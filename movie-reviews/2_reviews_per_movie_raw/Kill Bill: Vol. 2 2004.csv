","It's a matter of some debate which volume of Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" is better. Let's end the argument right now: David Carradine doesn't even appear in ""Volume 1."" Hasn't the Academy mailed him his Best Supporting Actor Oscar already?<br/><br/>In the first volume of ""Kill Bill,"" released only a few months before ""Vol. 2"" in the tail end of 2003, we met Uma Thurman, one peeded-off super-assassin taking out some folks from her past one at a time, with the occasional mega-posse thrown in for interest. ""Vol. 1"" had a lot of blood, violence, and wisecracks, and galloped across the screen like a rap video on steroids.<br/><br/>""Vol. 2"" is way different. It makes sense it's a separate movie; the tone is such a departure from ""Vol. 1"" in two ways. One is style. Director Tarantino has fun stylistically quoting Sergio Leone and chop-fu cheapos from the late 1960s and early 1970s. Cinematic sampling is something he's good at and enjoys, but in ""Vol. 2"" he doesn't go as overboard as he does in ""Vol. 1."" He pulls back and lets the plot breathe, rather than filling every spare second with a homage-cum-parody that maybe a dozen lucky fans will get. Maybe some here wish he'd pile it on a bit more, but they have to make do with the goofy Pei Mai sequence, which is a flashback and hence not jarring in its ""Vol. 1""-style comic-book treatment. Throughout ""Vol. 2"" the emphasis is on storytelling and character-building, which is where it should be given we are now being asked to deepen our commitment of interest to these people. ""Vol. 1"" is okay for what it is, but its flash and action are no match for the depth and nuance of ""Vol. 2.""<br/><br/>This gets to the second different tonal difference between the films, which is emotional. It all comes back to the characters. They don't quite become real people here, but they get close enough to get under your skin. Admittedly, the opening part of ""Vol. 2"" tests the viewer's patience a bit, there's some long bits that show the director hasn't really mastered self-discipline, like with Thurman's graveyard struggle, but the meandering usually has a purpose. Tarantino is building toward something here that has its payoff when Thurman's character finally has her face-to-face showdown with Carradine's Bill.<br/><br/>From that moment forward to the end, this is the best Tarantino has ever been.<br/><br/>Carradine and Thurman dominate the proceedings with two of the finest performances I've seen, certainly the best Tarantino has directed, playing off the mythology we've been taught in ""Vol. 1"" and developing resonances with the viewer both together and apart which will surprise those expecting a casual butt-kicking affair. We finally find out what Carradine means in the first line of ""Vol. 1"" where he tells a whimpering victim he is being masochistic, not sadistic, and its a powerful revelation, that this sinister baddie may have a heart buried under that cold exterior. Carradine is perfect in his phrasing, his pauses, the tired glint in his eye, or the way he says ""Kiddo."" You can't ask for a better veteran performance. For her part, Thurman presents a brilliantly conflicted character who can not stop either hating or loving Bill, and brings us not into a world of cartoon anguish, but real human pain.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" is slow-moving, and needs ""Vol. 1"" in a way few sequels do, since it assumes you know nearly all the characters coming in. That's a weakness. So are some undeniably pointless bits, including the entire sequence with Bill's father figure, Esteban Vihaio, and some business at a bar involving Michael Madsen, who plays a former assassin now gone to seed.<br/><br/>Madsen's good, though, and so's Daryl Hannah as another rather mouthy assassin, Gordon Liu as Pei Mei, and especially Perla Haney-Jardine as a girl named B.B. The nice thing with Tarantino is for every scene that strikes a bum note, there's four or five that hit the right mark, and some manage to do much more. My favorite scene involves a Mexican standoff in an L.A. hotel room between Thurman's character and an anonymous hitwoman, at once grippingly suspenseful, hilarious, and life-affirming. Still, it's the final moments of this film that will stay with you, as Bill and his former pupil work out their ""unfinished business"" and we are left to ponder the results of their decisions and actions.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" may not reach the heights of cinema to which it aspires, the level of ""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly"" quoted in its score, but it's a fine film that will make most viewers glad they stuck around for the second installment. I am."
"WalterFrith","Null","139","200","20 January 2005"," Glad to see the split.
","When I first heard that this film was going to be split into two movies instead of being presented as one as originally planned, I was angry. I accused the powers that be of trying to squeeze two box office triumphs out of a single project. But after having seen both 'Kill Bill' and 'Kill Bill Vol.2', I am glad because both films are extremely different even though the stories are tied together with primarily the same actors and having the same director. Containing less action than 'Kill Bill', volume 2 is intelligent, bizarre and extremely engrossing. It absorbs all of its elements equally and David Carradine's performance as Bill is the best thing to happen in movie villain history since, well, I'll leave that up to individual interpretation."
"abacus24","10","148","227","5 July 2006"," A Tarantino Masterpiece
","Over the last 40 years, I've seen a lot of movies. All types. Some great, some good and some mostly inedible; most left my breath with a sour smell. Westerns, sci-fi, comedies, dramas, etc. After seeing Kill Bill Vol I, I assumed that any sequel would pale to its predecessor. I, of course, was premature in my prediction. The movie was, by all means, a classic. I feel Taratino was really trying to make a great movie versus making money for his producers. To build his tasty sandwich, he took the lessons he learned from life as a movie maker and cleverly managed to meld some slices of meat from Sergio Leone (subtly), Akira Kurosawa (very subtly) and, I'm stretching it here, Ridley Scott, to create a great sequel to an excellent first movie. He used some great, almost forgotten actors (Daryl Hannah, Micheal Parks, and David Carradine to create a memorable meal. It was only a sandwich, but what morsel it was. I was full and wanting more. Very rare to find this type of film in our corporate world. He must wield some real power in the movie world. I don't know of anyone who has saw this movie who hasn't given it great feedback. And I know all types of viewers. My wife, who really doesn't like anything that is not overly melancholy or dripping with sentimentality, actually liked the whole movie. That in itself is an endorsement. Well done. Mr. Tarantino, you will be hard placed to match this gem."
"Coventry","9","175","281","22 April 2004"," Tarantino's Triumph: Volume Two
","Rarely 	known a movie I've been looking forward to so much than Q.T's resumption of the Kill Bill saga. I, as well as millions of others film-freaks, awaited Uma Thurman's further adventures with wicked anticipation. And of courseTarantino didn't disappoint. Volume two is a completely different movie than volume one, but it's equally brilliant and the director's trademarks are shown more than obviously. Volume one merely was homage to the Eastern Martial Arts movies, with delightfully over-the-top splatter and gore while Vol. 2 fully focuses on ancient westerns and rural horror. There's more dialogue, more twists n turns and the anti-chronological structure results in more depth and involvement. Some unexplained elements from Vol.1 become clear now and even the entire background of Thurman's character gets unveiled. For the very first time, (as far as I can remember) Tarantino really knows how to create an unbearable tension! There's a sequence in which Uma is buried alive and trapped under the groundThrough simple methods, like a completely black screen, Tarantino arises claustrophobia among the audience! Truly terrific filmmaking. <br/><br/>The actors in Kill Bill aren't Hollywood's best, but they each have their charisma and their typical Tarantino characters do the rest. The camera viewpoints are brilliant at times and  as usual  the tiny absurd elements are a joy to discover. Tarantino's entire Kill Bill achievement may easily be considered as one of the most creative and dared film-projects ever! Do yourself a favor and watch them! Over and over again."

","This movie is completely different from the first. Unlike the first with fast paced action and extreme entertainingly super-stylish gore, Kill Bill vol. 2 is everything that was missing in th first.<br/><br/>The Bride's revenge is burning strong and we can see it in her eyes. We discover the truth behind the wedding massacre and all questions from the 1st movie are answered. We discover why the Bride is the deadliest woman in the world. We discover why Elle is missing an eye. We discover who Bill really is. We discover the Brides name. And finally we discover the truth of the secret revealed at the end of Vol. 1.<br/><br/>Her first target is Budd. The loser bum ex-deadly assassin living in a trailer in the middle of nowhere. The short confrontation ends with one of the most terrifyingly claustrophobia-inducing (sp?) scenes ever...specially if you watch it in the dark. Then we are taken to the journey of how the Bride became the deadliest person in the world. We see the story between her and her hard-hitting very mean master Pai-Mei. <br/><br/>After a while there is the confrontation with Elle Driver...the Battle of the Blonde Gargantuants...as Uma Thurman referred to it in an interview. This one fight scene is almost as exciting as watching the Bride battling off tons of the Crazy 88s from Vol. 1. <br/><br/>Then the battle we were all waiting for. For Uma Thurman to Kill Bill...well I won't spoil it for you. Basically vol. 1 was 95% style 5% substance while vol. 2 is 95% substance 5% style. Very emotional and touching movie with a few key gore scenes...definitely a must see..."

","Kill Bill: Vol 2 is a whole new ball-game.  Whether you assess the film by virtue of its incisive dialog, its brilliant direction, acting par excellance or simply its `appeal,' there is but one factor - Tarantino. QT is to cinematic originality what Kubrick brought to deep space, and beyond the infinite!<br/><br/>A lifetime of forgettable movies excepting BOUND FOR GLORY and arguably Scorcese's BOXCAR BERTHA, is erased for Carradine overnight thanks to Tarantino.  As Bill, Carradine has handed in his greatest performance to date.that is to say, QT drew it out of him. The `Old Grasshopper' conveys charm, menace.all the wordly acoutrements his profession would have brought to him. Playing the reed flute that he carved himself from a bamboo plantaton he actually set-up while still making Kung-Fu episodes, Carradine's first appearance outside the small church in El Paso set the scene for the entire movie. He commands our attention from that moment on. His last line, `How do I look?' was delivered with such believable sincerity and  emotive sadness, it closed a chapter in Beatrix's and the viewer's recent experiences with remarkably good taste. The smallest part in this movie, from Samuel Jackson's cameo thru Bo Svenson's preacher to Michael Parks' gifted little turn as the crafty old Esteban is just flawless acting of the highest calibre.<br/><br/>QT 'regular'  Madsen also scores with arguably his best portrayal in years as the alkified retired gang-member Budd (aka Sidewinder). He really looked the sad dead-beat that he had become.<br/><br/>The flashback sequences are never overlong, out of place or anything but chronologically correct. Everything from Volume 1 is explained. Beatrix's Kung-Fu training sequences with Master Pai Mai might be considered by many, the high point of the film. Certainly Tarantino's love of old Samurai flicks is evidenced throughout, especially in the brief but beautiful silhouette-shots of Master and pupil training. Nice touch too towards the end (I don't wish to give anything away here) where `X' and `Y' are watching SHOGUN ASSASSIN.<br/><br/>The final twenty minutes of the movie fully justify the term `awesome.' At the point Beatrix finally confronts Bill, no-one in the audience would be expecting to see what they do. All I will say is that the `little girl' involved is the most appealing and touchingly innocent little thing I have ever seen in a film.  It was a master-stroke of casting, scripting and cinematography. A lot more I would like to say but cannot, without ruining the film for any future viewers.<br/><br/>In my opinion, no film ever made betters this!"
"daria84","10","93","153","1 September 2004"," A masterpiece by Tarantino.
","I've been waiting to see this movie for so long, and when I finally saw it, I loved it! it was worth the wait.  <br/><br/>Vol.2 picks up pretty much where Vol.1 left, except for some flashbacks explaining what really happened with the characters.  Uma Thurman is back as The Bride, and we get to know her real name finally.  Also Daryl Hannah comes back as Elle Driver, the one-eyed killer, Michael Madsen plays Budd, Bill's baby/loser brother, and the infamous Bill is played by David Carradine.  The performances are just great, Uma Thurman delivers a great performance as The Bride, we finally get to know her character a little better and the true reasons why she wants to ""Kill Bill"".  I also have to say that David Carradine was perfect to play Bill.  He has great charisma and he's so smooth, it's impossible not to like him.  Daryl Hannah's performance was great too, and Michael Madsen's too. <br/><br/>Once again the music plays a key factor in this movie, is very well selected and for every single scene the music fits perfectly.  And of course, the dialogue.  In this movie, we get a lot more dialogue than brutal fighting like in Vol.1, this movie is more centered in explaining what led Bill to do what he did, it pretty much focuses in the past, explaining the whole thing. I especially liked the dialogues between Bill (Carradine) and The Bride (Thurman), I thought they were clever and just great, like all Tarantino's dialogues.  Also the locations were excelent, I have no idea where they shot the film, but the landscaping was great, I truly enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Well it would be better to see Kill Bill Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 as one movie, not different, because in the end, you must see them together to understand.  So I give this movie a 10/10, I loved it, it was great, great dialogues, great performances, great fighting sequences, everything was great! And I think that Uma Thurman and/or David Carradine (at least him) should be nominated for an Oscar, they were perfect and they deserve that international film makers acknowledge that. Tarantino you are the best!!!"
"gmorgan-4","10","98","170","24 July 2004"," Honestly better than the first
","Kill Bill Volume 2 is the astonishing follow-up to perhaps 2003's best film, Kill Bill Volume 1. Quentin Tarantino once again demonstrates a mastery of dialogue in this homage to the great western and kung fu movies that inspired him from his video clerk days.<br/><br/>Simply, this film is as entertaining as hell. Tarantino unabashedly takes the viewer for a joyride, and the end result is a movie with intense action, tempered with some of the best dialogue I have ever heard.<br/><br/>Some have pointed to this film as inferior to the first volume of Kill Bill: I disagree. Whereas Tarantino is a great action director (the scene in the first film with the crazy 88s is one of my top five favorite battle scenes of all time), he even surpasses this talent in his ability to write witty, intriguing dialogue: and this film really delivers it. One scene in particular, with David Carradine as Bill, near the end, speaking with Uma Thurman's The Bride while he makes a sandwich, is unforgettable and insightfully interesting. There are few points where the film drags, and the movie ultimately creates the impression of a visceral experience. 10/10. Go see this film, it is by far the best film released so far this year."
"Turfseer","5","16","23","17 June 2009"," The Emperor's New Clothes
","Quentin Tarrantino tells us in the documentary which is part of the special features section of the Kill Bill Volume 2 DVD, that Volume 2 is much more an homage to spaghetti westerns than to the martial arts homage of Volume 1. Volume 2 brings us back to the beginning of Volume 1, The Massacre at Two Pines. It's a slow-moving scene where we finally get to meet Bill who ultimately rejects The Bride's deep-seated wish to leave her murderous past behind. Quite fortunately Tarrantino opts not to mimic Peckinpah westerns and show us close-ups of the massacre in slow motion. In fact none of the massacre is shown and by doing so he wisely avoids alienating his audience. Kill Bill Volume 2 ends up being more camp than horror show. Had Tarrantino decided to show the massacre of innocents it wouldn't have worked in his film precisely because the victims (aside from the 'real' people at the wedding rehearsal) are comic book villains who we are not supposed to identify with.<br/><br/>Michael Madsen as Bill's brother, Budd, does an excellent job portraying the former assassin turned bouncer. The portrait of the wise-cracking psychopath features some of Tarrantino's best dialogue. But the whole idea that The Bride (aka Beatrix Kiddo), who has just taken down 100 Samurai swordsman in a space of few minutes in Volume 1 would allow herself to be so easily subdued by a blast of ""rock salt"" from Budd's rifle is ludicrous. Obviously Tarrantino needed a way to have her overcome an even more impossible challenge than the 100 plus Samurai swordsman—in this case, she now ends up buried alive in a coffin and in Houdini-like fashion, is able to extricate herself from the situation. The absurdity of the scene reaches its apotheosis when Beatrix utilizes her zen-like martial arts training to punch a hole in the coffin with her bare hand and then miraculously levitate through mounds of earth to freedom above ground.<br/><br/>I very much liked how Tarrantino uses Gordon Liu to play different parts in Volume 1 and 2. Liu is the martial arts master Pai Mei in Volume 2 and Beatrix's training at the hands of this gruff instructor prove to be one of the more engaging and streamlined sequences in the film. Tarrantino also uses another actor, Michael Parks, to play two different roles. He's the sheriff in the beginning of Volume 1 and transforms himself into Bill's father figure, an old pimp, Esteban Vihaio, in Volume 2. Parks really shows his mettle as an actor since he is virtually unrecognizable from one part to the next.<br/><br/>Things get even better in the ""Elle and I"" sequence. Darryl Hannah is perfect as the demented one-eyed assassin who first kills Budd with a Black Mamba poisonous snake and then gets into a fight to the death with Beatrix. The fight scene was so over the top that it can be considered a classic in terms of campy female vs. female fight sequences. It's a scene that perhaps comes closest to being funny out of all the scenes in both Volumes 1 and 2.<br/><br/>Unlike Volume 1 which ends with a bang, Volume 2 ends with a whimper. In a very long-winded and tame confrontation, the late David Carradine (not looking very well at all) finally reveals why he 'overreacted' and went after Beatrix. It was a matter of simple jealousy—he couldn't stand the idea of Beatrix being with another man. So that's it—after one killing after another, the whole reason for Bill's actions rests on irrational jealousy. This is what we've waited for, for the entire movie. Tarrantino doesn't bother explaining who Bill is at all. We find next to nothing about him. He has no history and is merely a flimsy prop, the catalyst to get all the bloody events moving. Bill has no back story and Carradine has no character to mold here.<br/><br/>Tarrantino is probably better served directing movies based on adaptations. As a writer of his own material, Tarrantino is the master of not only style over substance but elevating nastiness to high kitsch. Visually he'll be remembered for some classic scenes but often many of these scenes are too drawn out and need to be edited. Most disappointing is the revelation of the ultimate motivation of the antagonist—in its utter simplicity Tarrantino is revealed to be the Emperor with no clothes, an 'auteur' who puts a premium on 'shock cinema' at the expense of intellect."
"PlutonicLove","Null","51","88","15 April 2004"," It transcends its genre and becomes Tarantino's most thoughtful and sophisticated work
","In my brief, initial review of 'Kill Bill Vol. 1.' I made the regrettable mistake of dismissing it as exceedingly pleasing yet unsubstantial stylistic masturbation, lacking the profundity and characterizations of Tarantino's previous works. Rarely have I been happier to be proven wrong.<br/><br/>What once seemed like somewhat incoherent cinematic recklessness has, after viewing the second part of Mr. Tarantino's saga, revealed itself to be wild, imaginative and brilliant filmmaking. As a whole, 'Kill Bill' is utterly unified (not despite but because of the radical shift in tone), possesses a strong, dramatic ark, and, above all, stands as quite possibly the most passionate, loving tribute to cinema I have ever seen. While part one pays homage to Brian De Palma, Dario Argento and the Shaw Brothers, part two cites, among many others, Jean-Luc Godard, Sergio Leone, and Robert Siodmark.<br/><br/>But that's far from all.<br/><br/>In his critical essay 'The Cinema of the Cool', Kevin Murphy suggests that Tarantino must move on and grow up to fully realize his potential as a filmmaker. In my opinion, with this piece, he has done so. Those merely seeking the blood-splattered, broken-bone action of Vol. 1 will be severely disappointed by Vol. 2, which is infinitely more thoughtful, pondering the nature of violence, both in cause and effect. While the action in the first installment was great, comic book fun, here it becomes severely unpleasant, cringe inducing, and never without consequence. If anything, it reminded me of the great Akira Kurosawa's work. Remarkable."
"JonSnowsMother","6","30","50","3 March 2008"," Disappointing
","The movie wasn't bad and i am not saying you should avoid it. But after a thrilling and great first movie i was expecting this to be just as good but even though Tarantino did a good job and some impressive acting by Uma Thurman. What the film lacks is the poor storyline. If you've seen the first film you will realise the lack of fights which was shocking enough.<br/><br/>Like i said earlier the film has a weak storyline and the only way to make it better is a good screenplay and even though it starts off quite good it turns poor near the end.<br/><br/>One thing the movie did do very well was the acting Uma Thurman and David Carradine give good strong performances. One problem with the movie is a big twist happens near the end and it is poorly done for such an important scene. This film isn't bad just that if you enjoyed the first film don't get so excited but i am sure most big Tarantino fans will enjoy it."
"Quinoa1984","10","47","84","22 August 2004"," On the whole, so to speak, or by itself, the second part of Kill Bill fits the Tarantinian psychology
","Although, as a film buff myself, having a whole Kill Bill epic in one sitting would've been satisfying, like the first part that was split Vol. 2 works extraordinarily well. In terms of storytelling it's direct and (of course) unconventional, in style Tarantino pays homage/borrows (or depending on your point of view steals) from most of the films that stew around in his arsenal. And with dialog, in maybe a couple of moments it doesn't seem up to par, but it's not often. And the acting is in the greatest tradition of B-movie, spaghetti western, shaw-brothers, kung-fu et. all. If you look at both Kill Bills it's fascinating as a movie buff to discover things you haven't seen before (i.e. the whole blood-coated style of the climax in vol. 1) and things you recognize right away (i.e. the unmistakable songs of Ennio Morricone, who is just as creditable as Leone for Tarantino's style).<br/><br/>What's there to say about the story, except that it picks up where it left off? Sort of- as usual, the non-linear story aspect kicks in, and two sections of the film derail from the continuing story of revenge on the DIVAs and Bill (the squad members this time being the perfectly paced in tone and presence Michael Madsen as Budd, and Daryl Hannah's most vindictive role as Elle Driver). At first, we get a stark, black and white view of what the ""Massacre at Two Pines"" was like, and right away we're introduced (finally) to Bill, played by David Carradine, one of the most calm, affecting film villain performances in recent memory. The other derailment is to tell the immensely entertaining story of The Bride's training by the heavy-duty Pai Mei (Gordon Liu, in one of his performances in the whole KB saga). This could be counted as the funnest part of the film, aside from a few key moments, as the camera sweeps from medium to close up happen every thirty seconds or so. <br/><br/>In the acting department, as I've said, Tarantino gets a big boost- this could be counted as being one of the key performances of not only Carradine's career, but Thruman's as well. They elevate the mood of Tarantino's (sometimes) tongue-in-cheek dialog, but they're also pro's that do their best when it comes time to the showdown, with monologues that come close to being QT's most memorable (although not his best- as cool as it all sounds, it doesn't hit the Pulp Fiction marker). When it does end, the whole operatic sense of the film seems to work, and to the audience it will either be a fitting end or a disappointment. It is, at least, the most ambitious action/comedy/drama/kung-fu/western/romance film (this is referring to Vol. and both volumes together) in many a moon; it's a lot like opening up the filmmaker's skull, and getting a scrambled up dosage of his memories and references, and it works much more often than not. Oh, and how about a bit of applause to Bob Richardson and Michael Parks! A+"

","I opted to see ""LadyKillers"" instead of this movie recently. But after a few people said it was so great, I decided to give it a chance.  Wrong move!!! There were a few nice action sequences but it was like watching paint dry waiting for them.  I'll go ahead and mention spoiler alert now since my comments may spoil it for those who enjoy this type of movie.  I nodded off a few times so they might have answered the only question I had which was how Bill got the daughter from the pregnant mother he tried to kill.  By the time they showed the daughter, I really didn't care.  At least 30 minutes of useless dialog should have been removed.   It even took an eternity for Bill to die.  And why was Uma crying after striking the fatal blow???  It was about as dumb as her going after everyone with that sword even though she was an expert marksman with a gun.  Although LadyKillers wasn't as funny as I had hoped, it was the better movie of the two.  My recommendation is that you skip both of these and read a good book if you want some real entertainment."
"dave_taylor999","3","58","113","2 July 2004"," A bunch of rubbish with the worst anti-climax ever!
","This really is a poor film in my opinion. I really can't understand all the hype. The fighting is poor, and doesn't know what it wants to be. Half-kung-fu, half-comedy, and competent in neither. If you want a decent kung-fu fight, watch a kung-fu film, not this commercialised rubbish.<br/><br/>And the story and characters are pathetic. The premise is simple, a long quest for vengeance blahblahblah. But this simple story is somehow spread out over about 4 hours of viewing time (and indeed, this review could easily apply to the first film). Quite how boring I found this, as well as the insertion of pointless scenes (e.g. Budd in the nightclub - why add it if I can't even empathize with the character?), is indescribable.<br/><br/>And Tarentino's directing, particularly certain camera styles, is also way below-par. If I had seen this film and none of his others, I wouldn't think he was a half-decent director. Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction fortunately make up for this, but I feel that those films contributed to the misplaced hype surrounding this film.<br/><br/>And finally, the ending, which can be summed up in one word: ""WHAT?!"". I was expecting something, anything, from the ending, maybe a huge fight or some half-decent dialogue. What did I get? Some pointless ranting and the worst 'move' ever. The Five-Finger-Majiggy. Not only is this outrageously unrealistic (take four steps, talk for ages, another step and, ooh, he's dead. What a shocker) but it really did let down the film and was a wasted opportunity. I can only assume the script-writer gave up and they had to hire monkies to finish it off.<br/><br/>In climax (unlike the film), a massive letdown. This film doesn't belong in a genre (some people for some unfathomable reason call it a thriller) and doesn't belong in a cinema as far as I'm concerned. I have enjoyed many films which have a lesser reputation far more than I enjoyed this."
"Rob_Taylor","1","123","255","30 April 2004"," Kill Bill? Should be Kill Tarantino, more like...
","Awful, boring, slow and tedious are just a few words that spring to mind when I recall having to sit through Kill Bill Vol 2. And those are the kindest words I can think of. A few more choice words would be crap, s***e, rubbish or just plain retarded.<br/><br/>Now, I admit, I wasn't expecting KB Vol 1 rehashed, but I did expect something not too dissimilar from Vol 2. KB2 is to KB1 as The Sound of Music is to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The first film's non-stop action has been replaced almost entirely by non-stop dialogue. And not particular good dialogue either. In fact, I'll coin a new term here - dire-logue. The film is littered with it. Any film requires a certain amount of exposition, and even mystic claptrap like that in the Matrix movies. But KB Vol 2 takes claptrap to a new level that makes the Matrix movies look positively Spartan in terms of jibber-jabber. But the worst thing about the chatter in KB2 is the total and utter meaninglessness of most of it. It just drones on and on. A character makes a point verbally then, instead of getting on with the movie, the character is forced to belabour the point over and over until you're practically screaming at them to shut the Hell up and get on with it!<br/><br/>Nor do the pointlessly long (and in fact, just pointless) extra scenes add to the film in any way. For example, we learn that Bud (Bill's brother) lives in a trailer and has a crappy job at a local bar as a bouncer. He's become a loser - a far cry from his assassin days. What I've just summarized in two sentences is dragged out on film over the course of perhaps twenty minutes or more, including an entirely tedious and unnecessary set of scenes involving Bud at work that add absolutely nothing whatsoever to the film and introduce characters that have no bearing on the movie at all. Another scene involves the Bride talking to one of Bill's old colleagues in order to find out where Bill is located. This scene drags on terribly and gives the viewer pointless information on this character which again has precisely no bearing on the movie at all. The only scene which is worthy of inclusion is the obligatory training scene. This is a direct homage to many old Kung Fu movies, right down to the beard stroking sensei. But even this goes on unnecessarily and has you shifting uncomfortably in your seat. And although this scene ties in with the finale and burial scenes, it only serves to remind you that, whilst the Bride was seemingly unable to master punching her fist through a piece of wood, she was apparently highly enough thought of by Pai Mei (the sensei) that he taught her the ""hand of death"" trick which he had previously never taught to anyone. Hmmm.<br/><br/>The action sequences are brief and entirely unsatisfying for a movie based around the concept of revenge. Bud isn't even slain by the Bride, but by Elle using a Black Mamba (we know it's a Black Mamba because, as Bud is writhing in his death throes on the floor, Elle gives us a tedious five minute exposition on the snake). Elle isn't killed by the Bride, but rather maimed and left after a fight that was very scrappy and not at all elegant. And finally Bill, who is killed by the Bride (after endless boring dialogue about superheroes) in one of the most anticlimactic and disappointing ""final encounter"" scenes I've ever witnessed.<br/><br/>The truth of this movie is that it's really not a movie at all. It's the extra half-hour that they had to cut from the first film, padded out to two hours or so to make a sequel. With not even particularly brutal editing, KB2 could be distilled down into 30 minutes of relevant, interesting scenes and tacked on to KB1 to make that movie complete. Otherwise this bloated monstrosity is doomed to obscurity in the way that so many sequels so often are - due to over hype and audience expectations being too high.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino is to be commended for his movie efforts on the most part. However, KB2 is little more than self-indulgent twaddle wrapped up as a film and served up for consumption on the strength of its predecessor. It's destined to become one of those ""I liked so-and-so, but the sequel was rubbish"" type of deals. This is even more certain in the light of certain comments I read by Tarantino where he made a big deal of telling everyone that he was sparing no effort in the editing room. If this film is an example of his editing skills, I'd say he needs to be evicted from post-production facilities and the door locked securely behind him to ensure he can't get back in."
"JAKastner","9","46","89","27 April 2004"," The Moose Hole - Review of Kill Bill (Volume II)
","`Revenge is a dish best served cold.'<br/><br/>When we last left off, Quentin Tarantino has re-emerged onto the Hollywood scene for the first time in six years with not just one but two films to be released into theaters to an overwhelmingly awaiting cult audience. But not everyone was especially happy with the decision of both Tarantino and his distributor, Miramax Pictures, to split the tale of The Bride in two. There were some in the vast assortment of captious movie-goers that took this as a sign of continued greed amongst the `Hollywood elite' in that the decision of splitting the film into two parts was done to get the loyal fans to shell-out double the normal ticket price for essentially one film. Granted, in the end, that turned out not to be the case, as the film would actually be five hours in length and thus be deemed too long to be taken all at once, but the issue still remained whether the rest of Hollywood would follow in the foot-steps of Kill Bill and spark a brand new trend, only this time with less honorable then Tarantino did. That is still to be seen and perhaps that argument is a bit overzealous . In this situation, one shouldn't question what could happen in the future but whether or not the primary influence, namely Kill Bill, did what it claimed it would accomplish, by delivering movie-goers ultimate satisfaction for dollar.<br/><br/>Kill Bill (Volume II) is the second, and possibly final, installment of the story that centers on a former member of a group of assassins who seeks revenge for the actions done on to her by her former colleagues. For those unfamiliar with the first installment, here is a slight recap of previous events:<br/><br/>A woman known only as The Bride has waken up from a four year comma after her former boss Bill left her for dead on the day of her wedding killing her fiancé, the wedding party and her unborn child. Unfortunately for the skilled assassin, he made one big mistake: he failed to kill her. Now that she has awakened from her living slumber, The Bride will travel the world picking off her attempted killers one by one including the mysterious Bill. First up on her list is O-Ren Ishi, aka Cottonmouth, and her group of Japanese underground assassins and then Vernita Green, aka Copperhead. Upon completing the task of killing her first two targets, The Bride continues on her rampage determined to kill everyone on her list, all the way to Bill.<br/><br/>The second installment picks up basically where the first one left off, leaving The Bride heading to her next target, Budd (aka Sidewinder), who happens to be the run-down and vastly inferior brother of Bill himself. But, for at least a few moments, Budd gets the upper-hand on the film's lead assassin by placing her in a coffin and burring her alive. In the time it takes her to escape, the audience is informed on the vast training The Bride took in order to become the superior apache she is today. Upon escaping the make-shift grave, The Bride duels with her contemporary rival, Elle Driver (aka California Mountain Snake), who not only killed Pai Mai but has her eyes set on The Bride herself. The final lag of her journey brings her to the home of Bill himself and along with him comes a little surprise: her daughter. The story for Kill Bill (Volume II) is quite arguably vastly superior to the one written up for the first installment in that this one deals not so much with action but dialogue and meanings discovered behind actions made by characters throughout this film as well as the previous installment. Once again Tarantino demonstrates his remarkable filmmaking skills by back-tracking the story at precise moments that by doing so will explain actions yet to come. Few writers can pull such an effect successful and Tarantino does so brilliantly.<br/><br/>As was said with the previous installment, a relative bunch of low-profile actors and actresses make up one of the better casts of the year for this film, but this time around we introduced to a slightly different lot from the last film. Michael Madsen gives a dead-on (no pun intended) performance as Budd, a run-down and subjacent version of his former self now that he is no longer in the hit-man business. Madsen gives a sense that the character really contemplates on what he has done and whether or not he feels remorse for those actions but at the same time showcases the scoundrel that still lives within him. Daryl Hannah is quite intriguing as Elle Driver, clearly the most ruthless and baneful character in the film series. The only problem with her role was the dreadfully over-the-top performance given when her character's eye was plucked out. Granted having one's eye plucked out isn't a pleasant manner but what Hannah presented on screen was unconvincing and quite annoying after some time. Uma Thurman's role in the second installment can't be complimented more then her role in the first . She gives an absolutely brilliant, witty, and exhilarating performance that works every moment she is on screen. And David Carradine, best known for his Kung Fu television series, gives a `sweet', vibrant, and utterly perfect performance as the title character, Bill. He shines in every scenes he is presented in and works exceedingly well with Uma Thurman . There isn't much to say other then `Bravo'!<br/><br/>Overall, Kill Bill plays out much like the concept of revenge itself - actions and instincts engulf us at first, but as time goes on and the journey rampages toward its ultimate conclusion, truth and meaning quickly take over. Where Tarantino starts off with a bang, he rightfully finishes off with a shock to our system - maturity and philosophical contemplation on the subject of revenge and what it means for those involved. Those who were truly engulfed by the blood and gut spilling actions of the first film will be greatly disappointed by the second installment unless you are one of those geeks who enjoy dialogue far more then comical violence, which may not be too many. But if there is even just a few then that will demonstrate the true essence of maturity amongst the movie-going public. Despite a pacing that made the feature feel a tad longer then was probably necessary, Kill Bill (Volume II) serves as a fitting conclusion to Quentin Tarantino's near perfect masterpiece . a masterpiece that may take quite some time to surpass but if the young filmmaker keeps putting out work like his previous films, his cult audience is more then willing to wait."

","So the second half of Tarantino's epic Kill Bill promised to be the pick me up the first required to stand up and be validated.  It failed miserably in that attempt.  Beware, there may be some spoilers.<br/><br/>Kill Bill 2 suffers from a shift in directorial tone so drastic that much of what Tarantino so effectively did in the first one was lost.  In the second installment the audience is shown the softer side of Thurman's character. Instead of the spectacle of Thurman out slaughtering hundreds of people in enacting her heroic vengeance, we see her succumb to the psychological trauma that would naturally follow from what she had just participated in. The empowered woman of the first installment (which is a problem in itself: giving a woman a sword and implying that she's empowered) had all together fallen apart and assumed the role of the helpless and weak.<br/><br/>Kill Bill 2 lacks the elaborately sarcastic violence that made the first volume close to palatable.  The second is filled with an overtly sadistic misogyny that is disturbing to watch, for example, Budd shooting Thurman in the chest with rock salt and burying her alive after threatening to fill her eye-sockets with mace.  All of this in an uncomfortably close quarters with Thurman so that we can watch her suffer.  Where the first movie had fun with its overblown violence; the second relishes in a much more terribly painful place.<br/><br/>Kill Bill 2, does however; include some instances of rich dialogue.  There is a scene where Carradine and Thurman discuss superheroes and why it is that they are popular.  The audience learns the appeal of superman, where he differs from other super heroes.  Instead of a human that changes to an alter ego, superman is an alter ego that changes into a human.  This conversation is reminiscent of Tarantino's older works, but is short-lived.<br/><br/>
One of the problems with the Kill Bill movies may actually be with more than just the movie.  Tarantino champions the middle-class white male perspective, and this perspective becomes visible if we consider the stereotypes adopted by each character.  For example in the first movie we see a juxtaposition of two kinds of stereotypes imposed on Japanese women by American men.  The first is the school girl, adopted by Oren Ishi's body guard, and the other is Oren herself, dressed in traditional Japanese garb for the final battle with Thurman.  In the first installment, Tarantino effectively wrapped these stereotypes and issues into a sardonic and nearly humorous violence.  In the second, Tarantino disregards that tone.  So what the audience is left with is a plot that very subtly declares a deeper malaise beyond the movie.  It exposes an unspoken evolution in American racism and sexism, and I believe it does so unintentionally.<br/><br/>

","I will admit, this film has a great first impression. For anyone who loves fireworks or laser lights, this is definitely the film for you. For anyone who likes books or classical music, maybe something a little more drab and tasteful is more for you. Unfortunately, I'm more of book person, myself.<br/><br/>While I love a decent and mindless action flick, that wasn't ALL I was expecting from Tarantino in these movies. I admired the lofty dialogue that Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction bared, but that suddenly disappeared. In fact, it was replaced with overpoweringly cheesy dialogue! What happened? I will admit, however, a very admirable conversation between Bill and B about Superman had me thinking, ""Wow, cool stuff."" As far as I can see, this film does a great job of capturing the majority of mindless audiences out there, which is probably why more people actually care about his previous films. Because, good lord, it's cool to like QT now! And while capturing such an audience and gaining that can of recognition CAN be considered an achievement, somewhat, a movie with all style and NO substance is a B movie, period.<br/><br/>No amount of guide-wire flipping or blood-spray can change the fact that this movie is a pretty cheap attempt to gain an audience. Oh, but of course, it's all about revenge. The one of many quotes in the tagline says so. Poor B must Kill Bill (*shivers*) because he killed her friends, took her baby, and then tried to kill her. So.... in turn...now she must..... Kill Bill..<br/><br/>Case and point, why do I really care? Yeah, it's that simple. The title itself could be the only dialogue in the entire movie and it wouldn't change a thing. Read the title, no need to read the back.<br/><br/>The Kill Bill series is a bottle rocket, nothing more. Do yourself a favor and save up for the fourth of July."

","All I have to say is WOW, what a big let down.  After loving the first Kill Bill, i went into this with high hopes.  Knowing it couldn't have been better that Vol. 1, i wasn't expecting the best.  But i had no idea it could be this bad.  The film, although not exactly horrible, is by far the worst Tarantino movie i have ever seen.  The dialogue, pacing, and acting all work together to solidify this movie has one of the biggest letdowns in film history (far behind the matrix revolutions, of course).   This movie seems like pure self-indulgence on Quentin Tarantino's part.  He draws out scenes to the point where you want to shot yourself. Now, i'm not saying it is horrible, i really enjoyed about 10 to 20 percent of it.  But the rest is horribly written crap.  None of the characters can get a whole sentence out before they pause 4 or 5 times to let the audience catch up to the previous three words they just said. Don't even get me started on the overrated David Carradine.  I don't know how anybody thought he was good in this film.  Maybe good for David Carradine, but not good for any other legitimate actor.  Uma did ok, but her line delivery wasn't anything to cheer about.  Michael Madsen was tolerable as was Darryl Hannah, until Quentin decided to have her spat out that crap about the black mamba. I think Quentin thinks that if he draws out a scene 5 minutes longer than it is supposed to be with a monologue about snakes or comic books he is supposed to be considered brilliant.  Surprisingly that is what everyone is saying, but i found it be the opposite. Alright, i am done ranting about this film.  Go see it if you haven't yet and please take note of what i am saying.  Oh and the cinematography and camera angles are good, as is the music. There is the 10 to 20%"

This is the first time we see Bill, who was wonderfully played by Bill Carradine. In volume 1 we only saw actually never saw his face.<br/><br/>This just as Pulp Fiction is a movie full of homages, from spaghetti westerns to giallo films. I see this movie more as an spaghetti western more than anything else.

"winner55","1","23","45","26 June 2006"," Master and student should not reverse roles
","Kill Bill I was a delightful surprise, living up to its hype as Tarantino's comic-tinged homage to Chinese and Japanese action-genre films. I could easily imagine all the old directors from Toei Studios having a blast watching Tarantino's final sword-fight scene, a loving imitation of all their samurai reincarnation or Shogun's Ninja films. Then Tarantino had to go and release this pap and spoil everything.<br/><br/>There are two principle problems with this film. First, Tarantino decided he didn't want to do genre any more. KBII is a ""serious"" film, about such weighty topics as guilt and redemption and love and death and all those other philosophical topics Woody Allen used to poke fun at before he decided to become a ""serious"" filmmaker, too.<br/><br/>Well, maybe Tarantino could have pulled that off - he didn't do so bad in Pulp Fiction - but he makes what for me is one of those mistakes a film fan can not forgive another film fan for making: he trivializes his predecessors.<br/><br/>Although this film has a large chunk at the beginning paying tribute to the old Shaw Bros. studio (which the first film promised but never got around to), the principle references in this reference-laden film are to the films of Sam Peckinpah and Sergio Leone. And unfortunately, in deciding to make a ""serious"" film, in order to deal with these references, Tarantino decides that Peckinpah and Leone made typical genre films (i.e., not ""serious"" films), and that therefore it was up to a better director (himself) to make a ""serious"" film from their raw materials.<br/><br/>Well, here's the news, Quentin. The Wild Bunch is the American version of Homer's Iliad, and all you've managed to come up with is a Hallmark greeting card that doesn't rhyme. Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West is the Cistine Chapel of a modern Michaelangelo, and all you've given us here is a color-by-numbers Norman Rockwell copy.<br/><br/>What in the name of heaven could Tarantino have been thinking of by trying to ""out-serious"" directors we know perfectly well he admires?What we get here are cartoon versions of moments from Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia and Once Upon a Time in the West. And that stolen Ennio Morricone music! sure it worked in KBI, because that was homage to Asian genre films and Asian genre films did that sort of thing all the time; but if you're going to get serious, it's time to get original; and, for heaven's sake, Morricone is still alive, I'm sure he'd have been glad to write a new score.<br/><br/>Finally, I should mention an obvious influence on this film that Tarantino would probably not want mentioned - the films of the Coen Brothers. Although they started earlier than Tarantino, they are still technically of the same generation as he. I'm not talking plagiarism - the Coens have done their share of ""homaging"" with and without credit to the originals. But Tarantino can't afford to try to ""out-serious' filmmakers still making films. Especially since the Coens know how to do an homage with respect.<br/><br/>What Tarantino ends up with here is a bunch of scenes that keep banging into each other like box-cars on a (slowly) derailing train. Better it wasn't made. Skip it."

Whilst I'm sure that these references must satisfy those members of the audience who recognise them, they wholly fail to make up for the misery suffered by those who don't. Neither Kill Bill film has anything else to redeem it. The dialogue is woeful throughout, retaining all the style but none of the substance of Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs. The performances are two-dimensional and completely un-involving, although much of the blame for that must fall on Tarantino for having penned such feeble characters. Because you don't care about anyone on screen, the violence appears aimless and gratuitous. But the worst thing about these films is that the ""Tarantino"" badge seems to be enough for some to excuse these terminal flaws, where any other director would be completely torn to pieces. Those of us who believe that film-making should be about involving an audience and telling a story can only hope that the aura of infallibility that surrounds the man is dissipated rapidly after these spineless and inept films.

","Tarantino falls back into his old groove with Kill Bill: Vol. 2 - a groove that sees the mediocre director trying to pass trash off as art. As with all of Tarantino's films (sans the legitimately well-crafted Pulp Fiction), Kill Bill: Vol. 2 works exceedingly hard at coming across as smarter than it really is... and as always, this ultimately fruitless technique leaves Tarantino's film looking even worse than it needed to.<br/><br/>Even operating under the notion that the film is making a conscious effort to make fun of itself and point out how bad it truly is, it still falls flat. By relying on the same two gags over and over again, Tarantino is offering up a veritable admission that he's in too far over his head, and that he really has no clue what he's doing.<br/><br/>To top it all off, Tarantino lies back on techniques usually reserved for enhancing a film, or, at the very least, enhancing a scene. But Tarantino throws these techniques in haphazardly, filming a scene in black and white not because it helps the scene in any way, but simply because he's taking a random crack at producing intelligence.<br/><br/>Looking at the two films (Volume 1 and Volume 2) as a whole, it becomes painfully obvious that Tarantino split these up solely in an effort to make more money, or else he has no sense of direction whatsoever, because the two films are split as unevenly as possible. Even as one film, all the action takes place at the beginning and all the elements that are supposed to represent plot and character development are crammed into the latter half. Even worse, this second film is comprised mostly of filler that has no real relevance to the story that Tarantino is already butchering.<br/><br/>All in all, the film is nothing you wouldn't expect from Tarantino, but that's not a good thing by any means. The characters are flat and uninteresting, the dialogue is Tarantino's worst to date, and the whole film feels more like a mockery of cinematic techniques than anything else.

","I've never seen a worse sequel in my life. This movie is so boring and shitty it made me wish I was watching The Talented Mr. Ripley. The tiresome attempts of Bill's assassins getting to Uma are about the same as the coyote after the road runner. You know it's just not going to happen. All you know is that Uma will kill Bill. And I expected it to be ten times better than when Uma took on Oren-Ishii. instead I felt let down by Quentin Tarantino for the first time ever. And yes I have seen Jackie Brown. I think it's a damn good movie. But you just have to a fan of Shaft and Superfly, Foxy Brown, and that type of s**t.

If mister Tarentino is a master film maker he used all that skill on Vol 1 and had nothing left for Vol II this ""in my opinion"" is the worst movie I have seen in the last ten years. Some other reviews here have said the distributors wanted to split Kill bill into two 1.5 hour movies, this sounds good but KB2 had at most 30 minutes of useful footage the rest was longwinded dialogue sessions that in most cases added little to plot or character development and should have been left on the cutting room floor.

","When I first heard about Kill Bill, it sounded like a filler project, a fun exercise in which Tarrantino cold pay homage, riff and rip-off his favourite genre pics. If this had been true, I might have enjoyed this film (for it really does not not deserve to be listed as 2 films) and would not have this sense of disappointment and sadness at an obviously talented filmmaker being allowed to indulge himself so completely in what is in reality, a very, very slim premise for a a 247 min film. I can understand why the Weinsteins wanted 2 films, because it is good business, but surely Producer Lawrence Bender,  should have stepped in and questioned the motivations of  his Director and suggested some much-needed pruning of his ""epic"".<br/><br/>Whilst I wasn't blown away by Volume 1, I enjoyed its trashy homage to the Grindhouse  pictures clearly dear to its Director's heart and I was intrigued to see how he would weave the Spaghetti western genre into Volume 2. Spaghetti Western!!! To even mention this film in the same breath a Leone et al. is the funniest thing I have heard in years. Believe me. this is no Western, this is no cool, revenge flick, this is simply an exercise in style that runs out of steam way before the inevitable denouement.<br/><br/>There are scenes in this film that go nowhere, dialogue that meanders and ultimately bores and action that whilst wonderfully choreographed (esp Vol... 1), has no real excitement or genuine sense of danger. The much-anticipated Pai Mei training was dull dull dull and I honestly wondered if I had experienced a micro sleep during this part, as I felt the whole sequence was under-developed and incomplete.<br/><br/>There are however, some wonderful moments in these films, but the poor editing and bloated direction means you have to wait and wait for so long for them to happen, that you begin to question whether you're really that interested in these shallow characters anyway. The characters in this films are supposedly the epitome of iconic cool, but they are like the sets of Old Hollywood westerns, well-dressed facades, with nothing behind, but the desert.<br/><br/>A disappointment on every level."

You set up Bill as being the most feared and deadly assassin and warrior in the world... You take two movies to reach him and then QT teases you by having the characters talk about a swordfight on the beach under the full moon, and instead the ending was lame and predictable.  There wasn't even a good fight (one fight and it's not even with Bill!).

in this one (SPOILERS) she doesn't even kill one of the people on her list and the fight scene with elle driver had little fighting and although the ending was creative it wasn't pleasing. and finally the death of bill was awful, we never even got to see this man fight he just dies by some BS technique. what a bore-fest 3/10"

","So sad that this awful, clumsy pastiche of clichÃ©s should generate so much sycophantsy in favour of that horrid little man Quentin Tarantino. This film has not even been out for five months and already it is at #117 on the list of IMDb top films of ALL TIME (!?!). If you want to watch a REAL Western as opposed to a facsimile of a Western, go and watch ""ONce Upon a Time in the West"" or even ""The Searchers"" again. Those films are difficult, trying, multiple meaning-generating masterworks. Those films still seems fresh, this one is tired and show-offy, without having a real sense of CiNeMa about it. ""Pulp Fiction"" (Tarantino's only good film in my opinion) is worthy, watch that again and tell me that this is not a vastly inferior work. Tarantino's cinema has always been plastic, self consciously fake, but at least Pulp-Fiction dares to have fun with its genre-bending tendencies. This film is merely a compendium of spot-the-film-references, with a couple of snide, jokey one liners to compensate. It is a fashion magazine-like tour through the landscape of the Western and other less respectable genres (as observed in terms of the 'centre', that dreary institution known as the AFI).<br/><br/>Granted, it is nice to see interest generated in older and less-known genres by younger generations, but all this does is to highlight how much better those films are and how intellectually bankrupt endeavours like this are. It is for this film to be informed by the history of cinema, but not for it to merely lift from that past willy-nilly without adding a iota of insight or critical meta-commentary of his own. QT, in my opinion, is a brat who deserves a spanking with a large wooden paddle. He may embody the Northern Californian ideal; a proud loudmouth, not coy about much, self consciously playing a role to his adoring fans, a natural entertainer, the grand high poo-bah of all film nerds (or ""cineastes"", whichever is preferable). That would be fine, if the films were any good. They're not (beyond ""Pulp Fiction"" which, as I have stated, is an unqualified masterpiece). There is a lot of myth-generating riding on the quality of that ONE film. Unfounded. And no, dear fans, I am not 'just jealous' (a childish retort which seems to be bandied about quite often at sites like this)."

","I enjoyed Volume 1 and had high expectations for Vol 2.<br/><br/>After watching Volume 2 I am unbelievably disappointed. Nothing new or interesting was revealed, the story was a total letdown.<br/><br/>If you think the second movie will bring something new to tale you are wrong, I wouldn't have believed it but you can already guess exactly what happens in Vol 2 by watching Vol 1. So apart from dragging it out a little more there is hardly any purpose for Vol 2, a simple sentence of what happened would easily conclude the story,it didn't need another 2hrs or more of rambling which had no real drama or action worthy of keeping our attention. It's certainly a movie I would never want to watch more than once!"
"sadamek-1","1","23","46","17 May 2004"," What a huge disappointment
","First, I should preface this by stating I am not a Tarantino fan. I think he is a great director who too often tries too hard to create culturally iconic images which are over-shadowed by batches of tired dialogue laden with uninteresting babble which in his own mind makes him some sort of genius. <br/><br/>I will also say, to the contrary, I am a huge fan of Reservoir Dogs, which was truly groundbreaking and entertaining. However, so few people had seen it before Pulp Fiction was released, that the latter film was credited with revolutionizing the ""time machine"" style of plot progression. For those who saw these films in chronological order, it is clear Tarantino simply recycled the same formula that made RD such a great film and slapped it on top of a fairly weak and rambling plot with famous actors that depended on ""cool factor"" to keep viewers interested in PF. I encourage anyone to go back and view PF now...it's one of the most outdated and overrated ten year old movies around.<br/><br/>On to KB Part II. Kill Bill 1 was awesome. Everything from the plot, to the bloody anime, to the fantastic sword fights were clearly the product of someone who has studied traditional Kung Fu films in depth. Even the yellow jump suit (a la Bruce Lee in Game of Death) was right on the money. I was excited to see what Tarantino had in store for Part 2 and was ultimately let down completely. <br/><br/>Where did all the action go? No lengthy choreographed fight scenes of note--the Hannah/Thurman scene in Madsen's trailer was more of a drunk cat-fight than a battle of two warriors--the dialogue in many parts was long, and languished into oblivion for 5-10 minutes at a time without moving the film forward, and the final 30 minutes left me looking at my watch every 5 minutes and praying the movie would end soon. Did we really need 20 minutes of pseudo-intellectual babble about the trials and tribulations of Bill and The Bride's relationship? Granted, I understand the point was to expose her softer, emotional, maternal side even in the face of her enemy, but for crying out loud, take it outside and settle it alright already!<br/><br/>Ironically, walking out of the theater, I couldn't help but thinking that Part II was a completely different movie the Part 1. Ironic because they are one in the same film. It seemed to me the few elements I disliked in Part 1 completely took hold of Part 2. Perhaps it was a yin/yang thing he was going for, but for my taste, the yang really stunk it up! Aside from about 4 scenes (buried alive, anything with Michael Madsen, the ""surprise plot twist"", and the funny, but all-too-short training-with-the-master segments, the other 75 minutes of this film were fairly awful. This is probably the most disappointing film I've seen since the turn of this young century."

","This movie is simply overrated.  For specialists in Kung-Fu movies it even touches the absolute ridicule.  I think Europeans will not appreciate this movie which is made in pure cinematographic language without references to literature or history.  The scene with the outbreak of Uma out of the grave is physically impossible because of the weight-pressure of the earth. You simply cannot get out.  Daryl Hanah (Elle)is superb and looks younger than Uma! The fighting scenes are an absolute childification of the great Eastern fighting-movies.

So when the movie ends the story is practically 100% finished and I believe that Tarantino tried to do just that, made a two part movie,now the why I don't have any idea, but as the third movie in a franchise is usually the worst and some times destroys the story of the previous two, see for instance Spiderman 3, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines Matrix Revolution and X-men the Last Stand, I think he made a good choice. <br/><br/>In the Volume 1 the love of Quentine for the Japanese culture and the samurai sword was obvious ,for Christ sake about 65% of the movie takes place in Japan! In this one we see his love for the martial ,but we also have some nit picks of western ,like a sunrise and some more (No spoilers!). I generally like the on equal measure this two flicks, for are really cool and tell a story ark of an kick ass female assassin ,which isn't the norm as we have see in leads role women in a handful of action films, like the Alien and Aliens, Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgement Day and Mad Max: Fury Road.

However, that is not saying much because the movie goes on so many tangents that are very distracting.   I don't understand why Kill Bill wasn't made into one movie.  I saw no reason that the two movies together could have been cut to two hours.  It spends too much time with extranous characters and situations that I simply lost patience.  None of Bill's associates are very interesting.  I don't care if you have an eye patch, Daryl Hannah, you are not a threatening assassin and don't get me started on your acting.  Quentin Tarantino seems to forget that action movies have to move fast with little dialouge or character development.  Instead we have too much talk and we learn too much about Bill's associates than we care about.  We want to see the Bride and Bill go at it one on one.  Unfortunately, it takes too long for us to get there.  We want to see the associates disposed of quickly and move on to Bill.  5/10 for its stylishness but fatally overlong."

Worse this film insists on copying god knows how many film styles, a flaw the first film over came. Most of the styles didn't need to have them paid homage.<br/><br/>I will not discuss the ending which goes on to the point of boredom, I dislike it and I'll leave it at that.<br/><br/>Perhaps this will play better as seen as one long 5 hour film, but I doubt it.<br/><br/>4 out of 10."

","Had Kill Bill been directed by a more talented action director such as Paul Verhoeven or Tobe Hooper, the project would have been restricted to one film that would have had a maximum running time of three hours. Not that either of these directors would have needed this much. There is nothing in the combined volumes of Kill Bill that a director who understands the need for efficiency couldn't tell in 130 or 150 minutes. Any other director would be constantly asked if this or that scene moves the plot forward.<br/><br/>Interestingly, volume two is approximately half an hour longer than its predecessor, but half as much happens during this time. Half of what we see in this volume is irrelevant drivel that could have been left on the cutting room floor. Budd's job and Beatrix's training are the least of the problems. In the end, the final moment with Bill seems like a two-hour buildup to a five-second payoff.<br/><br/>Between Tarantino's constant homages to himself, we get more of the Tao Of Tarantino in which one of the characters bore us to sleep with Tarantino's philosophical gems, this time about Superman's perception of humanity. One suggestion I have for Tarantino that could make these films more viewable for those of us who have grown beyond trends is to keep these gems separate, and publish them in a book instead. Then he ought to get an accurate picture of how wise or brilliant people really think he is. Apparently, Quentin doesn't mind paying homage to himself by referencing products that he has ""disowned"", either. Can we say ""hypocrisy"", children?<br/><br/>Given that the typical Tarantino formula is basically pornography that replaces sex with violence, Kill Bill part two basically resembles a porn film with no money shot. Tarantino's constant claims to be offering a commentary on violence would hold weight if he showed it in a realistic, believable manner (a la RoboCop or Total Recall) rather than the eliptic, implied manner that typifies Hollywood. For all the statements about how violent films don't make violent children and so forth, I'd love to see Tarantino put his money where his mouth is for once and show the actual consequences of violence.<br/><br/>Ah, to be a director who has an audience that will kiss the ground he walks on no matter how boring or indulgent his films are. George Lucas used to have that, so I guess the lesson to take from that fact is to learn to stop abusing this. Then again, given the low common denominator that the films aim for, I suspect that Mr. Tarantino does not hold his audiences in high regard.<br/><br/>I gave Kill Bill: Vol. 2 a one out of ten. Devo apparently named themselves in reference to a belief that humanity was ""devolving"". I think that this film could receive a standing ovation proves them right."

If I didn't know any better, I would bet that the 2nd kill bill was by a different director.  Not only wasn't the story told as well as the first one, but the story itself was also not as interesting.  Most of the dialogue was cheesy and the action scenes did not have that magnificent feel that they had in the first kill bill. There were so many things in the first movie that gave it an epic like feel that were foolishly left out of the 2nd movie.  One was the list kept by the bride on people that she had to kill.  You would think with the significance the list played in the first movie, that at least she would cross out bills name when she had done the job.  However the list was nowhere to be found. With the incredible battle scenes that were in the first movie, you would expect the final scene with bill to trump all them.  But again, it didnt even come close.  The final scene where she gets bill was as anticlimactic and boring as you can get.

There is no shouting in here, no yelling, just a few very sick killers with good vocabularies talking to one another. It sounds boring, but it wasn't to me. Even the trailer-trash lowlife played by Michael Madsen, had a good way with the words. <br/><br/>The violence in here is not that prevalent, and it's not the mindless, brain- numbing kind that made up most of the Vol. 1 in this two-part story. As I said, it was a shock...and yes, I liked this. It's good storytelling.<br/><br/>This film is stylish with a capital ""T"" and tells a lot of background of the characters featured in Vol. 1. Among the more memorable scenes, in addition to the great dialog, are Thurman being buried alive; the Chinese teacher; a snake attack and two women duking it out. I liked the ending to this film, too. Nicely done.<br/><br/>The cinematography also was good and I appreciated the black-and-white long opening scene....but I still go back to fascinating conversations in this film.

","The sentimental showdown<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol. 2 deserves to be another film than Kill Bill Vol. 1, not only the fact that the film would then run 4 hours + if it had been shown in one piece, but more because showing both films in one run might come across somewhat odd. The reason I'm saying this, is because Kill Bill Vol. 2 is very different in tone and feeling than was Vol. 1. The first part was more anger driven and brutal, whereas Kill Bill Vol. 2 is more about love and disappointment. Where the first part is bloody and ruthless, the second one is tender and sore. This does not mean that there is no brutality in this film, but rather that the tone of the film is totally different.<br/><br/>
I must admit that it took me some getting used to in the first 20 or so minutes of the film, because I'd expected the film to go on as brutally and furious as the first one finished. It didn't happen. What I got instead was a more story and character driven film, that was filled with emotion, explanations and some good and original fighting scenes.<br/><br/>
I have no negative comments on this film I guess. I think the acting was good to very good, with the extra kudos going to Daryl Hannah, who'd let some people to believe that she as just a tall blond who couldn't act in the last couple of years. With this film she manages to show us though, that she just has not been given the right offers. This I must say seems to be some kind of quality of Tarantino, to get Â‘discarded' actors and actresses and give them an opportunity to shine once again. Speaking of Tarantino, although I do realize that with Kill Bill he was an 'hommage' to many of his influences, I just have to say that he is a great director and screenwriter. I mean, the way he directs, the music he chooses to accompany the scenes and the dialog. It's just all top notch. This does not mean that this is the best film I've ever seen, but that it is a good film, which fulfilled it's promises. I mean let us ALL be honest. Who can pull off filming a revenge movie lasting more than 4 hours without it getting dull and boring? NOBODY but Tarantino.

Even the good tale of the fish and the kid, who has the killer's seed inside of her, was done so tastelessly. Actually these stuffs beg to be spoofed. In any case, I know that I enjoyed them as comic moments!<br/><br/>""Kill The Audience!""<br/><br/>(David Carradine) was so ludicrous while playing his flute, as if he's presenting himself: ""Hey, I'm David Carradine, you may remember me from the 1972 classic TV series ""Kung Fu!"". He seems a 100 year old, so how did he manage to be a father for this child?! Moreover, I think his age was the reason why there wasn't any fair fight at the end, which reminds me; this movie sufferers from one bad rhythmic disorder whereas there is a big battle at the end of its first half, then nothing like it later. As an action movie, it didn't deliver here, so forget about any thrill, and when you watch a long movie, in 2 volumes, about a hot revenge story on a guy named (Bill), to get at its end that (Bill), and to kill him as simple as that; then this is disappointing for the movie-goers that (Tarantino) supposedly knows best!<br/><br/>""What was that?!""<br/><br/>Maybe (Tarantino) used the most popular theme in all the world's B-movies: the revenge, to pay a homage, ANOTHER homage, to the cinemas that he loves, through the characters of the killers: the blaxploitation (Vivica A. Fox), the far Eastern action cinema (Lucy Liu), the western (Michael Madsen), and perhaps the European violent movies (Daryl Hannah). It would've been kind of attractive if he really made it this way. As with easy pretending writing, the story was mere yet stark flat, and all the characters, so their events, seemed hanging in the air (read: Tarantino's poor hallucination). He built the nonsense world in a nonsensical way as well, concentrating mainly on certain sequences or nostalgic details (for him!), more than the big picture, degrading the personality of his movie, and achieving a heavy emptiness!<br/><br/>As an album for B movies, this volume isn't creative but lazy and sleazy. And as a whole, it lacks originality in a way that made some say how (Tarantino) is a copycat! For me, it's one of the worst as alleged more than done. So, it ended up as not a good B movie or a good homage.<br/><br/>It mirrors BADLY how he's a conceited moviemaker, making a long boring idiot trivial movie (the rest of the attributes is in my review about Vol. 1), believing that it's the opposite. You can sense his vainglory as well as delusion through touches like: mentioning at the closing credits that the character of (The Bride) is written by Q & U; meaning (Quentin Tarantino) and (Uma Thurman)!!, his description of (The Bride)'s massacre as ""legendary""!, plus some irritating publicity like (The Fourth Movie By Quentin Tarantino!!) while no one ever used that with more honored, better, directors.<br/><br/>(Tarantino) already killed his own movie, creating something not good on artistic or entertaining levels, delivering us a complete waste of time, which works only as a nasty caprice for its maker.<br/><br/>""Someday, they'll see the light!""<br/><br/>Although it's not a groundbreaking, it's a breakdown, but you'll have countless dull ones who'll tell you: ""Yes, it's bad, but being bad was the point""!!!!!!!, so it's good in being bad????? If you love it as it is; fine, nobody can control their heart, but arguing in this way is the dumbest, most manipulative, ever which turns any bad into great! It is fool work, and with all the hype around it, it's super fool. Someday, someone will get out of their deep sleep, to say what a lousy bunkum that is!<br/><br/>""Name good thing about it?""<br/><br/>Well, there are 4. The action choreography, the solid sequence of the mentor; with the character itself so all the Hong Kong zoom-ins, the pretty smiling child who played Bill's daughter, and seeing (Lucy Liu) without scalp; I've never thought that I would thank (Tarantino) for anything!"

","Anyone that calls these Kill Bill movies `masterpiece' has an IQ less then their shoe size. Tarantino could make a film of himself taking a dump from inside the toilet and there would be rabid fans talking about how he's ""extending"" the genre. If I'm not mistaken, from ""inside the bowl,"" he smells just like everyone else. Give his sainthood a rest already. It's poorly paced and the dialogue is insipid. What to attribute this to then? Poor direction or poor use of editing software? Volume 2 trades its buckets of blood for pages of dry dialogue that explore the history of these characters but bring us nowhere new. It was far easier to swallow The Bride's bitter quest for revenge than this. Tarantino's self-adored mysticism and issues with self-indulgence this time around make it the boring mess that this post talks about. There are a few scenes that seem like they could've been cut out in the editing room without a problem, or at least shortened. If they would've released this movie as one long film, I bet half of the dull volume 2 would've hit the cutting room floor. It was either sheer greed or sheer stupidity that made them split it into this mess.<br/><br/>And so the adventure continues. . . it's just too bad it conned me into wasting my $8.50 on such an idiotic and surprisingly dull conclusion."

When it comes time to squeeze out some cinematic matter, it doesn't seem to come from his soul but from his catalog of very fine components. There is an art to arranging them nicely, but unlike his friend Rodriguez he doesn't make them his own.<br/><br/>What does a clever man do with this condition? He makes a movie about it. The story is about someone who has a killer talent and upon deciding to create something (a baby in the story) chooses to become a used `record' store clerk and pays the price normal in such tragedies. All viewers will surely know that QT was himself such a clerk at a `used' video store, where he carefully built his vocabulary of things to use here (his western influences) and in Vol 1 (his Asian ones).<br/><br/>The movie is nominally an action picture but the story is all built around some dialogue focused on the end: is it possible to both learn from a master and be a shopkeeper? Is it tenable to make a movie that does nothing but masterfully cite masters, always an apprentice? At what point can the self-loathing of inadequacy be turned to make the subtext original, personal and self-reflexive?

"michael_the_nermal","6","6","10","6 December 2009"," More Straightforward Than Part One
","Volume 2 does indeed tie up the loose ends of Volume 1, but it does so in a rather abrupt and ultimately unsatisfying way. Unlike Part 1, which was mostly guts, gore, and flash, Volume 2 is rather crisp, sticking to the plot in a straightforward manner without going off on tangents. The film sticks to the protagonist, Black Mamba's, quest for vengeance without going into side stories about the antagonists' pasts, nor engaging in 40-minute swordfights with hundreds of henchmen. This is no action movie; really, the murders of the remaining assassins are, compared to Black Mamba's epic sword duel with Cottonmouth in Volume 1, incredibly quick (including *SPOILER ALERT* Bill's, the main antagonist of Volume 2). Black Mamba does not even kill off Sidewinder, a trailer- trash strip joint bouncer who also happens to be Bill's brother! I was hoping Black Mamba would engage in epic sword fights with Mountain Snake (Daryll Hannah of ""Splash!"" fame) and Bill (the late David Carradine, Grasshopper of ""Kung-Fu""). Mountain Snake suffers the fate of the criminal who taunted Jesus at Calvary, also graphically depicted in a film that came out the same year as Volume 2, ""Passion of the Christ."" <br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!<br/><br/>Black Mamba's killing of Bill is so sudden compared to her long, drawn-out trek for the lesser assassin, Cottonmouth, that this film's climax seems hollow. No ""Hanzo sword duel"" as promised; just quick, sudden revenge. Tarantino deliberately wanted to bum out his audience, who craved the action, clanking swords, and epic battles between killers of equal caliber of the first film by denying Uma from fighting her main antagonist in any satisfying way. This film, compared to the top-heavy first part, was a little *too* focused on plot and not on action. As a result, the villains come off as easy enemies for the ""world's greatest assassin"" to vanquish. Tarantino wanted to save the best fight first (that with Lucy Liu's Mafia Queen character) and thus let us down by denying us any good fights with the villains, whom we, the audience, would assume are superior fighters to Lucy Liu's character (I was expecting Daryll Hannah's Mountain Snake to kick major butt, but Tarantino utterly ruined what could have been a cool fight scene). Uma ultimately reveals to Bill why she left his elite group of assassins; and, while heart-rending, it does not save this film from the huge disappointment of Tarantino preventing Black Mamba from clanking swords with Bill, the Grand Master of all the assassins, in an epic showdown. Mr T. is Hollywood's biggest letdown artist.<br/><br/>Only Uma Thurman shows plenty of acting skill, compared to the other actors, as the protagonist. Black Mamba is no longer a superhero, as she was in Volume 1, but she is still one of the few characters to show much emotion or to elicit any sympathy from the audience. Bill and his brother Sidewinder are soft-spoken killers, and their understated characterizations are nice to watch, but by no means more interesting than Black Mamba. There is a cool flashback scene where Black Mamba learns the trade of Kung-Fu from a strict sensei; this actor was awesome as the harsh, if spirit-building, martial arts instructor. Daryll Hannah's character is shown to be treacherous and slimy, yet understated like Bill. Still, Hannah's character does not have the backstory or enough meat to her personality to make her as interesting as she deserved to be (she is set up to be a far more interesting villain than Lucy Liu's Cottonmouth, but Tarantino lets us down).<br/><br/>While lean and straightforward to Volume 1, Volume 2 does seem to be style over substance, with an eclectic soundtrack and homages to Kung- Fu and spaghetti western movies that I have never seen. In all, a movie for those ""in the know"" about cinema, but, with an easy-to-follow plot line, which means that it is far more audience friendly than Volume 1.<br/><br/>In short, Tarantino is grossly overrated as a genius infant terrible of cinema. He should limit his films for a narrow art-house audience, rather than make any attempt to be mainstream---either that, or he should only make his movies for his select group of Hollywood buddies for Sunday-night viewings in his mansion."

","OK, I don't really want Quentin Tarantino to be killed - actually, I am a big fan of his earlier films. But the 'Kill Bill' films are not in their league, all style and no substance. Volume 1 at least had a fast pace, its innovations coming quick and fast; but Volume 2 of this over-long project seems to add nothing new except for a layer of emotional interpretation that its grotesque, cartoonish characters can scarcely sustain. Volume 1 pastiched a huge range of different styles of film; Volume 2, at times, appears simply as a pastiche of a bad movie (and very hard to distinguish from a genuinely bad film to boot). Yet I can't help but feel that within these two movies (originally conceived as one very long film) there's a highly original shorter film that should have been made. When the saga ends with a credits sequence in which Tarantino appears to pay homage to himself, one can't help but wonder whether even the most talented of individuals don't sometimes benefit when someone else has the final cut."

","VOL. 1 was a decent (yet overrated) movie filled with good action & mystery regarding the characters. As more is revealed in VOL. 2, the story was very lackluster. With less action & scenes of uninteresting dialogue, I was unsure why everyone claimed this was better than VOL.1. If you edited both movies together in a 2 1/2 movie, it would be much better than sitting through 2 dialogue volumes, but Quentin would have made less money that way. This would have worked much better if the action & dialogue were more evenly distributed instead of 1 being mostly action & 2 mostly dialogue. 1 was filled with more 70's elements & pop culture references & 2 lacked that feel IMO."

Kill Bill: Vol 2 is, on the other hand the most boring, self-indulgent piece of cinematic crap I have had the misfortune to sit through.  I can see why Quentin edited all this junk out of the first one and how he NEVER could have released them in the opposite order.  He spends endless amounts of screen time explaining/showing minutia which you at least hope will be useful later in the film, but ultimately turn out not to be.  His trademark style of mixing up the sequencing here is a total failure as he's constantly interrupting any chance of building tension or a story to go spend 15 minutes on some point that turns out to just detract from the film. Quentin desperately needs someone to stand over his shoulder and say ""NO"" when he's in the editing room and decides to keep a scene running a solid 10 minutes longer than it should. If you feel Ridley Scott was obscenely self-indulgent in that travesty of a film Hannibal you will feel worse about Vol 2 as it doesn't even have a saving grace shock you ending that at least made Hannibal a water cooler topic.

I decided to give it another viewing with the blu ray version, but I found myself fast-forwarding a lot of it instead.
I liked the homage to old kung fu films with the Pai Mei training sequence, but I didn't care for how the sequence was filmed. I also didn't like how Elle Driver was able to kill him so easily. Come on!
Another part of the movie that bothered me was the whole Bud sequence. First of all, it made the movie drag. Secondly, The Bride acts completely out of character. I mean, she's supposed to be the best assassin, already killed two (included dozens of highly trained fighters in Japan) and yet she insisted on running through Bud's trailer's front door?!! Why did she hide underneath it, she could have just broken in and waited for him inside. None of that made sense. Strangely, the Bride never says a single word to Bud in the film. She spits and moans, that's it.
Bill's dialogue was so dull. Stop making old soul song references! We get it Tarantino, in the geeky fan-boy voice you give every character, you like R&B and kung fu. Speaking of music, the musical cues in this film were also out of place. Many just didn't fit their scenes.
By the end of the film, you didn't care if The Bride found her daughter, or had her name Beatrix revealed, or if she even Killed Bill.

","At the time ""Kill Bill"" came out, movies were a totally minor thing in my life. I watched them relatively often, but I did not pay any attention to ""details"". I had no idea who the director was, and the question is whether I knew at all what the director was. Besides Uma Thurman, I think I never heard of other actors back then. I rated movies on a very simple scale - whether it's fun or not. This one was fun for a ten. Fifteen years and several thousand films later, I look at movies from a completely different angle and ""fun"" is no longer at the top of the criteria that distinguish good movies from bad ones. Now I analyze them in more detail and I still haven't found any flaws in this one.<br/><br/>It could be said that Quentin Tarantino's talent is a gift from God, but I think it's far more likely that he sold his soul to the Devil. The lowest rating I have ever given to one of his films is nine, and I'm not a ""fanboy"". ""Kill Bill"" is an action thriller, and for me action films are the lowest form of the seventh art. But Tarantino's ability to create an action movie which is also an art film is fascinating. The story is crazy and great, but the least important. Camera work, fight choreography, use of color and sound and feeling for details make this film a masterpiece of cinema. The cast is more than good, and Tarantino manages to get the most out of them. I doubt that any of these actors have ever given a better performance than in this movie. And, of course, music! Music is very diverse, totally unexpected, often even unsuitable for the scenes it follows, yet again in such a perfect (dis)harmony with the divine scenery and crazy choreography, that it all leaves the viewer breathless.

"Nephalim","Null","4","6","18 April 2004"," Very disappointing - nothing brilliant about it.
","Major spoilers. Don't read unless you've seen.<br/><br/>I think we need to take a step back and look at some of the reaction to this film. This movie wasn't that good a movie. It wasn't bad - I liked it, but it wasn't nearly as groundbreaking or brilliant or marvelous as everyone seems to think. Characterization is inconsistent with what we saw in Vol. 1, and if this ""expanded mythos"" that Tarantino is so proud of gave reasons for these inconsistencies, then we should know them from watching the movie, not having to buy the book, the special extended DVD edition, or the super-mega-amazing director's cut collector's edition.<br/><br/>It seems that people just assume that Tarantino strikes gold every time he does ANYTHING, so they rant and rave about how much of a genius he is no matter what he does. Rather than answer a good deal of questions we had in Vol. 1, Vol. 2 just gave us a bunch of new questions - the answers to which were less than satisfactory. And Taranino's talent for dropping subtle hints is completely lost upon this plot. Rather than gentle foreshadowing, he beats us over the head, repeatedly, which makes certain aspects of the story VERY predictable. They basically told us how Bill would die about halfway through the movie, and told us how Elle lost her eye before they told us. Then, when the movie confirms these battering-ram foreshadows, it treats it like we'e supposed to be surprised?<br/><br/>Every single aspect of this film was a disappointment. Let's go over a few.<br/><br/>As I'm sure you all recall, in Vol. 1, the name of the Bride was bleeped out, and this continues through the first portion of the film. However, when her real name is revealed, it means nothing. Which makes you wonder why he ever bleeped it out in the first place. And if the answer is ""just because,"" then why did he tell us her name at all? At least, in the fashion we were given. It was pointless. I could understand if we never found out her name until it was listed on the closing credits, but this was just stupid.<br/><br/>Now, character inconsistencies. In the first film, we are told that Elle hates the Bride. Fair enough. But, she is also willing to kill the Bride by poisoning her in her sleep, and flips out when she's ordered not to. But, in this film, she kills Budd, and her reason for doing so is, she says, because Budd managed to kill her. And this is, let's remember, after she told him to. Now, I wouldn't put killing Budd past Elle for a second, but I think if anything, it should've been for the money. She's proven, and continues to prove in Vol. 2, that she cares little for honour and the warrior code. So then why this sudden spark of sympathy?<br/><br/>And then there's Budd. All we know about him is that he's a hick. That's pretty much all we're given to work with. Every part of his character helps to reiterate this. That was done well enough, but for one thing - why did he keep the sword? Or at the very least, why would he lie to Bill and Elle about it? Now, I argued this with a friend, and she thought that it was because Budd loves Bill, but didn't want to show any sentimentality. While that does make a certain degree of sense, there's still the matter of what we're given. Until Vol. 2, we didn't even know that they WERE brothers, and their relationship is not at all elaborated on through the course of this film. I saw no actual evidence of why Budd would do something like this. Now, Tarantino professes that he made up elaborate backstories for all these characters to make their motivation more apparent to the actors, but here, it seems to have been a curse as opposed to a blessing. There can be a huge story behind these characters, but if it stays behind them, we never see it. Their actions were sloppy and pointless. And I really can't see Budd as anything but a hick, which makes we wonder if he was ever actually an assassin at all. I mean, it's only been four years, and he's just completely degenerated?<br/><br/>Onto Bill. Wow. I never realized just how crappy an actor David Carradine actually was. Everything is hokey and overdramatic. Now, I thought that this was supposed to be an homage to the chop-sockey, kung-fu media of old. Because he'd be great there. But he's stagnant and embarassing in any semblance of a dramatic environment. And the Bride, at this point, just killed O-Ren, who, we're told, he invested a lot in, Budd (he thinks she did, anyway), his brother, the only man he ever loved, and Elle, his (unless I misunderstood) current lover. But he never even brings that up. It doesn't seem to phase him, and yet, we're supposed to believe that he'd react to the Bride's leaving him the way he did. Even NOW, the only reason he seems at all upset with her is that she left him.<br/><br/>Pai Mei was my favourite part of the movie. The aged mentor character was true to form, complete with the all-consuming superiority complex and twisted humour at his pupil's failures. But he just seemed forced into the plot for no real reason. We got very little insight into his relationship with the Bride. When Elle announces that she murdered him, I wasn't sure if the Bride cared or not. Additionally, we're told, and are given no reason to believe otherwise, that Pai Mei is over a thousand years old. Given the stuff we've been given, that strikes me as a stretching our suspension of belief rather thin, and it just came out of nowhere. And THEN, there's also the matter that he's a kung-fu master, he's 1000 years old, and yet, Elle managed to kill him.<br/><br/>And finally, the Bride herself. Now, if I'm an experienced assassin, do I<br/><br/>just answer the door when I'm on assignment? If she hadn't dropped her pregnancy test, she would've been killed. So, it was luck. How the hell did she survive all this time if she makes such stupid mistakes? Let's remember that she's a former member of the Deadly Vipers, which means that she kills people for money. But we're never showed that. We're only showed the sins of the other five, as if Tarantino's afraid that we might lose faith in the Bride if she was portrayed as a ruthless assassin like O-Ren or Elle. But it would be more interesting if this baby actually CHANGED something. Instead, we're never shown the Black Mamba. We're only shown the Bride. Or, the happy-go-lucky student of Bill.<br/><br/>And the fights all sucked. The Budd fight didn't happen. The Elle fight was pretty intense, but too short, and what a crappy ending (and also, they're jumping up and around a trailer with a friggin black mamba somewhere in it, and it never comes up, and they don't seem to notice, and through it all, the Bride had bare feet). The Bill fight was probably twenty seconds long, and I'd seen half of it in trailers already. They never even stood up for it. For whole course of this friggin' movie, NO ONE GOT CUT WITH A SWORD. Probably one of the better fights was the one with Karen.<br/><br/>
And then, there's a lot of carryovers from the first film that, now that you've seen the second, make no sense. Like, Sofie Fatale. The way they show the Two Pines Massacre, there was no possible way for Sofie to be in the chapel at the time, and there doesn't seem to be much reason, either.<br/><br/>
And then there's Vernita Green. Now, give me a moment: The Bride wakes up in Texas. She hitches a ride to Okinawa, gets a sword made, then goes to Tokyo, uses the sword on O-Ren, travels to Pasadena, does NOT use the sword, and then goes back to Texas.<br/><br/>It almost seems like the movie was written to have Vernita killed FIRST. Especially since she loses the Pussy Wagon - which no one has seen and lived to tell about, yet Estoban somehow knows about it - apparently after that fight, and she GOT the Pussy Wagon when she killed Buck in Texas. Then, after killing Vernita, she went to Japan. This also makes more sense as she didn't have (or at least didn't use) the sword in the Vernita encounter. The movie just seems full of sloppy writing.<br/><br/>Now, this is just a personal nitpick, but I'll mention it anyway. This movie is a self-proclaimed homage to chop-sockey kung-fu crap, right? Well, then why not actually pay homage to it? This is a very staple archetype - you start off with the easy minions, and then work your way up to the most trying battle of the film. Yet, the Bride started off her revenge quest at the House of Blue Leave, where she single-handedly fought off hordes of supposedly skilled assassins, Johnny Mo, Go-go, and finally, she fought O-Ren while she was utterly exhausted. The Vernita fight wasn't nearly as taxing, though it was pretty intense. At least she got cut. Then, Elle took care of Budd for her, and Elle, like I said, never actually draws blood from the Bride. And then, the Bill fight was super-short and seemingly effortless on the part of the Bride. It seemed too easy for her.<br/><br/>Now, I liked it in spite of all this. I would recommend anyone to see it, but I don't think that anyone's redefining genres or whatever the crap all the critics are calling it. And Tarantino's making a mint off of this. He's announced plans to spin it off into a novel, he wants to rerelease it in theatres as a single movie, and he wants to make multiple special DVD editions, as well as multiple individual supplement discs. And, he also wants to make a Vol. 3 in fifteen years about Vernita's daughter Nikki coming after the Bride.<br/><br/>Tarantino already thinks he's god, so I fear that he's going to go the way of Lucas very very soon. I think another innovative filmmaker is about to bite the dust."

","Quentin Tarantino has become for movies what Radiohead are for rock music. He had two big movies loved by everyone in the 90s and since then continuously put out eccentric pieces of work that somehow managed to be arty and successful at the same time. When you walk into a Tarantino movie you know that you're about to see something special. ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" is another highly original movie, and yet it was terribly hard to sit through at times. The difference between ""Vol. 2"" and Tarantino's previous works (including ""Vol. 1"") is that you could enjoy the earlier movies without having the director's massive background knowledge, without understanding the numerous references to old b-movies. ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" puts style over matter. The dialog is stretched to extremes, the characters and the ending seem ridiculous, if you don't understand Tarantino's intentions (and I don't allege that I did fully understand his intentions). The overall feeling here is constrained as if Tarantino tried to match people's expectations and at the same time surprise his audience anew. The result is so wacky that I wouldn't be surprised if Tarantino had finally shooed the masses away with this movie. But then again, that's the same thing I say every time I hear a new Radiohead album. And they have had no flop, yet."

","Kill Bill, Vol. 2 is the ugly, sadistic, misshapen, and vulgar offspring of a cinematic barbarian, Quentin Tarantino.  <br/><br/>Worse, it's boring.<br/><br/>This is truly one of the most wretched films I've ever sat through, on every level.  The movie has no style; rather like a particularly bad episode of Saturday Night Live, each scene seems beamed in from a different planet in the solar system.  Trying to get into the groove with this movie is like trying to eat poached eggs while riding in the back of a Dune buggy.  It just ain't gonna happen.<br/><br/>The most notable aspect of the film is the obvious sadistic pleasure Tarantino takes in dreaming up cruel and violent deaths for his characters, then filming the demise in agonizingly clinical close-ups.  The fact that the director obviously believes all this carnage is righteous revenge only adds to the squalor.  If Tarantino was an 8th grader, he'd be sent in for counseling.  Since he's a film director, he'll be congratulated for his ""edginess"" by those who think that the only way to measure art is by the jolt it gives you on the Richter scale.<br/><br/>While this movie has been repeatedly described as a ""Kung Fu movie"", in fact it is nothing of the sort.  Tarantino doesn't begin to have the discipline to make a genre picture.  Kill Bill, Vol. 2 is a self-indulgent flatulence that borrows devices from Kung Fu, Spaghetti Westerns, horror movies, and comic books in the haphazard manner a hyperactive, pimply-faced junior-high delinquent rummages through his stunted intellectual landscape before writing ""F*ck Mrs. Jones"" on the urinal wall between classes.<br/><br/>Kill Bill, Vol 2 might be described as trash, but that wouldn't be fair to trashy movies.  It utterly lacks the essential joie de vivre that makes a good drive-in romp fun to chew popcorn to.  Indeed, Kill Bill takes itself seriously  -- deadly seriously -- and is as dull, self-righteous and dim-witted as a Driver's Ed movie.  Time at first seems to stand still in this movie, as one interminable monologue after another explicates the minute science of mamba snakes or the trivialities of running a strip joint. By the time the film is over it has gotten so slow that time literally runs backwards: Tarantino makes you sit through the credits of the first Kill Bill at the end of this one... his ultimate and final act of self-indulgence.<br/><br/>Tarantino is a hack, and this movie is his hacksaw.  Steer far clear."
"tccandler","10","18","42","17 April 2004"," Masterpiece Moviemaking from 'The Man'...
","Watching both volumes of this wonderfully energetic epic, one is reminded how much Quentin Tarantino adores movies.  His enthusiasm in paying homage to the westerns, kung-fu flicks and gangster thrillers that have shaped his life is infectious and tremendously welcome considering the vast sea of banality churned out each year by studios who are more infatuated with the bottom line than with the artistic merit.<br/><br/>'Kill Bill: Volume 2' is a more talkative conclusion than one would expect after having seen 'Volume 1'.  Oh sure, it has tons of action sequences and tension filled scenes, but there are signature Tarantino conversations littered throughout.  This film gives more weight to the first, explaining and giving dimension to the characters and their actions.<br/><br/>The film picks up where the other left off, as The Bride (Thurman) is half way through her list of people to kill.  Budd (Madsen), Elle Driver (Hannah) and of course Bill (Carradine) are still to be found and disposed of in a gruesome manor.<br/><br/>What makes Tarantino so wonderful is his layering of plot threads.  He is able to intersperse sequences so that we are given vital information which we are not immediately aware that we will need later in the storyline.  He has such complete control of his timing and rhythm as a filmmaker, and keeps us unaware of that directorial manipulation by using humor and wit and intelligence amidst a blur of action and violence.  This talent makes watching a Tarantino film an event.  I am already looking forward to his next film.<br/><br/>The drudgery of having to slog through another special effects bonanza (yawn), or a teeny-bopper romance (puke), or an animated kiddie-flick (ugh), or a gross-out comedy (frown)... All of that nonsense is made tolerable by those dozen or so films each year that show some originality, flare, passion and brilliance.  It is almost guaranteed that a Tarantino film will possess those qualities and be one to remember.  That's why they already have courses at major universities devoted entirely to his small repertoire of films.<br/><br/>I only have two quibbles with the entirety of 'Kill Bill'.   The film should have been released as one long movie.  I don't mind the splice too much, except for the fact that Miramax charged me twice when they said it was not a decision based on financial gain.  But I feel the film will be a delight to watch as a whole when it is released as a special edition DVD sometime this Christmas.<br/><br/>I must also admit to being a tad underwhelmed by the final few minutes of the saga.  I like the fact that it ended in a manor that was completely unexpected... but... it almost ended with a whimper.  I am making a mountain out of a mole-hill here, but I think there is a better ending to be found deep the recesses of QT's mind.<br/><br/>I also want to send out my mocking laughs to those who left the moment the credits started to roll.  True film lovers never leave a film that they like the moment the writing hits the screen... I only do that to films I hate. It is disrespectful to the filmmaker and to the other members of the audience who don't want to peer around you and your tub-o-popcorn to see what they paid for.  Anyway, those who left missed two more sequences of film.  And I hope Tarantino doesn't include them on the DVD so that you'll never get a chance to see them.<br/><br/>As for the 'Kill Bill' legacy... I think it's a marvelous display of a genius filmmaker having delirious fun with all of his influences and showing off every ounce of talent that he can pour onto the screen.  Is it as earth-shattering as 'Pulp Fiction'?  No.  Is it as well written as 'Pulp' or 'Reservoir Dogs'?  No.  'Kill Bill' is not an example of masterpiece filmmaking.  It is too silly and over-the-top for that description.  But is an example of masterpiece moviemaking that very few people will ever be able to duplicate.  There is a big difference between filmmaking and moviemaking, and Tarantino is a master of both.  His gaggle of imitators should find their own paths otherwise they will languish in paled comparison to 'THE MAN'.<br/><br/>The full feature will be a joy to watch over the years.  It will hold up very well over time.  The first volume made my Top Ten List for 2003 and I have very little doubt that the second will make my 2004 list.  I hope it isn't 2010 before Tarantino makes one of my lists again."

","Continuing the other film, vol. 2 tell us the story of the revenge of the Bride. After killing Vermita Green and O'Ren Ishii, Black Mamba continues its duty by searching Budd and Elle, in order to later kill Bill. Much less violent that the first part, vol. 2 is much more poetic, as it tells us many things about the motivations of the characters. The curious resignation of Budd(impressive Michael Madsen, absolutely fantastic), the evilness of Elle (unexpected Daryl Hannah) and the total charisma of Bill (mythic Carradine) marks the development of the drama, as the Bride meets everyone. With a delicious treatment of the dialogues and the music this is possibly, the best film from Tarantino and his violent universe. This time though, the violence is most psychological rather that physic, its more an impressive fight of wills which builds one of the best films of the decade of 2000. Despite that, remember that it is a Tarantino film. there is not much violence on the movie, but it is totally present in every moment of the film, which cannot result comfortable to everybody."

","I thought that Kill bill vol 1 was crap but this is even worse. It is just shocking to see how Tarantino has regressed in his film making. You would have thought that after taking a while out that he may have grown up a little and come back with a film that would reflect this maturity. Instead he makes the Kill bill movies. They are completely juvenile films that surely would fail to impress anyone other than immature, spotty faced, teenage nerds. The fact that the martial arts in this film are crap only adds to the misery. They seem unable to distinguish between Japanese and Chinese martial arts and film making. As a result the film displays neither. That may not mean a lot to most people but for someone who has been studying martial arts for over a decade it means a lot. I promised myself that i would not watch vol 2 after being so thoroughly disappointed with vol 1 but i was curious to see if it was any better. It wasn't and once again i spent a few pounds that would have been better spent elsewhere. So if you haven't seen this movie already do yourself a favour and give it a miss. It is CRAP!!!"

To what end?<br/><br/>In this film I was on the edge of my seat... hoping someone on the big screen would say even one line remotely interesting. Nope. Not even the acting was interesting.

Clever use of other people's ideas is by no means art. But it is so cool, isn't it?<br/><br/>Candy will not sustain one's hunger. It only gives you a quick fix. QT does have talent but someone has to shake him and tell him that at some point he needs to take the craft of film making more seriously. It is as if he is too scared to actually try and say something - to try something original.<br/><br/>How long did it take Spielberg to finally let go of all the tried and true conventions of his craft and try something serious (Schindler's List), not letting 'box office opening weekend grosses' mentality be the bottom line?<br/><br/>My respect for both QT and UT have dropped but what do they care?

"bob the moo","Null","11","25","2 May 2004"," An OK film but overlong and lacking it's own voice (spoilers)
","After the murder of O-Ren Ishii and her squad of bodyguards, the Bride continues her quest to kill Bill in revenge for shooting her and leaving her and her unborn child for dead.  Bill warns his deadbeat brother, Budd, of her return and he prepares the best he can.  When her attack on Budd goes wrong, she finds herself buried alive in a graveyard - left to rot and suffer until her last breath.  As she lies trapped she remembers her training from Master Pai Mei and tries to focus on her ultimate goal.<br/><br/>Just to set it in context, let me say that I thought Volume I was an OK film but pretty much just soulless style with no substance.  Volume II is a different film but it was still only OK, having the same sort of problem and some of it's own.  I say this from the start because far too many reviewers here seem to see Tarantino films as a sort of sacred grail that can only be loved or hated.  This is, of course, nonsense and such glowing fan-boy praise has put me off reading many people's reviews.  This film is very different from the first volume and many will be let down by the lack of bloody action - but, I'm sorry, if that's all you want from a film then you should go and just rent any of your bottom shelf actioners from your video store.  Here we have far more dialogue and longer, slower scenes that require patience.  However this is not to say that the film has more of the substance that I missed from the first film - and reviewers who say that this film provides the heart and substance to volume I's guts are just wrong - substance is not snappy dialogue.<br/><br/>Substance is character and story.  Here we are given a bit more plot in the form of back story but the film is still very much based on a revenge story that other directors with much smaller budgets would have had the good taste to deliver in under half the four hour running time of this film.  However it still fails to really give us characters that we can care about enough to get emotionally into the film.  Some of them are interesting - Budd in particular has a certain world weary acceptance of things on one hand, but then contradicts this characteristic about two scenes later.  The ending of the film is particularly weak because of this total lack of emotional involvement - the sudden requirement that we care about the Bride's situation is too much and just comes across as cutesy nonsense, likewise the actual manner of Bill's death will disappoint both those seeking emotion and action.  Action fans will wonder why Tarantino ignores the rules of the genre he is aping and makes the death low-key; but it would have been a great ending if we had had better characters - if Bill had been someone we had gotten to know it would have worked much better. The ending is, fitting with the spaghetti western homage, very much like Fonda's in Once Upon A Time In The West, but his was impacting for the same reasons that Bill's in not.<br/><br/>Speaking of homage's, there are so many here that it becomes a film that will probably be enjoyed by those with a good working knowledge of cinema. The film opens with The Postman Always Rings Twice and continues with references and nods to John Ford, Sergio Leone, Carrie and others.  While these styles are all copied well I did start to wonder if Tarantino had his own voice - there was barely a scene that was `his', even his comic book dialogue has become a sort of cliché onto itself.  As a fan of spaghetti westerns, I enjoyed much of the film as I don't find it slow or dull when it is done in this context, to me the long looks and slow talk is part of that genre and I generally like it.  I enjoyed this element as I have never seen a spaghetti western on the big screen and enjoyed seeing this; also I enjoyed the copies of John Ford's work - at least Tarantino has used his break from directing to watch some movies that come from before his own lifetime.  The whole Pai Mei segment is amusing but hardly original - hell, even the Police Academy movies have copied this exaggerated style, so it being done by Tarantino is not that impressive.  It is true that all his movies have had references to other movies and his direction has aped different genres but he has never done it to the point that he has here - here he loses his own voice and if I had only seen this film I would think that Tarantino is only able to copy what he has seen rather than use it in his own way.<br/><br/>The lack of characters is helped by the improvement of dialogue - here we actually have people speaking rather than just people killing each other in a soulless manner.  The dialogue is well written and makes the people more than just sword fodder, even if they aren't ever real people we care about. As writer Tarantino is able, even if this is far from his best work and it did feel at times like he was just doing what people expected of him. However he should really have cut back on his film's running time.  As a stand alone, this film is too long for it's flimsy foundation to support - it's not horribly overlong but it could have lost 20 minutes and benefited from it.  Certainly, as `one' film, four hours plus is an absurdly long running time for this material.<br/><br/>The acting is a bit better here than in the first film but Thurman is as bland and wooden as she was in the first film.  Her sudden mother's instincts at the end are all the more laughable for her complete lack of human emotion up till this point.  It is Carradine who makes this film though, and his performance is not so important as his presence, which is impressive.  He doesn't always convince saying the lines put in his mouth (the superman monologue in particular) but he is a good presence in the film.  Madsen is good despite giving the same performance that he does in every film he does.  Hannah is cool and is a good baddie, standing out from the majority of them - her vampy performance suits the film's style.  Liu is great fun and seems to enjoy spoofing the genre he is best known for (well, homaging rather than spoofing maybe).  Generally the performances are as good as the material deserves, they are not good enough to make the characters real or involving, but that is as much the material's fault as theirs.<br/><br/>Overall this is an OK film.  It is not a great film and it is not a rubbish film.  Tarantino films are just films, they are not the word of god and they will have good points and bad points, the hope is that the good will outweigh the bad and, generally this manages to hit that balance.  The mix of genres makes it interesting but Tarantino shows that the maturity he showed in Jackie Brown was only a blip or a fluke.  Instead he shows his immaturity by aping the work of others so much that he loses his own voice - on top of this his indiscipline makes both films (separately and together) overlong and he really needs to find an editing partner who can help him in the same way as Martin Scorsese generally has."
"wiseguymattt","9","5","9","21 September 2013"," Perfect sequel
","I wrote in my review of Kill Bill Vol. 1 that perhaps in the second film there would be an explanation as to how the Black Mamba became so skilled and what really was the root of her deep hatred and anger towards Bill. Well, in the first we can easily deduce that because Bill and his crew shot up the wedding and left Beatrix in a coma that she was more than entitled to her revenge. <br/><br/>I found it profound how much we learned about Budd and how unworthy he is to be part of the DVAS. Honestly, I wonder how the hell he earned his place. What was his specialty other than being a greedy smart alec? I digress. Kill Bill Vol. 2 wraps everything up near-perfectly. The Bride already has a couple names checked off on her list as we come into the second film. Budd, Elle, and Bill are all that remain and let's just say Copperhead and Cottonmouth were like the warm-up laps before the race, the real competition. Each of the remaining DVAS members have unique challenges to offer Beatrix. I don't know how to put into words how perfect this film is. From beginning to end you're wondering what's going to happen next. And everything that does happen is so well thought out and fits the characters so perfectly that it adds so much more depth and appreciation for the movie. <br/><br/>The ending may or not be what you're expecting. I'll just say it was both for me. It was a beautiful ending. These two films taught me a lot about honor. Obviously it's all fiction, but just like in Kill Bill Vol. 1 when Copperhead and Black Mamba are fighting in the house and the school bus pulls up, Black Mamba chooses not to fight in front of the little girl. She knew her beef was between the girls mother and that the little girl wasn't aware of how deadly and evil Copperhead truly was. That is just a very mild example of how, despite the overwhelming hatred Black Mamba harbors towards the rest of the squad, she still has the ability to be better than a mindless killing machine. Her enemies are highly-trained fighters. Each confrontation is like the beginning of a symphony and all you can do is sit back and let the melody of the swords carry you to the final heartbeat of either Beatrix or her foe. <br/><br/>I look forward to a possible third installment!"
"abjerg01","10","5","9","29 March 2013"," The some sort of underrated volume
","I thought the first volume was great fun, and you can tell Quentin had fun making it too. But to me, Vol. 2 felt a lot more 'complete' and well-rounded than the first one, which was action- packed and quite messy in my honest opinion. Vol. 2, although not filled with action, it was the most enjoyable for me. It was dramatic, beautifully choreographed, and of course well-written. Every QT-movie is well-written, but because this relied less on the action, and more on the dialog, it felt like it was better written too. <br/><br/>So what Mr. Tarantino has done here, is quite amazing. He has made two movies, which are one complete story, and belongs together as a whole - but still managed to make two movies in the complete opposite directions. So it all comes up to which mood you are in. If you want something quiet and dramatic, throw Vol. 2 on ... and if you want something that's more action- packed and fun, throw on Vol. 1."
"matlefebvre20","6","5","9","16 June 2007"," ...if you watch the first volume
","I still have difficulties to believe that this insipid and ordinary dish is the sequel of the ultra-spicy and tasty ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"".<br/><br/>With the incredible spectacle shown in the first part of this epic four-hour-plus movie, my expectations were very high for this sequel and conclusion. Perhaps that it's just me, but maybe I've put the bar too high. Or perhaps that Quentin himself did with the blood pool of the first volume.<br/><br/>At the end of the first volume, The Bride (Uma Thurman) already killed Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu). So there were only Budd (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and her boss Bill (David Carradine) to annihilate.<br/><br/>The major difference is that director Quentin Tarantino visibly gave a more conventional taste to the second volume. And if there's one character trait that QT doesn't own, it's the fact of being conventional. It's almost like if somebody slapped him on the fingers while lecturing him of calm himself and behave better. Anyway, if it's the case, I'd really like to meet that person and tell him/her my way of thinking.<br/><br/>This section of The Bride's story (who must be called by her real name Beatrix Kiddo) began pretty well however. The black-and-white opening about the church where the initial massacre happened is original and the massacre itself is never really shown, which gives a ""Reservoir Dogs"" taste (it happens to be the movie in which Madsen plays the greatest role of his career).<br/><br/>The fact that the shootout happened in a church during a wedding repetition acts like some kind of sacrilege. Just like the katana duel in the snow-covered Japanese garden in the first movie.<br/><br/>Like always, Tarantino tries to pay homage to many film genres in the course of the same feature-length film. But here, it doesn't work very well when you compare to his other movies. The first part, which is supposed to pay tribute to the spaghetti westerns from Sergio Leone, falls short. And there's one good reason for that. The word 'spaghetti' hasn't been taken just like that. That precise word is used because of the supposedly huge amount of blood shown on-screen. But it seems that we're running out of currant juice. Moreover, the cinematography is supposed to be minimalistic, which is not the case here either. Images are not elaborated nor especially stylized, but they're not minimalistic either. Tarantino can try to include samples from Ennio Morricone on the soundtrack, it doesn't improve the situation.<br/><br/>There's an obvious reference to the zombie films of George A. Romero which almost becomes a moment of unintentional comedy.<br/><br/>While Volume 1 was definitely based on the presentation, Volume 2 is definitely aimed at character development and at moments of introspection and souvenirs. It's probably that brutal change of tone that is so uncomfortable.<br/><br/>But it nevertheless benefits to some actors. Carradine impresses, not necessarily by his performance by itself, but by his capacity to remember so many lines and so many monologues by heart.<br/><br/>Hannah is the most frightening killer of the group, because of her dirty character, her menacing face and her sinister blindfold above her right eye. Her fight with Thurman is exciting and the scene where Thurman pulls out her remaining eye is very hard to stomach and remains the most powerful image of this portion of movie.<br/><br/>And we know at which point Tarantino is far from being sentimental. However, the scenes where Beatrix appears with her daughter (which Beatrix thought of being dead) are surprising and comforting.<br/><br/>Now I'd like to go back to Carradine's monologues. It's true that the characters talk much more than they fight in this second volume. Some people would even say that it's another Tarantino trademark and that it's the point that made ""Pulp Fiction"" so interesting. However, here, characters are rather boring and their conversations are not very catchy. Let's say that Bill's superhero speech is far from the level of the famous ""Royale with cheese"" of Vincent Vega.<br/><br/>On the cinematography level, there are not many things to underline. There's only the first chapter, entirely in black-and-white, and the scene from inside the coffin that are really interesting.<br/><br/>To sum up, almost all of the publicity and the fame of ""Kill Bill"" are built around the first volume. Volume 2 is good nevertheless, but we could compare the effect to a cold shower poured on a burning body. If both sections are put together, it would enhance the second part, but it would risk to harm the first one. And obviously, because we're so impressed by the first part, we desperately want to watch the second one. But what do you want..."

The emotional journey that the Bride goes through is stunning. And both Thurman and Carradine deliver iconic performances filled with weight and depth. And the final scenes, drenched in emotion and operatic Morricone are some of the best Tarantino or anybody has ever done.<br/><br/>In short one of the best films of the last ten years."

","Kill Bill Vol. 2, the second part of the fourth film of Quentin Tarantino, is a homage to spaghetti western and martial arts movies.<br/><br/>After of the Bride defeated to Vernita Green and O-Ren Ishii, she must cope with Elle Driver, Budd and his brother, Bill. The beginning, like in the previous film, has a strong scene because we see when Bill shoots to the Bride and she tell us directly about her revenge's travel and her final objective: Kill Bill.<br/><br/>The elements of spaghetti western films present in this movie are: - The desert environment. - The rough and tough characters. - The dirty aesthetic. - The soundtrack for gives more intensity to confrontation scenes: the Bride & Bill, the Bride vs the grave, the Bride vs Elle. In my opinion, these scenes are the best of this film.<br/><br/>As a curiosity, Tarantino uses part of the Ennio Morricone's soundtrack from 'The good, the bad and the ugly' in the chapter six, when Bill finds the Bride.<br/><br/>The elements of martial arts films present in Kill Bill Vol. 2, especially in chapter 8, are: - The story about the Old China. - The Kung-fu fights. - The hard training for become a great warrior. - The respect to the master and the revenge for his murder.<br/><br/>The movie is divided into five parts: - The chapter six (The massacre of Two Pines): The Bride remembers the last essay of her wedding. - The chapter seven (The lonely grave of Paula Schultz): The Bride confronts to Budd but she is buried alive. - The chapter eight (The cruel tutelage of Pai Mei): The Bride remembers her training with Pai Mei. - The chapter nine (Elle and I): Budd dies and, Elle and the Bride fights - The last chapter (Face to face): Beatrix Kiddo goes to Mexico, she faces to Bill and she discovers that her daughter is alive.<br/><br/>This second part is really good for this long revenge story, so anyone can feel satisfaction for conclusion of this film."

","Very disappointing, everything that worked in Vol 1, has backfired for Vol 2. I rather enjoyed the slow pacing of the first, here it is just frustrating, nothing happens. Though there is still plenty of black humour, I didn't care much for it. I was bored, there was hardly even any action. Several sections of the film seem unnecessary, and the finale is so anticlimactic, that I can't help but think Tarantino had bigger plans or that Something must've gone wrong during production. Maybe he had to rush to complete it, maybe he lost ten to fifteen minutes of exiting material. Whatever the case, vol 2. is a bore.<br/><br/>That said, it would be wrong to say that the film offers nothing new. Uma Thurman gets upstaged by a killer performance from the late David Carrandine. He has a very commanding presence. Vol. 2 also gives us the answers to all the questions we had when vol 1 ended, but thats about the only thing useful in this screenplay. I felt cheated out of a good time with kill Bill vol 2. This leaves me with a tough decision. Considering the competence of vol.1 do I recommend it? only if you want to know what happens next. Otherwise, just get a friend to tell you, or have him/her screen you the mere two or three scenes which actually contribute to the story.<br/><br/>then again, my opinion seems to be in the minority, so you I'd imagine you'd be liable to watch regardless of what I have to say"

The plot is really inexistent. You could summarize it in a couple of lines and it wouldn't be a synthesis, but just a faithful report of what happens on screen! The first hour is just damn boring! I've never yawned so much at a movie since Matrix 2! The only entertaining part is Daryl Hannah's fight vs The Bride and that's not much! Direction is great, as you would expect from Quentin, but there are so many homages to other movies and styles that you start asking yourself what's the real Tarantino contribution going on here!

","I greatly enjoyed Kill Bill Vol 1 and would happily give it a 9 out of 10. It had the right combination of goofiness and real action.  I watched the Volume 1 DVD the night before I saw Vol 2 in the theatre, so I was all primed.  While I did not like it as much as Volume 1, I thought that Volume 2 was pretty decent after the first viewing.  I enjoyed David Carradine, Michael Madsden was excellent and the Kiddo/Elle fight was pretty good.  I felt the ending dragged, but I was willing to put up with that as a change of pace. I still would have graded it an 8 out of 10 at that point.<br/><br/>After watching the DVD of Vol 2, I really have to downgrade my rating to a 6 or less.  Bill really gets BORING!  Now I know why Kiddo left him--she couldn't stand any more of those long-winded stories of his.  There's nothing wrong with long stretches of dialogue if the characters have something to say.  Bill's philosophical ramblings collapse under their own weight.  They certainly cannot be supported by the plot and characterizations of either Kill Bill volume, unless they were cut down to about 1/3 their length, and then we would have been left with very little movie.<br/><br/>I'll be re-watching the Volume 1 DVD from time to time, while Volume 2 collects dust.

In so many words: No.<br/><br/>On seeing Vol. 2 the impression hardens that this really should have been one movie of approx. 100 minutes length. Then it could have been good, or not, who knows. It's just that you can't help but wonder why this has to be a separate movie. <br/><br/>People expecting sword fight galore and chopped off limbs by the dozen will be sourly disappointed this time around. KB2 feels like it consists of 90% (cool) talk that isn't all that interesting. Sure, the bride clears a few things up about the wedding and her relation to Bill, but this is what we expected. And that is right where the crux lies. There is no suspension whatsoever. The bride will get her revenge and Bill will die. Surprise! Of course, it's not always necessary to have plot twists or elude the viewer, Titanic never made you guess twice either.<br/><br/>In the words of Coleridge the ""suspension of disbelief"" never set in. You may argue that this is no requirement for a good movie but I digress. I kept looking at the time index and wondering when this will be over because in spite of all its shortcomings KB2 has a great soundtrack, excellent camera work and tries its best to achieve the QT coolness factor.<br/><br/>Cutting both films into one would have set the right pace for one hell of a QT movie and not two mediocre ones.<br/><br/>5/10"

","What a well made film. Following the first amazing volume of Kill Bill, I had no idea what to expect. What I got, was one of the best films I've ever seen. There is much more drama and good dialog in this Volume than in the first, much less action, and much more character development. You find out the full story of Beatrix Kiddo (AKA The Bride AKA Black Mamba AKA mommy) and it is just as jaw-dropping as the story told in the first half. The black and white is used to perfection, and seeing it in color would make it worse. The acting in this movie is superb, as in the first, especially by Michael Madsen and David Carradine. I've never seen Madsen play a character so subtle before, and it really works. The dialog is sometimes amusing, and although this is not nearly as amusing as the first movie, which was hilarious (mostly due to the raunchy action), there are some very funny moments in Volume 2. Pai Mei is officially the coolest character ever in a movie, mainly because of his beard, and every character has depth and a style of their own. The cinematography, just like Volume 1, is nothing short of spectacular and the directing is, well, it's Tarantino, so its gotta be great. All in all, this movie is film making at the highest level, and is quite the joy to watch on screen and remember off screen."

Tarantino continues in full swing with his tributes to classics such as Leone's Westerns.  The first time Uma comes face-to-face with Carradine it cuts to an overlong showdown effect, why?  It works in a western whilst you're waiting to see who makes the first move, but it's completely unnecessary in this Kill Bill scene.<br/><br/>I stopped watching this when Uma manages to punch her way out of a coffin from 6ft under, it truly is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and is very had to believe its from the same director as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction!<br/><br/>1/10"

"bluesky-23","9","6","13","9 February 2005"," Surprisingly wonderful
","First of all, let's make one thing clear: I have never been a Tarantino fan and have never seen his other movies. They never appealed to me one iota. Yet the trailers for Kill Bill so intrigued me I finally had to watch Kill Bill, Vol. 1. I liked some of it, I started to understand why he is critically adored, but as a whole, it really wasn't outstanding. KB1 was fun to watch, but sometimes over-the top and lacking in coherence and plot. I watched KB2 simply to see how it ended but without high expectations. I was blown away.<br/><br/>From the black-and-white beginning where Uma addresses the camera to the final shot as the credits roll, there are so many brilliant moments I can't even list them all. The flashbacks to the wedding chapel and her conversation with Bill completely draw you into the characters and (which KB1 never did) make you care about what happens to them. The scenes in the coffin are so claustrophobic you feel trapped yourself, and the moment when her hand bursts out of the dirt is so terrific it induces cheering. Walking into the diner covered in dirt and politely asking for a glass of water is another great moment, reminiscent of the gunslinger walking into a bar. There are other wonderful Western homages and Western-style music which are incredibly cool as well. There are of course great action sequences with Pai Mei and Daryl Hannah and cringe moments (the snake and the eyeball) but thankfully, no ludicrous blood spurting as in Vol. 1. (There are also very funny moments as well, in particular the reaction of Daryl Hannah to the tobacco spit - a totally girl moment and absolutely hilarious.) But the genius of Kill Bill, Vol. 2 is in the dialogue between Bill and the Bride (aka Beatrix Kiddo we discover), and in the wonderful scenes with their daughter (such as: playing with toy guns; David Carradine making sandwiches, butcher knife in hand; tucking her daughter in bed for the first time; the superhero discussion... all moments to savor).<br/><br/>Ultimately, KB2 is an amazing tribute to motherhood and what makes us women. Even such a cold-blooded killer as Beatrix changes her entire life and does anything to save her child once she learns she is pregnant. The credits say it all: the shot of Uma smiling at her daughter, driving away, and AKA: Mommy as the last line - a defining part of her character from this point onward. She isn't just a killer, as Bill implied, who can never lead a normal life; she can be something more. It's a shame that a lot of women will see this as a guy's movie and not be drawn to it; as a woman, I loved the movie even more for the development of Uma's character and her stunning performance. And I have far more respect and admiration for Tarantino as a filmmaker than I ever did before. If you think this movie isn't exactly your cup of tea, try it anyway (if you have a tolerance for the action sequences) - you might be delightfully surprised."
"Ben_Cheshire","2","6","13","27 June 2004"," KB sums Tarantino up: all bark, no bite.
","Kill Bill is variously indulgent, shocking, corny, genre-clichéd, self-reflexive and plain thievery. Despite the fact that it tries to be a million other movies, in the end its hard to say what exactly Kill Bill is, and that's the highest compliment i can pay it.<br/><br/>I'm exaggerating, though, because Kill Bill is nothing more than a sickeningly simple revenge story taken intravenously from Sergio Leone with samurai philosophy and fights with big buildups that don't end up happening.<br/><br/>Look back at the final fight of Vol 1, or Elle Driver's demise in Vol 2 - they sum up what frustrates me about Kill Bill, and Tarantino's personality - a whole lot of build up (drawn-out closeups with crecendoing music before the fight; talking your movie up in interviews before its premiere) then a soft fizzle (Lucy Liu can't really operate a sword - there's just a whole lot of running around, smoke and mirrors, hardly even one sword-clash, before the final blow... Elle Driver: The Bride pulls her eye out instead of the fight happening). There is so much build up with music pilfered from other people's movie scores (mainly of Morricone music), that nobody seems to notice that the actual fight never happens!<br/><br/>Tarantino tries to convince us he does this on purpose, under the guise of ""f**king with the audience.""<br/><br/>Tarantino talks so much he'll always find some way of making his movie sound clever - but in the end, the talk's cleverer than the cinema is. Movies aren't essentially linguistic - that's books. Movies consist of moving images, and by reducing that to words you avoid discussing the reality of the movie itself, distort it and pretend its something its not. This is an artifact of all reviews, including this one - but there's something a whole lot less objective about the way Tarantino raves about why his own movies are clever. Unfortunately, Kill Bill requires us to think of movies like Quentin does to think its clever.<br/><br/>Quentin's constantly pointing out ""look how I f**k with the audience"" is a method of distracting us from the content of the movie. Quentin seems to have forgotten that its the audience he's supposed to be entertaining, not himself. Movies are entertainment - at least, genre movies are. What QT considers ""clever,"" I say is indulgent and makes for an impoverished movie-viewing experience.<br/><br/>He can describe the movie however he wants, but the reality of watching the movie is that every scene runs uncomfortable long, the dialogue delivery is corny (though much worse in Vol 1), his ""references"" grow to dominate his movies more and more, so that the end product is more synthetic than organic, the performances are 100 % Ham, and the style-over-substance (and not an original style anyway) nature of it results in a pretentious, empty experience."

I think that Tarentino had too much time to get into the characters because of splitting the movie.  Instead on concentrating on 'Cool', he concentrated on character and plot development.  This is normally a great, great thing that Hollywood needs more of, but in this case, I feel it back-fired.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, Kill Bill Vol.2 is a good movie.

"rainbird131162","Null","8","19","6 August 2004"," Gripping stuff
","Kill Bill: Volume Two confirms  as if confirmation were needed - that writer/director Quentin Tarantino's genius lies in giving audiences exactly what they want but not in the WAY they expect it. This approach has inevitably upset less imaginative viewers, especially those who wanted nothing more than a re-run of Volume One's bloodbath. But if you're willing to go with the flow you'll find yourself rewarded with one of the best movies of the year.<br/><br/>**Warning, Potential Spoilers ahead:**<br/><br/>One of the reasons I say that is because Volume Two pulls off the unlikely feat of making us feel sympathy for Bill. For instance, would you be surprised to learn that Volume One's wedding chapel massacre was as much an act of revenge on Bill's part as the Bride's is on him? Exactly what the Bride did to deserve such savage retribution is just one of the many surprises in store in Volume Two. <br/><br/>Talking of surprises, then perhaps the biggest of all is Volume Two's deeply satisfying emphasis on character and back story. Volume One's 'roaring rampage of revenge' is here subsumed into a titanic hymn to motherhood. Some have likened the second half of Kill Bill to Kramer vs Kramer and - amusing as that may sound - in a way it is accurate. For all its brilliantly staged action scenes the Kill Bill story culminates not in a re-run of The House Of Blue Leaves fight from Volume One but in two estranged parents battling over their child. As the story reaches its climax both gain our sympathy but only one can win. <br/><br/>But if talk of Kramer vs Kramer - in a Tarantino film no less - is starting to make you feel queasy, then let me reassure you that the fight scenes do not disappoint. Action highlights include an impossible 'Now get out of that!' situation for the Bride devised by Bill's brother, Budd. There's also a very funny 1970's style training sequence in which we learn exactly how the Bride gained her lethal fighting prowess. But the undisputed action highlight is a vicious catfight between our heroine and Daryl Hannah's one-eyed hellbitch Elle Driver. Ingeniously staged, the sight of two statuesque women knocking seven bells out of each other inside a cramped trailer home is truly something to see and the climax is delightfully, ah, squishy. <br/><br/>Acting-wise, Uma Thurman demonstrates impressive versatility as the Bride - really suffering in this second half both physically and emotionally - and Miss Thurman nails it every time. As the titular villain, David Carradine has just the right mix of leathery charm and ruthless pragmatism. When he and the Bride finally meet there's a convincing chemistry between them - enough to spark hope in the viewer that maybe, just maybe, they'll be able to resolve their differences peacefully.<br/><br/>As Budd, Michael Madsen has a sensational supporting role as the one assassin who regrets his part in the wedding massacre. There's an extraordinary unpredictability about Madsen. Even when he's doing something as mundane as mixing a drink you find you can't take your eyes off him for fear of missing something. He dominates the screen effortlessly and his character is a complex one. Whilst acknowledging that he and the others deserve to die for what they did to the Bride, Madsen's trailer trash loser is nevertheless intent on seeing her suffer (and then some!) for breaking his brother's heart. <br/><br/>From the biggest star to the smallest bit-part actor, all in Volume Two appear galvanised by Tarantino's enthusiasm. Tiny cameos, the potential of which would probably remain unfulfilled in any other film, are here given their full weight. Actors like Larry Bishop (Budd's strip club boss) and Michael Parks (Cuban pimp Esteban Vihao) seize the opportunity to create memorable characters. Even better, Tarantino is so good a writer that he never fails to ensure these scenes dovetail with the whole. When Bishop chews out Madsen's character for turning up late it's not only a stunning reversal of Madsen's tough guy persona, it also totally convinces us he'll be easy prey for the Bride  BIG mistake, that!<br/><br/>Parks' Cuban pimp also makes it clear where Bill got his way with women from. But despite his surface charm and status as Bill's 'father figure', Esteban is commendably shown as nothing more than a sadistic thug, not at all like Bill. Remember Bill's line as he prepared to put a bullet in the Bride's head at the start of Volume One? 'This is me  at my most masochistic' he told her. Well, as Volume Two reveals, poor, heart-broken Bill really was telling the truth. <br/><br/>In every respect - acting, music, photography, design etc etc - Kill Bill Volume Two is stunning film-making and compulsively, hypnotically watchable."

","While 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' was a masterfully directed, action-packed, humorous venture, 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2' is a masterfully directed, action-packed, humorous, emotional journey. In my review of volume 1 I briefly mentioned that the characters and their relationship with each other was what Tarantino really wanted us to relish. All the gore and the over the top action sequences (that really dominated the first volume especially) were just the icing. This time around, Tarantino builds on the tone that has been already set in volume 1 and gives much more importance to the ugly yet beautiful, hostile yet loving, relationship between the characters.<br/><br/>There is nothing much to say here other than to acknowledge the genius of Quentin Tarantino and his deep understanding of the art of filmmaking. And of course Uma Thurman. Her magnificent performance made sure that the movies exaggerated tone was not to distract the audiences from the heartfelt story it was trying to narrate. 'Kill Bill: Vol 2' is a brilliant movie which I felt was superior to the first."
"a_chinn","10","3","5","8 April 2017"," Ultimate finale to the ultimate revenge film.
","According to Uma Thurman, Tarantino had her watch three movies to prepare for this film: John Woo's ""The Killer,"" Pam Grier in ""Coffy,"" and Sergio Leone's ""A Fistful of Dollars."" If that sounds awesome to you, then the Kill Bill films are for you! Part two of what was originally planned as a 4-hour plus epic tale of revenge is even better than the first part. If Vol. 1 was primarily a homage to Asian genre cinema of the 60s and 70s, this installment is more a homage to westerns, particularly spaghetti westerns. Nods to others are certainly present (blaxploitation, rednecksploitation, muscle car movies, etc.), but this is primarily a western, which is wonderfully set up by Michael Madsen's down-on-his-luck international assassin character, Buck. Madsen's character could have simply been another sadistic Mr. Blond sociopath, but Buck has a tragic element to him. He was part of an elite group of international assassins, but he's now living in a trailer in the middle of the desert, working as a bouncer at a run down strip club, and even had to hock his Hattori Hanzo sword. Tarantino manages to give Buck a fair amount of character depth with minimal screen time, which is always a great thing to see. Though I think the action highlight of the film has to be the showdown between Uma Thurman and Daryl Hannah as the deadly one-eyed Elle Driver. Hannah had largely been absent from any films of note for quite some time, unless you count the Grumpy Old Men films ten years earlier and has sadly been absent from much since then, but she is terrific as Driver. I think a lot of credit also has to go to fight choreographer Yuen Woo Ping for the amazing fight between Thurman and Hannah in buds trailer. Tarantino also gets a lot of credit for selecting some truly bad-ass Ennio Morricone music for their final moments. Tarantino includes in his cast some other cool character actors including Gordon Liu (as a white bearded kung-fu master this time), Sid Haig, and Larry Bishop. And then there is David Carradine as Bill, who finally show his face on screen this time, and who is excellent. I can't imagine anyone else playing this role, even though there were some very cool other actors under consideration to play Bill before Carradine was cast. As with most Tarantino films, this is not a film to suit all tastes, but for those who enjoy Tarantino's aesthetic, this film is a real treat."

","All the tags we needed to know that it would be great watching this was: Quentin Tarantino, Katana fights, Uma Thurman, and Michael Madsen. Never has a movie with so much brutality and cruelty made me look away. In this movie, the violence is very mild and unseen compared to the last one, but in ways I liked that more. It allowed for more character development, conflict, and backstory, and it revealed such sentimental things, such as Beatrix seeing her - not aware that that she was alive- daughter.<br/><br/>And you all know the challenged woman who was with quentin Tarantino on the air and talking about his supposedly ""SOULESS"" movie.<br/><br/>Um, yeah no. It actually has a soul. A lot of it. The soul in many religions, philosophical and mythological traditions, is the incorporeal and immortal essence of a living being. According to Abrahamic religions, only human beings have immortal souls. This describes most the characters perfectly. We see that they have souls even if they caused Uma Thurman to be in a coma. *cough Pulp Fiction overdose scene*.<br/><br/>And the fact that is is directed by one of the most stylistic and thought provoking director makes it the more beautiful. <br/><br/>This movie also had an amazing soundtrack that fit the movie so well. Every scene that had a soundtrack was amazing. The final scenes soundtrack was probably the best. Which brings me the only issues, the scene was stretched a little to much.<br/><br/>So in the end, this film was successful in almost every way. And was an amazing Quentie film.<br/><br/>9/10 Oscar Worthy"

The thing that makes this movie is the score. The music in the background makes every scene seem so real and almost like you are there. The action and fighting is amazing and incredibly entertaining. The characters are actually pretty funny, and I almost identified with them. The camera shots are absolutely stunning. Altogether, this is a movie I wish I haven't seen so I could watch it again with the same feeling I had the first time. That feeling was utter astonishment at the beauty of this film. I don't know why this movie is one that sticks out, but watch it and see for yourself. Tarantino did it again folks. He crafted this cinematic masterpiece with his bare hands.

","Kill Bill: Volume 2 (2004): Dir: Quentin Tarantino / Cast: Uma Thurman, David Carradine, Daryl Hannah, Michael Madsen, Gordon Liu: Even better than Volume 1 and much deeper. This one is about penetration. As remembered from Volume 1 the Bride's wedding was ambushed by the Deadly Viper Assassins with the massacre concluding when Bill shoots her into a four year coma. Volume 2 opens with her being buried alive, which allows her to reflect upon her strict training. What makes this film work is its exploration of her and Bill's relationship and the concluding revelations. Director Quentin Tarantino details the film with his usual flair of outstanding dialogue. His previous films include the acclaim Pulp Fiction as well as Jackie Brown and Reservoir Dogs. Uma Thurman is excellent as the Bride who faced death and emerged with grim determination to face her past. David Carradine plays Bill as an intelligent and charming assassin with a sense of regret. Daryl Hannah plays the lethal Elle Driver whose fate is even more so. Michael Madsen plays Budd who is surprisingly the most sympathetic character in the film. He works at a strip club and lives in a secluded trailer. Gordon Liu is a strong presence as Pai Mei who puts the Bride under extreme training that ultimately leads to respect. Everything reflects upon why the Bride wanted out and the life she truly pursued when freedom arrived. Score: 10 / 10"

","Who reads the backgrounds knows that the script wanted bill to kill the wedding guests. It was the minute before taking the scene that Tarantino decided to have Bills contract killers it done... to me it explains why I couldn't figure the logic behind it. Neither did I find one behind the fact that this supposed world class killer Kiddo EVERY time is fooled by her victims and only by one chance or another survives... <br/><br/>Which completes the picture: Urma may confuse the hormones of many men, mine she doesn't. Thats why I could concentrate on the film and what I saw was an urban woman in her twenties that did not know how to handle a sword nor had the charisma that matches a determined killer. (A minimum requirement even for an absurd plot, I would say).<br/><br/>What some other pictures of Tarantino have and the reason why I will repeat them to watch till my end of days are the charismatic characters in it. Without exception, you have to love them, the good, the bad as well as the ugly. In Kill Bill? Marginally the sheriff, Budd and ...more just don't come to my mind... There was no spell and some nice shots or funny details (the best: the dead body in the coffin has his hand risen so a rabbit head-shadow is casted on the lid) didn't keep me awake. <br/><br/>Disappointing how money and/or fame (or whatever) have made Tarantino's mind lazy. The story was uninspired, totally profane; a woman has left her friend. He is a killer and reacts freaky. End. LOL! Just silly.<br/><br/>As other precedent critics wrote, in 5 years, people remind this piece as they will Roger Rabbit or Wayne's World: something new but nothing to watch ever again."
"simbo62","Null","3","5","20 April 2004"," Why make references?
","I quite liked this movie, not as much as the 1st, but there you go, anyway, Tarantino skillfully and stylishly made SUBTLE references in Pulp Fiction (e.g. the milkshake thing), Reservoir Dogs and his screenplay to True Romance, but when they're so open, where's the fun? It sort of ruins it, and looks like he's simply making an 'Ode to '60s westerns' or an ode to 70s samurai movies. There really was no point in overloading it with these (i'm sure there were a whole lot more i didn't get as well!); he's shown that he's a cinephile (to say the least), why not stop all these references which have been the substance of the downfall of his worst movie to date?"
"lasher42","10","3","5","17 April 2004"," A clearly defined second film
","Having just completed a back-to-back comparison of the two volumes of Tarantino's Kill Bill, its clear that his two narrators have very different storytelling styles.  Kill Bill Vol. 1 was a tribute to the Kung-Fu films of the 70's and later, as told by Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba).  Blood, honor, and kung-fu style fighting were paramount.<br/><br/>In Vol. 2, The Bride (Uma Thurman) narrates our story in the style of a ""Classic"" film.  There is more of a noir attitude and feel.  The violence is more realistic, and frequently implied instead of seen onscreen - a few graphic moments aside.<br/><br/>The story is told wonderfully, in a more linear style, incorporating more flashbacks than out of order chapters.  Tarantino's direction is crisp, with impeccable acting by Thurman.  Daryl Hannah finally gets her moments in the sun, as our stunning villain.  While Bill (Carradine) may be the man behind the evil, Elle (Hannah) is the true evil villain, reveling in the destruction of her enemies.<br/><br/>All in all, the two movies together tell a great story, and the stylistic differences clearly delineate between the two films."
"dj_bassett","Null","3","5","19 April 2004"," ""Okay""
","I neither liked Vol. 1 as much as some fans did or hated it as much as others. I thought it was ""okay"" -- basically an action/revenge cartoon with a Tarantinoesque gloss. Isolated parts, particularly the anime sequence and the wonderful House of Blue Leaves episode, were exciting filmmaking by any standard, but taken as a *whole* the movie seemed very lightweight and self-indulgent, more a case of Tarantino stylistically riffing on genres and characters he likes than an actual movie about real people doing real things. <br/><br/>That probably sounds harsher than it really is:  I like action/revenge cartoons, and I enjoyed Vol. 1. But I don't understand those who see all sorts of depth in the movie. The movie this most reminded me of was FROM DUSK TIL DAWN.<br/><br/>Vol. 2 has, I think, been overrated by a lot of critics who hated Vol. 1 and were looking for more traditional Tarantinoesque pleasures. Again, I think this is ""okay"", not great, not awful. More talky and less action-oriented than 1, it follows Uma on her quest. This time out she goes after Madsen, Darryl Hannah, and of course Bill himself. <br/><br/>Madsen's amazing, the best performance in the movie and the only one who felt actually ""real"" to me. Hannah is very good, too. There's a flashback sequence with Gordon Liu as Pei Mei that harkens back to old school Seventies kung fu movies that's fun, especially for fans of those kind of movies. There's some clever casting in small roles, too --I'll just mention Bo Svenson in a nice bit as a country preacher. <br/><br/>Some people like Uma in this -- I thought she did the best with a limited role, take that for what it's worth. Carradine has his moments, but he's basically playing David Carradine: the movie works best if you buy him as a Presence. I've never been a big fan of his and remained unmoved by his performance. <br/><br/>Tarantino complicates Uma's quest here and it's interesting -- I just never really cared about Uma and Carradine's relationship, so the complication remained pretty intellectual to me (ie, I understood it but just didn't really care about it, either). The dialog is entertaining, and there's plenty of homages here, especially to Spaghetti Westerns.<br/><br/>
Taken as a pair KILL BILL is good but lightweight, worth seeing but destined to be overrated. I am of the school that JACKIE BROWN is Tarantino's best movie, and the most interesting direction for him to go, but I like him a great deal and will definitely see his next movie, whenever it is."
"kritikoumaria","10","4","8","5 February 2017"," The Best Movie EVER!!!
","Kill Bill vol.1 and vol.2 are definitely the best movies(duology) in cinema history. It contains a lot of emotion, agony, thrill, melancholy and feeling of justice and vengeance. It is definitely the best fighting movie ever. Ennio Morricone soundtracks were perfect. I admire Robert Rodriguez and RZA a lot. Itis the first time Tarantino uses Morricone music, children to play in the movie,katana swords. I loved the idea of using sword. It is actually a film with a lot of martial arts, chapters, revenge, violence & love and it has no sex scenes which is very important for the movie. The Bride is not a woman for sex. She is a warrior who wants to take her daughter back.The end scene creates a feeling of justice.Definitely, best movie."

","Being a huge fan of QT before the Kill Bill series, I was ecstatic when I heard that QT was making another film. I watched Kill Bill Vol 1, didn't love it, the only reason that kept myself from hating was Uma. Then, I gave Vol. 2 a shot, not the best. The only thing I enjoyed in this film was Bill, and the last parts of dialogue between Bill and Kiddo. I felt the cast wasn't well chosen, the action scenes were mediocre, and the dialogue was decent. My ratings for previous QT films were: Reservoir Dogs (10/10), Pulp Fiction (10/10), Jackie Brown (8/10). My ratings for these two films: Vol 1 (3/10), Vol 2 (4/10) A Huge Disappointment."
"malcp","4","4","8","28 March 2006"," Time will tell on this epic work
","Perhaps I'm getting old, but dragging such a two bit story line out over two films without offering anything other than rather hackneyed tributes to numerous other movies and Tarantino's now rather repetitive slapstick violence, seemed to me rather akin to making a 24 hour long tribute to the Lord of the Rings trilogy (yes I know some people would welcome that but...).<br/><br/>Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs are indisputably classics, but anyone who thinks either of the two Kill Bill films are in the same league obviously haven't seen enough Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan movies. This movie would perhaps have worked better as a computer game."
"MaxBorg89","10","4","8","11 January 2006"," An outstanding conclusion!
","Much of Kill Bill's success depended on how the story would end. It couldn't be too predictable, but not too bizarre either. Luckily, Tarantino came up with one of the most brilliant epilogues in film history. In fact, Kill Bill: Vol.2 could be his absolute masterpiece, alongside Pulp Fiction. It really is that good.<br/><br/>Following the events of Vol.1, The Bride (Uma Thurman) has three more people to kill: Budd (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and, finally, the Man, Bill (David Carradine)! But since there are only three left, what are we gonna see during the rest of the film, the Crazy 88 having already been wiped out in the previous movie? That's what Tarantino aficionados are gonna love: the talky, ironic, totally quotable bits are back (the highlight? Bill revealing the ""truth"" about Superman's mythology, just like QT did with Like a Virgin in Reservoir Dogs). Some of the dialogue is reminiscent of Sergio Leone, and that's no coincidence: 75% of the movie is Tarantino's own version of the Spaghetti Western, with Ennio Morricone's music, a homage to the last scene of The Searchers (with Thurman replacing John Wayne) and the fact that most of the story takes place in Texas (we finally get to see the so-called Texas Wedding Chapel Massacre, which includes an intelligent cameo by Samuel L. Jackson). Okay, but what about the remaining 25%? That part (the middle section of the film) shows us how The Bride learned all the various killing techniques she masters, as we witness her brutal training with Pai Mei (Gordon Liu, who was Johnny Mo in Vol.1). It looks ugly, but it's one of the most interesting mentor/pupil relationships I've ever seen. If Tarantino had made Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, the Pai Mei chapter of Kill Bill: Vol.2 is probably what it would have looked like.<br/><br/>So, now the time has come to talk about what everyone expects to be the unmissable part of this film: the climactic Uma/Bill showdown. Well, without spoiling anything, it's a powerful, emotionally loaded confrontation, a tragic love story, the most touching ending Tarantino has ever filmed. And much of those scenes'beauty lies in the leading couple: Thurman is arguably even better than in Vol.1 (kind of a weird statement, given the two volumes were shot together and meant to be one single film), and Carradine's comeback was worth waiting for, similarly to John Travolta's return to form in Pulp Fiction. The only thing I don't understand is why the Academy ignored two excellent performances such as those we had the luck to see in this movie.<br/><br/>I don't think another director would have been able to achieve something this good. Kill Bill belongs to Quentin Tarantino, who has once again proved he can pick up an overused concept and turn it into a remarkable picture."

Tarantino said that in Vol.1 tried the making a Kung-Fu film developed in Japan , while in the Vol.2 to make a Spaghetti Western . There are various homages to several movies , thus : Hong Kong films of the Shaw Brothers , Kung-Fu television series when David Carradine himself appears playing the flute , musical score and sets of the Italian Western or Spaghetti .
In the picture there are murders , frenetic action , chop-socky , tension , shootouts and a little bit of gore when the violent struggles happen . Uma Thurman is magnificent , her fights against the enemies are breathtaking , the hard training with the Kung-Fu master Yuen Woo Ping have created a exciting and very well choreography struggle scenes . David Carradine who in the first part makes an invisible intervention here is the starring and he's top-notch.

However, I found that this movie was completely different from the first. Where the first lacked in much character development, it was made up for in Kill Bill: Vol. 2. The performances from every character were right where they needed to be, and, not uncommon for Tarantino movies, the dialog was witty when it needed to be witty, sadistic when it needed to be sadistic, and interesting the entire time. The audience can really feel the successes and pain of Uma Thurman through her terrific acting.<br/><br/>Even if you haven't seen the first Kill Bill, I recommend watching this.

"TheOtherFool","4","4","8","4 June 2004"," Why oh why
","As I feel it, Tarantino got away with Volume 1 of his revenge saga, as there were some elements in it most people (like me) not so much adore or find absolutely fantastic, but at least it was a movie you can like, laugh at and even admire (in particular the effects). Too bad you can do none of the above with Volume 2, as this conclusion must be one of the biggest let-downs in cinema-history.<br/><br/>'The Bride' (Uma Thurman), as we learnt from Vol. 1, is on a killing spree after 'Bill' and his assasins killed her soon-to-be husband, family and friends on her wedding (or, as we know now, her wedding rehearsel, but never mind that). In part one she killed of Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox) and Cottontooth (Lucy Liu), now the time has come for Elle (Daryll Hannah) and Budd (Michael Madsen). And the inevitable Bill, of course.<br/><br/>She starts of with Budd, who apparently traded his 'killer-life' for a trailer in the desert, working as a bouncer/toilet cleaner in a local bar. But Budd knows The Bride is coming for revenge, so when The Bride is planning to surprise him, he's way ahead of her, shoots her down and buries her 6 feet under. But this movie wouldn't be called 'Kill Bill' if, well, Bill wasn't killed, so the Bride gets out (in the best scene of the movie), remembering a trick she learnt from Pai Mei. So we have a flashback to Pai Mei, training The Bride for her life as a killer. Think The Karate Kid. This scene has so little to do with the movie and is so silly, it's right here where the movie takes a downfall.<br/><br/>Back to the story then. The Bride gets out of her grave and kills Budd and Elle (who happened to be in Budds trailer as well), and goes out to find Bill. But not before she has an encounter with Esteban Vihaio, some pimp who knows Bill. So we hear the whole story with Esteban etc. etc. etc. Throwing in some interesting characters who have nothing to do with your movie doesn't mean the movie is getting more interesting, you know...<br/><br/>When The Bride finally meets Bill there's a surprise for her: her kid (of which Bill is the father) wasn't killed at the massacre but has now turned into a 4 year old girl. The 'end fight' of The Bride and Bill should've been the highlight of this saga, but turns out to be so dull it's beyond belief.<br/><br/>As this whole 'Volume' is boring, useless, and in the end really unsatisfying.<br/><br/>4/10 for the OK first hour I guess."

","Admittadly im an avid fan of this director, producer and writer.From Dusk till Dawn was interesting and fun, Resovior Dogs was superb and Pulp Fiction was quite simply a master class.Indeed i throughly enjoyed Kill Bill Vol 1<br/><br/>and was looking foward in anticipation to the second helping.however i was bitterly dissapointed with what arrived.Kill Bill Vol 1 set the scene, it was a fantastic visual expierance and a thouroughly enjoyable ride.The absence of your typical Tarantino dialogue was replaced with sublimely clever visuals, the interactions between the main players allowed you to hear witty conversations take place without a word being spoken.Vol 2 has very little, in my opinion, to offer.it was good to see Madsen back and Carridine puts in a good performance by being slimey and irritating every time he appears on screen (""performance""?). Daryl Hannah is excellent as Elle, and the movies one saving grace (the allways outstanding) Uma Thurman, is as ever wonderful. However aside from the cast one has to say ""so what?"". Increased dialogue??they might as well have just shut up because there was very little of interest to say.Tarantino, the worlds most popular self confessed nurd,had his nurdiness turn around and bite him hard on the ass.the first installment was nurdy cool the second, just plain nurdy.Truth sirim?Please.Night of the living dead?its been done.the time hardened professional hitman and one of the worlds greatest killers playin Kindergarden Cop?Please.admittidly the scenes with Gorden Liu are very enjoyable, entertaining and downright funny and it here that Tarantino succeedes most in paying homage to his treasured Kung Fu genre.However this isnt enough to make this movie great, it isnt even enough to make it average.i walked away after viewing it(not during it as i was tempted to do) and had what alcaholics call, a moment of clairity....it was the first time i had watched a totally forgetable Quentin film.A sad day.Lets hope that Vincent and Vic can restore some of my faith in humanity.a forgetable 4 out of ten and not worth the effort."

","I really enjoyed Vol 1, so I waited for Vol 2 with great anticipation.<br/><br/>  I have been sadly let down.  This film is a trip into Mr T's self indulgent mind. There are far too many monologues along with unecessary scenes.  The opening at the church.  This was not needed, we knew what happened from the first film.  We didn't need it repeated in slow and boring detail without seeing the actual blood bath that ensued.<br/><br/>  As Uma is meant to be the ultimate female assassin, how did she fall for the oldest trick in the book at Bud's trailer???  Anyone with commonsense knows you fling the door open but don't fill the space.  For an assassin she was particularly thick. Once in the casket we have to endure yet another flash back to explain how she breaks out.  Any martial arts fan will know, we don't need a somewhat tedious flashback.  She has already proved a skilled warrior in the martial arts in the first film.<br/><br/>  Which brings me to the master.  So he falls to poison fish heads. :rolleyes:  For a master that is trained and highly skilled in mind and body control, he doesn't notice the poison!<br/><br/>  Bud - He is meant to be a psychotic nutter.  So why does he let himself get pushed around at the titty bar???? The trailer - a Black Mamba is on the loose, but the girls don't seem to care.  I was expecting a major sword fight, didn't happen.  Quite unexpected eye gouge. I appreciated the link with the master.<br/><br/>  We get long boring segments with Uma and Bill.  Playing the flute while she lies in front of the fire.  Bill's monologue about Superheroes.  Yes, we get it.  But please, it could have been quicker.<br/><br/>  Which leads to the climax.  For someone who has so much hatred and anger and someone with so much to lose, I was expecting a huge climactic battle between the two foes.   No, just a little clever sword play and the exploding heart combo. Sad letdown. Where was the drawn out suffering for Bill that he showed to Bea. <br/><br/>
  Basically Vol 1 should have been an hour longer with the same tight script with the action continue to flow.  Instead we get Vol 2 which Tarantino has had to bloat, destroy and slow down. A real shame."
"jsibley","4","4","8","19 April 2004"," Nothing like the first one
","Volume 1 was fantastic.  The characters were great, the action sequences were artistically conceived and stylish, and even the editing and pacing of the movie were excellent.  Not so with Volume 2.  Pai Mei is the only really new character, and while he is the highlight of the movie, his scenes don't last long at all.  There is very little action, almost nothing stylish or unique, and the pacing was agonizingly slow.  It slowly builds up to a very disappointing ending with almost no pay-off for sitting through some really terrible dialogue coming from Bill and the Bride.  Bill especially seems like a mouthpiece for Tarantino's inner monologue, which would be fine if Bill was supposed to be like Tarantino in any way, but that's a little difficult to believe.  In short, why on earth would Bill be reading comic-books?  Despite all that, there are some things I liked about this movie, such as the interesting characters and director's attention to details and sense of humor.  If this were a stand-alone movie I would give it 7 stars.  Having seen the first one though, I drop it to 4 out of sheer disappointment."

At times.<br/><br/>The problem with Tarantino is that he falls in love with his own cutesy dialogue, then refuses to cut it.  The final scene -- the supposedly climactic battle with ""Bill"" -- was beyond disappointing, beyond anticlimactic.  Two sad and pathetic human beings trying to talk tough, cliche after cliche, putting the audience to sleep in the process.  Why talk at all?<br/><br/>What we have here is an actress standing in for a director (they look like brother and sister to me), acting out the director's revenge and bloodletting fantasies, demonstrating in the process the director's infantile contempt for humanity, his disregard and contempt for human life, and his reliance on other people's ideas in the absence of his own.  The ""Fistful of Dollars"" soundtrack being thrown into the mix merely reminded me of the great Sergio Leone, the great Clint Eastwood.  When I heard this great music, ""Titoli,"" I believe it's called, at a packed midnight showing at the Cinerama Dome last night (and I consider screening this adolescent wank-fest at the Dome a total sin), I felt sad, thinking: this is what we've come to, this is what movies have deteriorated to: idiotic rehashes and ""homages"" to great and serious filmmaking of the past.<br/><br/>
The film-noir credit sequence at the end was stupid, overlong and completely inappropriate.  The ""Q"" and ""U"" credit made me want to puke.  The final outtake of Uma demonstrated once again the sheer pointlessness of the entire thing.<br/><br/>""Let's do it again,"" she says.  Another take?  Hopefully not another movie.<br/><br/>
I know Quentin; he seems like a nice guy.  And he's a damn good filmmaker, to a degree.  But he's an overgrown kid -- and a bloodthirsty one at that. Maybe he's a little bit retarded.  Maybe some day he'll grow up.  Maybe someday he'll actually put his creative energy into something that matters.<br/><br/>
Maybe."
"brett-50","3","4","8","16 April 2004"," So much worse than Vol. 1
","I really liked Kill Bill Vol. 1, so it's even more of a disappointment that Vol. 2 is QT's worst movie ever.  It's as disappointing as Matrix: Revolutions.<br/><br/>Nothing is really added to the story.  The beginning of Vol. 2 is slow, and the end is slower.  Even after ""Final Chapter"" pops on the screen, the movie won't end.<br/><br/>Here are some good quotes from Ebert's review:<br/><br/>""There is a lot of explaining in the film.""<br/><br/>""Such speeches function in Tarantino not as long-winded detours, but as a way of setting up characters and situations with dimensions it would be difficult to establish dramatically.""<br/><br/>""One of the achievements of 'Vol. 2' is that the story is filled in... which consists not of nonstop action but of more hypnotic dialogue...""<br/><br/>The speeches are so excessive that I can't help think QT should've just written a book.  There's an expectation you have after seeing Vol. 1, which had the most gratuitous violence of any film I've seen.  Vol. 2 is much longer and has almost no action.  I'm not complaining that Vol. 2 is missing the the gallons of spraying blood; I mean the movie is entirely stagnant. The Pai Mei scene was great, but most of the rest is just monotone dialogue. Carradine is interesting at first, but you quickly get sick of him talking, and by the end of the movie you really wish Uma would just walk in and shoot him instead of talk to him.<br/><br/>I don't suppose it's actually as bad as I'm pretending, but it's a complete 180 turnaround from the first movie.  Every scene is 10 minutes of dialogue followed by 10 seconds of killing.<br/><br/>Maybe Ebert's right that it's one of the best films of the year, when compared with masterpieces like You Got Served, Scooby-Doo 2 and Torque."

","What a disappointment for a long time Tarantino fan notwithstanding a very good cast.  Found Part 1 mildly entertaining and expected Part 2 to enhance overall experience.  No such luck.  Part 1 was way over the top (a times to the point of ridiculousness) and Part 2 was excruciatingly dull with too much boring dialogue. Continuity suffered through the over use of flashbacks, animation and black and white. The 2 parts could easily have been released as a single, shortened and much better edited film and accordingly felt ripped off.  <br/><br/>Compared to Pulp fiction (a 9 rating) would give it a only a 3."
"Lady-of-Rohan","Null","6","14","9 October 2005"," Volume 2 will answer all the questions and blow you away
","The Bride (Uma Thurman) was left for dead and woke up ticked off in Vol. one. After a bloody first struggle, the Bride now continues her bloodthirsty quest in the American South-West for her three remaining back stabbers: Budd, Elle, and most importantly, Bill. Through dust, blood, and the grave, she fights and bites her way to show her lack of mercy on the trio. However, before it ends, the Bride finds out some startling information on why she was almost killed and who is still alive after 4 long years.<br/><br/>It's obviously very popular for the talk on whether which installment of the series is the best as we constantly hear this yammering on. For instance, Volume 1 is often referred to as the exciting one which entertains you to a startling extent. Volume 2 is commonly noted as the idle, less dramatic, and less interesting movie. Yes, this film is takes it's time more and the body count is surprisingly small but in my opinion, I enjoyed this one more mainly because Tarantino steps away from the fake blood and gets back to the bread and butter of a successful film; the story. In the words of Tarantino himself, ""Volume 1 is the questions, Volume 2 is the answers"". It's the drama, stupid!<br/><br/>Anyways, what I really loved about this film in a nutshell is the story and the style in which it was told. Volume one was the Asian kung-fu bloodbath with bizarre scenery, great acting, and schizophrenic soundtrack. Volume two is the old fashioned Western where the story leads the advance and the lone Bride finally reaches her show down with her nemesis. Anything that was fuzzy, or unexplained in the first film is revealed in the Vol. 2 and told through Quentin Tarantino's marvelous storytelling and direction. The brilliant soundtrack also brings an authentic Spanish flavour to the stew, introducing all those high noon showdown themes from 70's spaghetti westerns that we all know and love. <br/><br/>One of the best scenes in this film (and also one of my personal faves) is the fantastic fight between the Bride and Elle Driver. Want a rundown? Every glorious punch, kick, whip, smash, crash, poke, flush, splat, cut, and stomp all perfectly roar together to give probably the most satisfying duel I've ever seen on the silver screen. Here's how I'd describe it in a bizarre way; imagine two rabid wolverines who are high on angel dust fight to the death in a tiny enclosed room with wooden furniture. Brutal? Yes. Entertaining? Hell yeah!<br/><br/>All in all, Kill Bill vol. 2 is a brilliant film whose soundtrack, story, direction, and action all collectively help to bring the film to a roaring success. It's definitely worth the twenty bucks for the DVD and I guarantee you it will be money well spent."
"snakej32","7","6","14","16 April 2004"," I feel so cheated SPOLIERS
","Kill Bill Volume 1 was a masterpiece, there is no doubt about that but this huge dissapointment Tarantino calls a second half does not do it justice. So many things make no sense and go against the whole style of the movie. Even the soundtrack sucks compared to the first. If you havent seen it yet dont read on SPOLIERS: The part when she is buried alive in the coffin and manages to not only break the coffin open, but she manages to get through all the hundreds of pounds of dirt that are coming in by what can only be described as flying through it to the top. So she can fly now, great. The whole scene with Elle is too short, and the sword fight doesnt last long at all. Another scene that was over promoted was the introductory chapel scene, Tarantino and others blew it out of proportion before its release saying that it was the whole scene of what really happened. In reality, they didnt even need to show it at all. All it shows of the actual ""massacre"" is a few seconds after the D.I.V.A.S. walk into the chapel (from behind no less), only to slowly back away from the chapel and only hear whats happening inside for about 10 seconds. And what the hell happened to Budd?? There's no big fight scene, theres no nothing with him and the bride, + he went from being one of the worlds most elite assassins to a poor alchaholic living in a trailer who's working as a bouncer at some strip club and it doesn't even say why. And he's randomly Bill's brother now and it barely mentions something about some kind of argument between them but nothing more. And Elle has him killed because she regrets that he killed The Bride when she told him to do it?!?! In Addition, the scene with the chinese assassin makes no sense, as assassins do not just leave their marks out of compassion or whatever you want to call it. Tarantino also cut the scene with the most potential which was Yuki's Revenge. The biggest injustice of all however, has to be the final scene between Bill and the Bride. Kill Bill is the title of the movie, and you'd think that The Bride's and Bill's fight would be some kind of epic battle, considering that the bride had such a hard time killing his assassins who don't even have half of the training or skills that he has. But no, the scene lasts for probably a little under a minute, and Bill puts up no kind of fight at all. I thought it was gonna be the climax of the movie! If their battle would have been longer I would have a much better opinion of the film. This movie does have some funny moments, and a few good scenes (especially the one with Pai Mei). I saw the first in theatres multiple times, and it remains one of my favorite movies, so me being so dissapointed with this one really says something about it. And it's not because it was ""slow"" because most of the best movies of all time are ""Slow"" and i've always been a fan of Tarantino's dialouge. And don't listen to any of this **** about it being complete now, this should have been one movie, it would have be much better and Tarantino would have had to cut some of the pointless and stupid crap making which would make the movie a great whole instead of a brilliant first half with a conclusion that pales in comparison."

","It's fine but it could have been better. The first one was entertaining, artistic, action-packed, impressive, archetype... it was something special! Also, Uma Thurman's performance was better in Vol. 1 (she won a Saturn Award and an Empire Award for her performance in this movie and it was the first time she won so many awards and nominations).
Vol. 2 is quite decent but honestly, too much dialogue ruined it. Also, music could have been better. Performances are good, especially David Carradine, who steals the show this time and Daryl Hannah (they both won a Saturn Award for their work in Kill Bill Vol. 2). However, it has more depth and backstory but then again it was too slow-paced.
Quentin Tarantino did an amazing job in Kill Bill Vol. 1 (he proved to the viewers that he was not only a good screenwriter, but also an awesome filmmaker) but Vol. 2 was a bit mediocre comparing to the first one. It lacks on action and badassity, Uma's performance was mediocre, music was mediocre and too much unecessary dialogue lowed it. I love the movie, that's why I gave it to it a 9, but objectively l think it lacks on many things."

Questions are answered, chapter eight and last chapter are masterpieces. It is a Spaghetti Western (with Ennio Morricone and Robert Rodriguez music) with some kung fu influences. While Vol.1 was a homage to old samurai movies, Vol.2 is a homage to old kung fu movies and Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns.

However like it's predecessor this film also features excellent supporting work. David Carradine in particular give an outstanding performance in his villainous role.

","Having not seen the first installment of this two part series, I was curious to see whether or not ""Kill Bill, Volume II"" could stand on its own as an entertaining and interesting story.  The short answer is no.  Most bad films have bad writing, bad direction, bad photography and bad acting.  KB II is actually quite strong in each of these departments, but it is in general so bizarre that each of these elements is overcome in what is some type of twisted homage and loveletter from Director Tarentino (a kung-fu movie nerd is his youth) to star Uma Thurman. Perhaps with the well known rampage of blood and gore of its predecessor having been accomplished, KB II apparently is filling in the blanks on some of the issues raised in KB I.  Knowledge of the first part might make the second part more intrinsically interesting, but KB II drags along with long sequences of essentially pretty and clever, but dull movie-making, punctuated by occasional outbursts of exceptional violence and stark ugliness. If you have some sort of fetish for Uma, and an unnatural fascination with martial arts films, KB II is definitely a must-see.  For the rest of us, however, living well, and seeing another movie, might be the best revenge."

(In flashbacks to her time with Pei Mai, bloodless and character-rounding for the most part, she is tormented by him with an arm lock that has her screaming and begging, snot and saliva dripping in a long strand to the ground as she writhes miserably in close up.) She is buried alive and left for dead, apparently past all hope, and we have a ringside seat for the whole ghastly misogynistic thing, complete with blithe and bonny crosscutting to every stray event taking place within a 5000 mile or 10 year radius. Read that: Her suffering is ridiculously, obscenely studied, protracted and severe.<br/><br/>Is it significant, I wonder, that both 'volumes' of this film begin with a close up of the main female character's swollen and gashed face, her bloodied head being shot point blank with a large caliber handgun as she begs for life? --As if once wasn't enough. <br/><br/>What's that all about? What does it say that this stuff goes down so well with the audience? For sure, it goes light years beyond just establishing firm character motivation.

But what is lacking in this film is humanity, nothing less than decency. It is truly pornographic. Many people have charged the same of The Passion for indulging with reverence and horror in the same kind of over-elaborated physical suffering this film does apparently for kicks.<br/><br/>I concede that my failure to stomach this film in the spirit in which it is supposed to be offered can be construed as totally not hip and not tough. Well, guilty as charged. Some people will claim that life, with its careening, out-of-control random violence, has escalated from horror to absurdity to comedy in the last several decades. There is only one problem with that point of view: Comedy or no, none of us has the room to laugh. --And that's exactly what Kill Bill 1 and 2 encourages us to do.<br/><br/>Zero stars. Bill 2 is a technically competent film. But as nearly all major films these days can make the same claim, that is not a recommendation for it. In the all-important areas outside the merely technical-- namely the moral and thematic -- Bill 2 is 1) reprehensible and 2) a mess.

The Bride, whose name we learn is Beatrix Kiddo, must deal with Bill's trailer-trash brother Budd (Madsen) and the deadly, one-eyed Elle Driver (Hannah) before her showdown with Bill (Carradine). We also learn that she has studied with Kung Fu master Pai Mei (Liu) and has learned techniques that will take on significance as her odyssey continues.<br/><br/>All through Arthurian legend and Eastern myth, the magic, invincible sword has been a central symbol invested with unending layers of significance. Filmmakers have taken great care to photograph it just the right angle, with just the right highlights so that its power and meaning can never be questioned. In Vol. 1, The Bride acquires such a sword from the legendary Hattori Hanzo, who comes out of retirement to make a weapon so powerful that ""if in your journey you should encounter God, God will be cut."" But another such blade is in possession of Bill's brother Budd, who must use it to prevent her from getting to Bill. When Bill asks Budd where this myth-laden, highly significant symbol of power might be, Budd says, ""I pawned it."" ""But it was priceless."" ""Well, I got $250 bucks for it."" This is the sort of dialogue that can only be called Tarantinian. T<br/><br/>In my review of Vol. 1, I wrote: ""But this is only Volume 1, and we don't even know what the main character's backstory is yet. Tarantino has Volume 2 to fill in some of the missing motivation as well as display his formidable writing and character development skills.""<br/><br/>And that is exactly what he does in Vol. 2. He has created great characters on the page and has brought them to life with flawless casting and seamless direction. Thurman's Beatrix may be studied in future years as one of the all-time great women characters ever put on screen. Both she and Carradine should start shopping for formal wear when awards season rolls around. Tarantino may even have a shot at Best Director. Also riveting is the performance by Hannah as Beatrix' rival, both for Bill's affection and for martial arts supremacy. Their confrontation is a masterpiece of choreography, stunt work, and eye-catching editing. Note that at the end of the credits there is a hilarious out-take from this scene.<br/><br/>One often hears the comment that ""they don't make movies like they used to.""

Budd, Bill's brother, is murdered by Elle as well. And Elle deservedly lose her only eye left, since Beatrix was mad that she(Elle) killed her(Beatrix) master. The end is surprising,showing that Beatrix learned the five point palm technique with Pai Mei, but she could have fought more with Bill,since it was the fight everybody was expecting the most.<br/><br/>A interesting fact that sadly never happened in the movie: The chapter ""Yuki's Revenge"" was cut from filming to accommodate a new chapter, ""Massacre at Two Pines"" that details the attack on The Bride. An outline of the chapter was to have Yukie Yubari,Gogo's sister seek vengeance on the Bride for killing her sister.<br/><br/>aka ""Kill Bill-volume 2"" - Brazil"

","Just like part 1, this film is awful. This story must have been written by a child, example being The exploding heart kung fu technique and escaping from a coffin 6 foot under! What a waste of the audiences time and I have to feel sorry for the cast members during the world film premiers watching this film over and over again. Also the characters waffled on and on about nothing much making the story very boring. Improvements that were missing from Kill Bill 2 are: 1. More action 2. Less talk/waffle 3. Realism and not fictitious nonsense. Don't waste your time watching this film."
"ScottLabrecque","7","5","12","18 April 2004"," Pretty good...............
","Pretty good, but not the end-all/be-all film by Tarantino. I'd rather have had this movie as ONE movie, not two, as the second half drops the ball, changes direction, becoming an action shadow of Volume 1.<br/><br/>Volume one contained ""the action movie"", and did so exceedingly well.<br/><br/>Volume two contained the ""slower emotional side of the movie"", which I thought it failed at frequently, and telegraphed the future plot complications too early, unlike the first volume's fight scenes, where you had no idea what they were going to do next."
"gunflyer","4","4","9","28 December 2012"," Overrated Tripe, volume 2
","I find volume 2 to be the better of the two Kill Bill films... but that's mostly because compared to the first, this one is much lighter on the ridiculous amounts of blood and gore, and a little higher on the drama. The problem is... in doing so, the movie becomes boring and ends up looking as though it needs more editing. I mean seriously, part of the Film is about Budd going to work and getting fired or something and for some reason, Tarantino really thought we needed to see this whole damn sequence which doesn't establish a set up or anything or serve any purpose later in the film. Other parts of the film linger for far too long on many different shots too in my opinion. I don't know what Tarantino was thinking, maybe he thinks he's Stanley Kubrick or something? No, Tarantino is no Kubrick. Not by many thousands of light years.<br/><br/>Instead, the Bride almost gets killed by Budd when in the previous film she killed many, many experts with the deadly arts, when she gets buried alive by a dumb ass hick. But that's the least of the problems with the film. My biggest problem is this: It's been established by this film that Bill is in love with Beatrix(The Bride), who is in hiding from assassins because she's pregnant. Obviously, Bill loves her. Want to know HOW much he loves her? He loves her SO much that he tracks her down, murders everyone in a church, shoots Beatrix in the head, takes her baby, puts her in a coma then into a hospital she is repeatedly RAPED while in that coma. Welcome to a world where nothing makes sense people.<br/><br/>My point is... this movie, and the one that preceded it are based on a premise that is so incredibly, inexplicably dumb that I can't possibly wrap my mind around it. Bill loves her so much... that he almost kills her, AND takes her baby. You know what? I almost forgot that definition in the dictionary that defines love as almost murdering the one you love. Now, I understand if Bill is really emotional. I understand if he's really sad, or really angry. But I don't understand the mentality of somebody who loves somebody so much that when you find her again someday... you shoot her in the god damn head!!! That makes absolutely no sense to me, no matter how much I try to rationalize or explain it to myself. Frankly the premise causes the whole film and the last to crumble apart into dust for me. Kill Bill volume 1 sucked... and this one sucks too.<br/><br/>On the plus side... some of the music is REALLY great and some of the ideas are fun and original, like Beatrix digging her way out of the grave. But otherwise, I would never recommend this series to anyone."

","I never bothered to watch the first one. Quentin Tarantino is overrated. There's not much to say besides that. He's admired by a lot of people who enjoy and watch good movies. But don't be mistaken. Every movie he makes is almost a repeat of the one before it. Just changing small minute character details. And just like that a new movie is just released.<br/><br/>Pulp Fiction. Not a bad movie because of all the good actors in it. Other than that not that great of a movie. It's hard to mess up a movie about a drug dealer, an overdose, and multiple characters that are all very action-packed. See Pulp Fiction if you want. It's not something you need to own. Don't see any of his other films. Not saying he's a bad guy, just saying he's not a great artist."

","I saw Vol. 1 the other night and was absolutely dazzled! It's not because I like action -- in fact, I rather don't -- it's that Vol. 1 is masterful, creative film-making, with almost impossible attention to detail (both visual and aural) and an anfractuous script that is perfectly crafted. I just saw Vol. 2, however, and I came on this site to see what people had to say...and I'm SHOCKED by you all! I can only guess that people responded to seeing character development in Vol. 2 --as ridiculous as it is (tell me, where oh where is there ANY real depth, ANY earned feeling?) -- that was withheld (intentionally, as it was unnecessary to what Vol. 1 is) in its predecessor. What is that at the end: ""All is right in the jungle / The cub is with her mother"" or something like that...Are you kidding me?! Are you people sheep?! Did this touch your heart or something? I'd think that Q's had a big joke on anyone if it weren't that it would be much too much trouble to go through. The whole training thing was nothing more than a redux of that kind of thing in martial-arts movies -- not an homage, not something new, just a redux. In fact, this is the whole movie: redux. Truth serum?! A hidden snake?! All that exposition?! And as far as the action, why bother, if you're gonna step down so far from Vol. 1?! QT ran out of steam. I know he wasn't TRYING to make Vol. 2 like Vol. 1...but he should have. Or maybe not. It seems the masses -- after all, the same people who somehow call themselves film fans while watching the Oscars year after year even though they give Kevin Costener Best Director for ""Dances With Wolves"" over Martin Scorsese for ""Goodfellas"" -- can't tell the difference. I hate people."

","I heard somewhere that Kill Bill Vol.2 is way better than Vol.1 but it obviously ain't. It's quite boring and thank God i didn't go to cinema to watch it. I watched it on DVD. There's too much talking/explaining and it really gets boring. The first one was a little boring too, but the action was way better. In this movie there's only two 'good' scenes to watch (remember) and that's when Uma first goes to Madsen and he shoots her and second when Uma meets Darly Hannah. After that fight scene the movie just get boring for another hour.<br/><br/>I expected a 'big' fight scene between Uma and David Carradine (Bill) but everything was over in few seconds which was quite disappointing.<br/><br/>And the thing that bothered me the most was that Uma hardly even says anything in this movie and the thing that everyone says how good and sexy she looks, when her look in 'Kill Bill' is definitely her worst look ever.<br/><br/>Uma used to be really hot (remember 'Batman & Robin' or 'The Avengeres'), but she looks exhausted and very old for her real age in this two movies.<br/><br/>All in all, i expected much more from both of 'Kill Bill' but i think it's obvious that Tarantino's best movie was 'Pulp Fiction' and that's the far-est he can go.<br/><br/>I give this movie 4/10 and the first part 5/10."

","People who expect the same unbridled brutality and violence of KILL BILL, VOL.I may get seriously disappointed with the more talky Vol.II. This sequel is NOT a bad movie at all; it actually shows a lot of the background of VOL.II, but by doing so, the film was rendered with a slower pace. We finally get to know WHY Bill wanted to kill the bride so much. The ending is contrived and a bit disappointing; after all, this IS a very violent revenge movie, but the way this movie ends is nowhere near as bloody as the tamest kill scene in VOL.I. I was expecting something bordering on bad taste for the final confrontation, but what we get is broadway drama. For a revenge movie, the bodycount on this one is EXTREMELY low. But what holds the movie together is our eagerness to see The Bride finding Bill and ultimately, killing him. I could have forgiven the slow pace, the talky scenes and the lack of action had the final confrontation been a real adrenaline rush, but this it was not. KILL BILL, VOL.II is still a fine movie that takes itself more seriously than the first, but by doing so, it sacrificed the youthful kinetic energy that made the original installment a more pleasant movie experience. 7* out of 10*."

","It's poorly paced and the dialogue is insipid. What to attribute this to then? Poor direction or poor use of editing software? Volume 2 trades its buckets of blood for pages of dry dialogue that explore the history of these characters but bring us nowhere new. It was far easier to swallow The Bride's bitter quest for revenge than this. Tarantino's self-adored mysticism and issues with self-indulgence this time around make it the boring mess that this post talks about. There are a few scenes that seem like they could've been cut out in the editing room without a problem, or at least shortened. If they would've released this movie as one long film, I bet half of the dull volume 2 would've hit the cutting room floor. It was either sheer greed or sheer stupidity that made them split it into this mess."

There are plenty of directors and writers out there that have made better films and more of them. As a film student I view films all the time and I could have made this film, bottom line, not that I would have wanted too. But if I had the money and I could have used the same actors etc; I could have easily made this boring, long, totally pointless film. Let's be honest both Kill 1 and Kill 2 look like a college students final project before he goes out into the film making world.

","Well,as i have heard so much that this vol is much less action packed than the first volume but it perfectly succeeds in giving us the satisfying conclusion of a two-parter movie. Uma Thurman is awesome as always. This volume depicts David Carradine as ruthless Assassin Bill(Title Character),he is as tough previous volume has shown us. I liked the way it contains so much characters and presents us the Training of the Bride AKA Black Mamba by Pai Mei. The scene where she escapes from the grave covered in sand after which she goes to a coffee shop and asks the waiter ""May i have glass of water,Please? ""is quite funny. Again,This flick is full of references.Also,the one of references to the zombie and undead movie when she takes her hand out of the grave is clever. As i believe it pays a great deal of homage to the Western and old Chinese movies especially the training where the disciple learns from his master. When she plucks out the second eye of Elle,that scene is so Intense Daryl Hannah is quite the screamer. Michael Madsen's style is very decent as a typical Texas fellow who lives in a trailer park. Everything about this movie is quite good but not better than the First volume nevertheless it lands on a comforting climax which makes us happy and cheerful,not to mention B.B looks so cute and sweet. Great Job by every member of Cast and Crew. Thumbs Up."
"zardoz-13","7","3","6","7 June 2012"," Not As Much Fun as the First One
","Quentin Tarantino has got talent, but he whipped up so much frenzy with ""Kill Bill, Volume 1"" that there was no way that he live up to what he had started in ""Kill Bill, Volume 2."" ""Kill Bill, Vol. 1"" has more artistic merit that the second half. For instance, Tarantino never showed Bill in a full shot in the first half. Obviously, the ""Pulp Fiction"" director was treating his chief villain like the early Blofeld in the James Bond thrillers that didn't show the villain until ""You Only Live Twice."" In the first half of ""Kill Bill,"" our heroine--Beatrix Kiddo (Uma Thurman)survives an attempt on her life. We know that the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad turns out for her wedding rehearsal and mowed down everybody in a barrage of gunfire. However, this singular event was never shown. The discretion that Tarantino exercised in ""Bill 1"" distinguishes it from the lack of discretion that he depicted in the follow-up. Indeed, he doesn't show this homicidal quartet actually perforating everybody in the chapel. Nevertheless, aside from showing the scene as a necessity, this is basically the only thing that he does that doesn't follow the chronology.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill, Volume 1"" surpasses ""Kill Bill, Volume 2"" because the demise of O-Ren Ishii and Vernita Green are more interesting than the deaths of Budd, Elle Driver, and Bill. Nothing in this half compares with the outrageous swordplay at the House of Blue Leaves. Furthermore, none of the villains in the second half are as memorable as O-Ren. You can almost share of sympathetic tear for O-Ren because she worked up way up to a position of prominence in the Tokyo underworld. Budd and Elle Driver qualify as sadistic louts. The Bride (Uma Thurman) doesn't even kill Budd. Indeed, Elle Driver kills him when she stashes a venomous black mamba in a red piece of luggage that contains a million dollars in $100 dollar bills. <br/><br/>The fight scene in ""Kill Bill 2"" is a reversal of the fight scene in ""Kill Bill 1."" Instead of staging an over-the-top combat sequence in a spacious restaurant, Tarantino choreographs a demolition scene fracas in a trailer. While it is imaginative, it seems more claustrophobic and exciting. Unlike O-Ren, neither Budd nor Elle Driver have anything approaching a back-story. He is a drunk and she is a sadistic bitch. The rewards of ""Kill Bill 2"" are the scenes at Pei Mei's place where The Bride learns how to punch her way through wood as well as a special punch that later enables her to kill Bill. Compared with its predecessor, ""Kill Bill 2"" looks and sounds more like a Tarantino film because the dialogue sounds more like ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction."" Unfortunately, again, the characters are not as interesting. You never really hate Bill who comes off as more charismatic. Nevertheless, ""Kill Bill 2"" is worth watching and studying for its narrative structure of setting up things and paying them off. The homages abound and Tarantino indulges more in his penchant for making references to other movies."
"drqshadow-reviews","8","3","6","16 April 2012"," The Bride's Follow-Up Changes Gears, But Remains Intense and Riveting
","A much slower, more suspensefully contemplative take on the same material as its first chapter. Rather than being on a non-stop offensive, this time we see the Bride in a more reactive role as her kills don't always go so swimmingly. Along the way, we catch a glimpse at her training in a stereotypically isolated Japanese temple, alongside an impishly charismatic bearded master, the show-stealing Pai Mei. When it comes time for the inevitable showdown with Bill himself, Tarantino plays his trump card and leaves a driven audience (and vengeful bride) confused about the apparent simplicity of their quest of the last four-plus hours. It's not as instantly captivating as the first package, and a few segments fall curiously flat, but it's enjoyable in surprising new ways and provides the closure we were all so desperate for. It's a perfectly appropriate finale, if not the one I may have been expecting."

"ElMaruecan82","10","3","6","31 July 2011"," Thank you, Master Tarantino for the 'Kill Bill' series ...
","""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" ended with the revelation of The Bride's daughter being alive and this last shocking finale couldn't have made us wait three years for a conclusion, it was a 'to be continued' ending inviting for a direct continuation that would also feature elements preceding the first Volume and completing it with a necessary level of depth. So, to call ""Vol. 2"" a sequel or a prequel is irrelevant, as the two movies make one, and constitute Quentin Tarantino's greatest cinematic achievement after ""Pulp Fiction"".<br/><br/>Creativity is like a second skin for Tarantino, it's amazing how each chapter exudes a unique atmosphere. ""Vol. 2"" never ceases to amaze us when we already got our share of adrenalin and emotions in the first opus, and I think the secret is very easy to spot, it's somewhat located in your heart and it's the ability of Tarantino to touch you right there. Action is one thing, but the movie excels even more in its portrayal of the motives that drives the action. And one recurring element in ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" more than any other, is the repetition of flashbacks whether shown or told, lengthy or furtive. The whole chapter involving the initiation with Pai-Mei is a great homage to the traditional Martial Arts films, and another enrichment of our knowledge about the Bride, finally known as Beatrix Kiddo, and the relationship with her Master. This aspect is crucial not only to justify her use of a special move to get out of a coffin, but also during the sword-fight when Elle Driver reveals how she killed Pai-Mei, indirectly informing us how she lost her eye. This fight closes the character's arc of Elle Driver and makes the revenge even more delectable, the 'Kill Bill and the Squad' thing getting a bit old.<br/><br/>The fascinating aspect is how the film relies on the psychological element as Bea doesn't have the monopoly of motives. When we finally discover Bill, we have some insights about the significance of his acts. In the first flashback, Bill promises not to be a 'killjoy', but there's something odd in that whole chapter. Again the editing of the scenes helps the narrative in an decisive way, if the massacre had introduced the whole series, we would have been terribly shocked. But now that we know what a killer the Bride is, there's something disappointingly odd to see her, in a lousy chapel with these giggling chicks, and that blonde-haired schmuck for a husband. Something doesn't feel right. I'm not saying we would have rooted for Bill, but at least understood him. The last conversation between Bill and Beatrix goes even further in the development of Bill, proving how a fascinating character he is, and a suiting villain for such a heroine like Kiddo.<br/><br/>The masterstroke in the screenplay is the serum truth, a poetical device to be sure that we all get everything, after all, the Volume 2 is here to conclude, to answer the questions without asking others. And we understand that Bea left Bill because she wanted to spare her daughter from growing under a bad influence, which quite justify Bill's anger, who thought his protégée was dead. On the other hand, Bea knew she was lying to herself with that wedding thing. So there are three truths in the Kill Bill series. First, you cannot escape from your past. Bill had to be back, and Bea's lies ignited his anger and caused the massacre. Secondly, you cannot escape from revenge, Bill's brother, Michael Madsen as Budd, knew it, and says in a poignant brotherly discussion that all the squad deserves to die. And third, you cannot escape from your nature, Bea was a killer, and the whole revenge against Bill let her express her most innate violent impulses  and as she conceded, the blood poisoned by the truth serum, she enjoyed those killings. The tragedy of Bea is that her nature as a killer inspired her, in a motherly protective move, to get B.B., her daughter, away from Bill. And seeing her shooting for fun, senselessly talking about a dead fish or watching 'Shogun Assassin' to get sleepy says a lot about Bill's education.<br/><br/>The depth in ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" allowed the climax to be more meaningful, Bea had to kill Bill, less for the chapel massacre than to protect her daughter. The reasons changed and so did the fight style. When we expected another blood-fest, the climactic fight begins and ends abruptly with the five point palm-exploding heart technique that catches Bill and us by surprise. Bea didn't tell that Pai-Meei taught her the technique, why? Because she's bad, or just because she, like any others, wants to win the fight, and it's the perfect ending, as we tasted enough blood to rather appreciate an emotional farewell. The next morning, we find Bea with B.B. in a motel. This time, BB doesn't watch 'Shogun Assassin' but a simple cartoon, showing that things are changing for the better. And in the bathroom, Beatrix cries with an euphoria that sounds like the hangover following the blood-drunkenness provided by so much killings, or was it just the after-effect of the truth serum? Never mind, she joins her daughter to let us breath and celebrate the happy ending of a glorious saga.<br/><br/>The ending credits reminds us that what we've seen is just a movie, a homage to a genre ... but what a movie! what a colorful gallery of characters who penetrated our Pop Culture memories : The Bride, Bill, O'Ren, the Crazy 88, Pai Mei  ""Kill Bill Vol 2"" is an extraordinary homage to the worshiped Martial Arts genre with some Neo-western elements, there's this agonizing feeling of an end approaching, and the creative destruction incarnated by the Bride piercing the coffin as to prove once and for all, that these genres are not dead, Tarantino as God-like 'CineMaster' resurrected them."
"Jonathon_Natsis","9","3","6","2 February 2011"," Who says sequels are always worse?
","Volume Two picks up precisely where Volume One concludes on a cliffhanger, and it is necessary to have seen the first one in order to follow the plot. Naturally, Tarantino, Thurman and Carradine return to wrap up the saga of revenge and violence, accompanied by Michael Madsen (another of Tarantino's favourites) and Daryl Hannah, both of whom are positively given additional screen time in this film.<br/><br/>Having already crossed two members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad off her hit list, we follow the Bride as she travels to a desert caravan park to confront Bill's brother Bud and fellow assassin Elle, who just happens to be Bill's newest lover. Sadly, she does so without the use of her beloved Pussy Wagon which (if I may make a pop culture reference of my own) we can assume was stolen by Lady Gaga. From there, she makes her way to Bill himself, where she makes a startling discovery that stands to challenge her motives entirely. <br/><br/>I mentioned at the beginning of the first review that to cover both volumes in a single document would be a tough ask due to the overt differences between the two. While Volume Two contains the violence expected from a film of this genre, it is nowhere near as gratuitous as the original, which sought primarily to reference the kung-fu genre in an exploitative sense.<br/><br/>Instead, Volume Two is somewhat more insightful and makes an effort to question the very nature of violence, and whether or not it is warranted in different circumstances. Anybody expecting the same scale of bloodshed as its predecessor will leave disappointed as the action in this film, while enjoyable, is severely unpleasant and never without consequence.<br/><br/>Tarantino delivers some of his best work in terms of both dialogue and set pieces with this pseudo-sequel. Apart from what could be considered an unnecessary opening scene in which The Bride breaks the fourth wall only to state the explicitly obvious, there are virtually no other instances where any character's lines feel either forced or lazily written. Madsen's perfect delivery of 'that woman deserves her revenge andwe deserve to die' and Bill's well- crafted monologue about mortality during the climax not only sum up the themes of the film neatly, but are also indicators that QT is back on his game in the screenplay department.<br/><br/>The extremely claustrophobic scene in which Bud (Madsen) buries The Bride alive is nothing short of terrifying, and is right up there with the Velociraptors in the kitchen (Jurassic Park) and Vito's assassination of Don Fanucci (The Godfather: Part 2) as one of my all-time favourite scenes. The training session with Pai Mei showcasing the origins of The Bride's development into a professional assassin is more than just an entertaining set piece; it is a film-within-a-film, and should be treated accordingly. Where some may view it as a major disruption to the story, I feel this was Tarantino's intention in an effort to further emphasise the film's exploitation angle.<br/><br/>Where violence is lacking, it is replaced by the development of genuinely interesting characters, accommodating a unique screenplay and fitting comfortably within the slower pace of this film when compared to Volume One. With such a complete and satisfying ending, confirmed rumours of a third instalment scream of a Miramax cash-grab. I hope to be proved wrong.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*"

The first Kill Bill did have more action and gore but I found this one to be it's smarter big brother. The plot is more interesting and finishes the story nicely. The characters are more developed and Bill himself is a very central character,and a fascinating one at that. I also really liked how the characters of Bud and Elle Driver(California mountain snake) where explored a bit more and had more screen time. Plus on top of that all the main performances where really good. My favorite though was Chia Hui Liu as Pai Mei,the extreme Martial arts teacher. My other favorite performance was David Carradine as Bill. Carradine makes Bill a charming,intelligent character as well as a great villain.

","I'm not quite sure how to grasp QT. Frankly, I think he's a very good director (and a so-so action director) and makes good choices when it comes to a DP, editing and music. The guy himself I think is a nut (not in a good way) and it shows in his writing.<br/><br/>Both Kill Bills are soulless. This is a revenge story between one psychopath against a group of psychopaths. I do have to say that QT does write interesting individual scenes, his trademark. And he probably gets good actors 'cause they're fun to play. But at the same time they are original, but as original as mashed potatoes and chocolate syrup. They're tired clichÃ© characters repackaged with the QT brand, and that somehow is fresh?<br/><br/>And those scenes in question. They're usually very colorful but also very trite. They rarely have an actual point.<br/><br/>And QT doesn't know a thing about character development. Maybe that's his point, but he seems to write AROUND almost anything interesting that might come out of a story about these people. To give a comparison, the original The Crow is a very passionate revenge story about a character that you're invested in. But why do we like The Bride? 'cause she kicks ass? Who cares? I know NOTHING about this woman 'til the very end, when a weak excuse of how she SUDDENLY changed into a good guy when she found out she was pregnant.<br/><br/>The only spark of character development was when Michael Madsen said ""she deserves her revenge."" Out of 4 hours? And this set-piece of action with the 88 at the restaurant. It was just a jumble of movements and gallons of blood. (I personally hate that wire stuff.) Even at his worst, a Jackie Chan movie has more rhythm and clarity to their action scenes than this. And even at its most corny and basic, a John Woo film has characters that you are invested in.<br/><br/>I know I'm in the minority on this, but I just don't get it. No, this isn't about the violence. QT is the demigod of cinema, but what is he saying about anything? It's not that hard. Movies are suppose to be stories about characters. And then do whatever the bleep you want after that. But if it's about slick pretty people doing bloody things, any hack can give you THAT!"

I was scared - he was so calm and pleasant and yet there was a cauldron of aggression just sitting tranquilly waiting to be disturbed so it could explode (""esplode"" as Estaban might say it) on another helpless human... Estabon scared me... THEN I saw the credits and thought to myself: ""It was Michael Parks?!?"" He should win an Oscar for best actor! (I was amazed even more when the western style sheriff who investigates the Pine Church massacre in KB:V.1 turns out to be Parks as well.) Now if that range and depth of acting doesn't win an award... then the academy needs to reevaluate its assessment technique. Parks was brilliant! He was so good I thought that this guy is too real - he is too scary - he has got to be caste from off the street! Michael Parks gets a 20 out of 10; 4 thumbs up; A+++; major plus superlative kudos.

Oh yeah, in kill bill 1 the crazy 88s ,or whatever they are called, after she beats them their arms and legs have all been cut off and they are squirming around. LOL! Then after that when she is fighting that Chinese girl, i forgot her name, at the end of the fight her scalp is flying through the air, then she is just like standing there. Then when Uma Thurman rips out that chick's eyeball with the patch, and she is freaking kicking around screaming and cussing. That was freaking awesome. I could go on but I'll stop.

","Uma Thurman returns as the Bride, who this time looks to continue her streak of vengeance against Budd(Michael Madsen), Ellie Driver(Daryl Hannah) and Bill(David Carradine) the movie delivers more substance than the predecessor and is better due to the texture provided by character actors who perform their roles excellently. I liked Kill Bill:Volume 2 better than Volume 1, mainly due to the attention given the relationship between Carradine and Thurman, which overall makes the ending tragic. David Carradine has always been an underrated talent and although he made a lot of lame B. movies, he was almost always the best thing about them and in the role of Bill, this is his best performance in years. Uma Thurman is also effective, as is the cast and Tarantino abandons his usual smart-ass line readings in favor of a western atmosphere. Also on board is Michael Parks who is always a welcome presence. However what really accounts for KBV2's best qualities are the training montage scenes as well as the final showdown which consists of poignant dialog which turns this into more of a tragic piece rather than a simple revenge saga. Plus it's weird but Carradine and Thurman have an odd chemistry which never lets us doubt for a moment that they indeed love each other. Simply put this a movie that is well worth owning on DVD. Even if you aren't a fan of Tarantino's work. <br/><br/>* * * * out of 4-(Excellent)"

","i think for an average film director this film would have been a masterpiece but for a director such as Quinten Tarintino its a failure. in comparison to his earlier priceless films this was an embarrassment. the dialogue was poor and did not entirely pull you into their personalities and doesn't give you the belief that they could be real people where as Jackson and Travolta made you believe that they were real people because of the attention to detail in the dialogue. But as always the sound track was phenomenal! with good music you can always add style to a weak film scene! which I think Tarintino took advantage of in this case! The story line was poor and the only thing that fully engrossed me in this film is the well regrouped fight scenes! All though the cast was impressive the film was pieced together poorly and failed to tie in significantly there was just too much left unexplained of my liking! I have come to the conclusion that the film is extremely over-rated and was a disappointment to Tarintino's career!"

","My opinions on the first film were ""hmm, very different, lets see where this goes in the next volume"" When I finally did watch volume two, I cannot fully describe my disappointment. Not just with the film but with Quinton Tarantino. To me, he hadn't directed this movie, he basically ticked the boxes of people expect of him. <br/><br/>Non-Linear story Chapaterised; Classic songs; Interesting dialogue; References to dozens of films from various decades from various genres.<br/><br/>To be fair to him, he did tick all of them but what he ticked them with was very lame stuff, but the overall product was just plain disappointing. And it seems to me that it has got to a point where Tarantino's ego has become more important than the script. Ultimately I get the feeling that Tarantino has peeked with Pulp Fiction, but he is deluded in to thinking that is he can deliver that every time. I think that he has lost his ""voice"" in the same way I think Kevin Smith has lost his. The spark/flare in the dialogues that were in his earlier films has gone, what we get instead is stuff which is very laboured. Likewise the use of music in his films, he has used the music so badly in this film it is unbelievable.<br/><br/>I guess the best analogy that I could give is M.Night Shyamalan films, you go watch his films expecting a twist, and when he does deliver the twist, you are kind of left disappointed with it. Likewise you go to watch a QT film expecting the stuff mentioned above, and what you get isn't what you had hoped."

"kaplara","4","3","6","20 December 2004"," Kill Bill: Vol. 2
","Kill Bill 2 is a movie whose plot is as simple as it's name. There is little below the surface here, but the movie simply runs amok on poorly developed characters and low grade action sequences. Yes I know the movie is designed to mock or make reference to many other movies, notably martial arts films, but rather then using those ""Hollywood"" moments to enhance something Tarantino uses them like a crutch. Most of this is due to the plot, which with nothing new to offer simply flows in a boring and contrived way. In addition no major roles seem capable of overwhelming the poor script and dry substance of the movie. Its as if everyone there has resigned themselves to the fact that the script and plot are dead, and act a little on the dead side themselves.<br/><br/>Uma Thermon is clumsy and unconvincing as a vengeful super assassin. At least in the first movie one is capable of viewing the ridiculously over the top action with a bit of a grin and saying nuts to the plot. O ren also helps with a few fun lines like, ""the price for mentioning my Chinese heritage as a negative is, I collect your f@#king head."" O ren in general is more convincing though not great in her role. Uma's awkwardness forces Tarantino into doing what I often view as the first sign of a bad action movie. He uses up close shots of the characters during fast moments and distance shots during slow ones. This usually means that were one to view what just occurred from a distance, they would see it for what it is, clumsy and uncoordinated.<br/><br/>Overall this movie retains some of it's director's excellent tough mostly through the visuals, which taken as a picture rather then a moving film as breath taking. Tarantino makes use of start color contrasts to give one a sense of texture and beauty beyond the norm. Were I in the poster business I could take a thousand frames of this movie and make them into wonderful pieces of art. I should also note that I still believe in Tarantino, movies with finesse and masterful dialogues such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction do not happen by accident and shine no less for the latter mistakes of their maker. I rate Kill Bill one and two as 6 together, perhaps a 6.5 for 1 and a 5.5 for 2, they were simply not that interesting, sorry Q try again.<br/><br/>~Tylahedras"

I won't bash Tarantino because this is the first (I count both KB1 & 2 as a sole film) film I've seen of him and that would not be fair.<br/><br/>First of all, why in hell I find most of the performances thoroughly forced? I don't believe Uma at all. Carradine... his lines were well, but please don't even dare making another ""fight"" scene like that (come on, you were better even in ""Future Force""!). On the other hand, both Michael Madsen and specially Daryl Hannah (thank you dear, you looked and performed much better than in ""The Job"") rob this film. <br/><br/>Straight into what the film is, the first volume was excessively violent, somewhat bizarre, and I called it (in my ""The Job"" comment) a ""fun crap"". this second one explores the inner side of The Bride, and all comes to an end in a long, dull, and boring way. <br/><br/>To sum up, it's the proof of what happens when an American director tries to make a martial arts film like the Asian ones. Any Jet Li or Bruce Lee film can run rings around it.<br/><br/>4/10"

I'd say he's more like one of those guys from ""Dude, Where's My Car"" who watched waaaaayyyy too many samurai films as a teenager.<br/><br/>I won't disparage Uma Thurman or David Caradine for their continued roles, as they had to be committed a second time, although why Tarantino broke the film into two is beyond understanding. I will say I am surprised that Thurman and Caradine agreed to do this film in the first place. Maybe Caradine feels he's getting washed up or had some fantasy of playing an evil ""Grasshopper"". As for Uma, I think she put too much faith in Quentin after their time together in Pulp Fiction, which I enjoyed despite its taste for gross violence. This film takes the same idea of violence but then dubs in ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" into it. Thank heavens Quentin didn't ask Travolta or Jackson to show up as ninja bandits! And again, we have the philosophical mumbo-jumbo mixed in amongst expletives delivered in an silly macho tone. I guess the only good thing I can say for the sequel was the same thing I said for the first film, it has good action, albeit this one has a lot less. Sorry, their isn't another Crazy 88's fight.

","Kill Bill 2 is a long agonizing view of a director's self loving extravaganza. There are a few really cool moments most of them are in the second trailer.

It's all a big build up to a stupid ""Lord of the rings"" long ending without the caring or the plot to keep the viewer interested. Uma Thurman is pretty but no one can just stare at her for 135 minutes without getting bored. The rest of the cast played with a  cartoon charecter's depth is annoying at best. Budd is a clasical shouthern idiot which doesn't explain how he is a brother to Bill and the rest of the cast including the charecter of the martial arts teacher are shallow and do little to entertain while spiting their lines with overacting seen usually in college productions.

And were there ever so many poor performances in one film from a supposedly major director? Carradine shines only because he rises to the giddy heights of being average in such poor company (Uma is especially bad, and the extremely unflattering photography doesn't help).<br/><br/>KB 1 was an okayish but wildly overlong actioner, but there's nothing here to match the silly but mildly exciting House of Blue Leaves finale. What that means is the big action climax actually happened at the end of another movie or halfway through this one when it's put together.

","I like most of Quentin Tarantino's work, a lot.  And this movie has a lot to recommend it, particularly interesting camerawork and photography.  You don't see a whole lot done with overexposure and backlighting like you do in this film.  The quirky, Mamet-esque at times, unusual dialogue is at times a bit much for me but I got it in the cartoony way in which I am sure it is intended.  But I think some of the quirkiness of QT's films comes from Quentin himself, and this is a guy that is a bit too self involved for his own good much of the time (at least on the talk shows that I've seen). Ultimately, this movie suffers from that in some of the excrutiatingly slow, labored speech that is intended to be dramatic.  Maybe this is in itself part of the cheese factor that this movie embodies, but between interesting bits, action, and comedy are vast boring wastelands of ""Eyes Wide Shut"" slow paced dialogues.  Making so much of the dialogue in this pace simply isn't good art in my view, there is a whole palette that can be used."

","This movie was an arrogant piece of work by Tarantino.

There is no better example of Tarantino trying to put himself above this movie than at the end when the letters ""Q&U"" take up the entire screen in giving credit to him and Thurman for creating the character of the Bride.  With mild attempts at scoring a few cheap laughs, the movie does a displeasure to itself and the first volume.

Somebody please tell me the appeal of near endless, mindless dialog with a great deal of it being completely pointless. Anti-entertaining is the best way I can think of to describe it. I was looking for a little entertaining while laying on my bed home from work sick with the flu, but this ""movie"" isn't just a disappointment because its not entertaining, it goes beyond that to induce an actual level of misery. Bad movies simply are not entertaining, thus this movie is worse than bad.

I read all these reviews of people saying what a masterpiece this film is. To each their own.. but that must be some kind of mass organized joke. No real sustained action period. Any fragments of what little action there is is outweighed a million-to-one by intense blaring boredom. Plot is irrelevant because before the you even hit ""play"" its already known -Kill Bill. No real flow considering all the wacky pointless scenes with no bearing on the story at all. These pointless scenes can't have even one positive adjective attached to them, for example ""funny"" or ""suspenseful"" They are just nothing.

There's the grindingly slow pace, the inept self indulgent use of film grammar (lotsa commas and capital letters) and as always the sentimental wallowing in vapid low budget nostalgia. It's the type of garbage that was third on the bill at the drive in back in the 70s when you were trying to get as much face time in with your date before you had to take her home ( ""Of course it's late, it was a triple feature.""). The only difference is that hipster auteur Tarantino has enough cash to spray paint it with a high gloss metallic lacquer that in this day and age gets gobbled up by a moronic generation raised on computer game violence with a reference point that stretches back as far as 1990.

By the time we are within sight of the finish line, we will have encountered eighty year old pimps sitting and chatting in chairs mumbling about where a certain someone is; we will have encountered Bill, after he was kept anonymous in the first film, playing a pipe of some sort and we will have spent a couple of scenes with a former international assassin who's now living out his days as a Redneck.<br/><br/>It's these sorts of people and these sorts of scenes that make Kill Bill: Volume 2 the mismatch film that it is. It's a lot of good ideas and one or two harrowing scenes basically patched together around a basic revenge goal. The film is not the complete experience but then again the film was chopped into two halves anyway and the result is one part brilliant, brutal and engaging (volume 1); one part drawn out, slow and unrewarding (volume 2).<br/><br/>You remember individual scenes from Volume 2, you don't remember the full product as an experience. Sure, the burial scene is harrowing and the scene in which The Bride (Thurman) has a certain encounter with a certain someone nearer the end will tug at a lot of people's heartstrings and the sure, individual shots of The Bride walking amongst the heat wave and the bizarre crash zooms into Pai Mei's (Hui Liu) face as a he strokes his beard in a nonchalant fashion stay with you for reasons of a sporadic nature. These moments are memorable, if not rather good but the frustrations lie in the referencing to other texts for the sake of being post-modern and the consistency with the characters.<br/><br/>Bending the lines between reality, fantasy, realism and escapism; The Bride sits in a car and delivers a monologue to the camera about how she's going to 'Kill Bill' at the film's very beginning. She even makes a comparison between herself and a movie, likening herself to a 'roaring rampage of revenge' reminding us that this is just a film after all. Then Tarantino chucks in what he does best in terms of manipulating narratives and that's including flashbacks as well as flashbacks within flashbacks. The Bride's first encounter with Bill (Carradine) and the general scenes around the wedding chapel early on work well through the menace Bill brings to the screen. It's effective because we know thanks to the first film what's to come, it is a matter of getting to that point and how it all plays out that is the suspense. Even stranger, Bill comes across as relatively well mannered, even nice, with his soft tone and slow, relatively passive movements that further create illusions of his true persona. It's no coincidence Tarantino selects the side angle when the two come face to face for the first time – the sort of composition that creates that 'face off' scenario.<br/><br/>Additionally, Tarantino gives space to Budd (Masden) to grow ever so slightly. Budd's early interaction with his boss for being late for his shift at work leads us down a route of possible confrontation but Budd is passive and lacks that killer instinct – something we wouldn't associate with an assassin. This makes his lack of ruthlessness toward The Bride later on all the more effective and instead, we get a harrowing burial scene rather than an upfront execution. All the villains in the film are sadistic but simplistic; they manage to think up crude and downright nasty ways to eliminate their foes, be it a live burial or a snake in a briefcase but there doesn't seem to be any real flow to it all.<br/><br/>The antagonism flits around the place; in volume 1 Bill is a mysterious unseen figure of all thigs sadistic, the next he is playing a flute by a campfire. Tarantino deployed this tactic in Pulp Fiction with Marcellus Wallace and it worked even when we finally saw his face, but here it falls rather flat. The film is a freak show of one eyed kung-fu femme fatales; 80 year old pimps whose whores have populated nearby villages with their young, thus taking the surrounding areas for the old man and comic book spouting psychopaths who have developed their own truth serum. The truth to this is that I think Tarantino gets carried away with himself – it's as if he reaches a certain height and then tries to top himself further with more outlandish content. This is particularly significant towards the end when Bill's luxurious house plays out as the setting for the final confrontation, but it's more of a circus than a bad guy's lair.<br/><br/>Some of the best scenes are scrubbed out by some of the more unbelievable and just plain silly. The Bride's interaction with an assassin in a hotel room feels awkwardly out of place and just plain daft whereas Pai Mei's constant laughing and beard stroking to crash zooms feels like a pastiche too far, no matter how potentially enjoyable in a guilty manner. But that's the key word: 'potentially'. The film feels like a missed opportunity, a film that with a calmer head and a more focused eye might have been pretty good. As it is, it's good in individual sections but actually pretty forgettable in the long run."

","Before my friends and I went to see vol 2 I had not yet seen vol.1. They sat me down hours before and made me watch the first film before right away going to see the second. I am not the biggest Tarantino fan but I must say I was impressed. The violence was awesome and it reminded me of an old kung fu movie with Uma Thurman. Like most of his work vols 1 and 2 were unoriginal. Compilations of older films Tarantino rented when he worked at a movie store. Except at least vol. 1 had beautiful action. Vol 2. was a waste of time. If 1 was a high budget kung fu movie 2 was a low budget western complete with slow dialogue and the insertion of long long hesitations. I did not like this movie. It appealed to pimple faced, twenty-something year old film students across the world who could dissect it and analyze in their film studies 101 and talk about how great it was. But to an average joe like me I though it was bad. It was boring and anti-climactic. I like solid movies, I love to kill a mocking bird and cinema paradiso, I don't just like violence. But if vol.2 was supposed to be more dramatic it should have had more substance. And vol 2 lacked substance."

","I just watched this film again after having seen it when it first came out and I am awe-struck: I have never seen a film equal itself in spell-binding impact as thoroughly the second time around as 'Kill Bill'. Spielberg and Ridley Scott are two other formidable filmmakers capable of that, to mention a few, but for sheer entertainment value, I think Tarantino clearly outdoes them both. Earlier today at the gym I was watching the death of Go Go in 'Kill Bill: Volume I' and all the way home I was smiling ear to ear. There's no way I was going to miss 'Kill Bill: Volume II'.<br/><br/>The thing about Tarantino's masterpiece is that he is dead on in the emotional aspects of the story. The current of feeling is so strong that my wife has to turn away in certain spots. What I can't understand is how is it every actor in this movie was aware of its quality while it was being shot? Somehow every performance is so unbelievably compelling it's quite difficult to judge who did the best job.<br/><br/>It's impossible to praise one without wanting to praise them all, but I will say that I thought Uma was a bad choice when I first heard she had the lead. She just seemed too lightweight physically. But rather than spoil the movie, in many ways, she is its best part, which is saying a great deal in this case. Like all great actresses, she essentially makes you fall in love with her. Quite a trick considering she does this by overcoming a substantial barrier of space and time. Could there be a sequel? I wouldn't think it possible except this is Quentin Tarantino."

","I was BORED TO TEARS watching this movie. The entire movie felt like watching The Architect's speech from Matrix Reloaded on repeat. I left seriously let down, as did many of the people I talked to after the movie was over while we were walking out of the theater. I walked into the movie theater, sat down in the front, and slunk all the way back in my chair and got ready to watch the movie. Only one scene in the whole movie made me sit up. One section of the movie looked, felt, and sounded like it was ripped DIRECTLY from the pages of an old, terrible Kung-Fu movie. Complete with an old super powerful fool who hates Americans, women, and blondes (yet agrees to train The Bride, who is all three), has an obscene infatuation with stroking his 5 foot beard, and can do the same 'jump and balance myself on the sword on one foot' trick that Chow-Yun Fat did in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. That sequence was terribly boring, much like the rest of the film."
"etzool","3","3","7","16 June 2006"," Very poor follow-up.
","As far as the general storyline, this film is OK, nothing surprising, and certainly not a disappointment.<br/><br/>However, after the very good editing that made volume 1's swordplay enjoyable and relatively convincing, the martial arts scenes in this movie are difficult to watch.<br/><br/>Yes, this is obviously in large part a spoof on martial arts movies. Yes, it takes some of the stock characters from such films and makes some great plays on them, and yes, it integrates this well into the story (even if it is amazingly cheesy).<br/><br/>However, to watch Uma attempt to look proficient in hand-to-hand fighting is truly an unpleasant thing, and takes away significantly from the movie. I didn't realize until seeing this movie how well-edited vol. 1 was -- watch it again. You won't notice how incredibly awkward she is, because the cuts are so good that all you see is quick action, not her swinging that katana. In vol. 2, you see all of that in-between, and it turns out it's a VERY good thing we missed it in 1.<br/><br/>Were it not for that, this could have been an acceptable conclusion. As it is, if you have any kind of background in martial arts -- or even martial arts movies -- you will probably find this film very hard to take seriously, even as a parody.<br/><br/>Extremely overrated. Watch at your own risk; you may end up with an aversion to the first one as well, as I did, which is very unfortunate."

","This is even better then the original in my opinion as its my favorite of Tarantino's along with Pulp Fiction, with an emotional finale and outstanding performances!. All the characters are just wonderful once again, and the story is brilliant, plus Uma Thurman, David Carradine and Daryl Hannah are all simply amazing in this!. OK granted there is nowhere near as much as the amazing action that the 1st had, however while Kill Bill is one of my favorite films, I just felt the story was better here, plus it was cool to see the opening fully this time!. To me the finale was one of the most emotional I have seen in a long time, and i'll admit I was sad to see Bill go, plus the dialog is just brilliant. For me it was very different from the 1st film, and a gross out scene for me is when Beatrix plucks out Elle's eyeball and squishes it with her foot!, plus the buried alive scene was great but rather disturbing as well. The fight scene between Ellie and Beatrix is now one of my personal favorites and the training scenes with Pai Mei and Beatrix were really cool as well, plus David Carradine's superhero theory was really cool!.<br/><br/>It was awesome to see Beatrix bonding with her daughter and I really dug the relationship between Uma and Carradine as they had fantastic chemistry together, plus the ending was just perfect. Even at almost a 140 minutes it's never over long and Uma Thurman gives an even better performance this time around! plus Michael Madsen's character was really cool as well!. It's extremely well made and written, and I loved how they gave Carradine, Hannah and Madsen a lot more to do this time! plus the music is very good in this once again. Like the 1st Kill Bill this deserves to be in the top 250 and while I couldn't stand Pai Mei's character Chia Hui Liu did his job extremely well! plus it has many surprising and shocking moments throughout!. All the characters are extremely likable once again , and while the main fight between Beatrix and Bill was disappointing and too short, it fit the film well, however it's nowhere near as violent as the 1st!. This is even better then the original in my opinion as its my favorite of Tarantino's along with Pulp Fictionm with an emotional finale and outstanding performances, and if you haven't seen it and loved Kill Bill like me do so immediately you shouldn't regret it!.<br/><br/>The Direction is once again practically flawless!. Quentin Tarantino does a perfect job here with amazing camera work, wonderful angles, good use of colors and lots of other stylish and cool shots as well, plus he kept the film at an extremely fast pace!.<br/><br/>The Acting is incredible!. Uma Thurman is stunningly gorgeous and is amazing as always, she is even better this time around, kicks that ass, had some great dialog, had fantastic chemistry with David Carradine, was incredibly convincing in her emotional scenes, was really likable, and it was cool to see more of her past this time around,she was amazing! (Uma Rules!!!!!!!). David Carradine is amazing here as Bill, he gave a charming show, had some very classy lines, had fantastic chemistry with Uma, and I was really sad to see him go, I was so happy they gave a lot more to do here! (Carradine Rules!!). Chia Hui Liu is extremely convincing as Pai Mei unfortunately I couldn't stand his character, he was extremely unlikable and cruel to Uma's character, much too arrogant and classless, still that's what his job was and he did it very very well. Michael Madsen is fantastic as Budd, he was funny, and had a really cool character I liked him a lot. Daryl Hannah is extremely hot, and is amazing here, she was so evil, and I absolutely loved it, I wish she didn't go so soon though!. Samuel L. Jackson has a cool cameo (Jackson Rules!!!).

","I saw the first half, Kill Bill: Volume 1, about a month ago, so it is still relatively fresh in my mind. Where the first half focuses mostly on Thurman's character ( The Bride aka Beatrix Kiddo aka Black Mamba aka Mommy ) going down her list to exterminate those who tried to see that she was dead, this second half focuses more on her relationship with Bill (David Carradine) and others from her past, including Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and Budd (Michael Madsen), all highly trained fighters as was she. While the movie, as a second installment, is mildly entertaining, it is ALL style over substance, and is a definite ""10"" for Tarantino's biggest fans, who enjoy his ""style."" However, I found much of it very slow-moving and bordering on ""boring"" to the point that I began to not care very much how it ended. It seems to me a self-indulgent film made by a writer/director who loves to hear the dialog he has written. I gave the first half a ""4"", I give this half a ""4"" too. I suppose one can add up the two scores and say I gave it an ""8"" of 10, and I probably would if he were to make one, two-hour movie out of it.<br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILERS. There is a scene mid-picture flashing back to the training The Bride received with the old Chinese master, and him insisting on her learning how to break through a wood plank with only 3 inches of room to accelerate her fist. Over and over she practices, knuckles bloody. It becomes her technique later for escape when, buried alive, she has to punch through the wooden casket. Good thing they didn't use a cheap steel casket! And, in an earlier conversation with Bill, who we find out is her husband, she is told of a finger punch exploding heart technique the old master used to defeat enemies, and in the final scenes while fighting Bill, she uses it on him, to his surprise, because the old Chinese had never taught it to anyone else. With Bill gone, mom and daughter seek to rebuild their lives."

","When I first saw kill Bill vol. 1 I was so pleasantly surprised because first of all, I didn't expect I would like a Tarantino movie that much (this movie turned me into a big fan of QT!!) and second of all, that underneath this bloody, feisty plot is a great story about a great woman that is so strong and in the same time so warm, which might not be noticeable in vol. 1. The next day I bought Kill Bill soundtrack because the music swept me away, and I couldn't wait vol. 2 to come out. In a way I was afraid what to expect... WOW!!!! The biggest dilemma after seeing it was:"" which one I like better?"" Than I realized i DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE AT ALL. Volume 2 is all about knowing the Btide, understanding her reasons which were'n trivial at all. Music is just as good, Michael Madson, Gordon Liu, Michael Parks as s Mexican pimp... WOW! Everybody were fantastic! QT created a new world in this movie and everything makes perfect sense in it, nothing is strange (not even to me, until now, a complete kung-fu ignorant), whatever a person does, we understand, we can relate. You can even start to feel this deep connection between Bill and the Bride. The scene of his death is absolutely beautiful and again, makes perfect sense. This is a story about great women in kinky situations. I strongly recommend it. I LOVE it!!"

","I'm kind of surprised to see people saying this Vol.2 was better than Vol.1. I thought part one got a lil over the top with the fight scenes (especially with the Crazy 88's) but it was still tolerable and full of surprises. Vol. 1 moved a lot better (as far as the story)and was far more entertaining.<br/><br/>Vol. 2 totally brought down Vol.1. Its hard to believe this is the continuation of Vol.1. There was entirely too much dialouge and QT tried to give us a better feel for the characters but it ended being very boring. I thought one of the best things about Bill in Vol. 1 was his mystery. We didn't know too much about him but we knew enough to know he was one bad mofo. In Vol. 2, all that went down the drain. He seemed very mild, vulnerable and not even capable of doing the things he did. Same thing with the Bride.<br/><br/>Also, Uma's character just didn't have the same drive she did in the first one. The list was now non-existent as well. Everything just seemed to be in slow motion as it was half way thru the movie and nothing had really happened except the Bride being buried underground.<br/><br/>This movie had its moments, (the tomb scene, Daryl's and Umas fight scene, and the training sequence) but other than that, the movie offered us flat dialogue. It seems like QT lost his touch for interesting and good dialogue because for the first time ever, i was bored during a QT film.<br/><br/>
Vol.1 was just so much fun and exciting. It had a good story and everything was perfectly paced. It seems like to me that QT had to compromise and added unnecessary dialogue and scenes to fill in time to be able to make this a complete film (time wise). I think he easily could've released this project as one movie by editing half of vol. 2."

Not only does this movie not enjoy the pace of the first, but it is downright boring!!  As I sat in the theater at the end of the film, I found myself trying way to hard to like it.   About 20 seconds or so later, I had to admit that I hated it.  It wasn't until I got home, however that I hit on the core reason I didn't like it.  I could have gotten past the fact that the storyline felt thrown together in a feeble attempt to bring it all together at the end.  I even could have gotten past Darryl Hannah's horrible overacting in both films.  In the end what I found unforgivable was that QT casts David Carradine, Mr. Kung Fu himself, and then doesn't let his character, Bill, survive for more than a couple of minutes.  I was looking forward to seeing a grand finale' of a fight scene with more of the same amazing wire work that was used in the first film. It was the most anticlimactic ending that could have possibly been conceived. How do you cast David Carradine and then not even have him in a decent fight scene.  The real pity of this film is that it ends up ruining the first one too.  Part of the appeal of VOL I is the cliffhanger ending.  But with no payoff in VOL II, who cares??"

","The movie-making career of Quentin Tarantino takes a turn for the worse following this pointless film. With successes like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction under his belt it's a wonder he didn't choose to retire a respected genius rather than filling our lives with this emptiness called Vol. 2. (It was actually called Vol. 2) Maybe it should be called Void 2 as when you try telling someone what this film was about you find yourself wondering more about what important knowledge was pushed aside in your brain for this inflated garbage to fill. OK enough of the initial insults (we'll come back to those) and on to the main points about why this is really bad. Firstly the story is a woman who kills people in revenge for her friend's own killings. There is nothing more about it to note and to be honest a donkey could understand what's happening. Usually these films get by on the sheer amount of violence, gore and special effects (eye candy). This however appeared to be an attempt at making a proper film. He failed. The violence was not there, but to replace it was a mere collection of flash-backs, undeveloped characters and uninventive killings diluted by a slow script where it seemed to take an age for a sentence to be completed. Maybe they made it through two-thirds of the script in the first one and had to tell the cast to talk slower or they wouldn't have a 'Vol.2'. The clip-show lasted two and a half hours and after about 90 minutes I was looking to my watch hoping for it to end soon (only to be bitterly disappointed). By the time 'Bill' started giving his superman speech I couldn't bear to listen because to be honest I really didn't care about Tarantino's comic-book revelations. In fact I'd heard that speech before somewhere like a lot of this film. One bit that had me amused was the part with the Chinese 'master' in martial arts who instructed whatever the main character was called (it just didn't seem important enough to know this in the grand story-line). Once again his character was a copy from another film but that didn't matter much as the OTT sword-fighting skills and silly beard stroking were enough even to make me laugh. It was a mere interlude before the exhausting second half. It drew to a close with a ridiculous fighting move that requires five steps for its death-inducing effect to kick in. I almost laughed at this but felt inclined to spare anyone caught up in this 'emotional moment'. The attempt to round up the film with an emotional ending was unbearable to watch and I didn't feel for her at all or bother to waste the energy to smile. The acting wasn't bad, which is some consolation for one of the worst and over-rated movies in recent times. To slate this film was to reboot my brain."

","When sequels are usually released, they are often rubbish, as they are merely cash-ins on the original's success and while they often suck, they usually aren't abysmally bad, ad they are more often lazy than anything else. Sadly, this is a case when the sequel to an already dreadful original is so bad, it makes the original look like a masterpiece by comparison.<br/><br/>The story is that The Bride is still on her bloody revenge, and is now after the head honcho, Bill. However, due to the many obstacles that get in her way, including Bill's bodyguards and the reunion with her daughter, will she be able to kill Bill? My problem with the story is that it is very badly written, from the constant plot holes (e.g. why does the Bride bring a sword with her everywhere she goes, despite facing potentially armed men), useless characters and even more pointless footage than last time. While it is nice to see her training montage or her wedding rehearsal before the massacre in theory, they serve to show things that either the audience already knows, or doesn't care to. Seriously, you could cut huge chunks out of both films, and lump them together as one, and it would be a better film because of it.<br/><br/>Another huge problem is the unsympathetic main character, as despite her understandable motivations for her revenge, she is a sadistic sociopath who kills because it gives her pleasure rather than for revenge, and who doesn't have any remorse for her victims, which (despite what some feminists might have believe) isn't a good role model for the young women potentially watching this movie. What makes this worse however is the fact that when she reunites with her daughter after so long, you don't feel any sympathy, as not only do you feel that she would be an awful mother to the child (something she even admits to by saying that she can never live a normal life), but considering that she killed a mother in front of her 4- year old daughter in the previous film, it is even harder to swallow. It doesn't help that her character is never fully developed either, which makes the film hard to watch as a result.<br/><br/>The main bad guy, Bill, is equally as dull, feeling constantly one- note throughout and gets rather boring because of it, despite David Carradine's great performance, and he often gets the movie's worst lines, including a theory that the Bride is a killer on the inside, and wears her more mature self as a disguise similar to Superman (because as we all know, people like soldiers are always destined to kill people, as they do it on the frontlines). One thing that is very annoying is that while some of the characters are completely pointless, they are the best ones in the film, in particular Michael Madsen's Bud, Gordon Liu's Samurai master or Deryl Hannah's Elle, who is easily the best thing about the film, as the character had the most personality, and Deryl's performance is both charismatic and sexy. You would wish the film was about them than some crazy sociopath, but that isn't the case, and sadly they are usually killed the quickest as well. The more personality you have in the film, the quicker you are killed. <br/><br/>The rest of the script is completely lacklustre as well, as outside of all the plot problems, the film's dialogue is overdone and often ridiculous. While Tarantino's unique style of dialogue may have worked in Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, here it is utterly inane, as unlike the aforementioned films, it isn't funny, quirky or essential to the story, leading to a lot of long winded pointless scenes that make the film feel a lot longer than it is. This story clearly didn't need two parts to tell it, and Tarantino should actually edit his films before he releases them. <br/><br/>It is also casually sadistic as well, as eyes are pulled out and stepped on, a man gets bitten by a snake over and over and a blind woman runs around screaming in agony. It feels very crass as a result, and you would wish Tarantino would grow up already. It also doesn't help that many of the film's major set pieces don't pay off, as they are either too brief or are interrupted by the boring story. This is especially true of the film's climax.<br/><br/>While there are some good elements in the film (good acting and great cinematography for example), overall it is utter crud. Whether it would be the awful writing, unsympathetic characters, sadism, overlong and pointless bits or the utter anticlimax, Kill Bill Vol 2 is an abysmal movie-making experience, that everyone should avoid at all costs in order to stop letting Tarantino's Samurai fan-fics get millions of dollars and well known actors behind it, and to teach him to make proper, grown-up films next time. Complete and utter garbage."

The flow of the movie is well-paced with the use of chapters, the movie gives you a sense of classical Japanese comics. The arrangement of chapters also allow events to be displaced in a sequential order rather than a chronological order.<br/><br/>There are many excellent quotes in the movie such as Kiddo's dialogs in the beginning of the movie showing her determination to ""Kill Bill"" and Bill's analogy of superman as to Kiddo as a natural born killer. In addition, the soundtracks of the movie is extraordinary. The soundtracks contains the element of western instruments and eastern melancholy tones, both effectively added suspension to the scenes. <br/><br/>My favorite scene of the movie is where Kiddo plucked out Elle's eyeballs, in particularly when she destroyed her eye by stepping on it recklessly. The is the scene which gives me the strongest emotional stimulation of how powerful revenges can be. <br/><br/>Furthermore, something i liked about vol 2 is where Kiddo's daughter comes into the scene. This gives a full explanation of why the whole massacre had happened. The scene where BB attempt to ""kill"" her mom with a toy gun, further reflects the nature of killing and life and death through the mind of an innocent and pure kid. After-all, is there any good reason for killing when even a child understands killing is not justifiable. This wraps everything well by bringing out people's regret and guilt after killing every single people!"
"tbills2","8","2","4","6 April 2014"," Kill Bill: Vol. 2
","Figuring out which Kill Bill is better is pretty tough. The 2nd may be. Quentin Tarantino strikes back with a vengeance in Kill Bill Vol. 2! The 2nd Kill Bill is entirely different from the 1st Kill Bill. Kill Bill 1 is action-filled and stylized at a fast pace. Kill Bill 2 is loaded with lengthy dialogue and suspenseful at a slow pace. Both volumes just so happen to be great. They're only different kinds of movies yet still one single movie. The 1st volume has the more centralized story with a more standard story progression while the 2nd volume has a more drifting story focus with a less standard developing story. Kill Bill: Vol. 1 isn't completely crafted as presentably well as Kill Bill: Vol. 2 but Kill Bill: Vol. 1 has way more substance to its story, while Kill Bill: Vol. 2 has less substance to its entire story but is presentably crafted better than Kill Bill: Vol. 1 but Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is also the more difficult movie to presentably craft completely because it has better material substance. The 1st Kill Bill has overwhelmingly more edited detail to the picture and story. The 2nd Kill Bill has a more complete technical value to the picture. Kill Bill 1 has more action sequences with exciting exaggerated effects. Kill Bill 2's action sequences are more naturally toned down. Kill Bill 1 keeps things generally on the surface. Bill 2 goes into more depth. Kill Bill 1 is better, but Kill Bill 2 is so close that it doesn't even matter, they're both great! I can say that Kill Bill 2 should have used more action dominant plot points and twists and turns; the movie feels to fail at impressing Vol. 1's adrenaline pumping action. Kill Bill: Vol. 2 does though have its fair share of seriously sick substance though! The moment when The Bride is captured and buried alive by Budd through to the moment when The Bride snatches Elle's eye out is all simply delicious cinema enjoyment! The beginning, before about Budd and the wedding chapel is very good, and the end, after about Bill and Beatrix Kiddo and B.B. is very good, but all of that middle, the middle about Budd and The Bride and Master Pai Mei and Elle Driver and the lonely grave of Paula Schultz and the cruel tutelage of Master Pai Mei and The Bride and Elle's sweet samurai sword fight in Budd's small little trailer is Kill Bill Vol. 2 at its most unstoppable best! Uma Thurman is unreal, my God! Daryl Hannah, David Carridine, Michael Madsen, Lucy Liu, and Vivica A. Fox makeup the Deadly Viper Assassin Squad, and they are amazing in it! Kill Bill 2 is sure great, but the way it chooses to steer away and try to expand upon The Bride's revenge on Bill main plot line is done admirably and interestingly and terrifically but pointlessly. It should of just stuck to the whole point of the matter, The Bride's revenge versus Bill, and delivered the goods like the 1st one did with an epic and over the top, action-intense, Quentin Tarantinoesque final showdown ending with Bill vs. The Bride! All that said, Quentin is the man, and I cannot wait for the 3rd Kill Bill because the 1st 2 Kill Bills are really, really awesome!!"
"donuthaters12","5","2","4","9 January 2014"," Needs A Rewrite To Correct It's Shortcomings
","Kill Bill Volume 2 is the continuation of The Bride's story in getting her revenge against Bill. I consider Kill Bill as one of Tarantino's weaker films, and Volume 2 is definitely a big reason why it's a letdown.<br/><br/>The film is written by Quentin Tarantino and what he has written here is much more dialogue and story heavy than the first volume. I enjoyed the first volume a lot more because it is much more fun and stylish, this second volume holds back much more of that in service to the story which wasn't all that great to begin with. Normally heading towards the end, a film with this story should be much more intense than the first half but that's not the case. The bulk of the build up of the climax is dull due to the underwhelming dialogue, though the pregnancy test sequence was hilarious. The climax itself would have been a great opportunity for Tarantino to write something spectacular and thrilling, yet it felt like Tarantino couldn't find some sort of vision of it and just wrote something that can be done swiftly. I know Tarantino can write because he has proved it with great dialogue-driven films like Pulp Fiction and Death Proof or mainstream action driven films like Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained. Kill Bill combines both aspects together and proved to be ineffective. The film's story isn't all bad with an interesting burial segment and a throwback to the old Kung-Fu Chinese films that had me smiling throughout.<br/><br/>Tarantino directs this film with a much more slower pace, in order to flesh out the story and gain more insight to it's characters. This film at times feels too safe for me, with moments that have characters just talking, which I don't mind if the dialogue was written better, leaving me feeling underwhelmed. Kill Bill as a whole's best moments are the segments that are over the top, violent and experimental. These experimental moments include the Pai Mei chapter, feeling like it was from a 1980's cheesy Kung Fu film. If Tarantino treated this half of the film like the first half then Kill Bill as a whole would have been an instant favorite of mine.<br/><br/>Robert Richardson comes back as the director of photography for this film and this time the scenes don't look as hyper stylised and overly saturated as the first volume. I do admire the fact that this film doesn't look the same the entire run of the film, with moments in black and white, changing the aspect ratio of the film, and using split screen to show two things at once. The Pai Mei sequence was shot in such a way that is similar to the old Asian Kung Fu films, with grainy photography and lacking in vibrancy in it's color. Though there are great moments in this volume's photography, I much prefer the style that was applied for the first volume.<br/><br/>RZA didn't come back to do the score for this film, which is odd as I liked what he did for the first volume. Instead Robert Rodriguez is credited for the music of the film, I am sure that he did the final song but I am not aware of any other moments in where he might have contributed. The film's music still follows that inspiration of Ennio Morricone, with some tracks actually written from him, and gives the film this Western feel to it. There are also moments where it uses Asian inspired music which works well with the tone of the film. The sound effects of this film is hilarious as they use the cheesy effects that are found on the films that this was inspired by. I wish that this film does retain that upbeat and fun soundtrack that fueled the first volume, but I guess that would be inappropriate judging by the events that unfolds during this film.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman as The Bride is still great but this time it seems the film demands more from her and she does a great job. She may seem less bad-ass here because vulnerabilities arise and there are times where she is outmatched by her opponent which we didn't see a lot from the first volume. I felt that Bill was a little dull because of the way Tarantino has written him, but David Carradine does the most he can with the character. Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen as Elle and Budd were fun to watch as they play characters that are classic Tarantino; fun, hilarious, and unpredictable. I wish Madsen were in much more entertaining films because he is a wonderful actor to watch. Gordon Liu as Pai Mei was definitely hilarious and written with such absurdity that anything that comes out his mouth is pure comedic gold or bad-ass.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Volume 2 is a bit of a disappointment in comparison to the first volume and the other films in the director's catalogue. If the film was fun like the first one, or at least written better then I would have liked this film a lot."
"charlessmith702210","9","2","4","5 May 2013"," A continuation of the avenging of a near-assassination attempt on the Bride
","It is good that Quentin Tarantino in the original Kill Bill (vol. 1) used flashbacks, especially the one about O-Ren Ishii's background. Now, in the sequel to this action movie, Beatrix Kiddo, who already had killed 2 assassins and went back home from her Japanese trip, is out to take out 2 more in Kill Bill Vol. 2, because the assassination squad was a quartet of 4 killers. Flashbacks in vol. 2 are almost as similar in number as Vol. 1. One flashback focuses on the squad entering the church--then you hear the machine gun fire, but you don't see what happens. Why? Tarantino did not want to have a cliché of the assassination of the 9 innocent victims of the wedding party...so focus was on an exterior shot, not interior because the give-away of the assassination squad church killing already had happened in Vol. 1.<br/><br/>There are several new things that should point out during this sequel.<br/><br/>Pai Mei was something like a drill instructor in Shaolin kung-fu when he subjected Beatrix to the difficult martial art. So there is an allusion to the ""Mortal Kombat"" movie that featured an almost similar Shaolin monk character...and some of the other Chinese martial art flicks of the B-variety, especially in the Bruce Lee era.<br/><br/>And then, there was Budd's house. Elle, who is a cross between a pirate and a secretary, comes in with the mob payment to Budd for the burying alive of Beatrix Kiddo..a treasure chest of, I guess, $250,000 in cash. But an ugly surprise came as Budd was going deep into that cash in the box...a black mamba snake bolts out and bites Budd about several times. Budd then tries to fight back at Elle but the venom from the bites quickly do its work and he collapses. Budd slowly falls to his death as Elle explains the facts about the black mamba--which could remind one person about the king cobra snake, which can be as deadly in its bites as the former mamba. So basically, Elle killed Budd so she can run off with the mob money. Then, as Elle calls Bill to lie about Budd's death, saying that it was an accident--Beatrix rushes into Budd's compound and it is a duel to the death--a cat fight filled with martial arts moves. The last part of the fight is in 2 stages. Stage 1 is the flashback where Elle mentions why she killed master Pai Mei..she poisoned the fish that Pai ate, and also--because Pai Mei slashed one of Elle's eyes with his sword. Then Stage 2 comes in, and with Beatrix saying to Elle, ""You have no future"", the final fight is now with samurai swords...but the fight was brief, Beatrix stops Elle's sword with a holding defense...and targeting Elle's remaining good eye, executes a very fast chicken-beak move (likely inspired by Pai Mei), pulling out that eye and rendering Elle completely blind as she goes crazy, haphazardly destroying things around the house. To add to the insult, she crushes Elle's pulled good eye with her foot, and she even manages to tame the black mamba's provoking stance so that the snake would not bite her...as she leaves Budd's house for good. Elle doesn't die but to Beatrix, the eye take-out is almost like what death looks like, so Beatrix does her job...she did not need to further finish off Elle.<br/><br/>The final conflict in Bill's mansion was something. Just before the vital point coup-de-grace strike on Bill's heart (which would be called ""kyushu"" in kyokushin karate), the setup for this was several gauntlets that Beatrix had to go through. One of them was Bill's pistol, and then a surprise pistol shot with a truth serum dart that went right in one of Beatrix's legs. Fortunately that serum did not kill her as Bill interrogates her, and finally, Bill lets him take out the truth serum dart. Then, Bill tells Beatrix by verbal intimidation that because she did not kill her child, she will be sentenced to death by Bill himself. Then after a brief samurai sword fight--this set-up that 5-point Pai Mei strike. Bill falls to the lawn and dies after Beatrix's last words to him...""You look ready."" Once Bill was gone, I knew that Beatrix's death wishes were in the books...the 4 assassins have all gone to heaven, and Beatrix's baby, B.B., a toddler, is now the new inspiration for Beatrix to get her life back to normal."

","The second part starts just after the first and I watched the films continuously so it kind of kept me more involved than anything else. Well whatever this second part was also very great but I felt at some points that it lacked the amount of interest that was present in the first part. If I do not compare it in any sense with the first one then I am sure this one stands alone with a different reputation. May be because in this part they focused on the back story and lacked the energy which was going on continuously in the first film. But no complains what so ever. I am just comparing till now. Otherwise this film is also a master piece in its own sense. Things are shown in such realities that I at some point of time was thinking like oh please do not do this way or that. You will find things messed up a lot. All things aside, you will never feel bored at any time.<br/><br/>""A must watch obviously if you have seen the first part."""
"nickmesafilms","9","2","4","7 May 2012"," Kill Bill: Vol.2 (2004) - Kill Bill Vol.1 + Kill Bill Vol.2 = A 4-Hour Long Movie!
","Released several months apart from the first installment of the Kill Bill series, ""Kill Bill: Vol.2"" is the continuation of the avenging adventures of Uma Thurman's ""the Bride"", still seeking revenge on David Carradine's Bill, and his gang. Since the first movie focused more on tributes to martial arts and Hong Kong motion pictures, the second movie focuses more on long scenes of dialouge between characters, and it's known for it's stylish directing from Quentin Tarantino. Thurman once again delivers another fine performance, reprising her role as ""the Bride"" from Vol.1. In Vol.2, she's more focused on trying to get out of sticky situations, to make sure that her enemies get what they deserve. Although Vol.1 was more enjoyable, Vol.2 helps bring everything to a close, with an ending that's better to be left unspoiled. But, there were some scenes that dragged off from it's place, and there were some times where I got uninterested. But overall, this is an expertly made homage that only Tarantino can make. In his short scenes, the late great David Carradine delivers a beautiful performance as Bill. You see him as a nice man on the outside, at first, but you can easily tell that he's a monster on the inside. It's a real damn shame that David Carradine passed away, years after the first two movies were released. These movies really showed what a superstar he really was. Although the first volume of the story was my favorite of the two movies, Volume 2 doesn't disappoint. This is a well-made, and somewhat enjoyable that deserves all the praise necessary. Beautifully directed, acted, written, shot, edited, and paced. ""Kill Bill: Vol.2"", in my review, ""expertly portrayed, a thrilling Tarantino feature""."
"Steffi_P","10","2","4","7 May 2012"," ""Beyond your years""
","The exploitation movie – that branch of cheap and violent movies that includes Spaghetti Westerns, Kung Fu, zombie horrors and many other subgenres – has rarely run to epics. These were bottom-line products, made at low cost for (supposedly) unsophisticated audiences, and usually clocked in around the 80 minutes mark. Grand, overarching themes were rarely explored, and the main goal for the filmmakers was generally a high body count and maybe a bit of sex. With Kill Bill however Quentin Tarantino creates a grand, sweeping homage, the exploitation movie to end all exploitation movies, a two-part meditation on the very nature of revenge and killing.<br/><br/>As with its predecessor, Volume 2 is a patchwork of references to Tarantino's favourite pictures. This time round he is, if anything, even more flagrant in his referentialism. The flashback at the start of the picture features some rhythmic cross-cutting between close-ups like one of Sergio Leone's early features (notable exceptions as exploitation epics). Then there's a Kung Fu segment which mimics not only the clichés of Hong Kong cinema but also the style of humour and overused zoom lens. Is it theft? Not really. It's channelling the influences in the way one might reshape Romeo and Juliet or La Dame aux Camelias into some other work.<br/><br/>Tarantino doesn't just borrow the motifs and camera-work of his cinematic forebears, he also encourages the eerie, taciturn acting that characterised Leone's pictures. Uma Thurman's range broadens even more here. It's amazing the way she is able to portray Kiddo as a tough fighter while still retaining her sensitivity. David Carradine is at his best here in the title role, a model of seductive evil, credible as both the killer and the kind lover and father.<br/><br/>And really these two dual-natured performances characterise something that is fundamental to Kill Bill. It's a movie about killing, and one that does not shy away from the sensationalist violence of the exploitation flick, but it is also a movie with a lot of heart and humanity. With volume 2 it becomes clear why volume 1 began with the business over Vernita Green's daughter. It becomes clear why Bill cancelled the hospital hit on Beatrix at the last minute. This is a movie about love as much as hate. Kill Bill is an emotionally mature and intelligent work, while still having that delightful playfulness and comic book mythology. A sincere and worthy tribute to a tawdry yet beloved part of cinematic history."
"rmax304823","6","2","4","26 April 2012"," A Long Trail That Has No Turning.
","""Pulp Fiction"" struck me as a haphazard masterpiece of originality. The incongruity was startling -- Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames tied up in a basement, their mouth stuffed with Japanese S/M balls, and an old Turkish pop song clanging away loudly in the background. And, wow, did ""Pulp Fiction"" have style of a particularly visual sort. It was hard to care who lived or died except that it's usually better when characters survive.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill, Vol. 2,"" is an extended revenge story full of twists, pain, and blood. In this one, I cared chiefly that the heroine, Uma Thurman, would survive. Who could not? The gangly all-encompassing limbs. The long monkey feet. The bent nose. The plumbless blue depths of those irises as they peer at us out of a face spattered with gore.<br/><br/>But this is a triumph of visuals in which the characters and actions are stylized almost out of existence. People strike odd poses and speak deliberately, relishing each syllable. The amazing thing is that despite the abstraction of style and its fragile roots in reality Tarantino manages to get moments of genuine excitement and terror out of the story. It makes you not want to be buried alive.<br/><br/>The highlight comes when two blond babes -- Thurman and Darryl Hannah -- face one another with and without expensive Japanese Hondo swords. The camera zooms in and out in a frenzy, sometimes with only a single eyeball as its focus, while the air inside a shack is filled with flying kicks and flashing steel, of a like never before seen by any human being except those who have known my ex wife. I'll tell you, this scene alone left me panting and exhausted.<br/><br/>But for all the flash, it's more a fantasy than anything else, only one or two steps away from a kid's cartoon or a computer war game. I got some of the in jokes and allusions, I think, but the imagery becomes tiresome after a while. It all prompted me to with that everyone had sat down for an hour or two with a couple of bottles of Dos Equis and simply, I don't know, taken a breather."
"Tweekums","8","2","4","16 January 2012"," The blood-spattered bride finally meets Bill
","After the almost non-stop action of volume one some people may be disappointed at the much slower pace of this film. The story opens with The Bride driving to her final Rendezvous with Bill and she announces that he is the last one left on her list. We then return to see what happened to Budd and Elle. Surprisingly this doesn't stop these confrontations from being intense... particularly the former where she finds herself facing almost certain death in a scene which is likely to disturb anybody who suffers from claustrophobia! At this point the story jumps back even further in time to the point where The Bride is in training with Pai Mei, an elderly kung-fu master; this explains how she can escape and ultimately what she will do when she meets Bill. While she was trapped Elle has killed Budd who had informed her that The Bride was dead; she learns that he was mistaken very shortly afterwards they clash Hattori Hanzo swords. Once Elle is out of the way it is time for The Bride to visit Bill and when she does she has a surprise; her daughter is still alive! Will this affect her plans or will she spare her daughter's father? <br/><br/>I preferred Volume One but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy this too; it was good to learn a bit more about The Bride's past and find out just what she had done to make Bill angry enough to shoot her in the head. The scenes between David Carradine and Uma Thurman were brilliant; this was largely down to Carradine's voice, some how he managed to sound totally calm yet still be menacing. After the spectacular conclusion to volume one the final confrontation here seemed less than spectacular although this did make sense; Bill wasn't going to hide behind henchmen and his words were more important than his actions. As one would expect from a Tarantino film the music, much of it inspired by spaghetti westerns, went well with the action and as with volume one the style of the filming changed to suit the scene. For the most part I found the story exciting but I could have done without the scene where The Bride meets Bill's father figure; it slowed the story down at precisely the moment it needed to speed up and get her together with Bill. Over all though I recommend this film to anybody who liked the first part; although I'm sure there aren't many people left who liked the first and still haven't got around to watching this!"

","Kill Bill Volume 2 is the second of two volumes that were theatrically released several months apart. Kill Bill was originally scheduled for a single theatrical release, but with a running time of over four hours, it was separated into two volumes. Kill Bill Volume 1 was released in late 2003, and Kill Bill: Volume 2 was released in early 2004.It was an action thriller that stars that stars Uma Thurman as The Bride together with David Carradine as Bill,Lucy Liu,Vivica A. Fox,Michael Madsen,Daryl Hannah and Gordon Liu. The story continues to follow a character known as ""The Bride"", a former assassin who seeks revenge on still-active colleagues who massacre members of her wedding party and try to kill her.It was written and directed by Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Volume 2 continues the saga of The Bride in her revenge after having dispatched several of her arch-enemies in the first film,Kill Bill Volume 1.In a flashback, the Bride and her groom rehearse their wedding. Bill arrives, and it is revealed that The Bride has retired from assassination and left her former lover Bill in order to settle down with her unborn daughter. Moments later, the Deadly Vipers attack on Bill's orders.In the present, Bill warns his brother Budd, a bouncer and former Deadly Viper, that he will be targeted next. The Bride arrives at his trailer, but Budd shoots her full of rock salt with his double-barreled shotgun and then sedates her. Budd calls Elle, offering to sell her The Bride's Hanzō sword, before sealing The Bride inside a coffin and burying her alive.In a flashback, Bill takes The Bride to the temple of Pai Mei,a legendary martial arts master. Pai Mei has mastered a technique wherein pressure points on the victim's chest are struck, leaving them with only a few footsteps before their death. Bill informs The Bride that Pai Mei teaches no one the technique. After she trains under Pai Mei, who initially dislikes her, she eventually wins his respect.The Bride recalls her training with Pai Mei to break out of the coffin to the surface. The next morning, Elle arrives at Budd's trailer for their transaction. Budd is betrayed by Elle, who uses a black mamba and its venomous bite to poison him. Elle expresses regret that a loser like Budd was the one to kill The Bride, whose name is revealed to be Beatrix Kiddo. As Elle leaves the trailer, she is attacked by The Bride. Elle reveals that her missing eye was plucked out by Pai Mei after she insulted him during her training, and in retribution, she poisoned him. Angered, The Bride plucks out Elle's remaining eye, and leaves Elle writhing and screaming hysterically in the trailer with the black mamba. After finding Bill's location, deep in the Mexican countryside, The Bride infiltrates his home. She is shocked to find B.B., her four-year old daughter, alive and well. The family spend the evening together peacefully, with Bill making sandwiches and Beatrix watching Shogun Assassin in bed with her daughter. Later on, after B.B. has gone to bed, Bill shoots Beatrix with a dart containing a truth serum and questions her. A flashback recalls the moment Beatrix found out she was pregnant. She was on an assignment, and her target had sent an assassin of her own to kill Beatrix. Beatrix managed to convince the assassin not to kill her due to her pregnancy, and they agreed to part ways. Beatrix explains that she ran away without telling Bill in order to protect their unborn daughter from him and his life. Though Bill understands, he remains unapologetic for what he did, explaining that he's a killer and nobody should ever cross him, even her. Bill then attacks Beatrix, but she disables him with Pai Mei's fatal technique, which he secretly taught her. Bill, aware of the technique, gives his final speech, takes five steps, and dies. Beatrix departs with B.B. in her arms, and later they watch cartoons in a hotel together.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Volume 2 has more dialogue and less action-packed than the fist film but nevertheless, delivers the goods for those expecting a satisfying conclusion.But still,the film is the epitome of the glamorization of brutality and violence and the same time tries to condemn it as well.Also,deeper themes are explored such as pregnancy and motherhood.<br/><br/>Overall,Kill Bill Volume 2 is wildly entertaining and smart that are full of genre-loving savvy, grind-house vigor and liberating energies."
"classicsoncall","10","2","4","1 October 2011"," ""I am gonna kill Bill"".
","There's probably no better mission statement for a picture's leading character than the one uttered by Uma Thurman in the opening scene - ""I am gonna kill Bill"". From there, the story takes us back to the wedding rehearsal at Two Pines, and introduces us to the title character who never even showed up for the first installment except by his off screen presence, and the violence directed at his former Kiddo. Thinking about it now, that was a clever ploy used by director Tarantino. I recall being a bit disappointed that there was no Bill in Volume I when I first saw the picture, but now it comes across as more effective story telling. Of the two films, I prefer this second installment. The over the top violence of the first movie is a take it or leave it sort of proposition for me, it's not the first thing I'm looking for when I go in for a story like this. I'd much rather get into the character development and the motivations for why characters respond the way they do.<br/><br/>It's clear that director Tarantino has a genuine affection for the genres he parodies here - Seventies martial arts flicks, spaghetti Westerns and comic book super-heroes. Bill's (David Carradine) monologue on Superman's identity and alter-ego seemed to come out of nowhere, but perfectly described the dichotomy of Beatrice Kiddo's character - an assassin with no more skin in the game after learning she was pregnant. It also revealed how coldly brutal Bill could be, unwilling to let go of the past to seek a personal revenge on a former lover. There's never a question over who's the more sympathetic character, even after the introduction of four year old B.B. Speaking of which, it became a nagging question to me how Bill would have been able to raise her after the Twin Pines Massacre. There might be the germ of a good sequel in there somewhere.<br/><br/>The picture has more than it's share of surprises. Recalling that The Bride spent four years in a coma, it was shocking to imagine that she would also be buried alive, initially outsmarted by Bill's brother Budd (Michael Madsen). Her return trip to Budd's trailer home gave us that well choreographed, splendidly awesome fight scene against Elle, the California Mountain Snake (Darryl Hannah). It's one of the action highlights of the picture, and you'll definitely want to keep an eye out for it. Of course, the entire Pai Mei training sequence was a trip, with Gordon Liu paying homage to all the Grand Masters of every martial arts film ever made, punctuated by a symbolic 'whoosh' every time he stroked his snow white beard.<br/><br/>In summary, if you like Tarantino's straight come at you style, there's a lot to enjoy with the Kill Bill films. They're stylish, colorful, action packed and violent, and if the characters are more caricature than real, that's OK too, because they were meant to be. Recommended for a unique viewing experience."

","Kill Bill vol.2 is the second part of the epic called Kill Bill and starts from the point the first volume ended,with the bride driving to Bill in order to kill him and get her revenge without knowing that the baby that she had in her belly didn't die despite the fact that she was shot in the head,fact that comes in the surface in the end of the first volume.At the same time Bill(David Carradine) and his brother Budd(Michael Madsen)are discussing about the bride's coming in order to kill them.A long flashback ensues and we are going back in the place where the whole revenge thing started.The bride is revealing that it wasn't a wedding but a wedding rehearsal,while we are watching the scene when the Viper squad killed everyone in the chapel after the brief conversation Bill and the Bride had.After the flashback we see the bride attempting to kill Bill's brother Budd who is by the way a drunk-ass loser working as a bouncer in a cheap strip club.Unfortunately she fails and gets her body shot by a shotgun and in a weird attempt of Budd to kill her and make her suffer he buries her alive.After that we have a second flashback and we see the bride's extremely hard training with the Kung Fu Master Pai Mei.After the flashback the bride is escaping form her casket and goes after Budd once again.In the meanwhile Budd and the bride's worst enemy Elle Driver are making a deal considering the bride's katana.In a twist of fate the movie's ultimate villain kills Budd with her snake but after that comes face to face with the bride in an epic fight where the bride triumphs over Elle in a quite gory moment leaving her blind,but having found out that Elle had killed Pai Mei.Then she finds Esteban Vihaio,Bill's first fathering image or whatever they call it,giving her Bill's location.The following scenes are quite sad.The Bride finds Bill but not alone.Bill is with their child,the one that as i outlined above wasn't dead.After some touching scenes we are learning the reasons why the bride left Bill and in the end Beatrix Kiddo(The bride's real name) kills Bill with a move called ""Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique"" that Pai Mei learned her while training her.<br/><br/>To sum up Quenitin Tarantino's Kill Bill is a single movie divided into two parts.The first part is violent,gory and bloody while the second part is violent too but has more dialog and emotion.The first part is a homage to the 70's Hong Kong Kung Fu movies while the second part is a homage to Spaghetti Westerns.To cut the long story short,Kill Bill is one of the best movies of all time and gets very close to Pulp Fiction's greatness.Thank you Quentin Tarantino,you are the Godfather of today's b-movies."
"joshi_3592","10","2","4","9 July 2010"," It actually makes the first film seem bad in comparison (not that it's bad, but you know what I mean)
","I can't believe some people said that this was worse than Kill Bill volume 1. This is honestly much better than the first film. It actually makes the first film seem bad in comparison, not that it is bad but you know what mean. Kill Bill volume one was great. It had a few moment that I didn't like but it was anything but bad. Kill Bill volume 2 hits the spot perfectly. It really summarizes most, if not everything that I look for in a ""good"" movie. It has cliché's, but that's the point. And they're played out excellently. It has that campy feel to it, a common trade in Tarantino's films. It even has a few 70's kung-fu moments which I just loved seeing. I admire Tarantinos love for classic cinema (or retro might be a better word). This movie unlike the first one has a few funny moments, but still manage to stay serious. And I mean that, it is a serious film. but then again, what revenge movie isn't. And I must say I really loved the ending. It surprised me as well, which is a rare thing to happen. I was sort of moved, or at least intrigued by the ending, and for that I am very happy, because that is such a rare thing.<br/><br/>So why is it better than Kill Bill volume 1? Well, I'll it's longer, hence manage to build up a better and more variable story. Secondly, I like the character better,a nd we finally get to see Bill. So I must say, Kill Bill volume 1 serve as an introduction, so Kil Bill volume 1 is what makes Kill Bill volume 2 so much better, because now we know what's going one. And third, if you for any reason should have read my review for Kill Bill volume 1, you would know that I criticized it's violence. I'm not against violence in any way, in fact it is important in many films. This is one of them. Unlike Kill Bill volume 1, Kill Bill volume 2 is not focused on the violence, butt he story. The violence supports the story, not the other way around. I understand Tarantino was trying to make a kind of anime live-action movie, interesting idea, but I felt it was over the top. Think bad of me if you wan't. But this movie, ditch that idea, and I could enjoy the movie, and even it's more violent scenes.<br/><br/>So what more can I say? I finished the Kill Bill volume 1 review by saying I'm looking forward to Kill Bill volume 2. Well I love this film. it should be considered a cinematic masterpiece, and is probably already a classic. 10/10."
"gigan-92","9","2","4","24 March 2010"," The Incredible Climax!!
","The story continues!! Having already defeated two of her five targets, Uma Thurman now focuses on Bill, a man whom we have yet a great deal to know. This film dives ever deeper into The Bride's past, including her estranged relationship with Bill and the shocking revelations that were hinted at the end of Volume I. This film is much less centered on the action itself but instead the relationships between these characters. I believe this works rather well considering the first piece was a gruesome thrill ride, and this one slows it down just a bit. Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah are among her final opponents, and both could get a lot more development in this film. Tarantino still pays tribute to Japanese and Hong Kong action films, but this too is tone down. And for all the build up there are still some well-served fight sequences.<br/><br/>Near the climax there is a showdown of a different kind between Bill and the Bride. By now we know her real name, but I'd rather not reveal it to those who have yet to see it. It's not just a battle of martial arts and swords, or even a literal battle of vengeance. Whoever takes victory this time will also decide the fate of the child, The Bride's daughter. Such an emotional fascade surely will entertain watchers even more so than any action scene. I know it did for me."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","10","2","4","23 June 2009"," Exactly as it should be
","After the first showed us what an efficient killer The Bride was, this provides the background that makes it all matter, and gives her a human face. If you only watch the former, you may walk away thinking that it was nothing more than a revenge flick, if an excellent one at that. You may believe that the characters were thought up for the sake of the retribution. It is, in fact, the vengeance that helps complete, and provide satisfaction, for the overall story-line. I can imagine people being disappointed by this... the first had non-stop action, and to the undistinguishing eye may have looked almost ""mainstream"", and perhaps they thought that Tarantino had changed his tune. This is not the same as Vol. 1, and it shouldn't be. There were incredible martial arts in that, and while what there is of that is, again, amazing, there is considerably less of it. The style of wuxia with some Western added in is still very much present. This is quite emotionally straining. I can understand if there are those who would go so far as to call it outright abusive to the audience. It definitely is brutal, and unforgettable. The non-linear time-line is impeccably well-used here. I can't compliment the editing and cinematography enough. The writing is beyond reproach. All of the dialog is marvelous. The acting is spot-on, every single person. This is immensely well-scored by Rodriguez. There is no direct sexuality, only references. The violence is bloody and gory. There is plenty of strong language in this. This has disturbing content, and many are not going to be able to stand it. The DVD comes with a making-of featurette upwards of half-hour in length, a trailer for each of the director's movies, including these two, a deleted fight scene of three and a half minutes, and an eleven minute music performance by Robert and his band, Chingon. All of them are worth the time. I recommend this to any fan of Quentin's, Uma's or of film-making. 10/10"
"Jonny_Numb","8","2","4","15 June 2008"," Killing us softly with his song
","SPOILERS (only for those who have not seen Vol. 1) <br/><br/>At the time of its theatrical release, ""Kill Bill, Vol. 2"" was something I probably wouldn't have bothered to see (due to my own dim appraisal of the previous installment), if it hadn't been for two friends who persuaded me otherwise on a lazy Sunday afternoon. I was actually impressed with how much I liked the concluding part, and now that I've viewed both films twice, Vol. 2 feels that much stronger.<br/><br/>To recap: The Bride (a convincingly bad-ass Uma Thurman), the sole survivor of a wedding-chapel massacre carried out by the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (led by David Carradine's Bill), awakens from a four-year coma to find her unborn child gone (assumed miscarried), and vows vengeance on those responsible for the massacre (should I mention that The Bride was formerly Bill's top assassin?). She has successfully slain Vernita Green aka ""Copperhead"" (Vivica A. Fox) and O-Ren Ishii aka ""Cottonmouth"" (Lucy Liu)along with dozens of henchmenby the time we meet up with her in Vol. 2.<br/><br/>What I still find most admirable about this closing installment is (again) how Tarantino subverts audience expectations. Vol. 1 met its peak in a complicated, visually spellbinding scene where The Bride takes on The Crazy 88s (a gang consisting of dozens of black-masked assassins) in a multi-level Japanese restaurant. One would expect the denouement of Vol. 2 to consist of many scenes as potent and intense, right? Well, that ""literary quality"" I praised in my review of Vol. 1 comes on even stronger in the last half, allowing dialog and backstory to fill in plot-gaps and further develop the trio of central baddiesBudd (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), and Bill (David Carradine)who were little more than ciphers before.<br/><br/>Tarantino develops an intimacy among this quartet, consisting of double-crosses, broken bonds, and revealed secrets that strengthens the story as a whole. And it surprised me how Tarantino's development sheds the skin of homage and irony that punctuated Vol. 1, venturing into territory that carries a genuine emotional impact without downplaying the cost of human life. Death's sting is very much felt here, and you may be blind-sided at how moving it is. And the film's most understated gagthat Bill is really just a jilted lover acting out of extreme jealousycarries an unexpected honesty that enriches the layers of his character.<br/><br/>Don't get the wrong ideathere is still a formidable amount of impressive action on display, including a brutal flashback wherein The Bride is trained under the ""cruel tutelage"" of a martial-arts existentialist by the name of Pai Mei, and an incredible sequence where The Bride and Elle have a showdown inside the narrow walls of a trailerbut Tarantino seems more interested in tying all the threads of plot up into a satisfying package, at which he is pretty damn successful. The long-mooted ""showdown"" between The Bride and Bill is drawn-out and surprising, though the final result (baldly announced in the film's title) carries an effect contrary to what most will expect.<br/><br/>Both movies combined, ""Kill Bill"" is a superior entertainmentquite possibly the best cinematic offering Tarantino has given us to date."
"psyran-1","Null","2","4","6 January 2008"," Idiotic dialog of Kill Bill Vol. II
","Since Quentin Tarantino is now an established motion picture director, it seems that he can now get away with just about ANYTHING! Witness the mind-numbing, jaw-dropping moronic dialog between John Carradine and Uma Thurman at the end of Kill Bill Volume II: <br/><br/>Carradine (after being given a death blow by Thurman): Pai-Mei taught you the five-point-palm exploding heart technique! Why didn't you tell me?<br/><br/>Thurman: I don't know. I guess I'm just a bad person.<br/><br/>Carradine: No, you're not a bad person. You're a g-g-g-g-good person.<br/><br/>Does Tarantino PURPOSELY write such hackneyed dialog or is he just merely verbally challenged?"
"egypttigerlily","10","2","4","7 November 2007"," Beautifully Done Sequel
","QT does it again! This movie is much more awesome than anything else he has done, which just means he's getting better and better with time. The first film is the questions, and this one is the answers. We learn her real name and learn about her as a person. You also get acquainted with Elle Driver, played by Daryl Hannah and her evil character blew me away because I remember her as that sweet mermaid from Splash. The entire cast was great, and the cinematography was beautifully done, because it wasn't as cartoonish as the last one and focused less on gory violence and more on dialogue, Tarantino's best talent. My personal favorite part is the Superman speech from Bill. All in all, a great film and I never get sick of them."
"morc-4","10","2","4","25 August 2007"," Best Tarantino Film
","Yes.. I know many of you will disagree and claim that Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs is the best QT film. But as I did, you will also grow up and see the splendour that is this film.<br/><br/>I first saw this movie 3 years ago and found it quite boring, actually. I thought that Kill Bill 1 was better and had more fighting in it. Now 3 years later, I just watched them again and I can't believe how unobservant I was back then. This time, I could see 1000 things more than I could 3 years ago. This is not only about violence, but also about the sheer beauty of atmosphere and dialogue.<br/><br/>Tarantino has topped his career with volume 2 of Kill Bill. The atmospheres he captures in this film is among the best I have ever experienced. The music and sound is the best in a movie since Pulp Fiction. The dialogue, especially with David Carradine is so sophisticated, that I demand an Oscar for Carradine for the way he carries that out. Sitting in front of the fireplace playing his flute and telling stories. Surprising Uma with her child and charming her and being so cool about every situation always coming up with brilliant lines. Bravo! A guy I didn't even know existed, made me shiver with his performance and he does it just as good as David Carradine. Kill Bills ""father"" played by Michael Parks delivers one of the best performances, I have ever witnessed. He plays some 80 years old Mexican-American whorehouse manager far out in nowhere whom Uma Thurman drives to see to get to know where Bill is. An Oscar to Michael Parks would have been in it's place. He is so slick and disgusting and I don't know what it is he does with his face, but it is genius! That calmness of his voice. A Don Juan and with an accent and a way of speaking, that I have never seen before. Wow! Michael Parks also plays the father of the two cops we see in kill bill one in the church, and I liked him very much in that part as well.<br/><br/>David Carradine deserves an Oscar for his role as the boss Bill. He is so great and sophisticated, so well articulate and cultivated, so charming that you almost get to like him. But you can always see through him and you know that he is an evil soab and you are never sure where you've got him. You are never sure, if he really has good intentions. Remember to see the deleted scene on the DVD! Here you get to see him fight. You don't in the real film.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman is also extremely brilliant in this movie. In the scene, where she is at the wedding rehearsal and meets Bill outside of the church, I could read her mind. An expression tells more than a thousand words.<br/><br/>Michael Madsen and Darryl Hannah have great roles as well and carries them out beautifully.<br/><br/>The last character I would like to mention who contributes to making this film as great as it is, is Pai Mei played by Gordon Liu. He is the comic relief of the film and he does an excellent job as the mysterious supernatural Chinese mentor far out in the jungle. He actually also plays Johnny Mo in Kill Bill 1! I could go on and on.. The bottom line is, that every word spoken in this film and how it is carried out has been put thought into. If you like great acting, you have to see this film. If you love great fighting scenes, you should see it as well as they are totally amazing. All of them.<br/><br/>10/10"

Then again, why do we see films. To be entertained. QT knows how to entertain and this is no different.<br/><br/>Kill Bill 2 is a thrilling experience a wonderful contrast to the first part; this is a calmer more philosophical film rather than a violent, vulgar and graphic first part.

"ratchpick","10","2","4","2 April 2007"," Amazing
","There is something amazing with every Quentin Tarantino film. He is a god of film-making- his style sticks out like a sore thumb. From the opening monologue exchanged between Bill and the bride to Bill's final steps, you can feel Tarantino's power surge through your head. Some call Tarantino a pervert. Yes, he has a thing for excessive violence and sex in his movies, but that's why they are so amazing. He can put incredible amounts of exploitation in his films (even though this film isn't too violent) yet, when he mixes it with dialogue from heaven, can create a powerhouse. This is is greatest achievement in this category. Yes, most of the technology is corny, but that's why it is so freaking awesome. It's supposed to be that way, and that way is the best way anyone can do a movie of this type. Kill Bill is one of the best movies I have seen in my life."
"duhumocvari","10","2","4","4 February 2007"," excellent
","Of the original ""Kill Bill,"" I wrote: ""The movie is all storytelling and no story. The motivations have no psychological depth or resonance, but are simply plot markers. The characters consist of their characteristics."" True, but one of the achievements of ""Vol. 2"" is that the story is filled in, the characters are developed, and they do begin to resonate, especially during the extraordinary final meeting between The Bride and Bill  which consists not of nonstop action but of more hypnotic dialogue and ends in an event that is like a quiet, deadly punch line.<br/><br/>Put the two parts together, and Tarantino has made a masterful saga that celebrates the martial arts genre while kidding it, loving it, and transcending it. I confess I feared that ""Vol. 2"" would be like those sequels that lack the intensity of the original."
"wereuat06-1","9","2","4","11 December 2006"," Inspired by The Good The bad and The Ugly
","This is a movie that you cannot stop watching due to the martial arts, effects, and action. The music is portrayed beautiful in a great manner. This movie reminds just of Good the Bad and the Ugly. The music all the action sequences, the hardcore attitude, and the great storyline that proceeds to it as it all goes together to perfection. Tarentino being a fan of martial arts knew exactly what he was doing from the beginning. Uma Thurman played her part perfect with the emotion and sensitivity. David Carradine played his part perfect as the assassin who wanted to kill her but still cared about her and wanted her to be a warrior and even better then him. I found this movie very enjoyable a typical Tarentino movie, he hit another one rite on the point. I give this movie a 9 out of 10. A great martial arts movie."
"whpratt1","10","2","4","19 September 2006"," Bill Vol. 2 was Outstanding
","Enjoyed Bill Vol. 1, however, this film went back to the same characters and gave more of a history into the Bride and how she learned all the secret powers of becoming a super killer in order to get revenge from all the people who harmed her. Uma Thurman gave an outstanding performance when she is being taught by a very old wise teacher of defense and some very important deadly parts of the body which can destroy a person even if they are almost sitting on top of you, face to face or nose to nose. Uma Thurman did a great job of sword swinging and got herself out of almost impossible situations, like being buried alive and many other horrible situations. David Carradine,(Bill) had a larger role in this film and showed his great acting abilities, just like his father John Carradine, ""Dracula '40 and ""House of Frankenstein) This is a film you can watch from the beginning to the end and enjoy every minute of great entertainment by all the actors."

","First of all, let me just say, it's pointless to argue about which 'volume' of Kill Bill is better, as it is intended to be seen as one movie anyway However, that said, Volume two is the superior of the two films. To put it in grading terms, volume one is an A+ and volume two is an A++.<br/><br/>The dialog is awesome, the characters,especially Pei Mei and Bill, are awesome. Every line of this movie is brilliant and every actor is brilliant, right down to Larry and Rocket in the strip club.<br/><br/>And The Superman Speech is the greatest moment in cinema EVER. EVER. No question."
"perfect_paradisiac","9","2","4","5 August 2006"," Tarantino's Return to the Art of Dialogue
","The two things that Quentin Tarantino specialize in are action and dialogue. While Kill Bill Volume 1 had more than enough action to quell any action fan's hunger, Kill Bill Volume 2 is more dialogue based. In comparison to Kill Bill Volume 1, the story is slower, the events that take place happen much slower, and much more dialogue occurs throughout. (Although, Kill Bill Volume 2 does have its fair share of action, i.e. The Bride's confrontation with California Mountain Snake).<br/><br/>The true beauty of this movie, like the first, is Tarantino's masterful blending of several film genres, (predominantly spaghetti-western and 70's kung-fu.) However, where the first one lacked in Tarantino-like dialogue, the second one fails to disappoint. From Pai Mei's words of wisdom during The Bride's training, to her final confrontation with Bill (and the verbal exchange that commences, particularly Bill's line about Superman comics) Tarantino fans that felt let-down at the lack of sharp dialogue from the first Kill Bill, should find plenty to rejoice about in this one."
"EJRAMv2","10","2","4","11 July 2006"," Vol.2 is the 2nd half of one of the greatest movies ever.
","In my opinion, Kill Bill Vol.2 was one of the best sequels I've ever seen, even though it wasn't really a sequel. It seemed a little slow the first time I saw it, since I was expecting it to have all the same action as the first one. However, the second time around, I got to appreciate it for the great movie it was and how well everything came together. The chemistry between Uma Thurman and David Carradine was amazing. I think it's a crime that Carradine wasn't nominated for an academy award for his performance. Thurman should have been nominated as well. I thought the music and the atmosphere to this movie were great. The Kill Bill series was Quentin Tarantino's best work, in my opinion. If you've only seen Vol.2 once, you have to see it again to really appreciate how great it is."

","Lacks the style and action of the first volume and there should have been some warning that the second part would be absolutely nothing at all like the first part. Actually Tarantino did give a subtle warning but the first part can be greatly misleading. However this movie gets better every time you watch it. It more typical Tarantino fare when compared with the first half. The expected dialog is long and detailed. Most of the scenes and acting have been done flawlessly. However, had it had just one major, well choreographed fight scene at the very end, it would have so much better. The ending is thus quite disappointing. Overall, the first part, as a wild explosive party was just so much more fun and memorable."
"TOMNEL","10","2","4","29 June 2006"," A big improvement over the first.
","Stars: Uma Thurman, David Carradine, Michael Madsen, Darryl Hannah, Gordon Lui, Michael Parks, Larry Bishop, Bo Svenson, Samuel L. Jackson, Jeannie Epper, Sid Haig and Perla Haney Jardine.<br/><br/>This is an excellent movie in every way. It's about ex assassin Beatrix Kiddo going to kill the last two assassins, Budd (Madsen) and Elle Driver (Hannah) and then kill Bill. The reasons that I enjoyed this over the last is that this movie puts action and style second to good writing and character development, yet it still has great style. Where the first was a Japanese action movie, most of this is like a Spagetti Western. The first film was more like a hard core action flick, where this one had some time to breathe in between, and was more like ""Jackie Brown"" in it's quietness but still very entertaining. Some other positives are Gordon Lui who played a different tole in Kill Bill 1. He plays her teacher Pei Mei in a long flashback. Michael Parks is also very good as Bill's 80 year old pimp father figure.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10 stars. 138 mins. rated R for violence, language and drug use."
"jay4stein79-1","8","2","4","9 April 2006"," Taken as a whole, it's a great achievement
","I felt electrified after watching Kill Bill, Vol. 1, but felt that something essential was missing. I was dazed, my head spinning; it was a caffeine buzz. The first film flies by in a heartbeat. With Volu. 2, Tarantino takes a step back and creates a languid and more mature film. It's a great combination when taken together. <br/><br/>The dizzying riffs on popular culture present in the first film slow down for Volume 2, allowing us to absorb them. I felt tired after watching Vol. 1; after Vol. 2 I was exhausted, but on an emotional level. The first film, with its beautiful gore and wonderful set-pieces, drags you along at a harrowing pace, while Vol. 2 simply presents a harrowing story. The final scenes between Bill and the Bride are moving in a way that is atypical of Tarantino's films. I actually cried. Jackie Brown revealed Tarantino's ability to dabble in pathos and sympathy; in Volume 2 he demonstrates that he has become a master of those techniques. <br/><br/>It amazes me to think how dissimilar Vols. 1 and 2 are, but it's obvious that they need to be so disparate. The zipping, fanboy references in the first film might be annoying, appearing as if QT is saying look at all the cool movies I've seen. The second contains just as many allusions, but it seems to serve a purpose. Like Finnegan's Wake or Gravity's Rainbow, Kill Bill (as a whole) occupies an interesting level of artistic achievement--a creation that acknowledges all artistry and allows it to bleed into and out of its narrative at will. Kill Bill is, if nothing else, a compendium of late 20th century culture, and a brilliantly realized one at that. Kill Bill is the world that existed between 1950 and 1999, and that's an achievement."
"Luke902","10","2","4","7 April 2006"," Kill Bill Review: Vol.2
","Tarantino has done it again. Vol.2 answers all of Vol.1's questions and then some. But you must be warned: If you are hoping to see a spectacular action film like Vol.1, then just don't watch this.<br/><br/>So, here it goes.<br/><br/>In the end of the first film, we learn that The Bride's daughter is alive. But she doesn't know this... Which raises another question: How will this effect/distract her when it comes time to ""Kill Bill""?<br/><br/>This is the film I prefer of the 2. It is because, well, it is brilliant. This film answers questions that were never even asked. Tarantino just let his imagination go to work and we got this. I didn't see it coming. I thought I was in for an exhilarating action experience, and I got an engrossing finish to what was before a some what zany story. It all comes full circle. And it does so flawlessly.<br/><br/>In this one, her first target is Budd. In one of the best parts of the film, which is ""Chapter 7: The Lonely Grave of Paula Shultz"" Budd goes to work, and he is a bouncer. He is late (as always, we learn) and is called back to his cocaine-fueled boss's office. He is fired and told by his boss to not where his hat to work. And that's the beauty of it. We see that underneath this character, a murderer though he once was, he is human. He once got paid a lot to kill people, and now is bossed around by some jerk getting paid bum cash and living in a trailer.<br/><br/>So, he goes home, sits in his camper and puts a Johnny Cash record on. The Bride creeps from underneath his trailer and swings the door open, but instead of a getting quick kill, she gets shot. This is a point of confusion for all viewers. She survives because she was shot in the chest, and her breasts acted as a shield, absorbing the rock salt from the shotgun shells.<br/><br/>We learn how the Bride got so good at killing. She is trained by quite possibly the most dangerous man alive, Pai Mei. We watch her harsh training.<br/><br/>Finally, she reaches Bill and, in another touching moment, sees her daughter for the first time.<br/><br/>This was one of Tarantino's most daring moves. The Bride and Bill don't have their showdown for a great deal of time after she arrives at his home. <br/><br/>But it gets there. And when it does, it is one of the best scenes ever in film history, not for the violence (because there hardly is any), but because of the emotion. Bill is dying, they say their final words to each over, and he dies. But the Bride is not triumphantly howling now that she's done. She is sad. She is sad because she once loved Bill. The film manages to stay realistic in the human aspects of its characters. Though he had done wrong to her, she had forgiven him. And it's because she's done that that she is able to grieve for him, not as the man who shot her, but as the man who was once very near and dear to her. And when you think about it, it is very touching.<br/><br/>Vol.2 is pure genius."

","Don't expect KILL BILL: Vol 2 to be more of the same. Expect more, not the same. A good director knows the rules of movie-making (in particular scriptwriting). An excellent director knows how to bend and play with those rules. That's exactly what Quentin Tarantino does. Everybody knows he likes to mess around with continuity, but I'll vaguely give a more detailed example. At one point Tarantino builds in a set-up (or a clue, if you want) in the story-line. He then ignores this clue for a while only to deliver the pay-off at the exact moment the attentive viewer remembers the set-up. He does that on several occasions.<br/><br/>Once again, I will not list all the things that I loved about this KILL BILL: Vol 2 ('cause the list would be almost infinite), but I did promise to point out some possible flaws.<br/><br/>First of all (and this is not a flaw coming from the movie) it was a bad choice made by the production company to split this movie into two volumes. But since they did, Tarantino might have considered of dosing the talking and fighting more proportional. Now we have one volume with a lot of action and the second with a lot of plot-development. To me it still was good, but to fans of the first volume (who'd have to wait some time to see the sequel) it might be a bit of a let-down. This is why I recommend to see both volumes (4 hours!) in one take. That way you'll still feel the rush from the first volume during the second. And in its aftermath you'll find the time to catch your breath and get along with the story.<br/><br/>Some viewers consider Tarantino a bit of a show-off. In a way like ""Look at all the things I can do"" and ""Can you spot all the references to all the other films?"". Well, concerning the first statement, I'm all pro: Tarantino has talent, and if one has it, I'd like to see it. So, by all means, Mr. Tarantino, show 'em what you got. And so he did. As to the second statement: any real movie-buff loves spotting references. So bring it on. But it doesn't end there. Tarantino is a real comic-book fan and he likes to mention that rather unsubtle in his movies. I for one applaud that (I like comics too), but a lot of viewers find it redundant. But since he can do whatever he wants in his movies, he does it anyway. I just loved the scene were David Carradine does his monologue about Superman. You can clearly tell that Tarantino acted out that whole scene for Carradine, 'cause when you look at Bill, it's like Tarantino's doing all the talking. Very Amusing. So again, this is actually no flaw. It's just part of the Tarantino-legacy.<br/><br/>One question remained after viewing the KILL BILL-saga. How in the world did Bill get a hold of the baby. It seemed plausible The Bride not knowing about it since she was in a coma and she fled the hospital before anyone could tell her. But it felt kinda weird that she didn't ask Bill about it and that he didn't talk about it either. But then again there was already enough talking as it was in volume 2.<br/><br/>I can't think of anything else being wrong with KILL BILL. Actually, there isn't anything wrong with it. And I dare anyone to find me just one aspect about KILL BILL (from screenplay, acting, style, shooting-techniques to soundtrack) that isn't simply brilliant."
"evanston_dad","10","2","4","3 February 2006"," Vol. 1 Was Dessert--This Is the Main Course
","""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" is the second half of one large story, and it creates a cohesive whole with the first part, but in many ways it's a completely different movie from Vol. 1. The first half was all about movement--it was almost balletic in its merging of images and music. Vol. 2 slows down, WAY down, to create a stoic, mythic conclusion. Where events in Vol. 1 rushed by in a glib montage, with blood spewing and limbs flying around the screen in a parody of film violence, everything about Vol. 2 feels heavy with consequence---there's much less violence, but what there is feels like it matters far more.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman gave a nimble, athletic performance in Vol. 1, but really impresses here with her ability to get to the dramatic bottom of her character. Beatrix Kiddo's conflict emerges---she becomes a flesh and blood human character rather than a comic book hero seeking revenge. David Carradine, as Bill, is the second part's most significant addition, and he plays his part perfectly. And I got a kick out of Daryl Hannah's Elle Driver, who turns in a memorable cameo in the first part, but really gets a chance to strut her stuff in the second.<br/><br/>I don't think it's a criticism of Tarantino's films to say that the first part is all style while the second part is the substance; it's like eating your dessert before the main meal. I think Tarantino would be the first to agree, and both parts exhibit all the signs of being thoughtfully and carefully assembled. One thing you're never in doubt of when dealing with Tarantino is that you're seeing the exact movie he wants you to see.<br/><br/>But why spend time worrying about which one is better or which one succeeds more? They're both part of the same movie---one wouldn't exist without the other. And they're both remarkable.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"
"gluttony14","10","2","4","29 January 2006"," Individually, these are two different movies with unique styles. Together, they form a masterpiece
","This movie is quite different from Vol. 1. It isn't as bloody and gruesome (apart from one scene that is so brilliant it would be a sin to spoil it), or as violent, but it has more plot and a lot more dialogue.<br/><br/>The dialogue is truly the best part in this movie. You get amazing acting from Uma Thurman, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, Gordon Liu and David Carradine. And even Samuel L. Jackson has a small role, but even then he plays it amazingly. They deliver incredible dialogue written by Tarantino, as only Tarantino knows how to write. It makes you smile, and that's important.<br/><br/>What happens in this movie is quite clear - the Bride (whose name is finally revealed in Vol. 2 in a rather awkward little scene) continues her vendetta against Bill and the remaining members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, Budd (Sidewinder) and Elle Driver (California Mountain Snake). She faces peril and excitement. And she fights in incredible fight scenes. We also meet Pai Mei, Bill's master, who also taught the Bride martial arts, and he leaves an impact.<br/><br/>Both movies are amazing, but only together they form a true cinematic masterpiece. Tarantino struck gold with Kill Bill, just as he did with his previous movies."

"noralee","10","2","4","19 December 2005"," Magnificent Tribute to the Movies
","""Kill Bill, Volume 2"" confirmed for me that I will never, in my entire life, ever be able to see as many movies as Quentin Tarantino has already seen.<br/><br/>While ""Kill Bill, Volume 1"" convinced me that I would not in fact want to see the zillions of samurai, chop-sockey, anime, etc. genre films that he had seen and was joyously reenacting in every chapter, ""Volume 2,"" a.k.a. the second half of really one movie, is an extensive tribute to movies which I have seen, from John Ford and Sergio Leone Westerns to Billy Wilder comedies and noirs and on and on. In a recent interview with Charlie Rose, the voluble Tarantino made his case as a film historian by claiming that Uma Thurman is his visual muse like Josef von Sternberg's inspiration was Marlene Dietrich, but that was just one calculated explanation for the older demographic who watches PBS as their violent collaboration may make Scorcese/DeNiro comparisons more apt.<br/><br/>In ""Volume 2"" the other movie references are astounding and breathtaking -- every note of music (the extensive actual samples and the connectors by Robert Rodriguez), every setting, prop and article of clothing on screen, camera angle, actor cast, through all the nostalgic credits, let alone every clip any character is watching on their TV, is a loving tribute to another film (we will have to wait for the super deluxe collector's edition DVD that combines Volumes 1 and 2 to communicate the footnotes with multiple eggs).<br/><br/>Yet it manages not to be a pastiche or a parody, but a masterful, post-modern work of art culminating in a passionate expression of love of movies as the ultimate bed time story (as accompanied by one of my favorite songs, Shivaree's creepy take on ""Good Night Moon""), even if it cannot stand on its own to be enjoyed by the kind of person who only sees a couple of movies a decade. Tarantino may be a motormouth but he is in complete control of all these references, cutting them up like a collage and lovingly transforming them within his vision.<br/><br/>To the disappointment of the kid in the back row who didn't shut up, ""Volume 2"" has far less sock 'em violent set pieces, cartoonish or otherwise, than the earlier chapter, and far more very funny humor and marvelous dialog, especially as delivered by an iconic David Carradine (others will connect him to this film via the TV series ""Kung Fu,"" but I first loved him in the TV version of ""Shane,"" which is also recalled here). From the planes of his craggy visage, to Uma's gleaming eyes and lips, to the cinematography of Robert Richardson, this is also a strikingly beautiful film.<br/><br/>It is certainly not necessary to have seen ""Volume 1"" to appreciate the second part, but that adds to the power of the unexpectedly cathartic change that The Bride undergoes on her quest, redolent of ""The Wizard of Oz.""<br/><br/>Tarantino emotionally yet ironically makes the case that violent movies are fantasies that don't turn people into killers, rather they can bring families together. <br/><br/>And now I do want to catch up on samurai movies!<br/><br/>(originally written 4/30/2004)"
"nobbytatoes","10","2","4","27 November 2005"," the vengeance is continued
","The Bride has finished the first two people on her list; O-Ren Ishii and Vernita Green. But before we see the rest of the vengeance to take place, we are taken back to the massacre at the Two Pine Chapel. The Bride and her husband Tommy are rehearsing their ceremony when a surprise visitor comes; Bill, setting this vengeance story into motion. Now come back to the rest of her Death List Five, next to come is Budd. Living in a camper van and working in a strip club, Budd is very unhappy with his life. When Bill gives him news that The Bride is out to get him, Budd couldn't care less. Entangled with Budd's fate is Elle, who despises The Bride; who in return The Bride didn't like much either, setting up for one down dirty grudge fight; an ultimate cat fight with very sharp claws. But the the highlight come to the dramatic conclusion when The Bride finally confronts Bill, but has a shocking revelation in store for her.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol 2 is a spectacular conclusion to the masterpiece of Vol 1. Like Vol 1, Vol 2 is a patch work of movie influences and references. While Vol 1 was more in the realm of Japanese Samuria films, Vol 2 is set more in the Spagetti Westerns and Chinese Martial Art films. While Vol 1 has more action, Vol 2 has picked up more of the Tarantino Dioluge, adding more weight to the story, as we do finally see a lot of the background to The Bride and Bill. Though it doesn't suffer from the drop in action, as the dramatic tension is raised a lot; especially towards the end and the confrontation of Bill.<br/><br/>The violence is very dulled down in Vol 2. The blood has been with drawn and there isn't much blood to see, but it still has that vulgarity from Vol 1 that still has that mesmerising effect. Being the main fight sequences, the grudge between Elle and The Bride is a fight to remember. It was a dirty slug fight that wasn't afraid to bring the low punches out, and there were some very low punches from each. Though the fight of Bill many have found abit underplayed and not what they were wanting, it was a very fitting end. The tension in the small fight was so gripping that it resolved it wonderfully.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman out does herself from Vol 1. Her reaction to many situation were so believable; it was painful to see her face when she sees her daughter for the first time and when she was being buried alive that was also painful to watch hearing her crying. David Carradine does an excellent job as Bill. Though there were a few times it seemed he was talking to so for his dialog, kinda putting the emphasises out of place, yet it was a minor flaw in his role. Michael Madsen was great as the begrudged Budd, he showed a lot of hollowness in Budd, with Budd thinking it can be fixed with money. Daryl Hannah was just outstanding as Elle. She played a perfect bitch. She was a character you loved to hate. You could hear all the malevolence in her voice. Gordon Liu as Pai Mei was just perfect. You can't help but laugh with every whip of his beard he makes with his hand.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol 2 is a wonderful conclusion to this tale of revenge. It would be great to see Vol 1 and 2 in one whole film."

She did an extraordinary job, Oscar-worthy. Don't let me start with David Carradine, who was marvelous. And The Bride herself... God, Uma gets better over the years. She knows with who she should work, and that's why she's working with Quentin. A brilliant genius who knows how to jump from genre to genre, from the greatest catfight to the softest moment between a mom and her daughter.<br/><br/>This should teach em how a movie should be make."

","I waited till this came to cable simply because I wasn't going to pay 15 dollars to see one movie which we split in half out of typical Weinstein greed. Plus it afforded me the luxury of seeing both films back to back. Whereas the first half was all glitz and lightning fast action set pieces, which was a fun ride. This half is more typically Tarantino in relation to the dialog that seems to crackle and ooze coolness. Not to say there isn't any action, as there are a few great stand-out set pieces to be had, just not as manic as the first half. This is leisurely and takes it's time and for true fans, it's all the better for it. David Carradine is great as Bill, Uma gets her most-rounded performance in her career, and while the movie, as a whole, isn't as sheerly fun as Pulp Fiction, nor as perfect as the sadly under-rated Jackie Brown, it still makes for a hell of a ride. One thing that tee'd me off was the credits ""based on a story by Q&U"", which just struck me as overly pretentious of them. But that's obviously just my opinion.<br/><br/>Signing off,<br/><br/>K"

","Kill Bill Volume 2 (directed by Quentin Tarantino) is a great, great movie. I don't know why Uma Thurman didn't get nominated for Best Actress because she gives a fantastic, emotional performance. There really is nothing wrong with this movie. The soundtrack is great, the directing brilliant and the dialogue better than the first.<br/><br/>In Vol. 2 we follow The Bride's story of revenge. For those who haven't seen the first: The Bride (Uma Thurman) was gunned down at her wedding by the DIVAS. She has killed O-Ren Ishii (AKA Cottonmouth) and Vernita Green (AKA Copperhead). She still needs to kill Budd ""Sidewinder"" (Michael Madsen), Elle ""California Mountain Snake"" (Daryl Hannah) and of course Bill ""Snake Charmer"" (David Carradine). In typical QT style we flash back and forth, revealing The Bride's past and how she came to be such a good fighter.<br/><br/>This, as I said before, is flawless. Uma Thurman gives a wonderful performance. Daryl Hannah plays a villain very well. Michael Madsen and David Carradine also give great performances. The music in this is wonderful and suits the movie perfectly. Luckily Vol. 2 has some better dialogue that we can remember.<br/><br/>The fight scenes in this are very well done and keep us watching.

"Wolfman316","10","2","4","7 August 2005"," One of the best movies of 2004.
","KILL BILL: VOLUME 2 is one of the best movies of 2004 and is Uma Thurman's most improved performance since Batman and Robin. After assassinating two of her Ex colleges, Female Assassin The Bride sets out to assassinate her two other former colleges and kill her Ex Boss Bill who is holding her daughter in his custody. I love KILL BILL: VOLUME 2. Uma did good acting especially, she did well-acting at the end of the film when she crying in the bathroom, i thought it was a shame that Uma didn't get a Oscar for her performance. What was good about VOL. 2, was it had all the answers. David Carradine was born to play Bill. The music by Quentin Tarrantino's best-friend Robert Rodriguez was good. I thought the song ""About her"" by Malcolm McClaren had good music and good lyrics, the song was about the relationship between The Bride and B.B. The fight between Elle and The Bride was a whoop-a** showdown and Elle got what she deserved. I thought the opening sequence when Uma is talking to the audience ""When i arrive at my destination. I'm gonna Kill Bill"" is one of the most memorable moments in cinema history. This is a highly-recommended film for fans of Quentin Tarrantion, Uma Thurman and David Carradine. Watch out for cameos from Sid Haig and Samuel L. Jackson. Put on you're DVD, sit back and brace yourselves as Uma Thurman is going to kill Bill."

","At the end of Kill Bill 1, Hattori Hanzo is quoted, telling the Bride that she can get lost on the way to her revenge. This fantastic sequel shows that with its winding pathways. Her encounters with the rest of the Deadly Viper Assination Squad is different from the first movie in the saga. She acts upon different whims. Budd's character is complex for his position in the story. As she comes to face her adversaries, her actions change and the reasons change.<br/><br/>By the end of the movie, with possibly the best quote from movies I've seen (those who've watched know what it is), The Bride is turned into somebody else. The last scene after the credits show perfectly the transformation of Quentin and Uma's character, The Bride."

","It takes more than good editing and cameras effects to make a good film. After Kill Bill Vol1 I was hoping that the second film would have been a bit more fast paced. Unfortunately it wasn't the case lots of unneeded dialogue which was used to fill in, until we got to the action. I thought the scene where Uma got herself out of the coffin which was buried under a ton of soil was so unbelievable that it killed any credibility the film had gained that far into the movie. This film might appeal to the Mtv crowd but I'd give it a miss, if Quentin Tarantino believes he can cover up a mediocre film with flashy editing and a slick cast he certainly has succeeded, judging by the votes he has gotten here."
"rixrex","Null","2","4","20 July 2005"," Putrid potboiler glorifying gangsterism with comic book characters, PT 2
","I thought nothing could get worse than part 1, but part 2 managed to do it. It continues the super slick presentation of part 1, the glorification of what is evil in the world, and don't give that garbage about how evil is equivocal. These people kill people and have no sense of humanity beyond themselves and their own selfish world. This director is twisted, in his world love is a selfish design, and there's no room for sacrifice. Why do people like Kiddo? She's the least evil of the evil. And are we really supposed to believe that core of martial art training is to provide assassins? But what really makes this one worse than part 1 is the outstandingly awful over-acting of David Carradine, a lousy attempt to present himself as a wise sage of some sort. It seems that with Carradine, less is better. The less he's seen, the better. The less he says, the better. He needs to stop playing Caine from Kung Fu. But at least Caine was a considerate human. And what was that crud about a truth serum he invented? What a contrivance. This two film series is a big contrivance."

","I have seen many movies, from Audrey Hepburn to this one, and I thought I would not like the violence in Tarantino movies, but as Bill himself said in an interview, these movies are not about violence, but about the inner workings of violent people. After seeing part 1 I became an instant fan, but I was a bit afraid that no one could really live up to really making that Bill character alive enough. I was wrong - it could not have been done better than by David. Apart from him, of course all the others were good too - Ulma and the 'Hateful bitch'. Excellent music, excellent - almost absurd- discussions between the Bride and her opponents before they start the fight. Very successful mix between Spaghetti western genre and 70/80s Karate movies. And David Carradyne, if I spell it right, as Bill is unforgettable. Rollingstone once said, in the CD booklet of 40 licks, the Best of the Stones, that Keith Richards was the undisputed King of Cool - but no more, since the days of Bill! What an excellent voice, unforgettable lines, and of course last but not least acting - this guy should have got at least an Oscar nomination for it. To me he is the undisputed King of Cool now, even if I have to admit it sounds like I am 15 now, but still he is! Hope to see him in many more movies to come!"

It wasn't really outright bad, it wasn't really outright boring, but it was the perfect anti-climax to Vol. 1. Mr. Tarantino should never have cut that into two parts! If it would have been one long film, I think I wouldn't see the second part as I do now. After the first two hours of what is now Vol. 1 with its thrill, the violence, the speed of it, continuing a bit slowing (okay, forget the 'bit'), continuing slower paced, leading to the end, that would have been okay. But since the first part is now some months old, and with the expectations I had for Vol. 2, I felt a bit like the guy jumping out of the birthday cake ""BOOO"" and realising he was two hours early and no one is there.<br/><br/>The one good scene it it was that piece where The Bride got buried alive, until she walked into that café asking for water. And I like the piece where she tore out the last remaining eye from Elle. What I also liked (first I thought what the hell) was Bill's speech about super heroes and superman and what's the difference between Superman and the others.

","It has to be said that Quentin Tarantino quite simply rocks and is the epitome of cool in modern-day film-making. Nobody stamps their mark on a film in the manner he does and with the possible exception of the peerless 'Pulp Fiction' this is his finest work to date. Vol.2 is utterly absorbing. The loose ends and questions from Vol.1 are seamlessly threaded into the next passage of Beatrix's vengeful odyssey and flow perfectly through to a wonderfully crafted and satisfying denouement. Effortlessly stylish and original, the dialogue and characters come together with the plot to create what can only be described as a masterpiece of modern movie-making. Utterly, utterly brilliant; there is simply nothing more to say."
"FZ-FX","9","2","4","10 April 2005"," The tribute film that could
","While Kill Bill was originally intended to be one film, somewhere along the line the decision was made to split it into two parts, and it's quite surprising just how well this works. On the surface, volume 2 is the Spaghetti Western half of Tarintino's tribute to cult films. But when you compare to two movies on a deeper level, they're dramatically different films.<br/><br/>The first half of the Kill Bill saga was essentially an extended romp that introduced the characters, conflicts and mythology of the story through highly stylized action scenes. Slower paced, with significantly less action and outlandish violence, Volume 2 is a departure from the original. But what it loses in action and style it more than substance. While the plot is still a revenge story, it's one of the most complex and humanized revenge sagas ever put on film. The central aspect of the plot is the relationship between the Bride (Thurman) and Bill (Carradine). Both of these characters turn out to be surprisingly deep, and through excellent dialog and acting we can understand their relationship to one another, as well as the supporting characters. This slowly builds up and comes to a head with their meeting. Some complained that the final confrontation was anti-climatic, but I couldn't disagree more. It's a deeply emotional moment for both characters, and is the perfect conclusion for the Bride's journey.<br/><br/>And of course, the plot isn't the only thing to praise with this film. Tarantino's directing skills are, as always, superb. Uma Thurman was superb, and David Carradine gives an almost mythical performance as Bill. The supporting cast was excellent as well (particuarlly Madsen and Liu). Tarentino has always been known for being able to combine music and scenes memorably, and Kill Bill is no exception, with the score lending itself to the film perfectly.<br/><br/>While it still possesses the style and action of it's predecessor, Kill Bill Volume 2 sets itself apart with it's deep and emotion filled story. No other director could have made this film, and Tarantino shows why he's revered as one of today's greatest directors. By paying homage to the his influences and heroes, Tarantino has created a classic."
"MichaelMargetis","10","2","4","2 April 2005"," Supersedes Volume 1!
","This has to be the movie I anticipated the most in my life. The ending of Volume 1 left me hanging not only for four months which was stated when the first installment was released, but for six months since the release of Vol. 2 was delayed two months due to problems on the cutting room floor. I won't lie, after the credits started to role I was a little disappointed. If I had not of been, Kill Bill Vol. 2 would be the best movie I would have seen, ever! Well, it wasn't but it definitely made my Top 100 list along with Vol. 1. The fact of the matter is Vol. 2 is not only better then Vol. 1, it's more involving. Unlike Vol. 1, Kill Bill Vol. 2 has less action and violence (which may turn off immature and blood thirsty viewers after the blood soaked Volume 1), but it explains the plot to it's full extent. In Volume 1 you didn't get a stable plot, you just got stylized acting and blood (not that is an insult), but in Volume 2 you get a little more closure.<br/><br/>The second installation in Quentin Tarantino's chop-sake meets wild west crime saga, The Bride continues her blood-hungry hunt for the three remaining members on her list. The first is Budd, Bill's brother played expertly by Michael Madsen (Species, Reservoir Dogs). He's a hard-drinking depressed cowboy-hat wearing fella, who works as a bouncer at a low-level tit bar. The second person on The Bride's list is someone she really hates and someone who really hates her -- Elle Driver, the foul-mouthed eye-patch wearing blonde-haired trouble maker who is now Bill's sweetie. Perhaps the best fight sequence of the film is the showdown between the Bride and Elle in a broken down trailer home involving a toilet, samurai swords and tobacco spit. The final person on The Bride's list is of course, Bill. You finally get to see Bill in full form in Volume 2, and he is played with such intensity and passion by David Carradine (who definitely gives the best performance of the entire movie.) <br/><br/>The acting in Volume 2 is a major improvement then the acting in Volume 1. Uma Thurman still gives a rock solid performance as the sexy blonde sword fighter on a mission, and the villains this time around are way better. Lucy Liu and Vivica A. Fox don't come close to the acting talents of Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah and David Carradine. In this one, the villains are also more developed and you get a better grasp of the kinds of people they are. The directing is fabulous as usual, along with the writing, and the soundtrack is more alive in Vol. 2 then it was in Vol. 1.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Kill Bill Volume 2 wasn't as extraordinary as I had expected, but it is certainly another masterpiece from one of the greatest filmmakers of our generation, Quentin Tarantino.

","Anyone can film a remake. A tribute. Revamped stories. Ripoffs films. Etc. All been done many times, and rarely well.<br/><br/>What makes Tarantino's films - especially the Kill Bill films - so special is that while there are co many aspects that pay tribute to cinematic history, they are only ASPECTS of the film. Tarantinos' film-making is poetry - he does not rely on one genre or another, one style or another, one film or another. He is able to thank all of his own muses individually, while remaining a unique screenwriter and director with something important to say on screen. Characters that would otherwise be ridiculous, actors that are often sub-par, dialogue that could be boring as hell - he brings it all to LIFE in a way that VERY FEW directors are capable of doing. He is a Kurosawa, an Attenborough, a Spielberg of our time - a true cinematic artist. And in thirty years, when everyone forgets that The Alamo or Hidalgo ever existed, Kill Bill will be regarded by film fans and scholars alike as one of the very best of its era - and will likely be paid tribute by the dynamos of the future just as Tarantino gives a salute to his idols."

","No doubt about it - Vol II is even better than Vol I. Where the first one gets a bit absurd, the second stays impressively real. Where the first one leaves you hanging, the second one gives an inspiring and completely fulfilling ending. This is Tarantino at his best.<br/><br/>There is no real way to summarize this movie. But essentially it picks up where Vol. I left off. ""The Bride"" is continuing on her revenge rampage, getting closer to Bill himself. We find out a lot more about Bill and the events surrounding his relationship to ""The Bride."" This makes the movie more effective and the characters more real. <br/><br/>The action, the acting, the drama, the humor, the moral, the everything of this movie is better than the first, which was very good in itself. This is a must-see!<br/><br/>I would recommend seeing Vol I first. The second will just simply not mean as much.<br/><br/>Wow. Great movie."

","(Spoilers)<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol. 2 is the second of two very graphic movies by Quentin Tarantino. At the start, we witness why The Bride (Uma Thurman) is enacting revenge on five different people. After this we have a brief run-in with a conversation between Bill and his low-life brother, Bud. Within a half hour, The Bride and Bud meet. Bud succeeds in capturing her and buries her alive.<br/><br/>While six feet under, we witness The Bride have a flashback of her training with the Japanese martial arts legend Pai Mei (Chia Hui Liu). After some very awkward scenes we come upon Daryl Hannah's character Elle Driver driving to Bud's house (rather trailer) in the desert. By this time The Bride is out of her grave and heading for Buds trailer. I'll leave it here so I don't ruin it.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman portrays the Bride incredibly. Smart, bold, and powerful. Willing to do anything to reach her goal of Bill. Uma Thurman is one of your top actresses in America today. She is sheer brilliant as the Bride and will keep you asking for more with every scene.<br/><br/>Kill Bill, although not as bloody, still holds the R rating due to some violence and heavy language. Even though the Bride is the main character, I did not find her to be the most interesting. Rather it is Michael Madsen's character Bud who seems the only one of the five murders to have emotion and regret for what he did.<br/><br/>The movie is dominated by Tarantino effects and brilliant acting by Uma Thurman and David Carradine (Bill). <br/><br/>4 1/2 out of 5 Stars."

","I had heard so much about this movie before I saw it. Yet none of what I heard/read prepared me for the brilliance of this movie. Quenton Tarantino knows all the hooks that make a great movie and uses all of them here.<br/><br/>It's strange, because, I kinda know what's going to happen throughout the movie, yet the movie kept surprising me. You know Bill has to die at the end, but yet.....<br/><br/>There are so many WONDERFUL performances throughout the movie, but two stood out to me: David Carradine, and Daryl Hannah.<br/><br/>David Carradine is brilliant with his understated performance, going from affable, to menacing quickly and smoothly. You understand his side of things at the end and find yourself thinking....""Well, maybe"" before you remember that there were other people in that chapel besides The Bride and he is a hardened killer who, although he regrets what he did to The Bride, he never expresses remorse for the others.<br/><br/>Daryl Hannah shows another side to her acting which, in my humble opinion, was just as shocking as seeing Charlize Theron in Monster. The public is not used to seeing Hannah as a hardened character. She usually plays the sweet, lovely girl. The films I have seen her in have all been fluffy and light. Even Clan of the Cave Bear wasn't as gritty as the book had been. I feel she comes into her own in this movie and shows what a real craftsman she can be.<br/><br/>One of the things I liked most about this movie was that it was a serious movie that didn't take itself seriously. There were several moments when you couldn't help but smile (the scene where The Bride is being taught by Pei Mei is a classic!) At the end, when they show scenes from the movie as they roll credits, when they show David Carradine...well, ya gotta see it to believe it...BRILLIANT!!!!!!!"

","This chapter of the ""Bride's"" story picks up precisely where it left us, at the end of Kill Bill, Vol. 1, and seamlessly carries us forward through the second half of Tarantino's dark and twisted saga.<br/><br/>This chapter was not nearly as sanguineous as the first, but was more treacherously deranged (if you can believe it). The execution of this screen play and the filming styles are inspired and simply breathtaking. <br/><br/>As the stakes mount in the Bride's game of cat and mouse, the players find they must stop at nothing, in order to survive her rampage of unrelenting revenge. Tarantino took out all the stops and directed one of the most disturbing and dastardly sinister enterprises I've seen. I can't think of a single film which compares to the atmosphere and story, the depth of these characters, and the overall enjoyability of the work that is Kill Bill, Vol. 2.<br/><br/>I wholeheartedly recommend this run to anyone who has a love of revenge movies, action flicks, and splatter fans (though splatter fans may prefer Kill Bill, Vol. 1, now that I think about it).<br/><br/>It rates the exact same rating as the first at an 8.8/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

","This is the most over-appreciated movie of the year. Mister Quarantino just rips off his own favorite movies and puts them all together into something that is too long; too much boring conversations and one clichÃ© after the other. If you have seen all the movies he has (like Once upon a time in the west; Peckinpah-movies; Hong Kong-movies etc etc), there is no surprise at all. The ending is a anti-climax. Of course, he has a very good cameraman and good actors. But let him try to make a film without guns, swords, fast cars and violence. A Dogma-film for example. A real story, about real people. I don't think he is capable too make something out of that. The thing what I dislike most about Quarantino's movies is the senseless use of violence. It gives you nothing to think about. It has no social relevance at all. Compare this with Peckinpah or Kubrick, to name a few real masters. Just violence and endless talking; it is not enough."

After viewing 1, your head is dizzy. But volume 2 fills all those gaping holes like The Bride's name, the location of Bill, the fate of her daughter, and the other 2 she needs to get rid of and exactly how did that Massacre at Two Pines happen? I will not say what the best part, but look for the subtle references to what lies in store for The Bride and what kind of man Bill is. The characters are well-developed, the screenplay moves at a good pace, and the ending is awesome. I just wish it was longer.

","Interesting - in post 9/11 I found the most unrealistic point of this movie (KB1 and 2) is that ""The Bride"" can move so effortlessly from the USA to Japan and back to the USA and then to Mexico and back not only slaying dozens of people in her wake - with no police on her trail - but more amazingly she's relaxing on the plane rides with a huge Hanoi Sword!!!! They arrest you @ the airport now with a letter opener!!!   What - did she slay the Marshalls and stewardess and hijack the plane to get to her destination??   Why wasn't the Air Force and Marines waiting for her when she landed??  Homeland Security failed us on this one!  But then we would still have Bill running around.

Kill Bill vol.2 has his good moments but for god sake Quentin, Uma Thurman get a shot in the chest with a shotgun at close range and mysteriously hours later she has not even scars, that is the error that i hate most in this film. The greatness of Kill Bill vol.2 is in the flashbacks and the unforgettable fight scene between Beatriz and Elle (the best of the film), Master Pai Mei is a great character and i think that he should had more time in the movie, The character of Bill played by David Carradine is the best in the film and i think that he deserves a Best Villain nomination in the Mtv Movie Awards, Uma is Good but not great, but in the other hand Daryl Hannah steals the show with the character of the coldess heart killer Elle and Michael Madsen makes a good performance for a comeback in his career, at the end i grant 7.5 of 10 to this Tarantino flick."

","This should have been a single movie rather than two truncated mini-movies. It seems Q agrees because he places the credits with all of the actors at the end (including mini-clips from part I), and we realize how very, very many things aren't in this second part. <br/><br/>It's a shame, because Kill Bill 2 is more thoughtful and fleshes out the plot, with backstories on The Bride and Bill and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) characters, as well as meaningful dialogue explaining the bloodbath of the first movie. But it needed an editor to chop down the words. Just as the first movie needed an editor to chop down the fight sequences. THE MATRIX 2 and 3 taught us that more Agent Smiths and bigger, louder, longer fight sequences don't improve things. But if Kill Bill vol. 1 suffers from Matrix 2/3 excesses, Volume 2 suffers from an excess of verbiage and overdone dialogue along the lines of...I dunno, MY DINNER WITH ANDRE? There is too much self-indulgence at work here, and I fear the box office of these two movies is just going to make ""Q""'s next effort that much more baggy and undisciplined.<br/><br/>Q has said splitting the movie in two allowed him to keep all the little bits he otherwise would have had to cut, but the truth is, there's a good half hour from part one that should have excised and a good twenty minutes more from part two. The result would have been a roughly three hour standalone movie that would have been tight and eminently watchable in one sitting. Kind of like the Beatles White Album, which would have been their all-time best had it been a single epic-length platter, but because they decided to indulge themselves and throw everything they came up with on the two discs, it's full of classics and crap side by side. <br/><br/>Even Kill Bill's music screams of lengthy epics, with Ennio Morricone sprinkled throughout the trailer sequence evoking THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY's monumental breadth. It would have worked as homage and humor in a single movie, but feels out of place and strangely wrong in this split up movie thanks to Miramax's quest for the dollars. To Q's credit, though, the overall music is wonderfully reminiscent of the seventies and chopsocky movies; I suspect he spent a long time putting it together and it is generally effective. <br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol. 2 is okay, but is lessened by being separated from Vol. 1. This is the rare movie where the ""Director's Cut"" DVD should have LESS footage and Q + U and HW and M should return KB V I and II into one film, the way it should have been from the start."

","I had rented Kill Bill: Vol. 1 last week. I liked it so much I couldn't wait for Vol. 2. Opening day, I was there. I might have had my hopes up too much. Volume 1 centered completely around the women. The guys are on the back burner 'til Vol. 2. That's probably why I reacted more favorably to Vol. 1. Vol. 2  is still a finely crafted film. I'm guessing that men liked Vol. 2 better since men are more prominent. Vol. 2 is a better film emotionally. The violence is less cartoonish. The fight between ""The Bride"" and ole one-eyed Daryl Hannah is quite realistic. (I kept thinking of Blade Runner during that scene). Well, as realistic as it can be. Who can really get thrown into walls time after time and continue fighting. Tarantino owes as much to spaghetti westerns as he does to martial arts films (which I've never been that fond of). Aren't nearly all of the man-with-no-name Eastwood films similar in theme? A wronged man gets his revenge. In this case, the Bride gets her revenge. I will definitely see these two volumes again on DVD. Tarantino infuses each film with so much style that one viewing won't do. Thumbs up for sure."

There are even a few surprises along the way and you get to see much more of Bill than in Vol. 1. He is no longer the mysterious man in the shadows, Tarantino really develops his character in part 2. Even non Tarantino fans should make an effort to see this movie. Although I don't think you would get the depth of the story from just watching Vol 2, you certainly could without be lost.

This is where QT comes into his own, he uses other film makers methods but improves upon them. He is the ultimate fan, and because he knows and loves the genres he pays homage to, we are brought back to these excellent films, and we are left in no doubt that we are seeing one mans love for them.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that Kill Bill vol 1 & 2 are probably going to be around a long time, these are movies that will be held as benchmarks for film-makers in the future, in these movies we see how it should be done.

","As neither a rabid fan or a detractor of Tarantino I must say I enjoyed the first vol. better simply because the action propelled the story and didn't give you much time to think about how thin the plot was. And there really isn't much here to make you care about any of these characters. The scene with the killer and the home pregnancy test where we're supposed to care about the bride fell totally flat.<br/><br/>I'm sure this film is going to get TONS of positive reviews simply because Tarantino is one of the only original filmmakers able to command big budget films these days and fans will fawn over anything he does because there is no else to fawn over. But it seems people only respond to action and kinetics in films and not on plots and characters, which is sad because it is possible to combine both and Tarantino has the talent to do it if he'd only grow up a little. This is a lot of fun but it's not a masterpiece in any sense.<br/><br/>Carradine is great and so is Michael Parks with a superlative job doing a Mexican pimp. Also If you're going to use music from other films take it from obscure films. The music used from the Good the Bad and the Ugly(it's in the top 100 best movies on imdb for christ sake!) is so recognizable its almost blatant plagerism to use it.

That should really say it all. Some of the best cinematography, action choreography and writing in, well any film. My problem with 2 is that there is significantly less action than the 1st one. This would not be a problem if the action in the first was so damn good. I also think of moments like the silhouetted action scene and the 'anime-homage' backstory, creative risks that are noticeably lacking in the 2nd. As it stands, kill bill vol 1. Is absolutely incredible and I would highly recommend it<br/><br/>KILL BILL VOL. 2: I'm gonna be honest, the only thing that vol 2. Improves after the 1st is the screenplay, which is arguably the most essential part of any Tarantino joint. There aren't as many great moments as the first one, but that's obviously not what this one is trying to achieve. This is about adding more character to, specifically, Bill and the Bride. I have my problems with it, like that pointless part where bill's brother gets fired or the anticlimactic fight at the end (again, because of the context of the first movie)<br/><br/>Anyway watch both of these if you haven't, they're great.<br/><br/>KB 1 - 10/10

","So. On to volume 2. Though lacking the action of volume 1, I came away liking this half of the story more than the previous one. It's more talky, more talky than even I remembered, but it's also more dramatic and it's moments of violence spread out.<br/><br/>The second half of the story shifts the focus back to America as The Bride (Uma Thurman) hunts down the remaining members of the VIPER hit squad Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) before heading after Bill (David Carradine) himself. However, after falling into a trap, The Bride has to recall specific training given to her by Pai Mei (Chai-Hui Liu) for just such an occasion.<br/><br/>It's definitely the less cooler half of the story. There's no iconic outfits, tunes, no pussy waggons. There's no action to rival the Crazy 88 scene, though the fight between The Bride and Elle Driver in the confined quarters of a mobile home is pretty great stuff. But it's a better story than volume 1. It has an Arc across it as we see the Two Pines Massacre, before what Budd is up to and his interactions with the bride that take us to one of the darkest points of a story that's filled with dark moment.<br/><br/>The ending is perhaps slightly underwhelming. The scenes between The Bride and Bill are fun, and the dialogue here is perhaps as close to Tarantino dialogue at its best that the two films ever get too.<br/><br/>What it is, is another Q.T. film that, whilst its quality is undeniable, I don't feel is an undisputed classic."

","With the critical and public success of the first part and many outstanding issues, volume 2 of 'Kill Bill' comes to close all loose ends and surprise us with the mishaps faced by the Bride on her way in search of revenge on her disaffected. After having eliminated two targets in the first half, now it is time to carry out the rematch against the other participants in the Texas chapel massacre.<br/><br/>After being betrayed by Bill (David Carradine) and his former group, the murderous Bride (Uma Thurman) is on the verge of death for four years. After waking up from a coma, she goes after each of her former companions to kill them. In the second part of this quest for revenge, the bride will continue her search for Bill, attacking Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), the last two survivors of the group. The confrontation with her former master, and mastermind of her death, will reveal new surprises for the assassin.<br/><br/>If the first volume had a lot of graphic violence in a more cartoonish tone and a more accentuated side of humor, in this second part we have a change of tone. As the work was not originally intended to be displayed in two parts, this tone was already purposeful, but with the division it became even clearer. This does not mean that it is a film completely opposite to the previous one. Volume 2 continues to feature violent and elaborate scenes, highlighting the burial with our protagonist and revenge against the last two survivors of the group. The scenes, especially those of the burial, are much more like a horror movie. Uma Thurman's performance in these sequences is spectacular, giving us all the suffering and despair of the character.<br/><br/>However, it is clear that in this conclusion, Tarantino prefers to highlight other characteristics of his works. Knowing that this final part would have to explain issues just mentioned above and that, especially the confrontation with Bill, would have to bring an emotional and dramatic charge to the audience, he inserts much more text in the characters' mouths, with the right to analogies to superheroes and the change in direction that our protagonist wanted to take in her life from the moment she learned she was pregnant. All scenes of the Bride / Beatrix Kiddo with Bill, whether at the beginning or at the end of the film, are purely in the best Tarantino style. In addition, the director tells us what the Bride's real name is, how she learned to wield a sword in very good-natured scenes with master Pai Mei (Gordon Liu).<br/><br/>Now with less exaggeration, less reference and a film with a much more paced rhythm, 'Kill Bill Vol. 2' bets on phenomenal dialogues, script and free controlled violence. If the first focused much more on the plot and all its explosive action, now we have the focus shifted to the beginning and end of the story, the humanization of the characters and the reasons why we support them, where in fact we know everything. that happened until they reached that point at the conclusion of the film. The Bride, especially, thus becomes the most human character in the vast gallery and Tarantino.<br/><br/>In addition to the Bride, we also know the other characters. In Budd's case, we even get to know where he lives, where he works and what he does outside work. Bill is already an extremely interesting character, as we know his motivations for the sadistic act that started the story. Tarantino gives us a choice of who to support, presenting reasons, even if not rational, strong for Bill to have done his slaughter. With a cast chosen in the right measure to give meaning and motivations to the characters, everything becomes more visceral. For knowing how to conduct the work in these different aspects in comparison to volume 1 and, managing to deliver everything that is expected, we see a great leap by the filmmaker towards the real authorial work. Now Tarantino fans will be able to delight in all the director's signatures.<br/><br/>As with Sergio Leone's westerns, everything is very slow. Just to give you an idea, the Bride kills only one person throughout the film, but everything that happens has meaning and makes sense. The best part of this second part is its ability to subvert all expectations, bypassing them in a wise way, without frustrating them, but surprising with creativity and innovation. There are crucial moments in the plot that leave the viewer simply without imagining what will happen next, leading him to believe that the story has reached a dead end. It is not because it was a more serious and profound film that he doesn't have fun and is funny. The perfect example of this is in the figure of the master Pai Mei, extremely arrogant, but very wise. In its scenes, the technical part recreates precisely the types of samurai films on which the character was based. Although references are in lower numbers, in Volume 2 they are more obvious.<br/><br/>The soundtrack, as in all of the director's works, is yet another character in both volumes. On the two soundtracks, the songs range from country music to selections of spaghetti western punctuated by Ennio Morricone. Bernard Herrmann's theme from the film Twisted Nerve is whistled by the fearsome Elle Driver on the hospital scene. When The Bride enters Casa das Folhas Azuis, the go-go group The 5.6.7.8's plays 'I Walk Like Jayne Mansfield', 'I'm Blue' and 'Woo Hoo'. The connection with Lady Snowblood is further established by the use of 'The Flower of Carnage' in the final theme of the film and we cannot forget Gheorghe Zamfir The in the beautiful song 'Lonely Shepherd'. It also plays the song 'Shot Me Down', at the beginning of Vol. 1. In general, the songs on both volumes are very eclectic and that goes well with the film which also justifies the fact that the soundtrack was so acclaimed and considered by many one of the best of recent times.<br/><br/>Tarantino gave more life to his work, more reason and more feeling to everything. If the saga of revenge 'Kill Bill' had not been divided into two fundamentally the same, but in detail different. The way it was done, Tarantino gave us two masterpieces, two odes to genre cinema that work each in their own unique way to the point that it is an arduous task to choose which one is the best. The works complement each other. It remains to be seen whether a single three-hour film could not further raise the status of films. 'Kill Bill Vol. 2' is a sadistic, creative adventure full of pop references that serve both to honor and to please a new audience. The combination of the two volumes mixes everything and gives consistency to enter the mind of one of the most relevant directors of cinema."

"thenolanfan","8","0","0","10 April 2020"," Review - Kill Bill: Vol 2
","Unlike his predecessor, this movie is more axed toward the drama than the action. The identity of Bill has revealed very quickly in the movie and on a certain aspect, the movie lost a part of his glamorous spirit.<br/><br/>While I appreciate this touch of drama, I have some criticizes to do regarding the flashbacks, this flashback scenes like in many movies of Quentin Tarantino are what I call ""Facilitated screenwriting"" in other words they explain quickly a concept with the only purpose of making the rest seemingly coherent to the view, except that these sequences are mainly based on an over explanatory storytelling that Tarantino attempted to attenuate by using humor.<br/><br/>Some scenes are however are simply masterpieces, I can take to illustrate my point, the final confrontation between The Bride and Bill. In this scene, Bill asks Beatrix if she felt satisfaction after killing her victims, to that she answers ""yes"", but in her eyes, you can see remorse. Maybe I'm over-interpreting it, but as I see it, it was a self-criticism at the violence in Tarantino's movies. He wants to highlight that all those outrageously violent scenes are for him a ""guilty pleasure"". The movie has a lot of self-references or homage which adds to the films if you have seen other Tarantino movies.<br/><br/>Other than that this is basically a movie cut in two parts, so It wouldn't be reasonable to give a different rating to one or another. This mainly why I gave it an 8.<br/><br/>To conclude, I recommend the Kill Bill Saga, and it might be one of
Tarantino's most complex and entertaining artwork."
"FreddieLee04","10","0","0","10 April 2020"," Kill Bill Vol.2- A Tarantino Gem Which Is An Improvement Over The First Volume
","I consider myself a huge Tarantino fan. I love Reservoir Dogs, constantly find myself quoting Pulp Fiction and have even sought out some of his lesser known flicks such as the mishmash Four Rooms. Yet, Kill Bill Volume 2 is the one I find myself always wanting to rewatch time and time and time again.
There is something for everyone in his 2004 follow-up to what I believe, is the fairly mediocre Kill Bill Volume 1. Sprinkles of japanese culture (mostly displayed in Vol.1), elements of western movies and homages to the great Sergio Leone, and tons of mesmorising dialogue from a range of unique and well-developed characters.<br/><br/>Uma Therman is superb just like the first film portraying 'The Bride'. Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah make fantastic side-villians who help create memorable action scenes and moments such when Buck burries Beatrix alive or when Ellle Driver gets her eye plucked out, leaving her blind. It is these tense, nail-biting scenes that really improve on the first movie, which at times, feels like an all-out kill-fest.<br/><br/>The star of the show for me is the late David Carradine who brings both lovable and loathable qualities to the titular villain 'Bill'. He is also a monumental asset to the film's success in my opinion, which contains the most memorable and heartfelt ending in Tarantino's filmography. The 'five-point-palm exploding heart technique' might just be the most inventive way of killing a villain i've perhaps ever seen. Also, the credits are bound to bring a tear to your eye.<br/><br/>In essence, there is no need for a third installment- no matter how much my heart wishes that I could get see Beatrix fight again on the big screen- the ending of this one is perfect. Kill Bill Vol.2 - 5/5"
"aidanratesmovies","9","0","0","4 April 2020"," The better half of the 2
","With a much needed balance of story, and some great performances as before, Kill Bill Vol. 2 is by far the better half of Tarantino's series and is certainly an unforgettable conclusion that shines even greater than the first. Although the pacing does take a drag as the film starts out, Kill Bill Vol. 2 doesn't waste any more time than it needs to telling its story in the best way possible, and is for the majority of its longer runtime, a very entertaining film. As before, the fight sequences are very impressive, and the tone has seemed to find its balance between the harsh and the cool. Uma Thurman shines again as her character the Bride, and David Carradine also gives a very notable performance as Bill himself. In the end, Tarantino provides yet another masterwork of filmmaking by providing a very impressive conclusion to a rather impressive series. The plot may take a bit to get started, and the film may feel a bit unsatisfying for its ending, but all together, it is able to improve on its previous flaws and shine greater than ever before.

The buildup, so well done in Tarantino's later movies like ""Inglorious Bastards"", was poorly done in this film.

"squeezebox","5","3","8","18 March 2005"," Marginally Better than Vol. 1
","The only reason KILL BILL VOL 2 is superior to VOL 1 is because both David Carradine and Daryl Hannah have more screen time, which helps to balance the awfulness of Uma Thurman's performance.<br/><br/>We also get the cool sequence in which Thurman undergoes her training with the master swordsman, which is shot like a gritty seventies Shaw Bros. kung fu flick. The entire sequence, however, winds up serving little more purpose than to explain how she gets out of her impossible situation of being buried alive at the hands of grunt Michael Madsen (playing a more down and out version of the same character he always plays).<br/><br/>Her ability in punching through a plank of wood from a short distance comes in handy when she has to punch through the coffin lid. Of course, this doesn't explain how she's able to punch through the ton of dirt that's been piled on top of it.<br/><br/>Hannah shines in her best role in years as the ruthless one-eyed assassin who kills Madsen for giving Thurman such an unceremonious death, despite the fact that she herself was all ready to kill her in her sleep not long before that. She also comes to a grotesque demise, which, unfortunately is made far less shocking by an unnecessary foreshadowing in the previous movie.<br/><br/>But the real shining light in VOL 2 is David Carradine. His presence is electrifying, and he carries the movie single handedly for the much of its running time. Unfortunately, he is forced to interact with Thurman during the final few scenes, with her bugging eyes and stilted delivery snuffing much of the life out of their exchanges.<br/><br/>These scenes are supposed to be emotionally devastating, but simply don't ring true at all, because Thurman isn't the least bit believable. She screams and cries and wails, but it's all so phony it has no effect.<br/><br/>The movie is worth sitting through for Hannah and Carrdine. Tarantino's direction is obvious and by the numbers, for the most part. The two movies together are a major disappointment from a filmmaker who's capable of delivering far better material.<br/><br/>Oh, by the way, ""Q and U"" stands for Quentin Tarantino and Uma Thurman. Isn't that clever?"
"Captain_Couth","3","3","8","5 March 2005"," Second part of as three plus hour movie.
","Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004) was the second half of a three hour plus movie that was directed by Quentin Tarantino (the action scenes were directed by Yuen Woo-Ping). Since nobody wanted to watch a nearly four hour grind house movie, the producers decided to split the movie in half and put all the left over footage in part two. In doing so the movie feels very bloated and the film tends to drag in many places.<br/><br/>The Bride is nearing the end of her long road to vengeance. With only the last two members of the DiVas hit squad left to dispatch (Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen) complications arise during the trip. She still has certain feelings for her former mentor. Can she push them aside and finish her mission?<br/><br/>Extremely disappointing second half of the Kill Bill saga. Instead of continuing the total comic book carnage of the first film, Quentin Tarantino caved into pressure from the critics and made a pseudo chick flick masquerading as an action/revenge film. Whatever momentum he built whilst making the first film died on the vine in this pretentious film. Too bad because part one was actually quite good. But when this tripe hit the streets (it took forever with Q.T. constantly tinkering with the finished product) it just sat their and stunk. <br/><br/>Highly disappointing."
"MISSMASS","5","3","8","1 February 2005"," Do Not watch this movie!
","This film picks up right where Volume 1 left off where the bride finds the other remaining assassins and Bill. Despite that the fact that the first one was so-so and highly enjoyable, once the second half came out and we saw it: It was better than the first one, NOT! Just when critics were rating this film with good reviews just like the first one they gave a bit of warning that it was changed from the drama/action to the almost full drama. They defiantly were right. For one thing this movie was way over hyped. When you see the first section of an entire title usually the second half or next fraction would get better as you progress through the sections but the second part Volume 2 was a real letdown man it just tanked. Take a look at the proper Kung Fu franchise Once Upon A Time In China Trilogy. The first part was an amazing Kung Fu film, which was long, and you had to sit through plot to get to the amazing action scenes just like in Kill Bill Volume 1. In part 2, the movie was shorter and the pace was quickened, and finally in part 3 it was complete non-stop action with very little plot. Now that's a proper Kung Fu franchise. When I see a sequel to a film I enjoyed. I like watching the story progress further down the road. The road, which always tries to be smooth, had some bumps on the road. Just when you got to the prologue part and Bill's (David Carradine) character comes up, his acting just bored everyone to death, I liked him in Kung Fu: The Legend Continues, but man his acting was terrible. It should be known as ""Boring Drama: The Legend should not continue"". If Darly Hannah's scene with the black mamba is the best part you have in this film, you are in serious trouble. Micheal Madsen & Daryl Hannah, they've had better days. This was supposed to be a proper Kung Fu movie just like the way Volume 1 was and the action in Volume 2 was way too empty. Even slow-paced films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidalgo and Peter Pan had more action than this entire film. Even the one fight scene with Daryl Hannah can't save this film. I rather would have watched Peter Pan than this deadly boredom. <br/><br/>ACTION and GOOD PLOT: Non-existent GOOD ACTING EXCLUDING UMA THURMAN: Non-existent<br/><br/>Bottom Line: THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST LETDOWNS IN Hollywood HISTORY!

","Writer/ Director Quentin Tarantino (Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown) continues his story from 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1', an exciting action/ adventure film that chronicles the revenge of The Bride (Uma Thurman) as she seeks to find those whom she used to trust and those who put her into a comma for four years. In Vol. 1, The Bride dispatched O - Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) and the Crazy 88 fighters. In 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2' the story continues as she seeks to find and kill Budd (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), and of course Bill (David Carradine), ending her rampage.<br/><br/>Tarantino created an exciting, action packed explosive piece of cinema with 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' by using slick cinematography/ editing and combining several highly memorable action sequences with a cool story. Instead of choosing to make a film with similar style as Vol. 1, in 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2' Tarantino opts to make the film more plot orientated and dig deeper into the characters. Flashbacks are used a few times to develop the relationships between characters that once was, in particular The Bride and Bill at the wedding rehearsal. However, Tarantino is ultimately dogged by his murky screenplay and timid direction that fails to truly grab a theme and hold onto it. There is a dizzy and very spectacular fight scene in a trailer between Elle and The Bride, and a humorous flashback to The Bride's training by Pai Mei (Gordon Liu). However, these action scenes aren't enough to make the film interesting and it becomes purely dull. It is discovered in the very end of 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' that The Bride's daughter is still alive, and in Vol. 2 they finally meet and try to form a bond. Bill finally is shown and developed. But it seems Tarantino was trying to go two places at once, and was trying to make an action piece and a drama at the same time.<br/><br/>Tarantino has always had a knack for making films with slang filled dialog, and stylish criminal characters. Bill is the culmination of Tarantino's style, particularly a scene in which he delivers a monologue about his thoughts on Superman. While Carradine definitely has some cool to him, the dialog ends up falling flat to the ground and it seems the depth, or whatever it was Tarantino was trying to achieve was totally lost. The film feels boring and patchy, instead of the tight focus Tarantino employed with 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1', Vol. 2 is by comparison much weaker and much more disconnected. The Bride is given more to do than simply fight this time, and she is asked to finally show more human emotions. Unfortunately, Thurman isn't half able to pull this off. While her grim emotions were perfect in Vol. 1, Tarantino gives her more to do but she is just incapable. One scene asks for her to be crying on the floor in a bathroom, and I couldn't help but laugh. She simply lacks the ability to perform. Carradine, as mentioned previously definitely has style but the murky screenplay doesn't give him the ability to really use it to full potential. Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah are appropriate in their roles, particularly Hannah as the fork tongued bitch Elle. The usual sharp performances Tarantino gets from his actors is lost, and there is no one to blame but him. The film employs some sharp visuals as well, thanks to ace director of photography Robert Richardson (JFK), but visuals aren't as important to the story as they were in Vol. 1.<br/><br/>I give some credit to 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2'. There are some exciting moments in the film, and Carradine is able to give off some nice moments. But the flat screenplay by Quentin Tarantino and his unfocused direction break the film apart.<br/><br/>5.5/10"

The Bride (Uma Thurman) continues her hunt for the masochistic Bill (David Carradine) in part 2 of Quentin Tarantino's pop culture styled duo-logy.<br/><br/>In part 2, we see Tarantino's influences shift from Asian cinema to the spaghetti western, with the stylings of the likes of Sergio Leone featuring heavily. This is possibly one of the smartest decisions on Tarantino's part as the kung-fu novelty of the first film having well and truly run its course.<br/><br/>One of the most disappointing aspects of Volume 1 was the lack of witty dialogue that has defined Tarantion's CV thus far. In volume 2, we see a return to form, with Bill's superhero monologue one of the most memorable moments of the film. While, the action is still intense and fast paced, it is not the carnage of Vol.1, with the aforementioned dialogue now playing a much greater role. Thus, Vol.2 is in many ways a more well-rounded and deeper film than its predecessor.<br/><br/>Though not as frenetic as the previous film, Vol.2 nevertheless has more to offer. It's just a shame that Miramax had to split the film in 2 parts in the first place. And I thought Tarantino was the last person to place the commercial pursuits of Miramax ahead of his art..."

Some western characters are trying to show off as if they were Bruce Lees, Sonny Chibas or Jackie Chans. One matter makes me real uneasy: this piece dealing with second-hand trifle things, which we saw before in other movies, occupies a place of honour on IMDb top 250 list. And note that poor wire stunt on the railing (when the Japanese guy flew horizontally around the main heroine during combat) - that looked so amateurish and goofy.

At the end of ""Kill Bill Volume 1"" Bill asked Sophie ""Does she know her daughter's alive?"" so I knew a 4- or 5-year-old was bound to turn up in Volume 2 at some point.  Little did I know she would take over the movie.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman is back as Beatrix the Bride, whose name gets bleeped out once but not afterwards.  She announces during an old-time-looking black and white back-projection car ride that ""when I reach my destination, I'm gonna kill Bill.""  (Volume 1 explained her incentive.) Let me skip ahead to when that finally happens: armed with a gun (for a change) as well as her trusty Hattori Hanzo sword, she arrives at Bill's Mexican hacienda, slinks inside, steels her nerves and confronts---a little girl pointing a toy gun at her. That image (and the reaction cut to Thurman) is probably the single best thing in the movie.  After that, though, ""Kill Bill Volume 2"" just .... stops .... dead.<br/><br/>I've heard there are people who find small children endlessly fascinating, even if they're not their own.  But as I sat watching, I felt like a guest trapped with proud young parents showing home video of their offspring: ""Oh, look, there is playing with her Christmas presents, isn't that cute?  Oh look, there she is eating cereal, isn't that precious??  Oh look, there she is upchucking the cereal, isn't that the most adorable thing you've ever seen???""  Uh, no... During this more or less endless footage of ""B.B.,"" not only is it not ""Kill Bill"" any more, it's not even Tarantino, unless he's morphed into Kevin Smith while we weren't looking.  At one point it occurred to me maybe he was spoofing the cloyingly saccharine (mis)use of young children in movies, but probably I was grasping at straws.  I think he just found the tyke fascinating and expected we would find her likewise.  Our sinister ol' Quentin did surface briefly when Bill was prompting the girl to tell the dead fish story, apparently suggesting to Beatrix that B.B. had killers' blood in her veins; this would have tied in with the later (and also endless) Superman story.<br/><br/>I wouldn't have minded all this so much if Volume 2 had been more of a romp to that point, more in the spirit of Volume 1, which generated great emotional momentum (immeasurably aided by Zamfir's ""Lonely Shepherd,"" which I will never hear the same again) and reached a dramatic climax that had me almost salivating for what would ensue.  None of this tingling adrenaline sweep survives to Volume 2; instead Volume 2 reminded me a lot of Tarantino's earlier ""Jackie Brown,"" a casually paced series of set-pieces punctuated by some out-of-the-blue violent moments.  The black and white chapel scene immediately preceding the massacre serves no purpose that I can fathom except to introduce Bill onscreen, but he seems a fairly mundane character, with a lisp yet (which he didn't have in Volume 1).  There's nothing menacing about him even though we know all these people are about to be murdered on his order.  Aside from a few pointless details (we learn the bride would be working in a record store--why not a video store, Q.T.?) the massacre remains as much a mystery as in Volume 1.  Don't suppose it was inserted just to give Sam Jackson a speaking part?<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, there are some effective moments in Volume 2 although they require us to accept that Beatrix has declined greatly from the hyperalert revved-up killing machine she seemed to be at the chronological end of Volume 1, driving off in the ""Pussy Wagon"" having just disposed of Vernita.  Her move on Budd seems downright amateurish, allowing him to gain the upper hand even though he comes off as a cartoonish country bumpkin who doesn't even search her before he buries her alive and ties her up very sloppily--jeez, didn't he see that Ashley Judd movie where she escaped from a similar predicament?  Tarantino does a good job technically with light and sound during the burial but since we know in advance she's going to survive it, he should've come up with a more novel kind of horrible death, like maybe having all her blood drained out of her--no wait, that was in a Sherlock Holmes movie from the Forties.<br/><br/>Others have rightly highlighted the Pai Mei and Elle Driver sequences. The former's a sly tribute to all those chop-socky flicks with the camera zooming in and the master stroking his beard etc. but the ""cruel tutelage"" seems really cruel and one wonders what Bill gains from sending his young female trainees to such a school; did Elle become a more effective assassin after Pai Mei plucked her eye out? Wouldn't that screw up her depth perception?  The Beatrix/Elle death match becomes a Three Stooges cartoon and isn't even finished.  Would Beatrix leave such a loose (albeit blind) end?  But then in Volume 1 she seemed to be inviting Vernita's daughter to come after her some day....<br/><br/>At first I wasn't going to do a review until after I'd seen Volume 2 again; I wound up seeing Volume 1 seven times and liked it better each time, but I'm not pulled to see Volume 2 again as I was Volume 1.  I know I'll have to contend with B.B. again and also the bizarre depiction of Bill who by the end seems the campiest screen villain since Dirk Bogarde in ""Modesty Blaise.""  He never seems particularly interested in killing Beatrix, doesn't seem to care much if she kills him or not.  Not only did he not spend the 4 or 5 years with B.B. indoctrinating her against Beatrix, he seems to have told her ""Mommy's asleep but she'll be back.""  That doesn't seem to square with what he told Elle on the phone in Volume 1: ""We've done a lot to her, and if she ever wakes up, we'll do a lot more....""  The final fight between them lasts about six seconds before she employs her secret ""Exploding Heart"" technique---by the way, why didn't she use that earlier, such as when Budd was hovering over her and she had her hands available?  Could've saved herself the trouble of fighting her way out of the grave a la TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer....<br/><br/>If any one line seems to sum up the whole saga, it's when the hired Asian killer with the shotgun changes her mind after she confirms Beatrix is pregnant.  She says ""Congratulations"" and leaves... so even in this ""alternate movie universe"" as Tarantino has called it, this ""movie that characters in my movies would go see,"" girls may kick ass and all, but ultimately they're still girls, still succumb to the whole maternal-instinct thing.  Is that the kind of squishiness Tarantino remembers from his beloved ""grindhouse"" days? Now if the Asian killer had said ""Congratulations"" and then blasted away anyway (needing to miss of course), requiring Beatrix to kill her, THAT would have been a true grindhouse tribute.<br/><br/>I don't even recall much of the music from Volume 2 except the Meiko Kaji tune from Volume 1.  I'll probably buy the soundtrack anyway.  Least memorable character: Michael Parks as the Mexican pimp, even though he was onscreen forever (and it felt like it).  Had nothing to do except show off his fine-Corinthian-leather accent. Most memorable character: Sid Haig as the bartender in his couple of moments.  Too bad Tarantino couldn't have let him play the obnoxious owner or something.  Most missed character from Volume 1: Sophie.  Seeing her again would've been a treat, even (or especially) missing an arm or two.  I would imagine Uma will get another Oscar nod and would deserve it even more this time around.  She IS ""Kill Bill.""  Her triple take after hearing that Bill ""overreacted"" is priceless.<br/><br/>Okay maybe Q.T. never meant this to be an issue but a lot of us are probably wondering if during the anime in Volume 1 that was supposedly a young Bill in the white suit.  Maybe he'll throw us a bone some day?  DVD?  Prequel? How 'bout it, dude....."

","I don't know why people think Quentin Tarantino is good when all he does is rip off other people. Everything in Kill Bill 1 and 2 came from Hong Kong cinema, including Uma Thurman's track suit and shoes. The closest he ever came to an original movie was Jackie Brown-at least in that case he was making a movie from a book rather than copying someone else's work shot-for-shot and passing it off as his own. I used to like his work and thought Pulp Fiction was one of the best movies I'd seen when I saw it. Ironically I was going to school in England when it came out, back when Hong Kong was owned by the Brits. It was pretty weird to walk out of a theater thinking I'd just seen something great only to hear people in front of rattling off the movies that; the Walken scene came from, Bruce Willis character, and the whole Eric Stoltz/Uma Thurman/John Travolta storyline. Plagiarism like his doesn't deserve to be rewarded."

","Shhh. Do you hear that? It's Sergio Leone rolling over in his Italian grave. Poor guy. He didn't know that years after his death some video store clerk turned director would completely rip-off the sty lings of his ever so popular movies. Well he might not be able to protest, but I sure can. ""Volume 2"" is one of the biggest rip-off's I have ever seen(closely followed by ""Volume 1""). I used to respect Tarantino until I saw the movies that inspired him. After watching this film again, I think that someone should call the studio and file a copyright suite! ""Volume 2"" was full of corny dialog and ridiculous action. It's almost like Quentin was trying too hard. I would recommend this movie to a thirteen year old boy who doesn't have the patience to sit through any Kurosawa or Leone films because they are too ""long"" or don't have enough ""action"" or not enough ""cool one-liners""."

","This movie is a good example of a director who can't seem to find his way. Kill Bill Vol.2 is a mess. From Sergio Leone to B-movie kung-fu movies bad imitations, Tarantatino tries to show his talent but only proves that he has no originality. This movie has no stylistic unity. At times, the dialogs are a torture ( i.e. the first time The Bride and Bill talks , in the opening chapter ). Usually in that type of movie the fighting scenes can make it at least fun to watch but the fighting sequences in Kill Bill Vol.2 are uninspired and boring. The only good thing in this movie is the soundtrack. At least Jackie Brown had some interesting characters and really good acting ( I prefer Bridget Fonda getting ... by Robert DeNiro than Uma Thurman caught in a wooden box for half an hour)..."

","After seeing Kill Bill 1, I was thrilled to see the sequel. When I finally saw it, I have to say I was a bit disappointed by it.<br/><br/>I'll give a few reasons: In part I the person 'Bill' is a complete mystery, which makes the movie attractive till the end. In part 2 this mystery is directly unfolded in the opening scene; to my opinion this could have been done with a lot more tension and excitement to keep the viewer tight to the screen. The second thing is the plot which is to my opinion too predictable and has only a few weird twists and turns. Last point I have is the length of the movie. It takes 136 minutes to finish, while with this storyline it could be done in about an hour.<br/><br/>I like Tarantino-movies, but this one certainly lacks quality."

"filmbuff20","Null","2","6","26 August 2004"," Gargantuan.
","In terms of conflicting emotions regarding the audiences reactions to certain characters, Tarantino has once and for all given us the mess with our minds that we deserve. 'Insomnia' had a cop whom killed his partner and covered it up, but we know that through it all, I couldn't have gone any other way. Kill Bill Vol 1 had a back story to cold killer O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) told in Anime, one of the most expressive mediums and actually gave the character a sympathy. Vernita Green's (Vivica A Fox) daughter (who will undoubtedly come back later) watches as the bride kills her mother. In Volume 2, the sympathy and emotion for the bad characters are heightened and the one man whom you thought you would hate the most of the five on the dead list becomes one of the most sympathetic, charming characters of the film, despite what he did at the El Paso chapel not four years ago.<br/><br/>David Carradine plays Bill with menace and charm, a combination that doesn't always work with todays ineffective and forgettable villains. Having said that, the title's payoff did come out a little flat and empty. Maybe Tarantino was trying to relate how revenge is not always sweet and convey the emptiness The Bride must have felt subsequently. If that's the case, he succeeded. If his goal was simply ""to kick ass"", it was flat. Budd, Bill's brother, is just trying to make buck or two, but, as he so rightly states, they all deserve to die. Elle driver is the only one who is all bad. A bitch to the end. We never thought the mermaid from splash was capable of it. Hats off to Daryl Hannah.<br/><br/>One of the greatest things about volume 2 is a welcome back for the Tarantino dialogue and some of the most luscious cinematography ever seen on film. He states himself that its a departure, he admits to homage, never to plagiarism. Those of you with an open mind will agree with him. How many times has a film style or genre, even story, been recycled and recycled and no-one bats an eyelid. Gus Van Sant remade Psycho shot for shot from the same script and no one said a word, but you put down Tarantino for imaginative and frankly incredible use of his movie influences? I've had my rant, and Tarantino is in no way overrated. These two films are one big masterpiece and should be treated as such and, if possible, should be taken together."

"Infofreak","Null","2","6","8 May 2004"," Add parts one and two together and you realize that Tarantino has created an amazing achievement. Bravo! Don't miss it!
","I've been an admirer of Tarantino ever since I walked into a cinema over ten years ago and watched 'Reservoir Dogs', not even knowing the guys name. 'Pulp Fiction' turned me from an admirer to a fan, and 'Jackie Brown' (still a most underrated movie) just made me appreciate his talent even more. To say I was eagerly anticipating his next movie is putting it mildly. But I was also ready to pick it to pieces. I'm no one-eyed fanboy. If 'Kill Bill: Vol.1' sucked I'd be the first to admit it. However it not only didn't suck, it blew my mind. I can't think of any other movie that has combined genres in such a dazzling way. Only Takashi Miike comes close, but in a different way. Tarantino adores trash movies and his enthusiasm came through in every frame. It was this excitement and lack of playing safe that really impressed me. He made the movie HE wanted to make regardless of whether a mass audience would ""get it"". If 'Vol.2' had been more of the same and nothing more I would have been well pleased, but once again Tarantino has topped himself. Part two is less action orientated and cartoon-like the first, and has more character development, and yes, genuine emotion. Sure there are still lots of fun moments (especially the tongue in cheek sequence featuring Gordon Liu as Pai Mei) and exciting fights, but the scenes between The Bride and Bill have surprising depth for what many regard as ""just"" the ultimate popcorn movie. Add parts one and two together and you realize that Tarantino has created an amazing achievement. The casting is virtually flawless. Much like the Tarantino scripted 'True Romance' several actors get the opportunity to shine in supporting roles. Michael Madsen's confrontation with The Bride is one of the most memorable parts of the movie, and he and Daryl Hannah also share an unforgettable scene. Martial arts legend Gordon Liu, already mentioned, is an absolute hoot. Michael Parks, who played a Texas Ranger in Part 1 reappears as a completely different character, the sinister but charming Esteban Vihaio. Seventies favourite Bo Svenson has a nice bit as a Reverend, and Samuel L. Jackson is great as his organist. And it was really cool to see Jack Hill veteran Sid Haig's cameo as Jay the Bartender. All these actors help to make 'Kill Bill: Vol 2' a special treat, but the stand out performance is by David Carradine. Carradine has had an amazing career, but much like Dennis Hopper his appearances in dozens of b-grade action movies and mediocre straight-to-video dramas has made most film fans forget just how good he can be when given superior material to work with. Carradine has made over 140 movies and worked with such directors as Martin Scorsese, Roger Corman, Hal Ashby, Ingmar Bergman, Larry Cohen, Robert Altman, Walter Hill, Paul Bartel and yes, Fred Olen Ray, William Shatner and Fred ""The Hammer"" Williamson. Hopefully his work in 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2' will get him the attention he so richly deserves. The guy is a living legend people! Look, I'm a cynical old coot and spend most of my time whining about how poor most movies are these days, so it really REALLY warms my heart when something this damn good comes along! Bravo! Don't miss it!"

","Once you have seen Kill Bill vol.1, you are thrilled to see the second part of the movie. But the problem with the second half is that there is too much explaining to do, to make good for the first. Even when the first didn't really need any explanation. Still, Quentin had to fill in to make this second half into a feature, so here we go with pointless scenes about a deadbeat Budd who has some issues with his boss. A Spanish pimp and a training sequence to explain the miraculous escape of the Bride from the coffin.<br/><br/>While the first part was exciting, the second part is disappointing, not to say a bit boring.

Generally this isn't as violent as vol 1, apart from one scene when the Bride is fighting Elle, but their is much more of a story. Vol 2 concentrates more on the love story between Bill and the Bride (whose name you also find out)and also you see where the Bride got all of her skills (the Pai Mei scene is very good). I was a bit dissapointed with the ending (though I'm sure we all know what happens at the end)I thought it could have happened a bit better, and Bill compares the Bride to Superman, which is just plain strange, but that's Tarantino for you.

A lot of years have went by, and the baby is no longer a baby, now a child, and Bill being a daddy is NOT going to stop The Bride from putting a serious dent in his future plans, if you catch my drift. We get to see a spectacular scene of The Bride in training with an old man. In some ways, Vol 2 is better then the original, I didn't like it at first as well because the violence was toned down, but if you treat them both as one movie, you should be able to accept it. 8 out of 10 stars!

I deduced that the first part would concentrate on the awful treatment metered out and a prolonged training process in readiness for revenge which would be part 2. This, it seems is only partly true with the first actually being much more a traditional QT product full of style and panache with the second much more interested in giving the characters background.

","I just watched Kill Bill Vol 2<br/><br/>There are too many scenes in this film that damage the pacing. It feels very bloated at times. Rather than flowing smoothly, it lurches from point-to-point, giving screen time to secondary characters who are neither colorful enough nor intriguing enough to warrant it. This is the case of a director having fallen too much in love with his material. The result is that much of Volume 2, for all of its strengths, is self-indulgent. About 50% of the movie is used to provide backstory.<br/><br/>That's the bad news. The good news is that, despite its flaws, it's still a good movie. There's much less action, a lot more talking (Although much of the dialogue isn't vintage Tarantino, except a scene like Bill's ""Superman"" monologue), and a legitimate effort to build the characters.<br/><br/>Put the two parts together, and Tarantino has made a masterful saga that celebrates the martial arts genre while kidding it, loving it, and transcending it.<br/><br/>Tonally, the two films are different, which may be the result of the split. Hopefully, Tarantino's original, single-movie cut of Kill Bill will eventually be available on DVD. With the two parts re-knitted and much of the extraneous material removed, this could be a great motion picture, right up there with Pulp Fiction. As it currently stands, Kill Bill is a victim of its director's ego and its distributor's greed. The moments of greatness make it worth seeing, and there's certainly plenty of entertainment to be found here, but it's hard not to lament what might have been<br/><br/>Kill Bill Volume 2 grossed $66 million dollars (against a $40 million dollar budget) at the domestic box office."

While the Bride stole the show in Vol. 1, this time it's Bill who's the standout, with the actor having the perfect balance of charm and creepy that makes you buy his history with the Bride.<br/><br/>This movie also has one of my favourite Tarantino moments, which makes one inch punching look like the most badass move ever invented by man! <br/><br/>Overall, Vol. 2 acts as a very satisfying conclusion to what Vol. 1 set up, and while it may be slower, it's just as memorable, and just as rewatchable."
"davispittman","8","1","2","1 March 2018"," Good sequel, not as good as #1 though
","I personally really enjoyed Kill Bill: Vol. 1. It was full of well written dialogue, featured good performances, and was very entertaining. All of the same things are true for this sequel, although it's not quite as good as the first movie. The cast is a lot of the same, Thurman, Carradine, Hannah, and Madsen are all back and all turn in great performances. Thurman's character is now focusing on the three remaining people that are left on her quest for revenge. I want to focus on these three individuals separately. First, is Michael Madsen. He plays his character very well, he is not very fanatic, he's pretty laid back and chill most of the time, and in a way that makes his character more menacing, because of the ease that comes with his actions. He was a great choice for his role. But ya know who was the absolute perfect choice for their role? Daryl Hannah. Hannah plays Elle, the one eyed ruthless assassin. I adored her performance, she really gave it her all. I was transfixed by her acting ability here, especially since it's a pretty unusual role for her. And of course Thurman was just amazing in the lead, just as she was in Vol. 1. I do suggest this sequel, but only if this is your kind of movie and only if you liked the first film. Well written dialogue, fine performances, and a lot of great action. 8/10."

","There's a quote by the character Budd in this Quentin Tarantino movie after our now Bouncer is asked to compare his Hatori Honzo sword with others. It is at this time that he hesitates and comments on appropriate and inappropriate comparisons. I would venture that the same goes true for QT movies. As they are genre compilations with their own set of rules of the film realm, that we have come to love and trust, they really stand in their own place. <br/><br/>We picked up here where we left off with The Brides' Viper Assassin Gang Assassination List 40% complete, with another 88 or so Samarai style deaths absolved along the way in the name of avenging the loss of her baby four years earlier. If we were expecting more of the same we would have been selling QT short. <br/><br/>Enter The Western!<br/><br/>It's a dirty, dusty old trail of revenge and nothing is going stop her, except herself... see beginning and ending off the movie for further details. This is countered by overacting, which is purposefully delicious and appropriate. To compare KBII to KB I is miss the point of a continued move. This really isn't a ""II"" , in the movie sense of franchised adventure. Volume 2 is simply the second half of a movie that was split in two for purposes of audience attention span, studio double dipping into your pockets and, I'm guessing, a bit off QT tom foolery.<br/><br/>... and isn't that what we came for?"
"Shred_Master","5","1","2","9 July 2017"," One of my least favorite Tarantino films, unlike Vol 1.
","OK, so I know that kill Bill is meant to be one film all together but it ended up that they did two volumes, which are very different, so it makes sense to review Volume 2 on its own.<br/><br/>Without saying too much about volume one, it is one of my favorite Tarantino flicks - the action, the dialogue, the music, the acting, etc. I remember being very excited about volume 2 coming out, then it did<br/><br/>It's not that I mind Tarantino going in another direction per se but everything that was awesome about volume one, he completely changed for volume two. The first thing that I noticed right away was the music. The score and the soundtrack for volume one fit every frame perfectly. For volume two, I felt the music was very off-putting. <br/><br/>The action is volume two was very much toned down. It's not that there wasn't any action but the few action scenes that occurred were nothing compared to the spectacle in volume one. Even the final fight between the bride and Bill, was very quick and very unsatisfying. These were the two best fighters in the story and yet, most of the back-and-forth was simply a conversation. Tarantino is known for his dialogue and the final moments didn't disappoint in that department but if you're telling a revenge story, it's kind of like going through a video game. Each opponent gets tougher and when you get to the final ""boss fight,"" it typically is and should be the hardest, longest and requiring the utmost of your skills. It seems like, for this arc, he went in the opposite direction.<br/><br/>One of the biggest problems I had though, was the fact that I couldn't help feeling that Bill in the end was right. Let's face it, what the bride did to him was pretty messed up and she did it to the very person that she knew wouldn't just let it go. She left pregnant with his baby, changed her identity and married someone else. Did she really think he wouldn't track her down? Did she really think that if he did find out, he would be OK with ending it like it was? She was either really stupid, or very arrogant. Either way, Bill being a ""murdering bastard"" or not, he was completely justified in his actions. It was hard to sympathize with Beatrix in the end.<br/><br/>I know that there are a lot of people that hold this movie in high regard but I don't get it. This movie left me very disappointed in how he ended what he so masterfully set up in volume 1."
"hunterprimm","9","1","2","10 June 2017"," Not as good as the first, still keeps it fresh
","Now this is an interesting continuation. It really barely has a lot of what the original has. There is action but it is so much different. <br/><br/>For one, this movie takes influence from many different other genres. The first pretty clearly took influence from samurai and kung-fu movies. And this one very clearly takes influence from westerns. It doesn't feel out of place though, especially with Budd in this movie. This movie is also more dramatic. And comedic. It's a weird tonal shift from the original movie but it still works. Somehow. <br/><br/>The tone doesn't work quite as well balancing the drama and the comedic as say Pulp Fiction or Inglourious or Django or even the first Kill Bill. But just knowing this is a Tarantino movie makes it work. And it doesn't get rid of all Asian influences. Lest we forget the funny and pretty great Pai Mei sequences? Now this movie also takes itself a lot slower. It starts with a great little talking to the audience with a tension filled score under it. And then it slows down with showing us the wedding rehearsal where this whole bloody story begins. Then, she goes after Budd, fails and is buried alive. Then we go back even further so we know how she got all the kung-fu she knows. Then it is fairly linear. I can see how this would feel jumbled, but Tarantino takes real care of these sequences with fantastic editing and shots.<br/><br/>Although done with more western flair, the movie has plenty of style. Just done differently. For one, the battle with Elle is a lot more comedic in tone but shot fantastically. And she doesn't really die, just gets a more poetic justice sort of end. And Elle kills Budd with a black mamba. But style just oozes from the Pai Mei stuff. Plenty of kung-fu creativity.<br/><br/>It's really hard to explain why this movie works because it almost seems like a mess the way I'm describing it. I think one is more of a presence of Bill and Elle because they are both very good characters. I'd say the other thing is that even if it is more of a continuation rather than a sequel, it differentiates itself enough to feel fresh. Especially near the end it is more dramatic with the Bride's daughter being alive. And of course the western edge is also very different as well as the only person the Bride actually kills in this movie being Bill. <br/><br/>But the end of the movie is also where some problems arrive. I thought the writing was great for Bill typically. Especially his thing about superheroes. But truth serum? Really? That has to be the dumbest thing in a Tarantino movie yet. And the actual fight that we have been waiting about 4 hours for lasts maybe 30 seconds. Although very well choreographed and suitably emotional, it is way too short. <br/><br/>But on an overall scale, its a great sequel. It has all the visual flair, style, and fantastic musical choices of the first and keeps it fresh as well. Kill Bill Vol 2 gets a 9/10."

","In this story the bride is back to seek revenge, still three people were left. Fist she wanted to revenge a man named Budd, next An one eye woman and finally Bill.

"ebhae-34976","9","1","2","19 February 2017"," The better half but the whole bloody affair is better.
","This review will be split into two parts, one were i talk about this movie and one were I talk about the new version of this movie and part one called Kill Bill the whole bloody affair.<br/><br/>Kill Bill vol 2:<br/><br/>This was a so genius move by Tarantino. After having done one of the goriest and most violent movies of all time, going back to the brides back story and give the character more depth. This movie have arguably one of Tarantinos better scripts and i would say it could have been executed better. The way that they tell the brides back story is so genius, I will not spoiled to much but it's a scene were she need to have a specific skills and then they going back to show her training. Many people is disturbed by the fact that the finally is more talk the talk then walk the walk but I ain't because it's make this movie so much more emotional and the story comes full circle. If you want me to mention something that could have been better executed I say Esteban that is bad overacting and an Mexican accent that doesn't work.<br/><br/>Without the whole bloody affair this is my 5th favorite movie by Tarantino, my favorite director. <br/><br/>Kill Bill The whole bloody affair:<br/><br/>This is Kill Bill volume 1+2 in one movie with some improvements. For you who can't find this movie or don't want to buy it, I recommend (( fmovies.com (were you don't even have to download it or signing in)). And for you who haven't seen Kill Bill vol 2 at all I recommend you to see the whole bloody affair first because it's one scene in this movie that will change your way to look at Bill to the better, maybe forever. The Kill Bill vol 2 part is not so different but the Kill bill volume one is and I would still say the Kill Bill vol 2 part is slightly better. <br/><br/>Kill Bill the whole bloody affair is insanely highly rated but get's way to less votes to arrive to the IMDb top 250 list. I think this movie deserve to be there and I hope you will help me by watching it and rate it."
"Mr-Fusion","8","1","2","16 February 2017"," Revenge gets complicated
","""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" has a lot of explaining to do, and it makes sense that it's the Western half of Tarantino's opus. It feels sprawled out, taking its sweet time in getting to The Bride's backstory. Boring? God, no, but the tempo is more leisurely. Less bloody than the first half, this is certainly the more vicious of the two. It's here that we get to see Beatrix's brutal training at the hands of Pai Mei, the love story that develops between herself and Bill, and the even more gruesome hurdles that stand between her and sweet revenge. The big surprise is that it's not all violence; there's a sweetness at the center of all of this.<br/><br/>It's not as flashy and exciting as Vol. 1, but it gives substance to her bloodthirst and really does stand as a worthy payoff.<br/><br/>8/10"

"greenfarfan","10","1","2","10 November 2016"," The Bride is back!
","If you watched Kill Bill: Vol. 1, then you practically have to see Kill Bill: Vol. 2 because it's no ordinary movie sequel. In fact, it is more of a continuation to an unfinished movie. Where the first Kill Bill film had chapters 1-5, the second film contains chapters 6-10. And by watching Kill Bill Vol. 2, you get any unanswered questions Volume 1 had. The second half of Tarantino's 4th film will essentially give satisfaction to its viewers. Volume 1 was the more action- packed/exhilarating part, in which Volume 2 is the more drama-filled/emotional part. However, it is better not to think of Kill Bill as two separate parts because when it comes down to it, Volumes 1 & 2 are just a means of presenting this film into two halves. In the end, Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill should be considered as one long, epic, martial arts, revenge-film. So if you liked Vol. 1, Vol. 2 is a must-see."
"troyputland","8","1","2","11 February 2016"," For me, Vol. 1 is the better of the two, but Vol 2. wraps it all up nicely for us.
","Vol. 2, Tarantino's fifth film, follows Uma Thurman's ass-kicking Bride on her revenge mission. Two members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad are down, two (and Bill) to go. Where Vol. 1 was a homage to Asian cinema, Vol. 2 is one to western films of old. Character story is chosen above the action this time, as 'The Bride', gets closer to who main target. Uma Thurman is outstanding. Routing for her until the very end is no issue, no matter the cost or the conclusion. Vol. 2 wraps up this very thick plot ('and so the plot thickens', says Bill) beautifully. It's not easy for The Bride. The harder it is for, the better it is for our viewing pleasure. Tarantino is hit his peak, slapping us in the face with slick music, quick edits and less dialogue than what we're use to."
"dfle3","8","1","2","26 January 2016"," Playful and with even more outrageous and preposterous action. 77.5%
","Tarantino seems to be in an even more playful mood with ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" than he was in the first one, after opening his sequel with a replay of the dying bride sequence of ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"". For instance, The Bride narrates straight to the camera and at the audience. She even ups the ante with comments like: ""What the movie advertisements refer to as 'a roaring rampage of revenge'"". Is she talking about the movie ""Kill Bill""? or merely likening her situation to that of such movies in general? Such playfulness seems to me to take the edge off some of the disturbing imagery in this movie...like the kinds of horrors that you only see in cartoons...the kind that is parodied in The Simpson's cartoon within a cartoon ""The Itchy and Scratchy show"". Such horrors are rendered dreamlike or, more accurately, perhaps, like a daydream or fantasy. Where to draw the line between what is in real in the movie and what is fake becomes more fraught when The Bride makes the viewer an accomplice to her ""roaring rampage"" by saying ""the one I'm driving to right now, the only one I have left"". Again, this seems to erase the line between film and reality...movies don't talk back to you, do they? It's the film purporting to be real...you are there, with The Bride...sitting on the bonnet of her car...as she drives along a highway to mete out her next act of revenge!<br/><br/>The other notable thing about this movie, going on my notes, are the inside jokes. For instance, Tarantino had me going with the books one of his characters was reading, i.e. ""The Carrucan's of Kurrajong"". Like me, Tarantino has a mistaken apostrophe. Anyway, I looked up this book just now and learned its provenance. The books just sounds like a real book...I'm pretty sure that there would be an Australian book with a not dissimilar title!<br/><br/>Self-referential humour also plays a part in this film. For instance, Bill has a brand of bread called ""Blanco Bimbo"". The Bride is sometimes addressed as ""kiddo"" too...which has a payoff later in the film.<br/><br/>Watching the movie and the end credits, Tarantino seems to be providing the viewer with a syllabus to follow-up on: two characters watch ""Shogun assassin"" together, for instance. A Charles Bronson movie poster adorns one character's caravan, I think. Not sure if it's this movie or the first one (perhaps both?) which also gives a nod to Charles Bronson in the end credits. Some nostalgia was brought up for me too...I'd forgotten that the cartoon series ""Heckle and Jeckle"" existed, but Tarantino reminded me!<br/><br/>For those who enjoy Tarantino's pop cultural riffs, he has a good one concerning superheroes and their alter-egos.<br/><br/>Some notes to self:<br/><br/>* Bill says ""Ah so"" a couple of times in the film, I think...not sure if that is a nod to David Carradine's starring role in ""Kung fu"" many decades ago.<br/><br/>* The pianist at the church is described as a ""drell""...I've only heard that word with relation to a character in the sci-fi game ""Mass Effect 2"", the word ""bar-kay"" is also used. Not sure what they mean here! Just looked up the latter phrase...the pianist was in a real life band of that name? Hmm...see my point earlier about blurring the line between fiction and reality!<br/><br/>* Bill makes a comment to the effect that B wears the costume of Arlene...and...I shouldn't have used an abbreviation in my notes! Not sure who the ""B"" refers too...probably The Bride...and I'm guessing that ""Arlene"" was a fake name she used at her wedding rehearsal.<br/><br/>As with the first movie, from memory, I was toying with what score to give this movie...I think scoring this sequel 75% was on the cards but I liked how it played out, so I settled on a higher score so that I'd give it 8 out of 10, since this site doesn't give half stars.<br/><br/>Lastly, if you like playful movies like this, I'd also recommend the horror movie ""In the mouth of madness"" and the sci-fi movie ""The thirteenth floor""."
"robsta23","8","1","2","5 December 2015"," More Dialogue
","The bloodshed continues in this conclusion to a great two-part film experience. It continues, but there is less of it as none of these villains rely on heavy arsenals of ""bodyguards"" as in the case of Cottonmouth in vol. 1.<br/><br/>The main thing this film accomplishes is that it fleshes out the main characters - The Bride and Bill - so much more than in the first installment. We actually get to see Bill's face throughout the film, witness the two having real conversations to develop their relationship, and we even witness some complex emotions from the Bride. Where the first Kill Bill was fun, vol. 2 is more about the characters.<br/><br/>This is not to say that vol. 2 is not a fun film. It is extremely fun - my friend audibly expressed satisfaction at certain moments throughout the film as it was his first time watching volumes 1 and 2 over the past two days. It is also notably very tense towards the conclusion of the film, and in this film Tarantino once again proves to be the master of the monologue with a great segment in which the mythology of a super hero is discussed. It certainly doesn't match up to the intro to Inglourious Basterds or Calvin Candie's monologue in Django Unchained, but its placement in the film is nearly perfect.<br/><br/>One disappointing factor of this movie is that, in my opinion, it seems to have a cop out instead of a well fleshed conclusion. I can't say much past this without a major spoiler, so I'll say you simply have to watch the movie to see what I am referring to. In a movie that incorporates the martial arts the conclusion may satisfy some, but I think it is a tad ridiculous compared to the rest of the two films put together.<br/><br/>While this film may impress me just a little less than the first, I am still eager to see The Whole Bloody Affair at a theater in my lifetime if I get the opportunity.<br/><br/>3.0/4.0"
"dexter-vane","9","1","2","19 May 2015"," Great continuation to a great movie!
","I loved Kill Bill Vol.1 and everything I said about that movie I can say about this one as well. As a huge Tarantino fan I love all the Tarantino-isms in this movie. It continues the cool story from the first one and brings it to a great end, bringing a lot more emotion into the story. What I loved about Kill Bill in general (this one and the first one) is that it manages to not take itself too serious, but manages to be serious as hell if necessary. Just like every Tarantino it has a really cool soundtrack. You have to see the first one to really enjoy this one, but watching them back to back is no problem at all and makes them the perfect movie-night evening filler. Great fun to watch.If you've seen and enjoyed the first one, definitely watch this movie!"
"alindsay-al","9","1","2","26 November 2014"," a fantastic second half that improves on the first
","I really did like kill bill vol 1, however, I did think it lacked something possibly due to the fact it is a film that mainly sets up the sequel. This film once again sees the bride return of the bride on her killing spree to get to her final showdown with her old master bill. I think the first kill bill was a return to form for uma Thurman and it continued with this film with the character of the bride being expanded on and her performance being more well rounded. The supporting cast is also really good with David carrehane being fantastic as bill and his performance was necessarily great because it made the revenge hunt more interesting. The other characters are great with budd and the one eyed assassin being great characters and adding overall to the plot. As I said in my faster movie review I really like revenge stories and this one was almost flawless with the emphasis on the revenge theme really working but I do think some of the flash backs were too long and also the ending is really anticlimactic. The script is Tarantino genius and it really helps this film's story be driven along nicely. The style is also not as over the top as the first film and all the action is great with the fight scenes being very crisp. I advise you watch the two kill bill films back to back it will make the experience a lot better for this fantastic film."
"tbuttretro16","8","1","2","24 October 2014"," Tarantino bounces back with his continuation of the story of The Bride
","When I say ""bounce-back,"" don't let that fool you completely. I thought Kill Bill: Vol.1 was decent, but for the great Quentin Tarantino, that's not strong enough. Kill Bill: Vol.2 is simply everything missing from the first volume. No Crazy 88? No over-the- top blood spewing battles? No problem. This is made up with more excellent Tarantino writing. David Carradine gets a thumbs up performance as the fiendish Bill. His strong presence gives new life to the movie. Not so strong however was Michael Madsen, as Bill's brother Budd. Yes, he was very memorable in Reservoir Dogs, but in this film I found him to be a bore. There were many scenes in the movie that I couldn't get into at all. Then later on, many scenes (like the training with Pai Mei) filled the holes of the story and created much character development. I can't write this review without mentioning the outstanding Beatrix ""The Bride"" (or Black Mamba, whatever suits) Kiddo played by Uma Thurman. In the follow- up, she shows even more color to her character, besides of course red and yellow. If your concerned about the lack of crazy action like the previous volume, don't sweat it. You'll get more out of Kill Bill: Vol.2 than you'd think."
"bowmanblue","8","1","2","3 August 2014"," Slow and steady wins the race
","I'm guessing that most people won't have decided to watch 'Kill Bill Volume 2' without watching the first instalment. So, if you've already seen the first half, you may be expecting something similar from the final act. However, whereas the first half was a blood-soaked massacre of bodies and mayhem, this one is anything but.<br/><br/>I won't say exactly how many people 'The Bride' kills in this one (and it's nowhere near the seemingly infinite number of ninjas she chopped up in Part 1), but there's a big clue in the title! Yes, 'Volume 2' is a very slow film. In many ways it's more like a Tarantino film that its predecessor. It's very 'talkie' – there are tonnes of long, drawn-out scenes where characters natter to each other, seemingly going nowhere. It just is. It's there to build character. However, if you're not partial to that sort of scene, then you probably won't enjoy this part.<br/><br/>As with the first half, there are a handful of scenes that you probably feel could have been left on the cutting room floor, but, all in all, it's a pretty solid film. Yes, it's not fast-paced; it's almost deliberately slow – like the 'ying' to Part 1's 'yang.' Fans of Tarantino will probably love it anyway, but anyone who likes broodingly slow film with clever dialogue should enjoy it, too.<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"
"loumatthews23","10","1","2","1 August 2014"," Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a success. Tarantino does it again ""spoiler""
","Kill Bill Vol. 2 is the second and final installment in the Kill Bill series directed by Quentin Tarantino. The film stars Uma Thurman as the ""Bride"" Beatrix Kiddo and David Carradine as Bill. The film picks up where the first installment left off with Kiddo on a ""blood thirst rampage for revenge"" as she describes it in the opening scene. Unlike the last film this one was not as bloody and gory in the screens. This film had a lot more dialog, which gave the viewer answers to some of the back-story questions we had about Kiddos past and exactly what happened in the church that day Kiddo was shot in the head. Unlike the last film that just narrated with Bills voice from time to time we actually see what Bill looks like and the roll he plays in Kiddo;s revenge with Kiddo finally getting the revenge she deserved. Revenge is still the main purpose in Kiddo's story and the theme of the film. Tarantino does a great job keeping the film moving at a fast pace with also giving the viewer the necessary dialog to know what is going on in the film. I finished the film without having any big questions unlike Tarantino's other blockbuster Pulp Fiction. The acting in the film I don't think was the best I have seen but it was not the focus of the movie. The film had excellent editing and use of sound effects that made the acting not as noticeable. An example of this editing is when Kiddo is being buried alive. The editor chose to show shots of the hammer close up and the hammer striking the nail to show the power of the hammer sticking the nail. Then he showed close ups on Kiddo's face as the casket was nailed shut. By cutting back and forth between these close up shots help show the fear in Kiddo as each blow of the hammer strikes the nail. By doing the editing like this it gave the viewer a feeling of power in the hammer and help show the emotion that Kiddo felt being buried alive. It was as if I was being buried myself."
"Al_The_Strange","9","1","2","12 July 2014"," ""When I arrive at my destination, I am gonna kill Bill.""
","Quentin Tarantino channels the manic, ultraviolent, stylized energy of cheesy kung-fu cinema, American westerns, and a slight twist of Italian horror, and he uses it all like threads to weave one of the greatest revenge stories ever made. Both Kill Bill movies collectively form a coherent, cohesive, sublime storytelling package; ideally, they should be watched back-to-back to understand every nuance of the story and the characters, since there is so much depth to them.<br/><br/>Volume 2 of this saga fills in the gaps that its predecessor left behind, not only in following up on the rest of the Bride's rampage, but also in revealing her full back story. But while Volume 1 had tons of rip-roaring action and an extremely vivid style, this follow-up is much more toned-down and mellow, laden with more dialogue than swordplay. In a way, this falls more in line with Tarantino's other work, but I personally favor the first film more for being sublimely entertaining. As it is, Volume 2 tends to be a bit long-winded and dry.<br/><br/>That being said, it still has a lot of brilliant moments that are worth seeing, including the burial scene, the fight between the Bride and Elle Driver, the brutal training scenes with Pai Mei, and the last half-hour or so, which builds up to a beautiful bittersweet ending.<br/><br/>For the most part, it's the story that counts, and it excels at taking characters we already know and love, and taking them to the next level. The full reasons for both sides of the conflict are finally revealed, generating empathy for both Bill and the Bride. Any other movie would be content in leaving things as a plain, straightforward black-and-white affair, but in this case, there's much more insight to the characters and the overall plot. It all builds up to the inevitable climax, which pulls out one of the most heart-wrenching twists imaginable. Through it all, the film provides the most satisfying ending possible, and it makes the entire Kill Bill saga one of the most endearing and complete storytelling experiences made.<br/><br/>This film is crafted with superb photography and plenty of flashy editing. A few title cards, flashbacks, and asides are thrown into the mix for a stylized effect. Acting continues to impress: Uma Thurman is effectively perfect in her role, and it's especially notable how physically demanding her role must have been. David Carradine exhibits an interesting presence as Bill, while Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah excel at being villains we love to hate. Writing is very sharp and interesting. This production boasts some good-looking sets, props, costumes, and locales. Music is pretty good at times, though I enjoy the music choices of Volume 1 better.<br/><br/>While Volume 1 excels at the action and style but comes up a little shorter on substance, Volume 2 is the opposite, subduing the action to favor the dialogue and storytelling. Some people may like one over the other. I personally prefer Volume 1, but this sequel is essential for the complete experience, and it adds up to a satisfying saga. If you can handle the violent bits, the whole affair is highly recommended.<br/><br/>4.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Perfect | Film: Very Good)"

Carradine is an asset here where we see much more of him like Madsen who plays Bill's younger wilder brother. Hey would we want him any other way. Kill Bill 2 is more a sedate action flick, even the massacre in that church where Bea bought it, the violence there was veiled as we only heard shooting coming out of the church. May'be it was Tarantino's intention to make this part less violent, but still we can't get our head around, that this is adjoined to the first all out bloody outing. With a few dead stops, we have some lengthy scenes too with this one, some philosophical involving Bea being trained by an grumpy old fart of a master, when I think of all those stone steps, I get tired. Too is Carradine's scene near the end, as he lectures little Bea's daughter about death. And the Tarantino humour hasn't gone astray either, the scene with Larry Bishop lecturing Madsen in his office about work ethics was my favourite scene. Michael Parks, incidentally plays another character, not notorious sheriff Pete McGraw, who bought the farm in From Dusk To Dawn. With all the critiques, call them inadequacies, just mentioned, this still comes as good solid entertainment, in a well told tale that only it's master Tarantino can tell."
"OllieSuave-007","8","1","2","4 March 2014"," Artistically done action sequel.
","This is director Quentin Tarantino's sequel to his action epic, Kill Bill Vol. 1. The intriguing story about the vengeful ""The Bride"" (Uma Thurman) continues as she seeks ultimate justice against her traitor, Bill (David Carradine), leader of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. This time, the Bride battles Bill's younger brother Budd (Michael Madsen), and Elle Driver (Darryl Hannah) in an epic tour de force to get to Bill.<br/><br/>This movie continues the artistry over substance method, delving into Chinese and Japanese martial arts, which are more emphasized as the Bride's intense and grueling martial arts training with the commanding and powerful master Pai Mei (Gordan Liu) are depicted in large parts of the movie. The Bride learns to wield swords, punch out wood and be swift with her hands - a spectacle to watch. Instead of a flowing plot, this movie like its prequel is divided into chapters, with each section delving into one of the Bride's mission or trainings and the ultimate battle between her and Elle Driver, which I thought were one of two best fighting scenes in both movies (the other is the battle with Gogo Yubari in the first film). The fight with Driver is extremely intense and mesmerizing to watch.<br/><br/>The filmmakers again captured the tension and sensitivity in each chapter, making the audience aware of the assassins' danger and the Bride's hunger for revenge. The main problem ***spoiler*** I had with this movie was that the climatic battle between the Bride and Bill was very short. You would think that after going through so much sweat, blood and tears, the final battle would be more epic and grand. Yet, Bill didn't show much of his moves or proved he was a force to be reckon with.<br/><br/>But, this is still one of most intense action movies I've seen, and one with the largest supply of bloody action with explicit gore. So, there is also a warning label for people attempting to watch this.<br/><br/>Grade B+"

","The characters are interesting, always though retro development, and the action virtually non-stop. The best explanation of anything was saved for the end in David Carridines' superhero mythology speech. Vivaca Fox, Lucy Liu, Daryl Hannah, Michael Madsen play out their parts, but it is a mocking Chia Hui Liu who puts on the performance that you'll remember for some time. I love how the whip sound effect is played every time he flips his long thin white beard and mustache! In KB-I, I wanted (and got) the Tarantino experience, while I was more interested in getting answers in KB-II.

"regienaldg-283-237153","10","1","2","5 August 2012"," An excellent conclusion to first volume
","I agree with what most people say about this movie, that it has less actions and more talking. Yes, there were really less actions unlike the first volume and more conversations but then again, those conversations were the heart of the movie. More conversations but there was never a nonsense dialogue in this movie. Everyone who talked in the movie talked with conviction and were sometimes informational (like Elle Driver's information about the black mamba). It is through those conversations that the viewer is able to grasp the meaning of the movie, the implications and essence of the characters' actions, and the characters' behaviors that defined the story. In fact those dialogues were the ones that made this movie quintessential.'The acting was superb. I am particularly impressed by Daryl Hannah's portrayal of the evil and remorseless Elle Driver. Her performance was so excellent I would have handed her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. The climax was great. It ended well with a resolved conflict.<br/><br/>Again Quentin Tarantino showcased another masterpiece. This is a movie that dealt with an individual's resolution of the conflict and consequences of one's actions. Kill Bill Vol. 2 encompassed all movie genres and uncovered individual conflicts and issues that most movies don't."
"khanbaliq2","8","1","2","6 July 2010"," Quentin Tarantino's sprawling homage to action films of both the East and the West reaches its conclusion.
","The Bride (Uma Thurman) continues her revenge against her ex-boss (David Carradine) and his two surviving henchmen (Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah).<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a much baggier production than Vol. 1, in which attempts at thoughtfulness and deeper characterisation fall dismayingly flat. There are good moments, but when this rampage stops roaring, it reveals itself as a bit of a sham. At the 2005 MTV Movie Awards, Vol. 2 was nominated for best film, Thurman was nominated for best female performance, and the fight between The Bride and Elle Driver won Best Fight."
"Flyer78","9","1","2","24 July 2009"," One of my all time favorites, Tarantino at his best.
","Kill Bill Volume 1 was a very enjoyable and fun film for me, but one of my main complaints was the same complaint many others had- The movie relied on vicious action, and told little of a story. Quentin has always been my favorite director, but even I thought that the only reason Volume 1 received so much praise was because it was a Tarantino film, and that fact somewhat blinded people of its true essence, and that was a standard action film with gallons of blood, although in fairness, it had one of the greatest action scenes of all time featuring The Bride vs The Crazy 88.<br/><br/>But Volume 2 on the other hand is much different from the original Kill Bill film. You can truly see what Tarantino's purpose was when making these two movies, and he did not disappoint. Volume 1 set up all of the questions, and gave vague reasons why exactly The Bride wants to murder her former boss and ex-lover, Bill. And now, Volume 2 answers all of those questions, and goes into deeper detail as to why Bride feels such a strong need to kill Bill. To use an analogy, Volume 1 opened the box and dumped out all of the pieces to the jigsaw puzzle, scattering them all about, and you know very little concerning where to go from there. But Volume 2 joins up all of those puzzle pieces, and by the end of Volume 2, all the pieces are together, and it creates a beautiful picture.<br/><br/>If you are one of those people who only enjoyed Volume 1 for the action and the actual storyline does not concern you, don't expect to enjoy Volume 2 as much as the previous installment. The second is much more intriguing and tells a much deeper story, as well as developing the characters much more. Don't get me wrong, there a few fantastic fight scenes in this film, but this is by no means an action-packed splatterfest.<br/><br/>As for the acting, in a word, extraordinary. Uma Thurman outdid herself as The Bride, Michael Madsen did great as the character Budd (one of the best characters in all of films, might I add. He's so mysterious in a sense), and Daryl Hannah was fantastic as Elle. But folks, let me tell you- the late great David Carradine stole the show. He is nothing short of ideal for the character of Bill.<br/><br/>Tarantino's Kill Bill movies are not for everyone, but then again, none of Quentin's films are for everyone. But I found this a very enjoyable film, and I think everyone who enjoys an intriguing story with heartpounding action, and a touching ending should without a doubt watch this film.<br/><br/>Oh, and did I mention that the musical score Robert Rodriguez did was incredible? The only thing I can think of that was better was the score Ennio Morricone did for Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy. But let's be honest, will that score ever be beaten? You bet not.<br/><br/>But back to Kill Bill. Awesome movie, watch it.<br/><br/>9/10"
"I_Love_Spielberg","9","1","2","13 April 2009"," More western really than kung fu, but still good nonetheless
","""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" concludes the Bride's revenge streak. She's already killed two members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Club and she's looking for more, all the way down to Bill. But she's in for a surprise.<br/><br/>This was, in my opinion, better than the first in that you had more of a back story on the Bride; how she was able to handle the sword and how she's able to fight. You also have a more inside view on what started the Bride's revenge, what the turn of events were. Yes, it's not as kick-ass violent as the first, but in some ways, that's a good thing. I'm actually kind of happy that Quentin Tarantino didn't get too violent with it, even though it does have its share of violent moments.<br/><br/>Overall, if you like the first one, you'll probably like the second one. If not, then oh well. But I do recommend it to anyone who shows interest in it."
"Jacques98","10","1","2","3 September 2008"," Better than the first, but not as entertaining.
","This is the only movie I've ever seen that I knew would be perfect long before it was over. When the action happens, it is much more gritty and cringe-worthy than the first Kill Bill. The final climax is nothing but sheer cliché-defying genius that I'm sure will make a lot of people made, but I still can't deny the awesome moral that it brings.<br/><br/>This movie has some of the most amazing and intense scenes in cinema and is not to be missed by anyone. It surpasses it's processor in nearly every level. Humor, grit, genius, originality, except . . .<br/><br/>. . . the only thing that disappointed me: the lack of blood. After the gallons of it in Kill Bill, I would have at least expected one scene for old time's sake. Also, the talking scenes can be a little boring because they're not as good as Pulp Fiction. It isn't as entertaining as the first movie, even though everything about it was improved.<br/><br/>But this is a must see. Amazing in every way.<br/><br/>10/10"
"kismit","8","1","2","5 April 2008"," A nice wrap up to the chaos of the first one.
","I enjoyed the first one somewhat. Good cast, and Tarentino quirky with over the top villains but a surplus of the red stuff. I went to Vol 2 expecting more of the same and was very surprised. Reduced splatter, plot and actions explained! This really does elevate the total package to near excellence. I could see people who were put off by Vol 1 not seeing 2 at all. That is a real shame, but these were not originally conceived as two separate movies, and the slaughterhouse action of Vol 1, while way too heavy handed, was meant to be tempered by the slower paced exposition of Vol 2. A solid 8 but allow enough time to watch both halves."
"lagriff05","8","1","2","4 April 2008"," Yep, I liked this one better.
","Here's where things really kick into gear. Paying homage to cheesy martial arts flicks, Wild West shootouts, revenge flicks and more all in one go, the second half of Kill Bill could only have been topped if both films had been released in one box.<br/><br/>Again, this isn't perfect, but it is extremely enjoyable. The plot comes into full here, and thus we are able to more fully enjoy Kill Bill. The film's saving grace is David Carradine, though, who is playing every bit the character I expect from Tarantino's flicks. Memorable dialogue and spot on acting and conviction ensure that Carradine's performance is ace, only aided by the excellent performances of a number of side characters. <br/><br/>Kill Bill is truly an adventure, with the blending of genres a key point in its enjoyability, alongside Tarantino's signature stylistic eccentricities. There's nothing else like this movie out there, and for connoisseurs and lovers of film, this is pure gold all the way through."
"addicott","9","1","2","23 March 2008"," More subtle than Volume 1 (what isn't?) yet almost as much fun.
","Kill Bill Vol. 1 is by far my favorite movie in recent memory. I've seen it 4 times and I still love every second. I love it for its outstanding boldness and relentless intensity.<br/><br/>Volume 2 is quite different from volume 1  that should be a given. Originally conceived as a single movie, one shouldn't expect the second half to mirror the first, especially when it's written and directed by Tarrantino. Don't expect another sassy knife fight or Kung-Fu bloodbath  expect the unexpected.<br/><br/>This pertains especially to the pacing. Volume 1 was fast and furious but Volume 2 is more contemplative. There's more word play than sword play and all the characters get ample room to blossom... before they are killed.<br/><br/>Everyone is colorful and amusing. Tarrantino has a way of simultaneously building fondness and contempt for the players, such that when one heavy back-stabs another, you feel a mix of elation and annoyance. Go ahead and like someone, but don't get too attached<br/><br/>Kill Bill is brimming with great performances, any one of which would single-handedly carry an average movie. Michael Madsen is Budd, Bill's estranged brother. (The two have a complicated relationship.) Although he appears to have gone tender, Budd is not to be under-estimated! Larry Bishop is hilarious as the sleazeball boss of the strip club where Budd is slumming as a bouncer. Darryl Hannah plays Ellie Driver, a truly bitchy villain you'll love to hate.<br/><br/>David Carradine is the charismatic Bill. (aka: The Snake Charmer) In the opening sequence of Volume 1, we saw him at his very worst but most of the time he is surprisingly pleasant to be around. But by his own admission he is a murdering bastard and he seems to have a knack for royally pissing people off. We see this with his former mentor Hattori Hanzo, his brother Buddy, and most especially the film's protagonist, The Bride (played of course by Uma Thurman).<br/><br/>Uma continues to dazzle as she did in the first volume. Seldom has a heroine been cast in so many different lights. Depending on the scene, she can look plain or glamorous, confident or vulnerable, exuberant or despondent. Her moods go all over the map but they're always convincing.<br/><br/>There's a few very cool dual roles. Gordon Liu played the ""Crazy 88"" commander from Vol. 1 and in real life he's the fight choreographer. In Vol. 2, he plays Pai Mei, a lonesome hermit who is the high priest of all martial arts. (Apparently Tarrantino dubbed the voice in Cantonese!) It's highly amusing to watch him put Uma through her paces. (This sequence also helps to illustrate how Uma's character became the deadliest woman in the world and is able to prevail in one particularly hopeless situation.) You won't even recognize Michael Parks, who was the Texas Ranger in Vol. 1.<br/><br/>Volume 2 relies heavily on dialog. This has always been an exceptionally strong point for Tarrantino and he comes through as strong as ever in this picture. It takes some strain, however, to reconcile the more cerebral high of Volume 2 with the sensational absence of subtlety in Volume 1. You have to shift mental gears to appreciate the entire package. It's well worth the effort."
"DVD_Connoisseur","Null","1","2","3 January 2008"," A powerful and mature second installment
","I was unduly critical when I first watched ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" on its UK theatrical release. Watching the second installment again last night, I'm unsure why I reacted so negatively to the film - it's an absolute corker.<br/><br/>The second volume is a slower, more atmospheric affair than its predecessor. However, it's a perfectly faithful finale to this epic tale and has more than its fair share of set-pieces and memorable dialogue.<br/><br/>Michael Madsen stands out as the down-on-his-luck Budd, a character who's had the stuffing knocked out of him over the years and who is a shadow of his former self. Daryl Hannah is also splendid as the psychotic Elle Driver.<br/><br/>9 out of 10. Definitely worthy of a second viewing."
"brando647","9","1","2","26 December 2007"," It's Time for the Bride to Kill Bill...
","The Bride reaches the conclusion to her quest for revenge! After the first volume followed the Bride's confrontations with the first two targets (Vernita Green and O-Ren Ishii), the second volume shows her hunt for the remaining two DiVAS members, as well as Bill himself. We really struck me as odd about volume two was that it was a COMPLETELY different style than its predecessor. Where volume one was a bloody kung-fu exploitation film, volume two tones it down and delves more into the story. It goes into greater detail about what led up to the attack on the Bride, as well as where she received her training that turned her into one of the most dangerous women in the world.<br/><br/>This volume has considerably less violence and less bloodshed. The fights are still spectacular with some of the greatest choreography I've seen in modern movies. The fights are brutal and still pack a serious punch. The battle between the Bride and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) is basically an all-out brawl with elements of martial arts giving it some grace. As I said before, we are given more story in this volume so we get more information around the legend of the Bride. My favorite scene in the whole movie has to be the chapter dealing with her training under Pai Mei (Gordon Liu); I really just loved the character. As a result of increased storytelling, the movie does move at a slightly slower pace than the first volume but it never fully stalls.<br/><br/>Michael Madsen rocks in this movie, but then again I like him in pretty much every role I've seen him in. My favorite addition to this volume was Bill himself. David Carradine almost made me sympathetic for the character when he explains the rationale behind his actions. Unfortunately, the ending was a bit anti-climactic compared to what I went into the movie expecting. For an entire 4 hour saga revolving around the hunt for Bill, I expected something more explosive. It was still a satisfying conclusion to Tarantino's epic tale of revenge and helped make the 'Kill Bill' saga one of Tarantino's best pieces of work."

Budget $30 million USD [2] All Movie Guide profile IMDb profile A few minutes before the events that open the first volume, Bill (Carradine) tracks down The Bride and her friends as they are gathered for her wedding rehearsal. He is polite and mild-mannered, and even consents to being introduced to the groom as her father. She takes her place at the altar as the other four Deadly Vipers arrive at the chapel, weapons in tow, to kill everyone at the rehearsal.<br/><br/>In the present, Bill ventures to the California desert to talk to his brother Budd, aka ""Sidewinder"" (Madsen), another former Deadly Viper.

Anticipating her entry, Budd shoots her in the chest with rock salt the moment she opens his door, then injects her with a sedative. Budd calls Driver and offers to sell her The Bride's Hanzo sword for one million dollars. The Bride is buried alive by Budd.<br/><br/>As she lies in her grave, The Bride remembers her early training in China, when Bill took her to the temple of legendary martial arts master Pai Mei (an intentionally classic example of the elderly martial arts master stock character). He uses cruelty as a tool for discipline and obedience. Although he ""hates Caucasians, despises Americans and has nothing but contempt for women"", he takes The Bride in. Her training was extremely rigorous, and she endured many hardships, but she became a formidable warrior under his tutelage. In the present, The Bride calls on Pai Mei's training to break out of the coffin and claw her way up to freedom."
"charchuk","8","1","2","26 March 2007"," Story drags it down
","It's definitely the more story-oriented of the two, and that might hurt it. Since volume one is all action, all of the plot and character development is left to this part, which makes it a bit too long and talky. That's not to say the dialogue isn't good, because it is, but parts of this film - especially near the end - drag on a lot longer than they need to. The climax takes forever, and then it is somewhat anti-climatic, though the final act of revenge was fitting. The action is sparse but awesome, and the acting is significantly better - probably because David Carradine's actually in this one - but it is slightly worse than the first volume. Although, Pai Mei is my favourite character in the set, so I have to give it props for that."
"ctrout","10","1","2","21 March 2007"," Even Better Than The First
","I first saw this one on its opening day, April 16, 2004, just as I had seen Volume One on its opening day, six months earlier. The night before I saw it I refreshed my memory by viewing the first film and I was glad that I did. Both movies really should be viewed as one single film because of how much you miss if you see just one of them. However, I will say that each movie can also stand on its own as a great film. <br/><br/>I'll begin by saying that I enjoyed this one just a little bit more than the first. I think that has a lot to do with David Carradine. Quentin Tarantino has a knack for bringing fading stars back from obscurity and he did it again with this great actor. Carradine plays the title character and brings Bill to life so much so that you kind of find yourself a little worried about the fact that our protagonist might actually end up killing him as the title suggests.<br/><br/>Speaking of our hero, Uma Thurman delivers yet another powerful performance as ""The Bride,"" a former assassin hell bent on getting revenge for what her former ""co-workers"" did to her on her wedding day. This chapter in the two volume series continues with The Bride's journey and leads up to a fantastic climax that only Tarantino, the best director of today's generation, could bring you.<br/><br/>That's not all! There's even a cat fight that may go down in history as the best one ever captured on film. As one of the members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad on The Bride's hit list, Daryl Hannah squares off against Uma Thurman in one of the tiniest spaces to hold a fight scene, a trailer home.<br/><br/>Even Michael Madsen gets in on the action! As Bill's brother, Budd, Madsen plays one of the more sympathetic roles of his career, even though he's a cold blooded bastard. His character becomes very developed and we see what we saw only a glimmer of during the Vivica A. Fox sequence in the first: someone like us. We all know that Madsen is just another bad guy, but he shows us that those ""bad guys"" are just regular people trying to live in a world that doesn't want them.<br/><br/>Of course, we can't forget about Pai Mei. The most fearsome martial arts expert is played superbly in this film by Gordon Liu. Although he speaks only Mandarin in the film, his intimidating looks and fiery delivery give us another great supporting performance in a movie that I'll stay with any time I happen to catch it on television. I'm sure that you would do the same. <br/><br/>Yes, this film is a bloody good conclusion to the Kill Bill saga and, if you've seen the first, you definitely need to see this one to find out what happens and how it goes down. I recommend this to anyone and everyone because it's one of the best films of this decade."

","First of all i would like to say that i'm only 13 and when I saw this movie I was amazed.I saw this one before the first but then I watched them again and I can say this is by far better than the other.<br/><br/>First the action scenes there are some but nothing compared to the ones in the first vol. being the best in this movie probably the one between The Bride and Elle Driver.One of the best moments in the movie is in my point of view the conversation between Bill and the Bride, I could say that no word is miss placed but that isn't Tarantino's style (what kind of gangsters talk about hamburgers in the car) but the overall is amazing.<br/><br/>About the characters first you have Bill who at first sight seems a cold hearted hit-man but then you understand that's not the case and in my point of view he only did that to The Bride to see if she is worthy of taking is child and how far would she go to get revenge, like he says i'm not sadistic i'm masochistic and if he wanted to kill her he would had shot her in the middle of the eyes not in the side of the head.About Elle Driver she is probably the most ""bad"" person in the movie she as no sense of honor or regret and last but not least we have Bud, Bud is probably the character with most sense of honor and he truly regrets his old life being probably the exact opposite of Elle.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is amazing like in any Tarantino film.

"jluis1984","9","1","2","24 October 2006"," The best part was saved for the end...
","A year after the release of ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"", director Quentin Tarantino's tribute to the 70s, appears the conclusion to the Bride's quest for revenge. While originally meant to be one single film, the studio forced Tarantino to make two films out of it due to the very long runtime the film would have had. Whether this information is true or not, personally I think that the decision to split the film in two was actually beneficial for the plot, as this allowed Tarantino the liberty to take two slightly different approaches (although the overall ""feeling"" is still the same in the two films) to tell one single bloody story of love, hate, and revenge.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" presents the final part of The Bride's (Uma Thurman) saga, as we follow the former assassin in her way to meet Bill's younger brother, Budd (Michael Madsen), and her nemesis, Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), numbers three and four in her list after killing O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and Vernita Green (Viviva A. Fox). However, the path to finally find and kill Bill (David Carradine) is filled with troubles and surprises, as the remaining members of The Deadly Viper Assassination squad are now expecting her and ready to make her meet her end. One question remains, will she be strong enough to kill her former boss and ex lover, Bill? <br/><br/>Just like the former chapter, ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" is an ode to the films that inspired Tarantino to make films, and while the first volume of the saga was focused on 70s films (specially martial arts movies), this volume goes further in the past and showcases Tarantino's taste for noir films (in a very well-done intro that captures that style) and specially for Westerns. As the Bride moves to the West to face Budd and Elle, the Western genre begins to domain the film's style with nods not only to the Spaghetti Westerns of the 60s, but also to John Ford's classic films. Tarantino plays with his influences and pays a respectful homage to them (even manage to include a new nod to martial arts films) without going out of the context of his revenge tale.<br/><br/>""Vol. 2"" marks a definitive change in tone from the first, as while ""Vol. 1"" is a visually arresting display of action, ""Vol. 2"" moves in a more personal, introspective environment, closer to the Western films that influenced it. Tarantino's script takes a strength unseen in the first part and the film becomes the character study that was missed in the first. The Bride's quest for revenge becomes more complex than what it seemed at first, and her enemies as well present inner conflicts that show a development from the first film. It's overall a less flashy, but more meaty film that completes the first part in a very fitting way. If ""Vol. 1"" is the visceral passionated side of the story, ""Vol. 2"" is the intellectual (although no less passionated) side of it.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman is back as The Bride and here finally she can show that not only she can do lots of stunt, she also can act. Her character's background is really expanded here and so are her chances to shine. Again, it is her character what drives the film, so her performance truly makes the difference between a dull movie and an exciting film. David Carradine finally appears as Bill, presenting a sympathetic side of a character we learned to hate in ""Vol. 1"". Not an easy task for an actor, and surprisingly Carradine makes it work. Personally, I had little faith in his performance but was pleasantly surprised by it. Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah are fantastic in their roles as the Bride's former teammates; Madsen in a low-key performance that shows the underrated talent the man has, and Hannah in a role that shows her great skill for black comedy.<br/><br/>Many people bashes both ""Kill Bill"" volumes accusing them of being rip-offs of classic films, but I find such claims a bit naive or biased, as even when Tarantino certainly borrows a lot from those movies, he does it in a respectful way (and also carefully places the elements in his own world) that can only be accused of being a tribute rather than a shameless steal. Personally, I found ""Vol. 2"" to be the best part of the saga, mainly in the way the characters become as important as the visual style, and also in the way it references its influences without the flashy display of the first part. Still, watching the film is rather pointless without having seen ""Vol. 1"", as unlike the first one, this movie can't stand alone on its own (well, it's a direct sequel).<br/><br/>While the first ""Kill Bill"" is a triumph of style over substance, ""Vol. 2"" is certainly the substance's revenge. Tarantino concludes the Bride's saga in an almost flawless way that improves the first part and leaves the door open to new interesting projects in the future. Probably the separation in two volumes was for the best, as ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" is a satisfactory conclusion for a bloody tale of revenge. 9/10"

One of the things I had heard about Kill Bill Volumes 1 and 2 is that Quentin Tarrintino HAD to put this is two volumes because it was running too long. This was the time when people were sitting though such epics as ""The Lord of the Rings"". I don't think its about the time, I think its about the content. I would have had no problem whatsoever sitting through this as one whole film.<br/><br/>Our poor heroine has endured much to get to Mr. Bill and finally this brings you to the showdown between our heroine, Ms. Kiddo and Mr. Bill.

Quite the paradox for the continuing calculated things he does when they meet and she starts putting the final pieces of her life together.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarrintino is a bit more straightforward with this part of the film, not relying too much on the pulp fiction aspects of unfolding the film - we already saw that in part 1, but more on the final steps of revenge and getting to the last piece of the puzzle for our heroine to make that happen, Bill. It unfolds more like the traditional Martial Arts films, and ends beautifully as a homage to them.<br/><br/>Again, one of Tarrintino's best efforts. If you can so, watch Kill Bill as a complete work, Parts 1 and 2 in one sitting..it's worth it."
"deadmanjones","9","1","2","2 September 2006"," The Legend Continues.
","Hitchcockian noir bids us welcome and 70s Kung Fu provides a wonderfully welcome aside, but above all this film wears its Leone / Ford Fan Club badge with even more prominence than the first instalment. Wondering whether it's as good as Volume 1 is fairly pointless, because this truly is one film in two volumes. Maybe the second film isn't as energetic as the first, but that's to be expected from a conclusion, and the film never really disappoints. It still manages to cram in a scene more horrifying than the hospital bed scene from volume one, & it still manages to have a fight scene even more brutal and cold. If you have no soul you could, at a pinch, say it is less fun than the first. But it's an operatic climax that is deserved and needed and which you'll applaud. Bloke in front of us did anyway."

But mama look at her now.<br/><br/>  Uma Thurman in the same get up as Elle Driver wouldn't cut it; there aren't a handful of women, not discounting Hollywood actresses that could pull off what Darryl does here.  She is the best villainess we've seen, perhaps ever.<br/><br/>  Never warmed by Uma, I am a fan of hers now.  She indeed shows us talent we never expected or frankly even demanded.  Usually the most wooden of actresses, she redeems all her career just speaking to us through the windshield of her car as the movie opens.  But she is never as riveting as her co-star; Ms. Hannah is a total showstopper in every frame in which she is visible, and that includes phone calls.<br/><br/>  This by way of introducing THE FIGHT.  When Uma and Darryl have at it, as we hope they will, all girlfights ever recorded are left in Mohave trailer dust.  Even the superior opening fight of Vol. I pales in comparison to this frenetic kinetic combat.  We've never seen anything like this.<br/><br/>  And so it goes for all of the film.  Interspersing humor, raw violence and quiet introspective minimalist dialog we get a stew of visual and aural greatness.  Of course this movie is all about style.  Why would you want or expect otherwise from a Tarantino flik?<br/><br/>  None in the audience spoke, looked at their watch or even wiggled.

","Quentin Tarantino is back with the second part of the his latest work, Kill Bill. The first part of Kill Bill can be compared with the work of ""Naturel Born Killers"". In the second part of Kill Bill Tarantino has really captured the brilliant work of Pulp Fiction. All of the individuals are as original as one can get. The short and sharp/witty dialogs truly shows the mark of Tarantinos incredible work that can easily be compared to Pulp Fiction. To sum up. Kill Bill is a true masterpiece with the great screenplay of Naturel Born Killers, the flashbacks of Reservoir Dogs and the dialogs of Pulp Fiction. If you haven't seen it - see it.

If anything could be added, I would like to have seen a flashback on the story of Brother Budd, a most interesting piece of human debris. Kudos on the fitting end of Ms Driver and her one remaining eye thus avenging the murder of Pei Mei. Tarantino is master artist without peer in the use of blood and gore as the media of choice. Hmmmmmm, gore!<br/><br/>That's all I really have to say, but teacher requires at least 10 lines.

","Kill Bill Volume 2 <br/><br/>The film begins with a flashback to the wedding rehearsal of the Bride (Uma Thurman) in El Paso, Texas, that is interrupted by the arrival of Bill (David Carradine), the leader of a band of assassins and her former boss and lover. Pregnant with his child, she has decided to start her life anew. Bill's heart is broken, and he responds by releasing all his pent-up anger. As we remember from ""Kill Bill,"" the Bride survives the massacre and a gunshot wound to her head and vows to avenge herself on Bill and his assassins who ended her bid for a normal life. <br/><br/>There are numerous ""problems"" with KB2, the main one being the simple fact that it's too damn ""talky."" Almost nothing happens for about the first 50 minutes of KB2. The film immediately put me off when it spent the first 20 minutes (which felt like two hours) rehashing the wedding scene, yet again!<br/><br/>The Bride's martial-arts clash with the eye-patched Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) provides a welcome burst of adrenaline, as the pair do expertly choreographed battle in the extremely close quarters of a trailer home. Erasing all former images of herself, Hannah provides the most venomous of the ""Kill Bill"" villains. But none of these fights compares with the ""Vol. 1"" climactic samurai battle. What's missing, and this is bound to disappoint fans of the first part, are the fights. There is very little actual swordplay, and none of the demented set pieces that gave the first film its insane energy. In all ""Kill Bill 2"" feels like a dull knife. (C)"

"ivanm-5","8","1","2","11 May 2004"," Much slower than Vol 1 but a satisfying conclusion to the story
","Kill Bill Vol 1 was an out-and-out comic book romp, full of violence but always with tongue firmly in cheek. The violence count is severely reduced in Vol 2 but arguably more disturbing. The big difference is that Vol 2 is about the characters rather than the action. Here we begin to find out who these people really are and that, despite there penchant for assassination, they are real flesh-and-blood human beings. The result is that expectations of another high-speed violence-fest are dashed but the seemingly chaotic events of the first film finally get explained. The pace slackens quite markedly towards the end causing an audible amount of fidgeting in the theatre where I viewed it but sitting it out to the end is well worthwhile. As before, Tarantino presents the story in a variety of film styles, my particular favorite being the black-and-white Film Noir that opens the movie. I'd love to see Tarantino do a whole movie in this style but I'm not sure his attention-span would last that long."
"redkiwi","8","1","2","15 May 2004"," Good, but is it getting old hat?
","Kill Bill Vol 2 is the latest in Tarantino's epics, and is very good with it.  As a sequel to last year's very over the top and very violent flick with many throwbacks to martial arts classics, it's often funny but also well put together and watchable elsewhere.<br/><br/>However, is it time to ask the question as to whether Tarantino is becoming old hat?  Throughout the film I had an undercurrent going around in my head that this was following what is becoming a set pattern for Tarantino films -- they're becoming a tad manufactured.  As he makes them at significant intervals, this isn't as much of an issue but are his films now becoming over crafted?  Is he becoming a parody of himself?<br/><br/>As ever, let's see his next move."

Anyone just out for gore should avoid this one. Sorry to you bored, bloodthirsty multitudes!  you have to listen to people speaking! Gasp! (don't get me wrong, i love gore, but i also love a good plot). Anyone who says this movie has no plot is dead wrong. It has one of the most complicated plots you'll ever see in an action film.

","I heard this movie was really good, but was skeptical from the start because I hadn't seen he very first movie. Not to worry, the plot makes total sense and this movie fills in all the details you need to know. Further still, the acting was really good and so was the script. Probably the most disturbing thing about this film, I found, was the way Beatrice finishes off Ellen. It just looked so realisitc, painful and way too gory.  Very realistic indeed. I think the star of this film however, is Bill, the actor did a great job of portraying a villain with a sense of humor so well that it helped carry the movie when Uma Thurman's acting looked awkward. Speaking of Uma Thurman you can tell that she's not at all a very good fighter - she looks too awkward at moments and you cant tell some of the work has been done by a stunt double.<br/><br/>I was also surprised at how graphic this movie is when you factor in the horror of Beatrice being buried alive. One minor gripe however is the way they show which chapter of the novel is playing, as well as that stupid actor that plays Pai Mei. I know him well. He stars in a lot of crappy chinese soap operas. Not only was it clear to me that he couldn't act at all but that they got the translations done all wrong. I understand Chinese perfectly and it only makes Uma Thurman sound stupid by giving simple answers to complex questions. Nonetheless, this movie is noteworthy.<br/><br/>A"

And Uma Thurman as the Bride goes on to wreak havoc in her revenge plan, until she finds her ex-boss and arch-nemesis, Bill.  It's an exciting story!  The body count isn't as high as it was in ""Vol. 1,"" but there's still plenty of gore and pain.  The Bride's harsh training under Pai Mei is rather painful to watch!  Quentin Tarantino's use of cinematic styles sell the story, with references to the genres of kung fu and the spaghetti western.  His use of music is also used well to set the feel of every scene. Tarantino might not be done with some of these characters, and it'll be interesting to see how their stories will continue."

"marinos theodore","10","1","2","5 May 2004"," Well worth the wait
","Kill Bill Volume 1 was my favorite 2003 film. It was one of the rare times i was laughing in a cinema not because the movie was funny (intentionally or unintentionally) but because i was enjoying mt self. It was the most fun time i' ve had in a cinema for a long-long time! After a six month wait period, the film's conclusion finally arrived. Did it leave up to my expectations? Yes it did, although in a totally different way.<br/><br/>Let's get on thing straight right from the start: Kill Bill Vol. 2 is entirely different to Vol. 1. It's almost like watching a completely different film.<br/><br/>First of all the action takes several steps back and character development steps forth. The Bride (whose real name is revealed but i won't spoil it for you) is almost an entirely different person this time around. She no longer is an unlikable super-bitch. She shows an incredible range of emotions from fear to sympathy and love and this time we really do CARE for her and her cause. Bill also gets some serious development. We learn about his relationship with the Bride and why he decided to kill her, and in the end we do feel some sympathy for him too. There also is a lot of Tarantino-esque dialog in this installment. Bill's take on Superman was one of the smartest things i've heard in a movie this year!<br/><br/>The action and humor  although toned down, still play an important part in the movie. Volume 2 is more brutal than Volume 1, and even though it doesn't contain any scenes like the Crazy 88 massacre (who as we find out weren't really 88 LOL) it's very violent and graphic (no blood (gaizers this time). The duel with Elle is truly a thing to behold! But by far the best part of the movie is the chapter entitled ""The Cruel Tutelage Of Pei Mei"" where we witness the Bride's training by a realy old Kung-Fu master. Their duels and Pei Mei's lines are the movie's highlights!<br/><br/>Direction wise Tarantino works his magic once again. This time the film is more Spagheti-Western oriented and it almost entirelly takes place in a desert (in El Passo none the less...) and the soundtrack is full of songs by Robert Rodriguez and Ennio Moriconne. The usual Kung-Fu tricks (sudden close ups etc) still make their appearance as well as some really cool camera angles and tricks (the end of the opening sequence is a real tour de force for Quentin Tarantino). Kudos have to be given to Tarantino for creating the best and more nightmarish sequence of someone being buried alive, you'll be surprised by how uncomfortable he'll make you feel just by watching a black screen and hearing strange sounds. Credit is also due to Uma Thurman who did one hell of a nice job as the Bride (heck she deserves an Oscar for the last sequence of the film alone) and to David Carandine who was deliciously evil and enjoyable in the role of the eponymous villain.<br/><br/>I only have two gripes about the movie. Sometimes the story dragged on and there were some scenes that just took up time and stalled the story. The sequence where we see Budd working at the titi bar for example was very very long and it served absolutely no purpose. My other gripe is that the Bride's duel with Bill is really short, and out of balance compared to the huge amount of dialog between the two characters that preceeds it.<br/><br/>If Vol. 1 was all style and no substance, then Vol. 2 is all style and all substance. It's a different experience in many levels but it's still a very enjoyable one. If the reason you saw Volume 1 was because you liked the slick action scenes featured in the trailers, don't even bother watching Volume 2, you will be very disappointed. I rate this movie with a perfect 10. Simply put, alongside Big Fish (which debuted here in 2004), it's the best film i've seen this far in 2004."
"s0304183","9","1","2","5 May 2004"," Homage to Kung Fu
","in the panultamate showdown between 'the bride' and bill you were led to believe that it would be a long complex battle. yet instead we see minimal contact between the 2 and just a little sword play.i believe that Tarantino did this because of David Carradine's (Bill) 70's show Kung Fu where he played the shaolin monk traveling around the 'Wild West' looking for his brother. the fight sequences in the show with Carradine were rubbish and were shot in a POV way in order to disguise Carradine's non existant martial art skills and i believe this is probably also the case in Kill Bill V.2.......Feedback? FACT/Bruce Lee co wrote the show Kung Fu and was supposed to play Carradine's character.That would have been amazing if it came into being."
"dromasca","9","1","2","8 May 2004"," Better than vol. 1
","I posted mistakenly yesterday a comment that was intended to be for vol. 1. After seeing the first 'Kill Bill' on DVD, I ran to the theaters and saw vol. 2 today - it is better.<br/><br/>One may argue whether making violent films about killers is moral. Still if morality of the times is a criteria, many art works would have never made it. 'Kill Bill' is a very good film, vol. 2 explains everything is important in a logical manner, it is superbly filmed and acted - a real treat. As vol. 1 was, vol.2 is full of cinema quotes from Terentino's masters, and for the cinema lovers this is really fun. <br/><br/>Action film fans will find less of their preferred stuff in the second film. This did not bother me at all. What I got in exchange is the really tremendous acting of David Carradine. I never forgot what a wonderful actor he can be, but I did not see him in any important film since the 80s. Here he is back, and I hope his acting will not be forgotten until the next Oscars - he deserves at least a nomination in my opinion.<br/><br/>
A few words about the ending. Leaving things un-explained as they were at the end of vol. 1 is a better artistic bet. Explaining has its problems, and explaining in films needs to conform to some rules. I think that the script and the director did a good job on this - not perfect, but very good indeed.<br/><br/>
9/10 on my personal scale. the best film of this year so far."
"dromasca","9","1","2","7 May 2004"," That's Entertainment
","Take 'Kill Bill' for what it is - good escapetionist entertainment, and you have good chances to enjoy it. Judge it according to art cinema criteria, and you risk to not like it and miss the fun. Terentino may be one of the most talented film makers around, but his violent and beautiful films are not meant to be more than entertainment, and folks looking for big artistic messages are searching in the wrong place. <br/><br/>'Kill Bill' is a revenge story, as many were written for the big screen since the beginning of the Western history. There is not too much originality in the story - what is different is the art of film making, the smart mix of quotes from all what Terentino likes in the history of cinema, from spaghetti westerns to classic Japanese samurai films, the soundtrack, and of course the unmistakable touch of non-censored violence so typical to Terentino. <br/><br/>Overall, the film is entertaining. I saw it on DVD, and I cannot wait for volume 2 release on DVD, so I intent to see it tomorrow in the theater. 8/10 on my personal scale."
"rosscinema","8","1","2","30 April 2004"," Second part is more dialogue driven but still quite impressive
","**SPOILERS**This second part of Tarantino's film ties up all the loose ends that were left after the first part ended last year and both parts are very different. Both have fight scenes and flavorful dialogue but in the first part the emphasis was on action while this is more dialogue driven. Part two has The Bride (Uma Thurman) now identified by name as Beatrix Kiddo killing the last two assassins from the Deadly Vipers Squad and then heading to kill Bill (David Carradine). Budd (Michael Madsen) is Bill's brother and he manages to shoot Kiddo with rock salt and then tranquilizes her so that he can bury her alive in a coffin. He calls Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and wants one million dollars for her and they agree but Kiddo manages to escape and goes to seek revenge.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br/><br/>Elle arrives and gives Budd his money but she has tricked him with a black mamba which kills him but then Kiddo bursts in and she and Elle are involved in a brutal fight. Kiddo wins and now she is off to find Bill and kill him but in one of the flashback sequences we see Bill bringing her to Master Pai Mei (Gordon Liu) who spends the next year or so learning martial arts. Kiddo finds Bill and before she kills him she discovers that he has the daughter that she was pregnant with! Kiddo finally meets her daughter B.B. (Perla Haney-Jardine) but later she and Bill have their ultimate showdown.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino opens this film in black and white but it does eventually move on to color and like the first part their is an abundance of music clips from both television shows like ""Ironside"" and films. This part has a noticable Italian Western tone to it and Ennio Morricone's score from ""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly"" is played during a key scene. While the first part had at least 4 big fight scenes in it this part really has one and it's a wonderful spectacle between Thurman and Hannah. Otherwise this has just a sprinkling of action elements like Thurman being buried by Madsen and the training by Liu. Who would have guessed that the best fight scene in a movie this year would be between two women? Both Hannah and Thurman should be given as much praise as possible for their achievement and both of these talented actresses show they can play any role given to them. I can't wait until both parts are available on one special edition DVD and it will be interesting to view both parts in one day. Also in this cast is Samuel L. Jackson as Rufus the organ player and an unrecognizable Bo Svenson as the Reverend. Perennial ""B"" movie actor Sid Haig pops up as a bartender as well. Tarantino has masterfully created a story that is a loving homage to the martial arts films that he so dearly idolizes and this film is dazzling both in it's choreographed action and in the way it's photographed by cinematographer Robert Richardson. Both Thurman and Carradine give unflinching performances and what aids them is Tarantino's wonderful trademark dialogue that not only adds flavor to the action but gives their character's their soul."

Part 2 (Vol. 2) totally makes up for that! ..It is the right blend of action and story.

In lesser hands, this film could have been boring and slow, but Tarantino uses concise, witty dialogue to get his point across, which allows the film to move at a good pace. He even has time to indulge himself in some comic book mythology.<br/><br/>While you wouldn't expect a violent revenge film to be a bag of gags, Tarantino manages to wring big laughs from unlikely situations.<br/><br/>The film starts with The Bride (Uma Thurman) recapping the audience on Volume I, including the events with led to The Bride being in a coma. The film rolls on to The Bride's confrontation with Budd (Michael Madsen), who buries her alive. Fortunately for The Bride, knowledge gained from her flashbacked training scenes with Martial Artist Pai Mei (who hams it up in a homage to the old 'Monkey' series) and gets her out of danger. After Budd meets his surprising fate, The Bride goes after the one-eyed Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah). In one of the films' more memorable scenes, The Bride and Elle battle in a cramped caravan before an eye-catching conclusion. Kill Bill then moves to its lengthy conclusion with Bill (David Carradine), where retribution and surprises await.<br/><br/>As in the first film, Tarantino, a major movie geek, includes little nods to his, and the films', influences. There's also a great soundtrack, including a remix of the old hit ""About Her"" by Malcolm Mclaren.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is a unique experience, with lashings of humour, violence, intellectualism and even a bit of sentimentality.<br/><br/>These factors alone will ensure Kill Bill Volume II will enjoy a healthy box-office run. But the real impact may not be seen until Tarantino's baby is released in its almost inevitable Volume I/Volume II DVD package, which is sure to be a hit among fan boys and movie buffs alike."

The most wonderful scenes for me were: 1.Uma being buried alive(but of course finding her way out eventually) 2.The anticipated cat-fight(if you want to call it that) between Uma and Elle Driver, and last but not least, the first acquaintance Uma makes with her daughter, that scene brought tears to my eyes. The only disappointing part for me was Bill's simple and quick death, but that is just because I was expecting more.<br/><br/>True Kill Bill fans will not be disappointed, for Tarantino is a genius and Uma Thurman is a Goddess in so many ways, I would give Kill Bill: Vol.2 9/10"
"wayne-eden","10","1","2","28 April 2004"," Miramax & QT are vindicated
","Having seen comments on vol 1, accusing Miramax and Tarantino of blatant profiteering by releasing KB in two parts, it's great to see vol 2 answering those critics with aplomb.  Vol 2 is such a different film from its predecessor, and for that reason works wonderfully.  As one film, such contrast would have been impossible!  Okay, I was a little skeptical about the decision myself, but am I glad it became two movies!<br/><br/>KBV2 is a treat.  Vol 1 seemed to lack plot.  Vol 2 brims with it.  Okay, the dialog still doesn't burn like vintage-QT (I felt the Superman thing, although entertaining, was shoe-horned in and seemed incongruous with Bill), but you sense he's trying his hand at something else entirely. Uma's performance is fantastic, David Carradine's, even better. The supporting players aren't half bad, either. In particular, Gordon Liu as Pai Mei, the vindictive Kung Fu master, is hilarious - never has insane laughter coupled with vigorous beard-stroking been done so stylishly on the cinema screen!<br/><br/>
As for the denouement, I loved it.  A noble and delightful end to a fantastic, stylish, and exhilarating ride.  Go and see it, even if vol.1 didn't float your boat - it may just make you reevaluate the whole thing.<br/><br/>
And now a line from vol 1: ""It was not my intention to do this in front of you. For that I'm sorry. But you can take my word for it, your mother had it comin'. When you grow up, if you still feel raw about it, I'll be waiting.""<br/><br/>There's the sequel, right there.  Can't wait..."

","Obviously, when watching vol. 2 you expect the bloodspree from vol. 1 to continue but in many ways the two films are very different - and that is not a bad thing, although I love them both!<br/><br/>Where as vol. 1 is concentrated mostly about sheer fighting and blood squrting, vol. 2 provides a much deeper depth to the characters. There is so many references I cannot begin to list them down, typical thing for Tarantino ofcourse. So many shifts in style, yet it works beautifully. Many surprises, some leaves you giggling, others makes your spine chill..<br/><br/>These two films suffered a lot of harsh critisism from the ""real"" Tarantino fans (whoever they are - I consider myself one and I LOVE Kill Bill!)....but don't judge until you've seen vol. 2 cause that in many ways IS Tarantino-back-to-basics, if you can call it that.<br/><br/>9/10, absolutely, positively, without a shred (pond intended!) of doubt!"

","Going into this movie, i heard some bad things. I heard that the first one was better and this one wasn't even close to being good. But i did hear also good things. So I went into the theater with a bit of concern. I probably should have rented the first one to get my mind into the new one but I knew enough still to be pumped up. When the title Kill Bill came on the screen though, I got goosebumps. And After 2 hours and a half, I must say this movie was great. Its a very different movie than the last though. The first volume was all about fighting and sword play and good action which was still a very good flick. The second one is mostly smart talk and diologue. But its so great though. Its a great film by itself. I like it better than the first half. Thats just me though. It still had good action when it was needed so don't worry. The only thing I did not like about Kill Bill 2 was that the previews showed what Bill looks like. I wish they would have saved it for the movie. Thats the only downfall.

"agentorange_clementine","8","1","2","27 April 2004"," Why a disappointment?
","The most important thing that can be said about Kill Bill Volume Two is that it doesn't quite live up to expectations built up from the incredible Volume One.  But that isn't to say that the movie isn't something special anyway. If you like Quentin Tarantino, and in particular, enjoyed the first volume of Kill Bill, then you will want to see this movie again and again.<br/><br/>
*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*<br/><br/>The film is completely different to the first, with dialogue taking over from violence (though we still get some fabulous fight scenes-The Bride's showdown with Elle shouldn't be missed by anyone!), and unfortunately, unlike with other Tarantino films, this dialogue can drag at times.  When the Bride finally gets to Bill, don't expect The House of Blue Leaves-you will be disappointed.  Some parts of the final confrontation are fantastic, but some will leave you itching for the story to just move along already. Emotion takes over, and whereas in the first movie, the Bride is portrayed as someone looking for cold, heartless revenge, (the scene with Vernita Green's daughter proving this), the character seems to do a complete turnaround.  At the time it seems a little annoying, but with the addition of the Bride and Bill's daughter to the equation, it does make sense looking back.  The last line of Volume One, in which Bill asks `Does she know her daughter is still alive?' was impeccable, and added a fresh twist to a very linear story up to that point.  The moment when the Bride finally learns the truth is one of the most perfect moments of Volume 2, leading up to Bill and the Bride's final confrontation.   And despite the seemingly endless amount of Superman talk, this confrontation is still fascinating for the most part, even it doesn't quite live up to expectations rendered from the first movie.<br/><br/>
Other parts of the movie however, do really give us a reason to treasure Kill Bill.  The scenes where the Bride is being trained by Pei Mei (a great and often hilarious performance by Gordon Lui) are fantastic, as is Chapter Six where we learn more about the day of the wedding rehearsal massacre-shot beautifully in black and white.  The scenes where the Bride is being buried alive are surely the best of the movie though-the direction is amazing, making the audience feel everything the Bride is feeling.  Even when the screen is nothing but black, you are entranced by what is happening. These are the scenes you leave thinking about, and which make you realise that even when Quentin Tarantino is not at the very top of his game (the level which Kill Bill Volume One achieved) it is probably impossible not to adore him anyway.<br/><br/>
Unlike Volume One, performances really need to be at top level in this movie, due to the much extended use of dialogue.  And on the whole, they achieve this.  Special mention must go to Michael Madsen (Budd) who possibly put in the performance of his career, despite the rather small amount of screen time.  David Carradine was immense as Bill, as was Uma Thurman (the Bride) though at times, Miss T struggled slightly with lengthy amounts of dialogue.  Finally, Darryl Hannah was a revelation as Elle, conveying pure evil in everything she uttered.   Hopefully, Kill Bill will be the beginning of a big revival for her.<br/><br/>
Kill Bill Volume Two is a slight disappointment, but only in the highest sense of the word.  On it's own, it would probably be regarded as a classic, but it suffers from being in the shadow of it's predecessor.  As a result of the film being split into two parts, a lot of Volume Two seems to be padded out to fill time which is a shame.  But it still deserves 4/5."
"daveverhiest","9","1","2","24 April 2004"," Its cool in a whole different way to Part 1 - but why split?
","Lets be honest, Kill Bill should not have been split into two separate movies. It's plainly obvious from the start that the piece was meant to be whole and therefore we the movie going public were forced into a 6 month intermission between films. Call me cynical but the fact that this movie came out 5 days after the DVD release of part 1 just smacks of a blatant attempt to rake in more cash from the consumer. That said I really enjoyed the movie, in a different way to part 1. The dialogue is more prolonged here, there are no massive fight sequences and no manga cartoons that cry out 'Hey, look at me, I'm QT and I've done something no other director has - worship my coolness!'. Taking away my cynical streak the movie was very enjoyable. I enjoyed the fleshing out of the characters and the anticipation of how each one would meet their end. The fact that I revisited Part 1 just before helped me to get straight into the plot(another reason I am annoyed at the split) and there are plenty of clever, funny and striking scenes to make even the most cynical movie-goer appreciate Tarantino at his best. Every one of the main cast are on top form, and Carradine's Bill dominates every scene in which he appears, including his ending, which unfortunately did come across as a little far fetched. But that is one of the main appeals in these movies. They are set in an unreal world where people can kill at will and not get arrested. And where humans can act like superheroes and still have very human emotions. Tarantino drags you into his world, grabs your interest, and makes you believe what he is doing is cool - and fun. I appreciated this movie as a very entertaining work, and to that end I can just about forgive the self indulgent splitting of the two movies.HIghlights for me were Daryl Hannah reading to Budd about snake venom, and Uma's training with her master, Pai Mei. The guy was just great - I love the way he screamed at her and how he was prone to stroking his beard! All in all this movie is great, and I would just prefer it to Part 1, merely because I like the characterisation. But to be honest both parts should be viewed as one movie, as I am sure they were originally intended."

","Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" completes the 2 volume set that began last fall, and it is simply an amazing accomplishment. The movie is stunning, and is complete onto itself unlike for example, the individual Lord of the Rings movies. One need not have seen Vol. 1 to be enthralled by Vol. 2. Tarantino is a master of context. Vol. 2 even surpasses Vol. 1, largely because this movie is more story driven. Tarantino's screenplay (along with the credited Uma Thurman) breathes life into the characters of The Bride (Uma Thurman), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), especially Bill (wonderfully played by David Caradine), and clarifies the juxtaposed plot thread. The dialog has the signature Tarantino crisp, quirky, whacked sensibility. In Vol. 2 Uma Thurman emerges as a powerful and commanding screen presence, a true movie star, and a gifted actor. Tarantino provided the foundation of ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"", and Thurman gives it it's soul. <br/><br/>When last we left off, the unnamed Bride killed off 2 members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. Yes, she had left a trail of blood and body parts in the aftermath. Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle Driver (Hannah) remain on her list before she kills Bill. Turns out that The Bride has a name that was actually revealed in Vol. 1-- left here unsaid. Also from Vol.1 we know that The Bride's child lives, and that Bill was named the father. So The Bride's path for revenge is no longer a straight line. <br/><br/>First on her list is Budd, who is Bill's brother. Somehow during their encounter, The Bride ends up buried alive. But this is merely a vehicle for Tarantino's storytelling genius. The Bride recalls her training with Kung Fu master Pai Mei (a truly excellent Gordon Liu). Using humor and amazing kung fu technique, he reveals an axiom of mastery in the martial arts: First, one has to cop to the fact that he or she knows nothing. Secondly, whatever one already knows really means jack. Brilliant.<br/><br/>Though Vol. 2 relies more on narrative and dialog, the action and fighting sequences are breathtaking. They are all brutal, though there is a distinct elegance inherent to them. The training sequences with Pai Mei and The Bride are visually stunning. The battle between Elle Driver and The Bride is captivating with a sense of style and humor (Driver is unable to draw her samurai sword, because they are fighting in a low ceiling trailer home). Daryl Hannah is smart, sexy, deadly, and totally hot. She is perfect as Elle. Both she and Thurman trained intensely to do what they did on screen. <br/><br/>David Caradine is awesome as Bill. He is slick, cool, and flaunts this arrogant air of enlightenment. He has a classic scene with Tarantino's dialog, regarding his fascination of Super Heroes, particularly with Superman. According to Bill, Superman wakes up in the morning knowing that he is Superman-- his alter ego is Clark Kent who is weak. Bill's point is that The Bride is a natural born killer, and everything else is pretense. This punctuates that The Bride even in her singular mission of vengeance, is a hero. This is an acknowledgment of Uma Thurman's performance. Her Bride is so strong of sheer will and spirit, and at the same time she dismisses some of her humanity because it clouds her focus-- to kill Bill. Thurman is that rare combination of beauty, intelligence, power, grace, and vulnerability. Her performance as The Bride is like the perfect haiku-- it's poetry. <br/><br/>""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" is the best movie of the year, thus far. Tarantino is a master storyteller. Uma Thurman has become a powerful and completely captivating movie presence. She should continue to take on commanding movie roles. Vol. 2 is an awesome movie."

","*possible spoilers ahead*<br/><br/>The moment I finished watching volume one I couldn't wait to see what the next installment was and I was pleasantly surprised with the result. If anyone expects the pace and gore of the first installment, they are very much mistaken! This movie focuses on the bride's revenge against Sidewinder, California Mountain Snake and finally Bill. Uma Thurman proves her range as an actress by showing the struggle of her character's emotional stability. You finally understand why the Deadly Viper Squad were out to destroy the Bride and funnily enough you actually find the character of Bill likeable. My only question is what happened to O-Ren Ishii's friend?<br/><br/>Other than that the movie is really great, this is by far Tarantino's best work"
"xsmd723x","10","1","2","23 April 2004"," Truly brilliant
","Kill Bill Volume 1: **** Kill Bill Vol. 2: **** Kill Bill as a whole: One of the top 20 movies of all time<br/><br/>Both movies are easily four star movies.  They are brilliant.  However, what each one lacks, the other makes up for.  Examples: In volume 1, there was no character development.   That was made up for in volume 2.  In volume 2 there wasn't non-stop action sequences.  In volume 1, there was.  In volume 1, however, there was hardly any of that brilliant dialogue.  That is made up for entirely in volume 2.<br/><br/>When you combined the 2 movies together and make them one (which by the way they were originally intended to be) then you have an amazing movie. People say that the styles are way too different to be one movie.  I don't think so.  Tarantino has done something truly original here.  In his last movie before the Kill Bill saga, Jackie Brown, he spent the first half of the movie developing characters and just letting them talk.  In result, it was much slower in the first half of the movie.  With Kill Bill, Vol. 2 he develops the charactes in the *second* half of the movie.<br/><br/>
Standing alone, Vol. 2 works as it's own movie.  It is probably the best movie you'll see this year.  It has everything: dialogue, action, great characters (Budd, Bill, and the Bride come to mind) and a great ending. With Vol. 1, it is not only the best movie of the year, it just may be the best movie of the decade."

","In my humble opinion, this movie pales in comparison to the 1st volume of Kill Bill. Where the first movie was briskly paced, part 2 simply drags. Where the fight scenes shone, here they glimmer weakly.<br/><br/>
***SPOILERS AHEAD***<br/><br/>That's not to say there is nothing to like in Kill Bill: Volume 2. Daryl Hannah has her best role in a long time with Elle Driver, and the fight scene between her and Uma Thurman in the caravan is everything it should be - brutal, bloody and exciting. <br/><br/>Gordon Liu is both unrecognisable and on good form as Uma's mentor, Pai Mei - he gets almost all of the laughs in this movie (bar one line spoken by The Bride's daughter at the end of the movie - ""Shogun Assassin"" - had me rolling in the aisles!)<br/><br/>***END OF SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Tarantino's weakest film to date for me, but Tarantino at half-mast is still better than a lot of directors out there at their best!<br/><br/>6/10"
"beenerz","9","1","2","18 April 2004"," Bang!
","Volume 1 was nifty.  The world and the characters Tarantino set up were intriguing.  The pastiche of genres was darn cool.  The camera work was phenomenal.  The violence got to be a bit much at times (as if T was sitting around, scratching his head and saying: ""where can i make blood spurt out of now?"").  But the coolest things about Vol. 1 were the tantalizing hints of back-story.<br/><br/>Volume 2 makes good on the promise of the first, and may actually be the better movie.<br/><br/>It's different.  There's not so much screentime devoted to gore.  The style shifts aren't so abrupt.  It's actually more cohesive and more-or-less linear.  The characters are phenomenal, as are the actor who portray them.<br/><br/>
Above all of this, it's a wonderfully done anti-hero picture.  The moral ambiguity is absolutely delicious.  I think Buddy sums it up best when he says that they deserve to die--but so does she.  So... shrug.  We'll see. As surreal and stylized as the movie is, the characters seem very real and honest, and just weird enough to charm your socks off.<br/><br/>
Finally, Tarantino deserves some major credit for digging Carradine out of the depths of obscurity for this movie.  If you consider how much of this movie rested on a title character who got very little screentime, you'll see why it was so important that Carradine made the part of Bill his own.<br/><br/>Chalk me down as a non-Tarantino-fan who really enjoyed this movie."

","Contains spoilers, but i mean, come on, if you've seen the trailer, you already know what im talking about.  No great surprises are ruined.<br/><br/>Before i went to see Kill Bill: Volume 2, i would joke to my friends that i don't go to church, i go see Kill Bill in theaters, so when the second half of the movie came out, i felt compelled to see it as soon as possible.  It is my own version of a religious committment.  In order to put my own opinions on the second film in perspective, i need to explain what i thought of the first one, however.<br/><br/>I am slightly biased, as Kill Bill: Volume One is one of my favorite types of movies.  It is a heroic epic of a sole character who needs to beat insurmountable odds to accomplish a relatively small task, and is only able to do this because of an inhuman amount of passion.  It is also a movie that is made not by the plot, the characters, the style, or anything really, except for these moments of intense power where you are completely awestruck by the force and power of the situations given to you.  I will not go into great detail on the movie itself, as if you are reading this you probably already know a lot about it.<br/><br/>For a long while Kill Bill 1 was one of my favorite movies.<br/><br/>And at first, second, third, and in fact all superficial glances, Kill Bill Volume 2 is a COMPLETELY different movie.  Gone are the Crazy 88 battle scenes, with warriors flying Yue Wu Peung style, gone is the barebone archetypical plotline, gone is the magic realist feel of a world gone backwards, and gone is the splaying blood infused gore.<br/><br/>And what are we given instead?  Near the beginning of the film, The Bride is buried alive, which is strangely the same predicament that those who see the film are put into.  I am sure that Quentin has enough storyline on each of the 6 main assassins in this movie to make an entire series of movies at least as long as this one, and it is only in this movie that the sheer weight of all the deep, intertwining background history of this world falls on our heads.  Whereas Bill was seen merely as the enemy in the first one, in this movie he is The Bride's greatest foe, yet also her greatest freind, greatest lover, and ultimate father figure to the end.  All the main characters, in fact, are deeply and perosnally connected in a way that niether Vernita Green nor O-Ren Ishii seemed to be.<br/><br/>
The amount of dialouge in this movie is almost unbelievable.  Almost.  The amount of action scenes is relatively non-existent compared to the first one.  But the ones that are there are completely pervasive.  The fact that they are diminished in number only increases their quality.<br/><br/>This movie is, in fact, completely similar to Volume One.  It is, like the first one, a movie that depends entirely upon the instrumental, shockingly impactful singular moment.  I will not ruin any of these for you.  You will know them when you see them.<br/><br/>The best way i can describe this movie in one sentence is a realization that i had midway through: ""This movie has me by the balls.""  No other movie has ever done that to me before."

Admittedly, few movies could keep up the pacing of the first part without completely leaving any pretense of plot behind.<br/><br/>So we get to alternate between current time and flashbacks... so much so that, at first, I got a little tired of it.

Instead, we get a grittier look at The Bride (Beatrix Kiddo) as she takes to Texas and Mexico to chase her former mentor and lover, Bill.<br/><br/>We get excellent background on the massacre at Two Pines Chapel, we learn more of the relationship between Bill and Beatrix, as they edge closer and closer. You, the viewer who has seen Kill Bill Vol. 1, knows that The Bride at that time has no idea of the upcoming massacre, and thus Bill's words ring with menace.<br/><br/>We then cut to Budd, in one of the best scenes of the movie. While Kill Bill Vol. 1 was a pastiche of swordfighting, over-the-top action and so on, this one is stark, gritty, realistic. We see Budd has a dead end job and is looking for a fast buck. He dispatches of Beatrix with brutal efficiency, and the Texas Funeral was claustrophobic in the extreme. Elle is gorgeous and deadly. She IS ""blonde ambition"" and she proves it by dispatching Budd, then giving Black Mamba more than a run for her money.<br/><br/>
The Cruel Tutelage of Pai Mei is an excellent segment, showing the training she got, and Pai Mei is cruel, but efficient.

And I thought that the violence was tolerable because it was done in such an over-the-top, fantastical way.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol. 2 is an entirely different movie. Gone are the one vs. an army battle scenes (the Bride vs. the Crazy 88's) from the first movie and there is little to no gore in this movie (except for at the end of the Bride vs. Elle Driver fight...I'll leave what exactly happens as a surprise if you don't already know...). The musical score and choice of songs are not nearly as impressive as in the first movie. Even the cinematography is not as crisp and uber-cool as the first Kill Bill.<br/><br/>However, that does not mean that Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a bad movie--only different from Kill Bill Vol. 1. The storyline in Vol. 2 is much more methodical and the characters are given more depth this time around. And the movie is still full of crisp dialogue and humor (Pei Mei's training of the Bride is one of the funniest scenes from recent memory). Vol. 2 with its slow pace and depth is ultimately a deeper movie than Vol. 1 with its nearly nonstop action and comical gore.<br/><br/>Chia Hui Lui (Pei Mei) is absolutely hilarious. Daryl Hannah does very well as the sadistically cruel Elle Driver. And Michael Madsen (a Tarantino mainstay) provides a solid performance as the hick/slob of a killer named Budd. David Carradine is great as Bill. The way Carradine portrays Bill with a calm yet unpredictable demeanor gives the impression that he could go off at any minute. Plus, we get a brief Samuel L. Jackson cameo as Rufus, the organ player.<br/><br/>However, Uma Thurman's performance is the best of the movie. She brings an undeniable charisma to the Bride and does just as well as she did in Vol. 1 if not better. I think she deserves a nomination for Best Actress and would be surprised if she wasn't at least considered for a nomination.<br/><br/>In the end, it's very hard to compare Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 as they are very different. In my humble opinion, Kill Bill Vol. 2 is not as good as the original but is still a great movie worth watching.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

","Mr. Tarantino stakes his claim to the title of master filmmaker with Kill Bill Volumes I and II. Volume 2 completes the masterpiece by taking the art of storytelling to a whole new level. My favourite element of these films is the subtle use of breakfast cereals throughout the film.

"nekanderson881","8","1","2","17 April 2004"," Starring Tarantino and Thurman
","*** Warning! Contains Spoilers ***<br/><br/>The second half of Tarantino's long-awaited martial arts revenge flick stars Uma Thurman as The Bride and David Carradine, as Bill.  Looking so much like his late father John, Carradine has his first starring role in a major motion picture in years.   Vol. 2 has more dialogue than its predecessor and gives much-needed background information on the characters.  The best action sequence is between Thurman and Hannah in the trailer house of the recently deceased Madsen.  He has died from the bite of a venomous snake which just happened to be inside a suitcase containing a million dollars in cash which Hannah brought with her to pay for a special sword of his.  After he is bitten, she reads (to comic effect) from a small spiral notebook information accessed from the Internet on this snake and its deadly venom.  One-eyed Hannah loses the other eye in this fight when Thurman pokes it out and subsequently drops it to the floor squishing it between her toes.  The second best action sequence has Thurman shot and then buried alive.  In this sequence there is a flashback of her extensive martial arts training by a master with a long white beard which he constantly runs his hand through. Thurman successfully breaks the wooden coffin she is buried in and surfaces to breathe among us once again.  This woman is unstoppable.  The music by 1960s spaghetti western composer Ennio Morricone is used in the film with great effect.  Classic pop songs have been used brilliantly in Tarantino's other films and here we have the wonderful hit  ""About Her"".  The ultimate demise of Bill comes from The Bride's use of the five finger heart stopping technique taught to her by the master.  Sure enough, after five steps Bill keels over and dies. Compared to Tarantino's best film to date ""Pulp Fiction"", this film lacks its originality and ultra-hip dialogue.  ""Jackie Brown"" recreated the feel of the blackploxation films of the 1970s and here we have the same decade's Kung Fu and spaghetti westerns revived.  This film is a must for Tarantino's fans.  He is as much the star of the film as anyone.  And no amount of praise is enough for Thurman, who gives the best female action performance since Sigourney Weaver in the ""Alien"" films."
"epierce-1","10","1","2","17 April 2004"," Well filmed, well acted, well done!
","Not too often have I come across a film so highly anticipated, and walk out the theater actually having enjoyed it more than I expected. Kill Bill Volume 1 was so over the top, so over stylish, and oh so very good that I had to doubt myself if Volume 2 could live up to the first. Now granted, we all know (or should, before basing judgment) that this is really one long movie, essentially chopped in half. The first half being action and set up, the second half being the conclusion and character building. I was relieved to find the second half being what I just said. The directing by QT just goes to show that he has to be one of the finest writers and directors of our time. The dialouge in and QT movie, in my opinion, sets his flicks apart from the rest, and he does not disappoint here. The finest part being the ladder of the film, with the conversations between The Bride and Bill. Also here is something we aren't too accustomed to from a QT movie... sentiment. I couldn't help but smile as I left the theater. All things considered, from the few action scenes, to the beautiful scenery, to the well-written script, KB 2 more than lives up to the reputation that the first movie set. I loved Kill Bill Volume 1 for everything it is, and I love KB 2 even more for it being everything that KB 1 was not!"

","I was fortunate enough to see this film at a private screening the day before it was released. When i first rated it, i gave it a 9. After a couple of days to think about it though, I had to give it a 10. The reason I thought i should change this vote, was because when I thought about it, there is nothing I can think of to change this movie to make it any better. Mr. Tarentino has done something with these two films that is unique in the midst of most film-making today. When you first see Bill, (or rather, hear Bill) He is the most despicable of the despicable. You can't wait to see The Bride get to him in the end. But when she finally does in vol. 2, Bill is easily the most likeable character in the two films.<br/><br/>Uma Thurmans performance was excellent and David Caradines was all the more incredible. If you havent seen this movie yet, go see it twice."

","Kill Bill Volume 2 is brilliant, although you really do have to have a vast knowledge of films to appreciate it for what it is - a great homage to cult cinema/filmmaking.  The references are everywhere - the whole master/disciple relationship of Pai Mei (Gordan Liu) and the Bride (reminiscent of Liu's 1978 36th Chamber of Shaolin - probably the best martial arts film ever made).  Also, the Leone-esque narrative construct with long, drawn out takes.  All the close-ups of feet (similar to De Palma's infatuation with hands).  Even the whole buried alive sequence and rising from the grave conjures up images of De Palma's Body Double/Carrie. This film is true brilliance, and is a great end to an epic revenge saga. The only problem I had with it, was that I was so disappointed that it was over."

","This is Quentin Tarantino's Spahgehtti western. I liked both movies equally, but it was hard to feel the continuity between the two movies. I loved the close ups, the bloody faces, and that western music playing throughout the movie. just awesome, Uma's best acting performance ever. i voted a solid 10 for this one. Elle driver was so perfectly evil, and Budd the perfect hillbilly. This movie probably had some of the best writing I have ever seen. David Carradine was so perfect for this role with his leathery face and smooth voice. The wedding chapel masacre made it hard for me to believe he was gonna kill everyone at all. If you want to see some harsh bitchin ass kickin then go see this movie it is the most fun you will ever have at the movies."
"habsfan123","10","1","2","17 April 2004"," Best movie of all time
","I consider Kill Bill 1 and 2 one movie and this movie is the best movie of all time hands down.  Tarantino is simply brilliant with every aspect of this movie.  I feel I owe him more money watching these films, the regular admission price is not enough to charge for a piece of art like this. The whole movie was perfectly cast and the storyline was orchestrated with surgeon like precision. When she was in the coffin how many of you thought ""How is she going to get out of this?"" then they cut perfectly to her training and it all made sense. When she finally got to Bill you almost have this feeling they may actually get back together. I've seen thousands of movies in my life and this is at the top of my list, until the tarantino movie comes out. Please Quentin, make movies more often, i need your movies!!!!"

","I saw this movie last night with my brother and we were stunned at all the beautiful camera work. The direction of this movie is enough to see the movie alone. The comes the movie itself which is amazing. Its better than the first volume and keeps itself fresh the whole way through. Its got a very good story and they pull it off brilliantly. The score adds to the movie to you'll especially notice how good the soundtrack is when the bride fights Elle.<br/><br/>Spoiler ALERT...<br/><br/>My favorite scene is where she's buried alive it actually made you feel helpless and like you could barely move. The music when shes digging out is also some of the best off the soundtrack.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that we didn't get to see Bill use his kung fu skills. The fight at the end should have well.. happened because there wasn't a fight really.<br/><br/>The training scenes were unforgettable as is the whole movie. I recommend this movie even if you didn't like volume 1 because they are very different in so many ways. Go see this movie. 10/10"
"Haio","9","1","2","17 April 2004"," The difference between two films...
","There's a point in Volume 2, where The Bride/Black-Mamba/Uma Thurman is shot in the chest with a shotgun.  She flies back a few feet and hits the ground.  What happens next is unbelievable- nothing.  Blood doesn't fly 12 feet into the air.  But isn't this Kill Bill?  Isn't it the second Volume of Tarantino's blood saga of vengeance.  Yes it is, but then again- No it isn't.<br/><br/>I don't know.  Maybe if it was somebody else- blood would have shot up. But nowhere in Vol. 2 do those annoying bursts make an appearance.<br/><br/>The two films are so different that nothing I read could prepare me for how Vol. 2 would flow.  Considering I didn't like Vol. 1, this was very good for me.  Considering some did... well, this will test their loyalty to Tarantino- or just the KILL BILL saga in general.<br/><br/>Looking back on Vol. 1 I can easy pinpoint many things I didn't like: The over-the-top-sickening anime sequence, the lack of depth, the lack of story, the lack of development, the lack of sanity... I could go on (you know I could)<br/><br/>On Vol. 2, however, there is almost nothing I can say I didn't like. Anime- none. Depth- it's like the deep end of a swimming pool.  Story- told with massive heart. Development- so much it would sicken anyone who loved the first just for bloodshed.  Sanity- WELL, this IS a Tarantino film (Luckily, because Vol.1- well, its not a film if it doesn't take itself seriously, is it?)<br/><br/>Thurman and Carradine who play The Bride and Bill (respectively) are unbelievably good.  Every moment they are on the screen a love-hate feeling just drifts... Their performances flesh out the characters who were empty in Vol. 1.  And, the fact that Tarantino decided to finally write helped.<br/><br/>Ultimately Kill Bill ends as a drama, but spins back into Homage for the credits.  For those who stick around for the closing credits- you can see just how much fun Q & U (as they credit themselves) had just by the one outtake.<br/><br/>Uma deserves an Oscar nod for this one, and if it's not too much of a stretch, toss one to Carradine for supporting.<br/><br/>Before you see Vol. 2, ask yourself- ""Action or Story?""  Which do you prefer?  Because if all you want from Quentin is a bloody-mockery of a film, you might as well stay home and watch Vol. 1."
"woowoodavey","Null","1","2","17 April 2004"," Good Stuff
","Kill Bill 2 reminds me off what going to the movies is all about, and I can't wait to see it again, along with KB1. if you haven't seen either film, I urge you to take a few hours to watch the first one, then roll to the theater to see the second. The roller coaster ride that you are taken on is emotional and at times funny, shocking, and horrific. The tension in KB2 is just as thick as in KB1, though there is less sword play. The strength of the movie is that that tension you crave is there but is formed through other means. Very cool movie, with lots of replay value and hidden wackyiness added by QT."

Pai Mei you ARE the master killer!!<br/><br/> I forgot how much I enjoyed those rack-focus closeups, the whole uh...Uh..Ooh! of a well choreographed fight scene, and those crazy click-click noises in the soundtrack.  Man that was cool.  Sure it's fantasy, but it was just what I was looking for.<br/><br/> I really digged the standout female roles, like from a Sarah Paretsky novel.  They were really involved.  Uma, you're the hottest!  And Darryl Hannah, an earlier generation honey, had such a cool character!  She didn't seem imposing at all in KB#1, but what a villain!!<br/><br/> David Carradine was excellent and I would sure like to see him in more films.  Michael Madsen had a great role too.  The strip club scene was a bit of a waste of film and detracted from the action, but I guess Tarentino had to develop the character a bit more to have him earn his pay.  The morale there is, watch where you spit your tobacco!  haha.<br/><br/> I'm going to go back to enjoy this movie and the performances again and again. A must-buy for any kung-fu/ Tarentino fan.

","I loved this movie and would definitely recommend seeing it- granted, it was much different than the first volume; not as much action, much more dialogue and character development, but equally on par with the first installment. I had read that Quentin Tarentino was going for an East-meets-West combination, and in my opinion, he nailed it.  If you're looking for more of the first installment, then you might not like the second half as much since it's more story than action- I personally thought the second half was just as good as the first, but for different reasons- the acting was amazing and I unlike most movies out in this day and age, I cared about what happened to the characters.  Overall, I loved it and can't wait until it comes out on DVD.<br/><br/>In closing, I personally wouldn't base going to see a movie or not going to see a movie on people's reviews- you might view the movie differently and every person has their own personal taste so definitely check it out for yourself!"

We found out the reason Bill 'killed,' and how the California Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah) lost her eye. (If you have no idea what I'm talking about, watch the first one, she's the one whistling that eerie song.) We also learn about the Bride's past with Bill.<br/><br/>Overall it was a great story, with everything you'd expect in a great film."

Granted, I am a fan and thought 'Pulp Fiction' was a fantastic film. This may not be a date movie, unless you are dating one of those strange roleplaying women who dig violence.

"s1169965","9","1","2","16 April 2004"," More Tarantino than the First Volume
","The character interaction was much more Tarantino than in the first volume. The dialogue between David Carradine, (Bill) and Uma Thurman (The Bride) and Michael Madson, (Budd) where done in the true Resevoir Dogs style.  I was pleased to see that Tarantino strayed a bit from the ultra-vivid backgrounds; instead selecting more grass-roots backdrops for the film. It just seemed like more of a Tarantino film than did Volume 1.  I am not saying the the second is superior to the first...rather that the second is more Tarantino than the first.  I will dare to say that the first was more entertaining, while the second was more content oriented.  A word to the wise...don't purchase the Kill Bill Volume 1 on DVD yet.  Wait for the dual-packaged box set which should be arriving in August."
"gravity3","9","1","2","16 April 2004"," A Return to Story Driven Cinema
","VOLUME 1 of KILL BILL was really all about the action - a pure revenge film dipping into every '70's action genre one could imagine, and director/writer Tarantino can imagine quite a lot of them. There wasn't much character development, nor a great deal of plot. But that left more room for what it was really about - Tarantino proving his walk was as good as his talk. He had talked about action for years, and with VOLUME 1 he delivered; enough for any five action films, I think.<br/><br/>So it was the return to an earlier Tarantino type of character developed, story driven film that really threw me in VOLUME 2. Now that's not to say there isn't any action. KILL BILL VOLUME 2 has got that covered. But in this one we study all the background, the motives, and the characters themselves. Mostly these elements are given in an old fashioned storytelling style, told from one character to another, in that kind of conversational realism Tarantino has made popular all over again, but which he and few others have really mastered. We are given many little storytelling scenes, about this or that - I'm not going to give anything away here. But it all adds up, at least to me, the way all those little storytelling scenes worked together for the whole in PULP FICTION.<br/><br/>It's this storytelling element that really gives meaning and depth to all the craziness that was unleashed in VOLUME 1. It's clear how much the two films are actually just one story. Without the second, the first is just action fun. Characters doing crazy things to each other without much reason behind it. But with VOLUME 2, we have the scope and the motives and intentions of those actions. We finally get inside these characters, and that, for me, is the best part of the storytelling process. At the end of VOLUME 1, O-Ren Ishii might have been the only character I understood at all. Even The Bride was a bit of a mystery, and we didn't even know her real name. Now, I feel like I know them all. They are distinct, in the way perhaps the Magnificent Seven are, in my mind.<br/><br/>Now I don't want to give the impression this is a slow film. It's quite a bit longer than the first, but the time just flew by and I was surprised when it was over. Wonderful editing and pacing are the keys here, not to mention riveting dialogue, and action that comes out of nowhere like a truck driving into your living room on a quiet evening. Tarantino still has the element of surprise in hand. And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the talents he's assembled in cast and crew. The film is just as clever to watch as the dialogue is to hear. Buddy Robert Rodriguez even makes an assist on the music soundtrack.<br/><br/>Tarantino has once again bravely side stepped the industry trends, turned the formula on it's head, and delivered the more thoughtful, deeper elements in the second half of the story. The audience is then rewarded with a superior, unpredictable second installment that may leave those ""check-your-brain-at-the-door"" fans a bit disappointed, but gives the rest of us, as The Bride puts it, ""bloody satisfaction"". Well done."
"NoArrow","Null","1","2","16 April 2004"," The second half of the story is much better than the first!
","""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" is not as much a sequel to Volume 1 as it is the second half of the story.  In the first half (some very predictable spoilers ahead) The Bride kills Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu) and Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox), two of the five assassins who gunned down The Bride at her wedding rehearsal. In Volume 2, she goes after the last three: Sidewinder (Michael Madsen), now a lifeless hick, California Mountain Snake (Darryl Hannah), a mysterious one-eyed fighter, and, of course, Bill (David Carradine), the leader of their former group of assassins and The Bride's former flame.<br/><br/>Since in Volume 1 there were no major plot developments or big twists (except for the very last scene) it left a lot - a whole lot - of room for action.  And that there was, scene after scene of bloody action, and that worked for that one.  In Volume 2, however, since it is the second half of the story, and the climax, all the plot starts to come together.  The characters are developed fully, there are others introduced, and a few plot twists are thrown at you.<br/><br/>After all, Hannah, Madsen and Carradine had little-to-nothing to do in Volume 1, whereas in Volume 2 their characters bloom so naturally and gradually.  Budd (Madsen) is introduced sipping bear from a coffee can, sitting at his trailer door, shrugging off that The Bride is coming to kill him and then showing up at his job to have his loser boss push him around (despite Budd being a former assassin).  When The Bride comes and Budd collects her priceless sword, he sees it as a chance to turn up a new leaf. The character of Elle Driver (Hannah) shows up and ruins Budd's plans, that's how she's introduced.<br/><br/>But Bill, he's the best character of the film.  Carradine captures the character's mannerisms perfectly.  How he talks, how he moves, how he fights, how he can go from friendly to sadistic to intense to evil with just his eyes and the tone of his voice in seconds.  It is an Oscar worthy performance all the way, he better nab the 2004 Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>Of course, I haven't even mentioned Uma Thurman.  Her performance in Volume 1 was brutal and dynamic, but not very versatile.she wasn't able to go many places with her character, because all she did was kill.  In Volume 2 we see the entire transformation of her character from an airhead blonde to a skillful killer in a flashback scene, and we get to see her character put in many emotional situations, most notably when she is buried alive.  I'm glad Thurman didn't get an Oscar nomination in 2003, but it'll be a crime if she doesn't get one this year.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino.  Have I said his name yet?  Do I need to?  I must say, his talents are much better expressed in this volume.  In the first the lines were good, but not all that great, in this half they have that special, wonderful Tarantino feel that is both natural and authentic. Best Screenplay?  Yes.  Best Director?  Definitely.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is the years best so far, that may change, but it would take a very good movie to deny this the title, 8.5/10."
"tegucigalpa17","10","1","2","16 April 2004"," Entertaining and Great
","Quentin Tarantino commonly makes great films. However, you didn't know what to think with Kill Bill Vol. 1. It was a great action film, but at times became tired. There was no great dialogue as you come to expect from Mr. Tarantino. However, this film gives you everything that you want. It is a good thing that he split it into two films, because after you get to see his masterpiece of action experimentation, you get to the great stuff, with the dialogue. Also, Budd and Elle Driver are much better characters than Vernita Greene and O-Ren Ishii. This movie is great. It is one of those movies where you sprint towards the bathroom so you won't miss any more great dialogue or another revalation."
"topaztiazel","8","1","2","16 April 2004"," Wonderful piece, but it might not be what you expect.
","Kill Bill Vol. 2, the second half of an intended full-throttle 4 hour epic, is amazing in its own right. However, viewers may feel surprised when the credits begin to roll, as, despite being aforementioned second half, Vol. 2 is almost entirely different.<br/><br/>It's almost hard to believe that Tarantino planned to keep the movie as one piece, especially since the focus of each ""volume"" contrasts greatly. In Vol. 1, the focus was to give enough story to support what was to happen on screen. The focus was action over plot, certainly. Viewers were treated to gorgeous fight scenes (most notably at the House Of Blue Leaves) only knowing the mere basics of the plot. With Vol. 2, the focus has flipped over to character development. We learn more about the Bride's past, as well as the other members of DVAS, and the settings are (seemingly) intentionally more dull in order to allow us to focus on the characters.<br/><br/>And nothing is wrong with this, at all. Tarantino has certainly succeeded in giving life to his cast, and the actors (especially Thurman and Carradine) have no trouble portraying their parts. The only flaw, then, is that the movie is just not what the typical Vol. 1 viewer expects. Nevertheless, Vol. 2 is a treat that no fan of Vol. 1 should miss, but don't expect another House Of Blue Leaves.<br/><br/>8/10"
"l33t_FX","8","1","2","16 April 2004"," Excellent yet lacking
","I liked Vol 2 a lot.  While I was watching it in the theater I felt that I liked the second more than the first.  But now that I look back I don't like one more than the other.  I like the first one for the fight scenes, and the second one for the wonderful plot, the story was so great.  The only bit that was lacking was the fighting.  I was expecting elaborate grand finale sword fighting scenes; instead of Fire Works I was awarded with a Flash in the Pan.  The bride simply killed or disabled her opponents to fast.  I do believe that I liked the sound track to Vol 2 better.  I really enjoyed the back story of her training with Pai Mei.  I wouldn't have minded seeing even more of her training with her master.  Of course there was a purpose for it and QT had to keep the movie going.  Overall quite good."
"Shoegazer29","9","1","2","16 April 2004"," A TAD DISAPPOINTING...
","Well I just got back from the multiplex, and let me tell you, KILL BILL VOL. 2 IS NOT WHAT MOST VIEWERS ARE GOING TO EXPECT. The only review of Vol. 2 I had read before watching the movie myself was Rolling Stone's Peter Travers's take on things. I have to say that Mr. Travers was more than a little misleading, but that is besides the point (He gave it a 4 out of a 4).<br/><br/>The movie begins well enough, with Uma Therman speaking directly to the camera courtesy of cheesy '40s fare. Then The Bride provides backstory on her wedding, her training, and a little on her relationship with Bill. Keep in mind all of this is intercut with the encounters between The Bride and Budd, and The Bride and Elle Driver (We even find out how she lost that eye). The switching up of present and past maintains the fast pace of Vol. 1, while providing indepth insight into The Bride, something new in Vol. 2. ALTOGETHER THE FIRST HOUR IS SOME GREAT FILMMAKING.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it is this newfound appreciation for emotional insight that ends up being the film's worst flaw; THE SECOND HOUR OF THE FILM IS DOMINATED BY TALKING. Not that talking is bad or unnecessary for movies, but the energy of the Vol. 1 is all but lost during some of the particularly grating scenes. Granted there is the final showdown between Bill and Uma, but this is preceded by possibly the most degrading showing from Tarantino yet. And what I mean by that is this (And don't infer that I don't respect Quentin Tarantino, because I do), conversation after conversation, MORE AND MORE IS SPELLED OUT for us. Not in a symbolic or metaphorical sense, but in an actual question and answer session between the film's two key players. I found this to be insulting to my intelligence, and anyone else's for that matter. If you payed any attention to Vol. 1 the whole scene is EXTREMELY PREDICTABLE and LABORIOUS TO WATCH.<br/><br/>-i have to pause for a second-<br/><br/>After reading what I've written I see that I'M PAINTING AN OVERLY NEGATIVE PICTURE of Kill Bill Vol. 2. I suppose I'm still frustrated that I already bought Vol. 1 on DVD, expecting Vol. 2 to surpass the first and tie everything together. And IF VOL. 2 REALLY TRIES TO DO ONE THING, THAT WOULD BE COMPLETING THE PICTURE. But I must reiterate that that is exactly my problem with this movie, IT STOPS MOVING FORWARD TO PICK UP WHAT IT LEFT BEHIND, AND TAKES ITS TIME DOING SO (And even still one important question is never answered. Why does Hatori Hanzo not like Bill? What drives him to make the sword?).<br/><br/>
I say: Kill Bill Vol. 1 - 9/10 Kill Bill Vol. 2 - 7/10 Kill Bill (Whole)- 8/10<br/><br/>A two-part to remember, possibly more for its stylistic prowess than anything else, but nothing to live by. A combined release with intermission might have helped. I do realize that isn't very practicle (Look how the Lord of the Rings movies did though, despite length)."

","Kill Bill: Volume 2 was a major step forward from Volume I.  Those who liked Vol I purely for the gore-fest will be a little disappointed, but if you like QT's other movies you will be in for a treat. Vol 2 relies a bit more on Tarantino-esque dialog (which I like) so be forewarned, if you find it annoying from his other movies you will probably be a tad bored in some parts. If you love witty dialog and a good healthy dose of revenge you could not ask for anything more.  Anyway, what are you waiting for?  Go see it!"

","Even though this one didn't have as much action as the first, its still a great movie over all.  This second part mainly brings everything to an end nice and simple and very unique as well.  Quentin once again did a terrific job on directing and writing and producing.  The Acting was once again perfect like Quentins other movies.  Uma did a great job as the bride and no one could replace Dave Carradine for the part of bill.  Most people need to make sure they go into this movie with an open mind, if anyone were to expect as much action and violence as the first one they will be disappointed.  Hopefully Volume 2 will also make the top 250 just like volume 1 because thats what it deserves."
"silentbob_tg","10","1","2","16 April 2004"," Classic Tarantino
","First i must say this is just classic Tarantino. There is little violence in this movie but the dialogue is what makes it. I'm also a big fan of Madsen so him just being in the movie made it great. It has classic characters such as the Pei Mea(SP?), Budd, Elle, and Bill. The story has been greatly improved upon since the first half. The silly blood spray that was in the first half is now gone, which is not a bad thing. Bill and the Brides past really is well done and makes you think Bill isnt really that bad of a person. If you ever are able to free up a few hours go see this movie right away. Thank You Tarantino for this wonderful masterpiece of a movie. I recommend this to everyone 10/10"
"rich.baldwin@nth.com","10","1","2","16 April 2004"," The movie achieved the results but not like you expected
","Part 2 brings everything to the conclusion that you expected it would but not at all the way you expected or the pace of the first part. Volume 2 is still a story of revenge, but not with massive amounts of violence like in Volume 1. There was a couple of times when we thought that the bride was dead, but she is like a cat with nine lives. There was several shocks and impossible situations, but our heroine came through in ways you thought weren't possible. The use of black and white photography emphasized the drama of the wedding massacre. All in all this is Quentin's best flick yet! Be sure to watch all of the trailer credits - there is an extra ""eyeful"" at the very end!"
"Spider-man_2099","10","1","2","16 April 2004"," Excellent movie, but nothing like the first one
","This movie was fantastic.  However, for those of you who were only into the first one for the adrenaline rush, you may want to rethink seeing the movie. I myself loved this movie; it was perfect in every way that I can think of. However, there are about three fight scenes throughout the whole movie, and the death count in this movie will surely surprise most people.  Also, the backstories of the other members of the Deadly Viper Assassination squad aren't as fleshed out as O-Ren Ishii's, which was a slight disappointment, but they're implied well enough.  This second film is more about the emotions of the Bride than her ability to kick ass, and it is more a drama than an action film.  Thankfully, Tarantino knows how to make all sorts of great movies.  This one is extremely well done, and I urge you all to see it.  Just don't expect a crapload of action in this one."
"Dekukid","10","1","2","16 April 2004"," Elle Driver, Budd ""Sidewinder"", and Bill. Superb trinity to the final act.
","This film cannot be summarized without giving spoilers, but I'll try my best. There are *SPOILERS* for Kill Bill Volume 1 though.<br/><br/>After The Bride took her vengeful violent wrath upon Go-Go, O-Ren, and Vernita, she continues on to her last targets. So, her next targets are marked, but what kind of crazy stuff is going down this time? This is not as gory as the first volume. There are no decapitations that I remember, no spurting blood fountains, no bloodbaths at all pretty much. There is still a lot of disturbing images.<br/><br/>The acting is stupendous. Uma Thurman delivers a performance worthy of an Academy Award, there are some scenes that just scream ""Academy! Look at me!"", but they're pulled off so good, that their purpose is fulfilled. Michael Madsen is the focus of a good chunk of the first half. He's gotten a helluva lot worse after leaving Bill's team, and has a dead-end job, but he's still the same 'Texas killer' he fashions himself as. There is a lot of things going on with his character, and I rank him up their with Uma Thurman for his acting. Dave Carradine is mysterious in his role, and his lines are quite melodramatic, but he delivers them quite tastefully so Quentin's mediocre writing for this character is forgiven. Elle Driver is a treat that I thought would be just another character to kill. She had that super-cool almost sarcastic tone to her voice. I have to say, Daryl was awesome in her role to the point I almost liked her, despite she was created to be hated.<br/><br/>All in all, it's awesome. Way better than the gore-flash-fest of the first, and it truly shows Quentin's ability to direct a wide range of styles, and also shows Uma Thurman and Michael Madsen's great acting skills."
"radiumrogue","8","1","2","17 April 2004"," More than what I expected...except for the blood
","To keep this amazingly short, Kill Bill Vol. 2 was much better than what I had expected.  The plot is more developed and the character, Black Mamba is better portrayed as a heroine(vs. just one angry woman)in this episode. Thus, placing abilities of Uma Thurman prominently in the limelight.  As well, the artistic efforts for each frame of the film is notably well thought out; each would make a really cool picture book! However, I was expecting more of a sword fight btw Bill and Beatrix, and more 'squriting blood'!  More so, I thought the end was just too abrupt and it needs more of what I call ""the cool-Tarantino-cheese."" Maybe, simply his style has grown-up? Though this film cannot be viewed as 2 separate entities, I must say, like classics such as the Godfather and the Godfather II, it has surpassed it's predecessor, Vol I, greatly."
"NMcKenzie","10","1","2","17 April 2004"," liked vol I? get excited...didn't see it? rent it and see what it's all about..
","If you like the first one, then I don't really have to convince you, these two movies are a one-TWO, and they saved the best for last, that is if you have the ability to leave some of the reality at the door. I'm not saying they are stretch to the extent of ""The Matrix"" or anything like that, but they are dont creatively to give a new spin on things old. What movie with a killing in it wasn't based upon revenge? But how many of those movies are as innovative and while some say ""that's stupid and unrealistic"", well that's the point, you kill someone you go to jail in real life...it's a movie.... But back to the main point, if you didn't I commented on the first volume which recieved fair marks on here as well, but I think before you see the second that this second installment could not possibly be as good. Its defintely visually pleasing, and the sound is great (both effects and music). Along with that, it plays off some of the things in the first movie but gives the (note the quotes for modesty)""saga"" more depth..ie the chapel massacre. In any case, I loved it and I think that I liked it more than the first one. To be fair I am biased and ran out and bought the first one; so, I suggest, rent the first volume, if you can't buy into it then dont waste your time on the second. However, if you liked it in the least, get excited for volume two because it is just a great ending to the story. Also, I have to note, I was incredibly impressed with the actor's, whose name I'm not sure of now, performance. I think that Uma Thurman was a good cast for the main role, but the casting of Bill's part couldn't have been better. At any rate, I hope that even though I didn't elaborate much on the plot, the fact that I am so excited about this movies gets SOME people out and turned on to the ""Kill Bill"" stories."
"snoogansjl","10","1","2","17 April 2004"," what it was about
","Well, volume 2 is a continuation of volume 1 (they are one movie, split into 2 parts) and the difference between the two of them are night and day. While the last movie explained very little in the way of plot, and the character's histories, Volume 2 gives you everything that you missed in the last installment. There was some amazing action in this movie. There were less grandiose battles, and more one on one settling of personal differences, which were intimate and really damn cool. While some of the characters may be a bit long winded about their pasts, or their motives, what they talk about is definately worth paying attention to. This will definately strike a chord with the fans of QT. This highly stilized, well directed movie had some nice suprises if you can forget the fact that you know what happens in the end. (I wonder why its called Kill Bill...) Every performance, from the Bride to B.B (her daughter)was stellar. With a jump start beginning, an emotional ending, and some great plot fleshing, action, laughs, emotion, and insight this conclusion of a revenge story, could not have been more sweet."
"MovieKat","10","1","2","17 April 2004"," 9/10 would have been 10/10 if not for one scene -- Spoilers
","First of all let me say I am a QT fan, and thought that his Kill Bill films were excellent.<br/><br/>But what was with that scene with Budd at the strip club?  Did we really need to say that.  I also would have preferred a longer fight scene at the end with Bill.<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>IMHO The fight scene between Elle and Mamba for me was one of the best fight scenes of the year.<br/><br/>Just my two cents..."
"own2feet2140","8","1","2","17 April 2004"," Different than Vol.1, but still Tarantino
","I must say that where Vol. 1 pumped me up with it's fast paced homage to bloody decapitating action, Vol. 2 had a whole other vibe similar to that of the Pulp Fiction flavor. I read a review where the critic complained that Vol. 2 is not as good as Vol. 1 and that it's simply Tarantino being ""self indulgent"". I disagree. I don't believe that audiences will be getting a film that out-does the first. However, what they will be getting is a whole other movie, which stands on it's own. While Vol 1. was shocking, Vol. 2 is more sultry and bitter sweet. Where Vol. 1 started you off with the champion of all catfights, Vol. 2 starts you off with a drawn out dramatic scene which builds the tension to a crescendo. You get a truthful look of the girl inside the badass warrior, as well as the man who loved her so much, he had to put a bullet in her head. Although, I was disappointed that the long awaited showdown with the title character was more talk than swordplay. It would have been even more disappointing if Tarantino would have simply created a carbon copy, ""more of the same"" from the first installment. And when it comes to talk, Tarantino is the the master. His collaboration with David Caradine in the creation of the ""Bill"" character is one of the greatest of all time. Bill is charming, using subtle tricks and tactics to derail the Bride's rampage of revenge. Tarantino stretches his directing muscle by holding back some of his old techniques and using new ones to give you an original film and not just a sequel. Uma Thurman gives the acting performance of her career, worthy of the Oscar she was nominated for in Pulp Fiction. David Caradine is better than ever, and Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen give much stronger performances than was ever expected from them. Honorable mention to Gordon Liu as Master Pai Mei."
"temescalian","10","1","2","17 April 2004"," unique and entertaining
","That quirky Tarantino.  Like his other films, he really puts his eccentricity into this.  In this movie he demonstrates his mastery of manipulation and direction.  One minute I'm laughing, the next I'm sad, then angry, then laughing again.   Sometimes I experienced more than one emotion at a given time.  The story telling is overt and purposefully over the top, playing off of cliches from older genres of film, particularly that of martial arts.<br/><br/>I watched vol.1 with my Happa roommate and he confirmed that the action sequences were very reminiscent of the old samurai movies he used to watch, and with lovably hilarious Master Pai Mei in vol.2, there was no doubt of QT's references--no, his enthusiasm for old chinese kung fu films.  In retrospect it makes you think, ""I just watched a samurai duel take place inside of a cramped trailer in the middle of the desert and I accepted every moment of it--to say the least."" Tarantino infuses and integrates the kind of elements that one would otherwise find incredulous; so seamlessly and with such unique prose.  The type of attitude you see in his character interactions makes you chuckle, even amidst the gravity of the situation if you stop to think about it.<br/><br/>The second movie is what some would consider slower than the first. Still, I found even the heartless antagonists to have their own sense of charm--adding to the mixed sensations I was speaking of.  Personally, I hardly missed the mindlessly excessive gore found in Vol.1<br/><br/>
For me, it was a unique, over-the-top, and utterly entertaining film. Very intentional and well composed.  I would recommend both volumes of Kill Bill UNLESS you are squeamish about blood or are completely unable to comprehend any cultural satire presented before you."
"sixtwentysix","10","1","2","16 April 2004"," Don't take your guns to town...
","An highly entertaining piece of cinema. Borrowing from every great action movie of note in the past four decades this film delivers from front to back leaving just enough unsaid to truly give the characters enough mystery for some great mythology. Remember how you thought Bobba Fett was the coolest? That's because you didn't really know jack about him...<br/><br/>If volume one was about action, volume two is about suspense and muted emotion. Drawing the audience in with gritty exchanges and gruesome action the movie takes a different kind of turn when Bill and the Bride finally come face to face.<br/><br/>Great film with an interesting but dangerous nearing flat ending. The plot is running on the rim when it finally screeches to a halt with a satisfying spin out. An oddly delicate if uneven ending that recalls the final piano note from the Beatles ""Day in the life"" in that after a crescendo of mayhem your left with an open ended story and moral questions left unanswered.<br/><br/>This film will be even better if it is ever cut together and viewed as one entire piece. I felt that cutting this movie in half was a bad (and greedy) Harvey Wienstein idea and really creates something lopsided. However despite the slashing, it is an epic without a doubt and will stand up to the sands of time. It could take it's place in the pantheon of great even near perfect action films. 9.5/10"
"shashankr025","9","1","2","16 April 2004"," Everything I expected it to be.
","I must admit, I knew what was going to happen. Like many other impatient viewers, I too had read the screenplay online long before the movie hit the screens. But it did not diminish my movie experience in the least.<br/><br/>The camera changes from black-and-white to color to grainy, and back to black-and-white... and back to color. But Tarantino's prolonged and indulgent ode to his influences and pop-culture is driven to a riveting end. From the moment we see the killer turned expectant bride in that chapel, rehearsing for her wedding to a record store employee, to the final scene of the final chapter, Kill Bill Vol. 2 is an exhilerating and mostly satisfying cinematic journey.<br/><br/>I did find the Budd story a little bit of an unwanted diversion. Instead, Tarantino could have let the casino scene with Bill make it through the final cut (if you don't know what I am talking about, you can read the script online). It would have had more relevance in developing Bill's character, which is of course crucial. But strong performances all around more than make up for this shortcoming.<br/><br/>I especially enjoyed the cruel tutelage of Pai Mei. I felt Tarantino succeeded at maintaining the fine balance between edgy humor and over-the-top ridicule in paying homage to Chinese Kung-fu movies, with those sudden facial close-ups, Pai Mei's arrogant laughter, and his repeated stroking of that wispy beard.<br/><br/>But to me, the best chapter was easily the final one. I was pleasantly surprised to see how genuine the interaction between father (Bill), mother (Beatrix/Uma) and child (B.B.) looked onscreen. David Carradine, who puts in a strong performance throughout, shines especially in this chapter. In particular, the `goldfish' scene where he recounts how their daughter learned about life and death was captivating and insightful.<br/><br/>I give this movie 9/10."

","So it has come to this. From the first eastern-flavored outing of the revenge of the bride, the action moves just a bit to the west to Italy. Having clearly seen one to many Sergio Leone flicks, there's a complete shift in pace and tone in this second volume.<br/><br/>The Bride is back, the usage of fake blood was reduced, the plot thickens and so do the characters. They're far more fleshed out this time and I was quite happy to welcome back the quirks and fanboytalk of a ""usual"" Tarantino-Script (> Superman anyone?)<br/><br/>But: Does it deliver? Does it all add up? Yes! The fight of Elle and the bride is one of a kind. Beautifully shot, beautifully cut, tough, vicious and violent. The included Flashbacks throughout the film give lots more information on the who, what and why and come the final act, you can't help but care about all the characters. As a whole, Kill Bill offers the essence of all those trash-films, we just love to watch and Tarantino successfully shows his affection in this ultimate homage-movie. If you don't like the originals, you won't like this. But if you indeed do like 'em, he just brought the best Luxury-Trash-Movie to a noble end!"
"smallclarkville","Null","1","2","16 April 2004"," Wow.
","If you're a fan of Superman, than you'll enjoy this movie. I, myself, being a fan of Superman, really enjoyed Bill's speech on his favorite comic book character, Superman. The plot to this movie is always changing, up to the end. It'll leave you wanting more. Luckily Quentin Tarantino is still going to be directing, ""Hero"". This movie has the greatest possible actors for the parts, the soundtrack is one of the best I've heard, and the three hours you sit there will go by so quick that it'll feel like maybe fifteen minutes at most. I'd give this movie 5 and a half stars and would suggest that everyone go see it. Quentin Tarantino is one of the best director's of our age."
"solitaireshark","9","1","2","15 April 2004"," Tarantino goes back to what he does best
","Like a good director should, Quentin Tarantino has saved the best for last with Kill Bill Vol. 2. The second film is an emotionally charged finale that will leave you with a smile on your face. Without a doubt, this is Tarantino's finest work especially considering that this is supposed to be one giant film. What he has done is taken everything he loves about cinema and put it all into a gem of a film, and this really comes through in the second volume. Kill Bill Vol. 1 was Tarantino's exercise in making an action movie, Volume. 2 is his Citizen Kane. I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in a long time, and the critics agree that this is one of the best films of 2004.<br/><br/>While the first half of Kill Bill was a crazy mesh of violence, the second half is a poetic character-driven opus that truly is a heartfelt piece of filmmaking. With Volume. 2, Tarantino goes back to what he does best, and that is showing interesting characters, who deliver the coolest dialogue around. There isn't near the amount of action that Volume. 1 contained, and that turns out to be the strength of part 2. We are finally allowed to see Bill's character and his relationship with The Bride (Uma Thurman). David Carradine plays Bill with a smoothness that oozes cool and is totally lovable. Bill can be a mean SOB but he has a purpose and thanks to some excellent scenes with he and The Bride, we get to see his side of the story. Let me say that it is not what you think, and if anything you will adore the character. Carradine delivers his lines in his own unique way, much like Christopher Walken does. In one scene, he talks about why his favorite character is Superman just before the big showdown and you can't help but love the guy.<br/><br/>Other interesting characters inhabit Volume 2 as well. The coolest member of the Viper Squad, Budd, is a cowpoke that realizes the error of his ways and works as a bouncer doing crap work. Michael Madsen plays him with such an air of humility, that you might feel sorry for the guy. Budd is a modern Charles Bronson as a poster in his trailer home references. Not to give too much away, there is a scene involving Budd and The Bride that will have some feeling very claustrophobic just after a dialogue about a flash light and mace. There is a scene with the one eyed Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) fighting The Bride in very close quarters. This is the best cat fight that will probably ever be seen on film and ends in a shockingly funny way. Be on the lookout for a surprise cameo by a famous Tarantino thesp. Of course The Bride needed training for all of the martial arts, so we get a wonderful flashback sequence of her training with Pei Mei. The training sequence is both hilarious and painful, providing some great glimpses into who The Bride is.<br/><br/>Everything surrounding the production of Volume. 2 is top notch. Every chapter is shot with a different film stock, giving each one a different style. Unlike the previous film, Tarantino lets the shots go longer instead of quick cuts, thereby letting us view the characters and events more naturally. Tarantino still uses tricks from his fun bag such as the old fashioned background projections or colored objects in black and white scenes. The music is much more natural and effective in part 2 as well. Robert Rodriguez and his Spanish guitar provide for a cool spaghetti western soundtrack, even Ennio Morricone is used.<br/><br/>Tarantino has delivered a very cool flick and the best film of his career. Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a moving film that is the culmination of what makes cinema fun. If you weren't a fan of Volume 1, you may want to give 2 a chance as it is a much different film. We are shown the motivations of these characters and reminded why The Bride is doing what she is. When you laugh and almost cry when a character delivers a line, that's good cinema. A film that leaves you with a huge smile on your face should be seen and seen again."

Again the black and white scenes, and every move deliberate. Micheal Madsen is exactly what you would hope for, cheesy one liners like we all love. Carradine, looking every bit of 67 at times, surely didn't act like it. His acting and storytelling intriguing along with his smooth voice that just lures you in and makes you want to listen. Overall a 9, but not as much action as KB1, so if you are looking for that, just enjoy how the story comes together.

","Kill Bill: Vol 1 is my favorite film of 2003.  I was blown away by the film, it was a brilliant film made by the excellent Quentin Tarantino.  So obviously, I had high expectations for Volume 2.  Well, I was not disappointed at all.  And hey, if I don't see 10 better films this year, this will be the top of my 2004 list.<br/><br/>Kill Bill: Vol 2 concludes the tale of The Bride, and it does it with wonderful style.  Though it seems a little different than the first film, without all the blood soaked action and multiple killings, it answers all the questions the first film raises.  Now that the viewer can see both films as a whole, it is a perfect revenge story.<br/><br/>There are so many excellent scenes in this film.  I never expected to cry at a Quentin Tarantino film, but this one did it, and it's at the most unexpected moment that I cried (during the chapter of Paula Schultz). <br/><br/>
Quentin is a masterful director, and in this film he further proves it.  He even manages to make montages acceptable and beautiful.  The editing is once again extraordinary, so many great cuts.<br/><br/>Tarantino has made a beautiful film, and it is perhaps my favorite of his career."

And what a wonderful surprise ""Vol. 2"" turned out to be. <br/><br/>THIS is the film the first one should have been. Tarantino, again, offers a pastiche of genres, but, this time, packs it with a thoroughly engaging story, delightfully dark humor, dialogue that crackles and some inspired storytelling. ""Vol. 2"" isn't as violent. Not that I am averse to violence. But, unlike in ""Vol. 1,"" where it just became tedious, here, the bloodletting is handled with great aplomb and makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>There are some marvelous moments in this second installment - a sensational trailer scene between Daryl Hannah (who hasn't looked this sexy in a movie in years) and the uncommonly gorgeous Uma Thurman; a terrific (and horrifying) sequence where the screen goes completely dark; a very funny Bride-Karen scene and some touching moments toward the end, made all the more believable in a movie of this sort because of an utterly convincing and captivating performance by Thurman.<br/><br/>She's fantastic as the vengeful bride. And this time around, she's given some brilliant dialogue to play with. It's typical Tarantino and a pleasure to listen to, especially when delivered by the likes of Thurman, whose timing is immaculate, Hannah and David Carradine.<br/><br/>Robert Richardson's cinematography is spectacular. The early black-and-white shot of Uma Thurman framed by the doorway of the Two Pines Wedding Chapel would have made John Ford proud. And, stick around to the very end. After all the end credits have rolled. You'll be rewarded with a nice surprise.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill, Vol. 2"" is superb storytelling. From the very first frame to the last. If I had to sit through a disappointing ""Vol. 1"" to get to this, so be it. Because the payoff was truly worthwhile."

The first film played out like a video game with great visuals, music, and a thin story without characterization or QT's sharp dialogue (and managed to be great because of all this, because it was, plain and simple, a bloody good, shocking time), while the second one can stand on it's own as a full movie.

The theatre was packed and the emotion began as soon as the Miramax logo appeared on the screen. Then the ""Silhoutte of Doom"" theme by Ennio Morricone. And then, there she was, the Bride talking to the camera in her way to kill Bill. The applause went bigger when the title Volume 2, in a film noir kind of style, appeared. I'm not going to give away any significant spoilers. The film lasts almost 2 hours and a half. It consists of another five chapters. Every one of them is shot in different styles and different kind of film stock. And of course, they are all told in non-linear order. There is an extraordinary ""cat fight"" between The Bride and Elle Driver. It is quite the opposite from the elegance of the scene between O-Ren and The Bride at the end of Vol.1, but it is equally effective. And probably, the most memorable scene of the film: I'm not going to tell you what happens, but it is one that provokes claustrophobic feelings in the audience and is quite terrifying. You'll know what I'm talking about right away when you see the movie. The rest of the movie is soooo different from Vol.1, that you won't believe it is actually part of the same story. Tarantino lowers the level of violence in a pretty significant way, and dwells on a complex love story between Bill and The Bride, who have more things in common that you would think. And who would have known that Bill was such a cool intellectual guy? The movie is almost 100 percent dialogue-dialogue-dialogue and the music is pretty spaghetti western like. We all know what happens at the end. But many will be surprised (and I hope not dissapointed) at how Tarantino resolved it in the end. Just try to understand every word Bill says to The Bride trough the movie and you'll probably loooove the way it ends. Don't expect something graphic, though. But rather, something quite emotional. It goes really deeper than anyone of the press members expected. Kill Bill Vol. 2 goes straight for the audience's heart (well... o.k. you'll see). At the end of the movie, though many adored it and many despised it, we all agreed that Tarantino has surprised us again. The words that people uttered were ""it is cute"", ""tender"" ""moving""...!!! Did we expect that from Tarantino? Never. Is it wrong to make a love story? No, not at all, especially when he is so good at it. Is it better than Volume 1? No, it is different. Extremely different. Is it worth the wait? Hell YEAH!!! ... But will it leave you wanting for a Volume 3?.... Nah.... The Bride has completed her journey. Now, move over."

","First of all i gotta say I think that Kill Bill vol. 1 was fabulous. And that being said - this movie is its exact opposite.<br/><br/>At this point I've watched it twice, and I usually get a lot out of watching a relatively bad movie a second time, since I don't have any expectations it has to fulfill. Plus I get the possibility of getting an alternative perspective on it. But in this case even that did'nt help. Well, first of all the casting is horrible. If you gotta star Michael Madsen, star him at something he is good at. Hence being macho! In this movie he's a drunken excuse for an ex-pro-assassin, being dragged around the nose by his strip-club owner-boss, for whom he works as doorman or should I say doormat. Not cool, since Michael Madsen is a type-actor and nothing else! Secondly Darryl Hannahs performance as a mean, one-eye-patch assassin with a grudge is totally of the scale. And not in a good way! Most critics probably look right through this fact, because they think its intended on Tarantinos behalf, but if you ask me, you cant disguise poor acting, as a filmic visual intend, in relation to 70's blacksploitation movies, when its really nothing but poor acting. And thirdly David Carradine. He couldn't act in North and South and he sure can't act now. For what intend Tarantino drew him out of the closet, other than as a promotional stunt, I really cant see! There you have it. And thats just the cast. Will be back with more on the movie later. Sleep tight."

","This movie was a total letdown. I was expecting it to be a lot better because I loved the first one. Vol 1 was awesome. Vol 2 sucked. If Tarantino would have called volume 1 ""Kill O-Ren Ishii"" and ended it there, I would have been MUCH MUCH happier. This movie wrecks the first one. If I could I would erase it from existence, and then erase everybody's memory of it ever existing. I don't mind there being a bad movie. But when it ruins a perfectly good movie by association, I mind that a lot.<br/><br/>Volume 2 is a complete waste of time... I was so disappointed by this film that I can't even give it more than 1/10.<br/><br/>If they took these two movies and put them together, people would say it's too long and they should just hack off the last one and a half hours, THAT is how bad this movie is compared to the first.

"davidmvining","10","1","3","25 November 2019"," A completely emotionally satisfying work
","Much like The Lord of the Rings and Manon des Sources, Kill Bill was a large movie shot at one time and released in separate parts.<br/><br/>It is amazing that over the course of a single movie, Tarantino turned himself into one of the premier action directors of his generation. The most action-oriented scene he had ever shot before this was probably Mr. White hitting Mr. Pink to the floor in Reservoir Dogs. Then, he brings us Showdown at House of Blue Leaves which is one of the most inventive action tour de forces in modern movie making. One thing Tarantino is, certainly, is a student of film, and it is obvious that he did his homework before he conceived of, planned, executed, and edited together that masterpiece of action cinema.<br/><br/>The movie around it is great too.<br/><br/>This is Tarantino's epic. This is his most sprawling film with a depth of emotion he rarely ever reaches for. The core of the film is The Bride, Uma Thurman's ex-assassin left for dead by her former boss and lover out for bloody vengeance. She's believably tough, angry, scared, and vulnerable at different times. When she cuts through the Crazy 88 at the House of Blue Leaves, we're not only willing to believe that she can do it (complete with stylistic flourishes like wire-fu that enhances the action into some kind of super-reality), but we're also invested in her journey. The key to that investment is, like with most Tarantino films, the film's structure.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is frontloaded with the outer veneer of the conflict that really touches on the most basic of emotions driving The Bride. She was a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, and when she decided to leave, their leader (and her lover), Bill, took it badly and had her killed. She doesn't quite die, wakes up four years later from a coma to find the baby she had yet to deliver gone, and her legs atrophied to nothing. She wills herself back to functional and begins her quest for revenge. We see her second target to start the film, Vernita Green, who functions as a small and darkly comic introduction to the nature of the conflict. The biggest first fight is the first chronologically, O-ren Ishii.<br/><br/>We get O-ren's backstory, which functions not only to tell us the particulars of the young woman's meteoric rise to power within the Japanese underworld, but also as a proxy for the other members of the Squad. We hear very little backstory of the rest of the gang, but we hear O-ren's background in great detail (complete with a full animated sequence). I think that's to give us enough detail to understand O-ren and to also understand that the other members of the squad have similar backgrounds and are similarly deadly, by implication.<br/><br/>We then get that fantastic action sequence. One of the few things I understand about building an extended action sequence is that you can't get boring by doing the same thing repeatedly. You have to have variations, complications, and a story within it. That's exactly what the Showdown delivers. We have different characters that feel distinct (especially the young madwoman, Gogo). We have a progression and escalation of the conflict, and we finally get to a full resolution as The Bride lords over her victims, demanding their lost body parts as her property. It's such a virtuoso demonstration of ability at the service of story. I even love the turn to black and white (which was done for the American version to receive an R-rating, it was released in color around the rest of the world). It gains a certain old-school feel that meshes well with the music choices over the visuals, though I imagine that if Tarantino had known he was going to have to release it like that, he might have made different film stock and lighting choices.<br/><br/>The second part begins in much the same way as the first, with a prologue that essentially tells the audience that The Bride is going to survive until late in the coming action. With Tarantino, it's not about the destination, it's about the journey, and he's there to make the journey as entertaining as possible.<br/><br/>The Bride, fresh from taking out O-ren and Vernita, heads to the American southwest and Budd, Bill's brother and number three on her list. The portrait of Budd that Tarantino draws is so wonderful. He was like the other members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, but he's fallen very far. He's hawked a priceless sword and works as a bouncer in a far from busy strip club, receiving nothing but disdain from his boss and doing the dirtiest jobs in the place. But, he has lost none of his ruthlessness, as The Bride discovers when she shows up at his trailer and tries to take him by surprise.<br/><br/>I love the Showdown at House of Blue Leaves, but I think Budd burying The Bride alive might be the best sensationalistic scene of the film. It's claustrophobic (enhanced by Tarantino beginning the sequence in 1.33:1 instead of the 2.35:1 aspect ratio he had used through the whole film), tense, and Budd demonstrates an easy willingness to cause severe pain on The Bride. Budd's final words of the sequence (""This is for breaking my brother's heart."") is so pitch perfect, and then we have one long shot, mostly in complete darkness, as the heavy and jarring sound of dirt crashing against the wooden casket The Bride has been nailed into shoots through the soundtrack.<br/><br/>Tarantino then jumps backwards in time to one of the earliest events in the film's chronology, The Bride's training with Pai-Mei, the ancient Chinese kung fu master. It's a highly entertaining sequence that shows The Bride's transition from girlish waif to hardened killer, and it's placed right here in order to provide the most emotionally satisfying conclusion to the burial. Watching The Bride get buried, we have no hope, but learning that part of her training could help (and obviously does help) her escape her prison is emotionally satisfying. Placing that training sequence far earlier would put it 3 hours before the burial, and I think it would have diminished the impact of the sequence's emotional delivery.<br/><br/>Anyway, the fights of the film continue to get smaller. Budd gets killed by Elle, the final member of the squad and The Bride's replacement (both Elle and The Bride are blonde with blue eyes, and Elle has obviously become Bill's lover). The Bride, still covered in dirt from her escape, shows up at Budd's trailer and the two have a fight in the dirty confines of Budd's living space. Spittoons are thrown. TV antennae are used as makeshift swords. Walls are torn apart. An eye gets pulled from its socket and stepped on. The Bride makes off, ready to make her final confrontation with Bill.<br/><br/>When she does arrive, she finds that her daughter is still alive and the movie's plot stops. The story doesn't stop, it keeps on headfirst, but the plot of killing Bill comes to a complete halt for about half an hour, and it's a great half an hour. Bill, obviously remorseful for what he had done to The Bride, has raised their daughter, B.B., as well as he could, and she's a cute little four-year-old. The Bride gets to know her daughter and puts her to bed before Bill and The Bride have their first scene together since the wedding (rehearsal) massacre. It's a raw scene of condemnation and hatred. It's such a great scene that reveals the depths of the hatred and love the two shared for each other.<br/><br/>And once again, the fight gets smaller. I've read that the beach fight that Bill proposes was actually Tarantino's plan, and if he had filmed it, I'm sure it would have looked fantastic. However, I find something really satisfying about the final fight lasting roughly five seconds and done entirely while sitting in chairs across a table. It's intimate and about the characters, not the flashy choreography. Everything ""fun"" about the genre has been stripped away by the time The Bride gets to Bill's hacienda. It probably shouldn't come back at that point.<br/><br/>I love this film completely. It's probably Tarantino's most satisfying work emotionally. It has a breadth and depth that is kind of shocking. He became an excellent action director. His dialogue is as fun as ever. He pushed himself to become more, forcing himself to take on tasks that he had never done before, and he excelled at them. This is a triumph for Tarantino."

","Kill Bill Vol 2 expands on the first in every way a great sequel should. With improved writing, an even greater score from Ennio Moricone, and of course David Carradine's stand out preformance as the titular character."
"EddyTheMartian007","8","1","3","3 February 2019"," The character development needed for the first movie. (Minor Spoilers)
","(Minor Spoilers) The Second Part Of Kill Bill is one of the rare sequels which is better than the original in almost every way. This movie is very different to the original having almost no action, and having a much slower pace. Instead of focusing on the great action from the first part, it builds the world more, and its characters.<br/><br/>I think Uma Thurman had a really great performance in some specific scenes. Most of the actors do a great job. The highlights for me were definitely Bill (David Carradine), Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah). I did think one of the scenes with Elle Driver was really over acted, to a point were it felt silly, and overly melodramatic, it was honestly a little funny. I mean her reaction makes sense, but she took it a few steps too far. Also Pai Mei (Chia-Hui Liu) wasn't very good in my opinion. Bill has this weird charm to him, but you still hate him. I thought it was done well. Budd was one of my favorites. He isn't over the top like all the other characters. He's the most believable with clear motivations.<br/><br/>The movie had less plot convenience than the first one. The Bride didn't win because she was lucky this time, she won because of her skills. I still don't understand how she became so skilled. I mean the flashbacks to her training didn't really do much to prove to me that she became master at martial arts. Also I think some of the techniques Pai Mei taught her were really silly. I mean one of them worked, but the other one just made the fight seem underwhelming. What I really did like was that in the last movie she gets shot (or a knife thrown at her) twice, and it barely misses her, but in this movie she does get shot in one scene. However there's still a ton of plot convenience. Like in the first movie the world makes no sense. There's a snake that only attacks one person, gun shots that don't wake people up, someone with the intent of killing not killing the character when they have the chance. There weren't as many big examples as the first one, but it still annoys me. I mean some suspension of disbelief is fine, but honestly when there's so much it really annoys me.<br/><br/>There were a few scenes that were setting up some of the characters, but in a movie where we won't really see these characters for too long, it's felt unnecessary. I mean we could've used this time to better set up The Bride's past, or some more action. Also the bleeping Of The Bride's name made no sense. It isn't really a big reveal, the name bleeping does nothing. I spoiled the name for myself since the beginning and it didn't affect the story at all. I did however really enjoy how Bill manipulated The Bride at the end. It's a really smart idea.<br/><br/>I do have to say though, this movie has just better character development, and the narrative. While the first one excelled in the action, I think this one had much better character moments. It's also more creative with its directing, and now the story progresses. We really do see the effects of Bill on everyone even more. The world is expanded on even more. I also do have to say this movie has some great lines.<br/><br/>Overall I think this movie is better than the first one. Quentin Tarantino does a even better job directing here. There were some great shots, and some nice cinematography. The characters aren't as over the top (for the most part), more fleshed out, and believable. Uma Thurman has a really great performance, and I think the story wraps up nicely (despite the underwhelming final fight). My biggest issue is again how silly, and convenient the movie can be in some parts, but also the lack of action. I mean don't get me wrong I'd rather have good character moments than action, but there's only really 1 good fight and that's it. It also drags a little in the beginning. Regardless this is a better movie narratively, and I did enjoy it. I do still think this movie is a tad overrated though.<br/><br/>7.7/10"

","''The Bride continues her quest of vengeance against her former boss and lover Bill, the reclusive bouncer Budd and the treacherous, one-eyed Elle Driver.''
Starring: Uma Thurman, David Carradine, Daryl Hannah, Michael Madsen...<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol. 2 adds extra plot and dialogue to the action-heavy exploits of its predecessor, while still managing to deliver a suitably hard-hitting sequel/continuation. It's almost a completely different film to the first. Where Vol. 1 is purely action-driven with a lot of uncensored blood & gore, this one is exactly the opposite. The humor of the first volume is gone, the adventure is partly decreased and the tone becomes more serious and dramatic. It however makes up for it as we learn what The Bride's real name is, what happened to her baby, how the massacre happened and more character development for Budd, Elle and Bill. The first volume had some excellent scenes and fantastic direction, but lacked depth in its story. Vol. 2 provides this backing, and does it in an immersive way. With Tarantino having scenes show us past events throughout the film, it allows us to know more backstory about the characters, but in a non-boring way. Every moment feels like it was expertly directed and well put together. There is perhaps only one or two moments of actual violence in this film, the rest is purely story and character driven.
Uma Thurman once again, impresses as The Bride, and this time her character is allowed to become a real human being driven by emotions beyond those connected to a desire for revenge. Bill is a superb character creation of Tarantino's, and he is easily one of the best, most terrifying, interesting and intelligent movie villains of all time. While the story is enthralling throughout, where the film reaches its true potential is in the final act. You'd be surprised if you expect an extravagant and lengthy final battle between The Bride and Bill, as that's what we've been lead to believe by watching the first volume. What Tarantino gives us instead is a taught, tense and sublimely written final conversation between the two characters.
Though some of the dialogues are lengthy, everything just fell into place as the movie progressed to its climax. Kill Bill Vol. 2 is all about the emotional dilemma and conflicts that result to unimaginable consequences. It is less kinetic but more satisfying. Actually, Vol. 1 is 90% style and 10% substance while Vol. 2 is 90% substance and 10% style. Totally, the two films are different, which may be the result of the split. Overall, Vol. 2 contains less action, less fight scenes, but more of backstory, depth, dialogue and better character development.<br/><br/>In Conclusion:
Overall, Tarantino delivers a wonderful cult-style film with a fluent mixture of samurai and western style. Kill Bill plays out much like the concept of revenge itself - actions and instincts engulf us at first, but as time goes on and the journey rampages toward its ultimate conclusion, truth and meaning quickly take over. Where Tarantino starts off with a bang, he rightfully finishes off with a shock to our system - maturity and philosophical contemplation on the subject of revenge and what it means for those involved. As a whole, Kill Bill is utterly unified, possesses a strong, dramatic ark, and, above all, stands as quite possibly the most passionate, loving tribute to cinema ever made."

","'Kill Bill: Volume 2' is the better, perfect half of Tarantino's bloody affair. While Volume 1 was a fast-paced and quirky action film, Volume 2 is a steadily paced drama. Toning down on the excessive violence from the first film, Tarantino adds emphasis more on dialogue. This results in a much more serious and slow-burning atmosphere that makes the ever-so-brilliant fight scenes a whole lot more entertaining. In this case, less is more. During this film, the missing puzzle pieces are all put together into the outstanding, non-linear plot line that makes this film so memorable. Despite being filled with unpredictable plot twists and a satisfying ending, the film really shines through it's superb screenplay. The film has amazing monologues and dialogue that captivates it's audience and showcases mastery of Tarantino's writing. Another great aspect of this film is the developing portrayal of The Bride. Depicted as a ruthless, invincible fighting machine in Volume 1, we see her vulnerability in this film while also learning how she came to be such a deadly assassin. Just like in Volume 1, Uma Thurman plays this role perfectly. It is also David Carradine, who plays the infamous Bill, that plays his character exceptionally well, and delivers great monologues. Overall, this is a flawless conclusion to a great and entertaining film by the ingenious Quentin Tarantino."

"Red-Barracuda","7","1","3","3 August 2017"," Entertaining conclusion to Tarantino's 'Kill Bill' epic
","With this film Quentin Tarantino concluded his 'Kill Bill' epic. The decision to do this as a two-parter was because the material he amassed for the project soon became so sizeable that it became impractical to release as a single film; both movies combined clocked in at over four hours. At the time, Tarantino was such a powerful director that he could essentially do what he liked and this two volume offering is certainly self-indulgent. I've always wondered if, with some editing, there was maybe one excellent film in here as opposed to two good ones. But that is strictly by-the-by now and what we have is two entertaining, if uneven, films. For my money, part one is the superior entry but I still think vol.2 still offers a lot of enjoyment. Where Tarantino's 90's films integrated their movie references and numerous homages into their overall crime stories quite seamlessly, his post-millennium efforts have tended to include them often just for their own sake. This has tended to make his films from this later period feel like the sum of their parts outweighs the whole and overall I have usually felt that they, while often exhibiting directorial and screen writing excellence, often include frustrating moments of inanity. The 'Kill Bill' films display these faults too I think but also the considerable directorial, and to a lesser extent, screen writing skills of its creator. With this entry the Bride continues on her revenge mission against her former colleagues from the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. We learn more about the infamous incident where they carried out a murderous assault on her and her wedding party. We also finally meet Bill for the first time and better understand his relationship with the Bride.<br/><br/>In this entry Tarantino specifically pays homage to the action films of both the east and west, specifically the chopsocky and spaghetti western sub-genres. To this end we have an extended training sequence where the Bride is taught by a martial arts expert, while we also have much Ennio Morricone music on the soundtrack and a cowboy villain to boot. The 'Kill Bills' were probably the least interesting dialogue movies Tarantino has ever delivered, they are much more minimal in this department and much more interested in visuals and action. The writing is still good enough though and more important in the second part than the first certainly. David Carradine finally appears as Bill, I remember thinking at the time that it felt like an eternity before we finally saw him which was as much to do with the idea of this film first being mentioned shortly after Tarantino completed Jackie Brown (1997), so it was a good six or seven years between then until we finally saw Bill on screen in this movie. It was an epic amount of time but Carradine is certainly a good choice in the role and it was nice to see a true b-movie actor get such a prominent billing (no pun intended). The rest of the cast do fine but this is less of an actor's movie than Tarantino normally delivers, it's far more about the overall spectacle and set-pieces. I would probably be inclined to rank this one as the least of Tarantino's movies so far, although that is admittedly a relative statement as I still was very entertained by it."

There is no breathtaking violence aesthetic here, the film only wraps up the story, a disadvantage to the non-linear format that was so powerful in Vol. 1. <br/><br/>As a cinematic experience, Vol. 2 felt lacking and incomplete without its sister film.

"ThreeSadTigers","Null","1","3","12 March 2008"," A dizzying collage of styles, textures and visual references
","Whereas Reservoir Dogs (1991) and Pulp Fiction (1994) took elements from the French New Wave and American independent cinema of the 1980's to create bold, iconic, character driven films rife with clever dialog, uncompromising violence and subtle allusions to a myriad of varied, textured film references, Kill Bill: Volumes 1 & 2 (2003-2004) take the idea of referencing even further, giving us blatant and literal references that cross from one genre to the next with a complete disregard for whether or not the audience is familiar with the kind of work being quoted. This technique is pushed even further in the subsequent Death Proof (2007), which really does require an audience to be familiar with its subject in order to get the most out of the style, set-up and intent. Here, all pretensions to the cinema of the French New Wave are dropped, as well as the more adult-orientated flavour of the previous Jackie Brown (1997), which was perhaps more in keeping with the aging spirit of the blacksploitation sub-genre of films from which it drew a superficial influence.<br/><br/>Instead, Kill Bil finds director Quentin Tarantino shifting his focus to Asian cinema and referencing sources as disparate as Kung-Fu (1972), Lone Wolf and Cub (1972), Lady Snowblood (1973), The Street Fighter (1974), Shogun Assassin (1980) and Ichi the Killer (2001), as well as taking direct influence from the Shaw Brothers studio productions of the 1960's and filmmakers like Kinji Fukasaku and Seijun Suzuki. Alongside these visual and thematic reference points we also have a continual reliance on juxtaposing ideas and iconography taken from spaghetti westerns, blacksploitation pictures, Chinese ""wuxia"" and kung fu movies, Japanese Manga and Anime, hip-hop, American exploitation and revenge cinema, and François Truffaut's The Bride Wore Black (1968). These influences are all combined, sometimes obviously and sometimes with more subtlety, but all used with flair, imagination and intelligence to create the right kind of cinematic environment for this purposely elaborate, over-the-top, comic-book-style tale of roaring rampage and revenge to play out against.<br/><br/>As the film is split into two halves (for commercial reasons, as opposed to artistic; but regardless, tying in with the literary use of voice-over, chapter-heading, an unreliable narrator, etc) there will always be the question of how to critique it. Do we view them as two separate films that should each deliver on the characteristics that we think cinema should pertain to, or do we view this as one long film; a continuation of a single character and theme over the course of two very different though ultimately linked feature films? If we take the former approach, then Volume 2 (2004) is the film that will probably take longer to appreciate on an immediate level, concerning itself more with scenes of character development and that typically unique structuring of dialog that Tarantino does so well. There are a couple of prolonged fight scenes, but nothing approaching the balletic, visually rich and heavily choreographed action of Volume 1; with Tarantino cleverly cutting away from the actual massacre at Two Pines so that the brief snippets from the first film and the few moments that depict the punishing aftermath become even more clouded in mystery, as well as giving us a final ""battle"" that works on an emotional level, as opposed to the physical.<br/><br/>The film gives us much more insight into the relationship between ""The Bride"" and Bill, as well as further fleshing out the background of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. This gives us much more in the way of context when we go back to re-experience the previous instalment in an attempt to restructure the chronology. As with the first film we still have the stylistic elements of over the top martial arts choreography juxtaposed against scenes of more brutal, hard-hitting violence, obvious miniature work that almost points to the original Godzilla films, retro use of rear-screen projection (much like Pulp Fiction), allusions to films as disparate as Twisted Nerve (1968), Hitchcock, Brian De Palma's elaborate use of split-screen, the production design from Gate of Flesh (1964) and Sex and Fury (1974), etc; however here, the references are used for the purposes of drama as opposed to opulent spectacle. Though the performances, plotting and the emotional impact of that grand, unexpected final are all incredible well handled, the overall effect could perhaps be wrongly misinterpreted as boring or uneventful, simply because of the bold contrast to the over-the-top violence and technical virtuosity presented in the high-octane thrills of Volume 1 (2003).<br/><br/>With this in mind, it would seem more appropriate to view the films as one single film; taking into account both the bursts of colour and energy presented in Volume 1 and the slower, more character-driven approach of Volume 2 to really get the most out of the incredible journey that this larger than life character undertakes. It also allows us to better appreciate the extraordinary performance from Uma Thurman in the central role, who here gives one of the best performances of her career; instilling ""The Bride"" with a sense of honour and purpose that makes her violence and bloodshed all the more understandable. Kill Bill: Volume 1 doesn't quite scale the dizzying heights of Tarantino's first three films; lacking the intuitive style, unique dialog and intricate plotting - but it does represent a new phase of his career; one that pushes cinematic reference even further to create a visual tapestry of self-aware cinema that appeals to learned cineastes preoccupied with technique, as well as offering a bold story, memorable characters and a great sense of entertainment."

","I'll spare the details of the plot because there aren't many and you can read the synopsis. Basically Uma Thurman's character wants revenge and wants to kill Bill. There's other people too, but...it feels sort of inconsequential to me. I don't really buy the plot so it was a bit of a let down. I think the way the story is told impresses a lot of people, but I just don't find it that clever.<br/><br/>I don't see how people can truly say this was amazing or horrible when you take in all the elements and judge it on artistic basis. However, just as a general asthetic I can understand people hating it. I am certainly not one of those people...it's interesting to see why people seem so polarized though.<br/><br/>Camera work: great. No argument there from anyone. I do'nt see how you could complain about how this is shot. I didn't read the credits that far because I have no idea who these people are and don't honestly care. But whoever it was, he really brought out the best of what was there.<br/><br/>Acting: pretty damn good considering there's rarely any depth. In spite of such an absence of substance--which anyone in their right mind recognizes--Thurman and Madsen say a lot more when there's no dialog. Carradine's good, etc.<br/><br/>Script: OK. Some people seem to miss Tarantino's overwrought loquaciousness. It would've gotten in the way here...and on the ocassion that it creeps up it continues to get in the way. They're killers not 2nd semester English majors (the kind Quinten puts in every other movie apparently).<br/><br/>Plot: Yeah who are you kidding? It's kind of fun though.<br/><br/>Action sequences: Cool at first, and fortunately there's enough focus to keep you drawn in. Nowadays it seems like there needs to be 15 cuts per second to convey action instead of letting us watch the actual fight. Kudos for not following that trend. On the other hand these become a cliché unto themselves pretty quickly for me.<br/><br/>Style: Look if you want style over substance then go the full way and make it a joke. I think of this movie as an over-budget, less funny, more colorful ""Story of Ricki Oh"" about half the time. Either put more substance in next time or leave it out.<br/><br/>Pretty much middle of the road in terms of quality for Tarantino, but usually I tend to feel his movies fit the extreme. A little more work on the plot would've taken this much farther."

","Disappointing finale to director Quentin Tarantino's ode to modern Hollywood epics as a once believed-dead assassin (Uma Thurman) continues her reign of revenge against former partners who double-crossed her on her El Paso wedding day. Thurman still must overcome professional killers Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah in order to reach the mysterious titled character (David Carradine). Flashbacks galore, side-stories, black and white sequences and more background into the series' key narrative points all mix to make a fascinating and yet somewhat meandering final product. ""Kill Bill: Vol.1"" worked due to chaos, action and crazed cinematic techniques. This sequel seems strangely tame and Tarantino's attempt at focusing on heart rather than reaction falls somewhat flat. Carradine, who was never seen but always horrifying in the original, becomes a strange sort of sadistic-type clown who comes off more funny than menacing. Just lacks the adrenaline and Tarantino's patented killer style that the first had. Still far from a waste, but just does not have the famed director's legendary intensity. Watch for Samuel L.

","The first attempt to view Kill Bill 2 on DVD failed, as the rental store inadvertedly gave me Kill Bill. Second time around, I made sure there was a '2' on there. I settled in, a Texas Tea within my reach (how ironic) and fired up the DVD.<br/><br/>And well over two hours later, I'm writing this review.<br/><br/>Kill Bill 2 picks up where its prequel stopped: The woman who was brutally shot in the head by 'Bill' at the beginning of the first movie is still off to kill every last person who aided Bill in killing her and her soon-to-be-husband. She already killed two, and now there's three more on her list.<br/><br/>The first thing which immediately becomes apparent is that the tone of the movie is completely different than in its predecessor. Instead of excessive martial arts scenes with lots of gore and blood spouting all over the place, we have a much more timid, carefully laid down plot which seeks to answer all questions the first movie raised. (Well, not all, like why Hanzo made a new sword for Kiddo, a.k.a. Mommy, played by Thurman.) Combat is limited to the strictly necessary, with the Final Fight being surprisingly short but to some extent quite predictable.<br/><br/>Despite the good, artistic camera-work, at times gripping and evocative scenes (Kiddo being buried alive, Kiddo meeting her daughter) and good, to the point dialogue, the movie somehow failed to spark my interest. Perhaps because it is so tame in comparison to the first movie: remember, we are dealing with a *continuation* of the story. Perhaps because all the bad guys admit that Kiddo deserves her revenge: where's the fun in killing off the bad guys who admit to being bad? Okay, they certainly don't intend to put their heads on the chopping block willingly, but still. Perhaps because you know already that everyone is going to die a horrible death, and that of course, Kiddo will find Bill, and kill him. Perhaps she will die in the process, but kill him she will. Perhaps because about 1/4th into the movie, you know *how* Bill is going to die. Or, perhaps when you see Kiddo being shot in the breast by Bill's run-down bro, Budd. Excuse me, but if you can handle well over 100 well-trained swordsmen, you do *not* run into the line of fire of an ex-killer with booze for blood.<br/><br/>There are plenty of little surprises and twists to the tale, so it takes a while to get to the end. But because you know what the end will, has to, must be, and because the movie takes on a completely different character, it becomes somewhat slow and boring. I am sure there are plenty of people who will be lyrical about the entire thing, citing the good character interplay, sneaky twists, the stark contrast with movie one yet holding up its own without effort, and lots, lots more. You can read it in the other reviews. I can certainly understand why those things have been, are being and will be said. Problem is, I am not plenty of people. On its own, good movie, make sure you see it. As a continuation of a story of brutal revenge... No.<br/><br/>6 out of 10."
"azrael41","10","1","3","11 October 2004"," Vol 2. is to story what Vol. 1 is to Style
","Here we have a ""continuation"" of one of the most perplexing, stylistic, mystifying, and action packed movie experiences ever put on film. I had no idea what to expect walking into the theatre to view Kill Bill Vol. 2. The first film was clever, wrought with Tarantinian logic and style, unspeakably violent, and one hell of a good time. But I couldn't watch vol. 1 without the sinking feeling that there was almost literally no story involved. Tarantino made a film which seemed to exist so that he would have an excuse to recreate shots from his favorite kung-fu films, single handedly support the ""movie blood"" industry, and coordinate breath taking a beautiful fight sequences. It moved at a break neck pace which left no time for character development or conflict. I feared that Vol 2. would make the mistake of attempting to maintain this pacing.<br/><br/>My worries, however, proved to be unfounded. Instead, Tarantino's second installment tones down the miraculous action sequences(but does not eliminate them) so that we can pay more attention to why things are happening, and what is driving these characters to do what they do. There are feasts for the eyes and the ears. This film is largely more influenced by the Spaghetti Westerns and Sergio Leone than the first. Robert Rodruigez and the Rza provide great throwback music which the director perfectly mates with his images. However, Vol. 2 finds its greatest asset in the character of Bill, portrayed by David Carodine in the most surprising performance of this or any year.<br/><br/>It is important to note, when watching either film, that neither is complete unless viewed with the other in mind. This is a single film, written, acted, and photographed at the same time. The decision to split the film apart came in post-production, and to consider it as two separate films is to do an injustice to the much greater work as a whole. This film is the key to all genre film-making. The filmmaker has created a work in which a frame from any of its influences could easily find a home within the reels of his movie. This goes beyond the similar aspirations of Raiders of the Lost Arc, Star Wars, and Silverado, among others, to prove itself not only a great movie, but another piece of film making genius by Quintin Tarantino."

","In Kill Bill: Volume 1, we as an audience were thrilled to see the return of Quentin Tarantino and this magnificent artwork. Now as he continues with this Vol. 2, it seems that this one slightly outranks its predecessor. This film is absolutely brilliant for one reason because of the diolague. Because Tarantino tones down the excessive violence that was featured in Vol. 1, we can focus more on the characters and the powerful diolague from his magnificent screenplay. Also, though Uma Thurman is still dominate, the supporting characters are good as well. Such as Budd who almost plays a reformed sinner and Elle who is a sinister person and has the greatest scene in the entire movie, a showdown between her and the Bride in Budd's trailer. But one of the greatest characters is of course BILL. David Carradine is so brilliant in this role that the character seems to come alive. Through watching him, we have this feeling that even though he presents himself as a simple human being, through his actions we can see he is really a sick and sadistic person. My only complaint is that Michael Parks seems to try too hard to play a Mexican and get a thick Spanish accent than try to work on his lines. But still, this is an excellent film, a true delight and one that should surely not be missed. (***1/2)A-"

","While not one of the original harbingers of the so-called ""geek cinema"" of motion pictures, Quentin Tarantino is more or less afforded with the ""auteur"" status because his films sell tickets. But KBV2 is the paradigm for excess. There is simply too much dialogue being spoken in this film, not that there's anything wrong with dialogue. It's just not modulated enough with the action to achieve an interesting flow. At least 25 minutes of this film could have been cut with the first film, KBV1, and still have a movie that runs less that TITANIC did. Unless you're a big Michael Madsen fan, and I'm guessing more than half of you aren't, you won't enjoy KBV2. <br/><br/>The best part of the film, and probably of the two films, is the parody of Asian 70's kung-fu cinema with Gordon Liu.

The first movie was definitely one of Tarantino's best yet, didn't beat Pulp, but it was also a different kind of movie all together. Vol. 1 was quite artistic in many ways... the huge amounts of blood, the cartoons, the whole atmosphere made the whole movie feel surrealistic.

I enjoyed the other scenes that were true Tarantino. Not a bad film, but one that SHOULD have been better. I wish the studio heads would leave him alone! If they had left him alone, he may have on his own cut it down to one 2 1/2 hour film that was lean."

","Photography and art direction are Oscar-calibre.  However, we were checking our watches during several talky scenes, especially when David Carradine was droning on. And. On. In. His. Very.

However, it must be acknowledged that he gives a gem of a performance.<br/><br/>On the plus side, it's not as bloody or gory as I feared (I didn't see KB-1) due to the comic-book style.  At times this comic-bookness seemed like a cop-out, providing an easy out for things like, how can someone get shot point blank with a double barrel shotgun and not have to deal with a cavern in their chest -- or at the very least the embedded buckshot.  Clearly, the director is so in love with the images and the IDEA of the film, that he loses the plot and structure of the actual film we are watching.  I mean, really, how many people were clamoring for an homage to martial arts films? And how many really needed a sequel to the homage?  I got the point after 20 minutes - I really didn't enrich my life with another 2 hours of the same parody."

","KBv2 is a nice movie, very well acting but in my opinion a comedy. Bit cornball and also long (and slow compared with v1). I believe it's more of a Tarantino hype then the movie is worthy. A lot of funny pointers too any move we ever might have seen, but also overdone. Very nice photography, very well instructed. I lack the kung fu capabilities of ""little Grasshopper""/Kwai Chang Kain David Carradine. My guess is they made a lot of money by spending as little as possible on locations, scenery and background. But why not if you can get away with it? As this is the part two of one movie I'm afraid that the whole thing is too long (4 hours) for a single line story, in which some impossibilities repeat to much, there could have been a bit more creative vision on these points.

"ALauff","8","1","3","23 April 2004"," The Second Half of Tarantino's Masterpiece
","This is a much more contemplative, somber, and deterministic film than Vol. 1. The tonal disparity can be attributed to the splitting of a completed film into two seemingly dichotomous parts. Critics seem to be ignoring that this is merely the second half of a saga; perceptions of Vol. 2 as being closer to a ""true"" Tarantino film have abounded, with this film being considered a satisfying sequel rather than the plaintive coda it happens to be. Of course it is a tall order to solder the delirious assortment of styles and influences of the first film with the masterly pacing and reflectivity of Tarantino's denouement, but that is part of the unique challenge of Kill Bill, an unwieldy masterpiece that reflects the breakneck referentiality, the encyclopedic knowledge of genre archetypes, and the bewildering love for cinema of its creator.<br/><br/>Tarantino's sophistication in knowing when and how to reference his pet influences—kung-fu grind-house flicks of the '70s and spaghetti westerns, most vitally The Good, the Bad and the Ugly—adds immensely to his deft handling of conflict (physical, emotional, psychological) and the mythos of the avenging hero. Occasionally it can be frivolous: I could have done without the beard-stroking of the talismanic sensei, but it was an inconsequential irritant, a jest to the B-level qualities of the source material. Those who use self-indulgence as an open-and-closed criticism of this film and its maker are missing the point: Kill Bill is a catalogue of obsessions and an indulgent pastiche, yes, but it's also deeply considerate and generous to its audience, couching the more obscurantist elements and tendencies in recognizable and skillfully rendered cinematic language. Listening to some people talk, you'd think Tarantino committed a mortal sin by opening a portal to his brain. That it's mediated by some very empathetic performances (Uma Thurman, in particular, is a marvel: she endures physical and emotional highs and lows in the most rigorous and touching ways), and his most restrained screenplay yet, proves his interest in tapping into a more challenging aesthetic beyond that of fan-boy élan (something that still rankles me about Pulp Fiction).<br/><br/>In this latter half, themes of fatalism and penance—briefly touched on in O-Ren's dying contrition—hang over certain of The Bride's waiting victims, creating in Budd (Michael Madsen) something of a purgatorial void of guilt and regret. He works as a bouncer at a vacant saloon, enduring abuse and mockery from his obnoxious, drug-running boss; he spends the evenings pulling on a bottle of Jameson and crooning to Johnny Cash. And yet, despite his concession that the Bride ""deserves her revenge and we all deserve to die,"" he doesn't exactly surrender or give in when she comes calling. Why? There is an extraordinary, digressing monologue delivered by Bill late in the film that is as effective as any high-noon showdown in elucidating the warrior's existential code of fighting even when there is nothing worth fighting for. These are tough, spirit-deadened men, acting on instinct alone. The women are a different matter entirely: Elle (Darryl Hannah), for her part, yearns for battle, desiring the Bride to ""suffer until her final breath,"" but respecting her as a peerless combatant. And I don't remember Vernita or O-Ren having much empathy, despite one mothering a child of her own and the other a victim of unspeakable childhood tragedy (the maverick anime insert, which may still be Kill Bill's most disturbing sequence). These are women largely without conscience, embracing their dark natures, masculine counterparts to the apprehensive men.<br/><br/>Overall, I believe it to be a tricky proposition to link fluidly the two volumes—the tonal disparity remarked upon earlier could just as well be the effect of re-ordering and re-cutting scenes in post-production to reflect two separate films, the first more compressed and violent to entice audiences to see the second, illuminating volume. A best-case scenario would be for Miramax and Tarantino to release the film in its original state (as a third DVD along with the two individual volumes in a box set) to reflect what it was before it had to carry the weight of two feature films. Then we would have a true rarity: a chance for filmgoers to see if marketers and bean counters truly know what's best for them."
"XFLRWF","9","1","3","21 April 2004"," Tarantino's Martial Arts Masterpiece
","With the brilliance of a gleaming samurai sword, `Kill Bill: Vol. 2' shines as an outstanding conclusion to its 2003 predecessor.  The second part in the revenge epic from writer/director Quentin Tarantino takes a breather from the stunning, over-the-top action sequences of Vol. 1 to focus on the origins and backgrounds of the characters.  This does not by any means take away from the film's greatness or viewing satisfaction.  Audiences and fans are still treated with a clever script filled with sharp, philosophical dialogue complete with powerful and emotional acting that is common in Tarantino's movies.  Having left his trademarks all over `Kill Bill: Vol.1', Tarantino finally completes his tribute to his adored martial arts genre in his own captivating style.<br/><br/>Four years after she was unmercifully beaten and left for dead by her former assassin cohorts, the Bride AKA Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) returns to the United States to finish her quest for vengeance.  Wanting to leave her old life behind her and settle into motherhood, Black Mamba was busy with her wedding rehearsal.  Unable to let her enter her new life, Mamba's former boss and beau, Bill (David Carradine) orders her execution by the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox).  Following her recovery, Black Mamba sliced and killed her way down her hit list while encountering near-death circumstances and vicious villains.  When Black Mamba's journey ends, she must not only face her old master but also the ace up his sleeve.<br/><br/>Director Tarantino incorporates the same ingenious and unique filmmaking style that he carried out in `Vol.: 1.'  This fact comes as treat for the patient movie fans that have waited for the film's continuation. Utilizing his trademark jumps between time and space, Tarantino employs this skill with even more precision.  Each time jump ties in directly with the scene that it jumped from in the present time.  This direction gives the audience a better understanding of how and why the heroine arrives at each of her circumstances.  Lighting also plays an important role in the film. Tarantino's use of light (and sometimes lack thereof) is a key factor to capturing the characters' emotion in several scenes.  The lighting provides the audience with a better tool to comprehend a character's thoughts and feelings and gives the audience a special viewing experience.<br/><br/>The collaborated script of Tarantino and Thurman contains even more concepts from martial arts cinema and are incorporated with Tarantino's amusing views on life.  Whereas the first film focused on incredible sword fights and eye-popping effects, `Kill Bill: Vol. 2' is more character driven while still containing a good amount of fighting and swordplay.  It is in `Vol. 2' that we learn more of how the characters came by their skills and the relationship between Bill and Black Mamba.  A beautifully done scene in which Carradine entices Thurman with his flute playing while regaling her with a tale about his former teacher not only integrates the kung-fu style of filmmaking but also explains the closeness once shared between the couple.  The exceptionally hardcore Tarantino aficionados will particularly love the director's comic book explanation on humanity and finding oneself.<br/><br/>
Uma Thurman continues her Oscar worthy performance as Black Mamba.  In the role, Thurman plays not only an expert killer but also a human being. Thurman's character is not the typical heroine who is infallible and unfeeling.  Rather, she has fears when she is beaten and feelings of both love and regret on her quest.  Thurman's portrayal is so powerful that passion of her performance is emitted through the screen.  The audience can sense her every thought and feeling as she struggles through dire circumstances and the elation of her victories.  David Carradine is the perfect mix of coolness and ruthlessness as Bill.  In `Vol. 1', Carradine's voice carried out his performance.  In `Vol. 2', the audience gets the privilege of seeing how acting matches the action.  Carradine's rendering of Bill is not that of a callous fiend who kills without any remorse or logic. Instead, his actions are from the knowledge and acceptance of who and what he is.  Carradine performance of this realization is done in such a matter-of-fact manner that one would almost believe Carradine was speaking of himself.  Carradine also pulls are rare feat by evoking a small piece of understanding and sympathy for the criminal.  This is accomplished through the terrific on-screen chemistry between Carradine and Thurman.  Carradine brings about the sincere love Bill has for Black Mamba that it makes the shooting seem more as a crime of passion than a crime of hate.  Equally impressive are the supporting roles of Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen as Elle Driver and Budd respectively.  Hannah is deliciously evil as Driver. A complete 180 from the beauty roles she is known for playing, Hannah's Driver is out for herself and will crush anyone who gets in her way.  Her performance as the deadly killer is a villain colder than the other side of the pillow.  Hannah plays the role with such ability that she rivals many femme fatale roles.  In a similar 180 move, Madsen's Budd is not the sadistic, torture-loving villain that the actor has been known to play. Rather, Madsen portrays Budd as a down-on-his-luck con who is always looking for a quick buck.  Although the character is not extremely vicious or confident, Madsen still manages to exert his own charisma into making Budd a worthy character.<br/><br/>`Kill Bill: Vol. 2' has all the action and witticisms that movie goers loved from `Vol. 1.'  Tarantino's unique eye and camera direction gives the film life and the incredible acting talents of his cast bring the screenplay into being.  Tarantino's kung-fu masterpiece is so incredibly well done that it almost seems a shame that the film was cut in two.  But each volume is a work of art.  Tarantino's tribute will not only stand as one the greatest and meticulous films ever made but may just secure a place for the maverick director in the kung-fu hall of fame."

","Anyone who is a fan of Mr. Tarantino's understanda what he did with KILL BILL VOLS. I + II. In the first one we get an action movie, a movie that sucks you in to a world of revenge. It makes you a spectator in a series of wonderfully violent murders. It makes you wonder whose side you're on. It brings you to the very essence of antici...(WAIT FOR IT)...pation when it ends. Then came VOL. II. We don't know what to expect. All we know when leaving the theater last fall is that there's the daughter, who's alive, and there's her father, who's gonna die. I felt that the movie didn't need to suck you in to an emotional love story. You don't need to cry at the end. If that's what you want go see MY GIRL, or some such nonsense. What you need to remember always with these movies is that their originality is equal to their satire. That these 2 movies are Q's homage to the movies that many of us grew up watching. I, as much as anyone, would pretend I was Bruce Lee in my bedroom. I'd practice kicking and punching imaginary bad guys with my ""kung fu."" And after seeing KILL BILL VOLS. I + II, I found myself doing that again in my living room. KILL BILL VOL. II is the sort of movie that can only be taken lightly by serious fans. Its the sort of film that makes you wonder why action movies ever began going for drama. The fight scenes in KILL BILL VOL. II are a little less over the top. But thats what makes them great. After you kill the peons in a video game you don't want to keep fighting them when you're trying to beat the boss. With the less dramatic fight scenes you have a chance to see the movie for its true worth. You get to take a breath and see that these characters were very well crafted. And each intricate detail in the movie is made more precious by not being dominated by Stallone/Schwartzenegger crap. I loved this movie more than any of Tarantino's other movies, which is saying a helluva lot since I own every single one. You either get it or you don't. You don't have to be a fan of old movies to understand these 2, anymore than you had to be a fan of oldies music to laugh at some very sick scenes in RESEVOIR DOGS. This is the beauty of Tarantino. Now, seeing this beloved cult classic icon on American Idol is a whole different story..."
"Super_Fu_Manchu","Null","1","3","22 April 2004"," The final, unexpected touch to a remarkably beautiful and brilliant saga
","minor spoilers ahead...<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino has crafted a magnificent piece of cinema that has an unexpected beauty, resonance and ultimate maturity that undermines Vol.1, which, although an explosive collection of balls-to-the wall grindhouse action and a superb Saturday night at the movies, could almost be seen as not much more than a throat clearing in comparison. In a word, the film is breathtaking. It has everything that a film fan could ever want; comedy, romance, action, horror, suspense, as well as a script of the likes you've never heard of before. Q.T's actors, Thurman, Madsen and Carradine particularly, know this film is more than just a plain and simple roaring, rampage of revenge. They are heartfelt, effortlessly skilled in the art of cool and brimming with charm. Tarantino, meanwhile, somewhere in the background (or foreground) of every frame, has proved himself to be the Shakespeare of comic books, a poet of pop culture, a jukebox to an endless riff of great music.<br/><br/>For a start, as with the first part, the film is an orgy of cinematic enthusiasm. Film fans will lap up the references to movies such as Fulci's 'Zombi 2', 'Babycart At The River Styx', 'Branded To Kill', 'Carrie' and countless Spaghetti Westerns. A particular highlight is Pai Mei's character- a typical Shaolin priest/trainer played by Liu - made famous by the film this sequence lovingly homages, '36th Chamber Of Shaolin'. The Lonesome Grave Of Paula Schultz, (itself a reference to a film called The Wicked Dreams Of Paula Schultz), is a superbly gruelling half-an-hour with heavy comic undertones, masterful direction and Madsen's ever likable presence. The opening sequence, if slightly stilted, still provides comedy and a well marked change of style from Volume 1. The soundtrack too, a sweeping succession of Ennio Morricone feel totally at home and will have fans (including myself) smiling widely. Other passing moments wash by, Black Mamba snake deaths narrated by grisly internet facts, a Silent Flute homage by Carradine on Pei Mei, a Johnny Cash backed ninja scene, a Fulci eye-gag and heavily layered self referential humor, all of which give the film a unique, dynamic feel that makes it incomparable with anything else. In a way that reminded me of Pulp Fiction, still my favorite Tarantino film, it has an overwhelming creativity that never numbs, but always surprises and impresses.<br/><br/>The final act is really where this film not only enters a different league, but creates its own. When Thurman's Kiddo witnesses a comic recreation of her 'rampage' starring none other than her little girl, the conventions of the double bill have been officially thrown on their head. We have been taken out of the movie-movie world, and smack bang into reality. What follows is one of the most touching, unique and instantly brilliant scenes ever shot since Edison invented the camera. As well as highlighting Carradine's talent (as if this needed to be proved), the scene also highlights the voice of Tarantino. On face value, perhaps, what we've come to expect from Tarantino seems like it may have left the theatre. But what we're seeing is his most personal piece of writing so far. His youth, only-child to a single mother, is openly reflected as Kiddo and her daughter watch Shogun Assassin. The unexpected track 'About Her' hones us in on a searingly moving piece of film, its melody laden with tragedy. The colors from the TV splash onto Thurman's emotive face displaying the kind of subtlety we don't really expect from Q.T, let alone from Kill Bill, and the film has been given a backbone no amount of bloodshed would have provided.<br/><br/>This, and Bill's exit, are utterly remarkable moments in a film full of remarkable moments. Bill is killed, not in searing black and white from a rip roaring samurai slice to the throat, but like Emilio the fish B.B takes out of the water. A man, who in full knowledge of his wrong doing, accepts what has come to him, and dies as a father. One minute he's flapping on the carpet, the next minute he's not flapping on the carpet. What better way than to express death, something the films have dished out by the bucketful, and that critics have endlessly criticized Tarantino for? And, what responsibility on Tarantino's part not to shy away from giving his film a moral core, as well as an emotional one, that makes it more than just a 2D comic book. The enthusiasm behind the camera is still 110% in evidence, but it doesn't need to carry the film anymore. There's a core to this that not many could have possibly expected, and what we realize we are seeing by the end, is Tarantino's most 3 dimensional films so far, as well as of course, the best film of the year."

"tylerjohnson3-1","Null","1","3","22 April 2004"," DiVAS represent genres?
","I just saw the film for the second time last night and it occurred to me that each of the DiVAS represents a different classic genre to which QT is paying tribute.  Budd is the archetypal western loner, Elle the noir-ish femme fatale, Vernita Green represents the Foxy Brown-type blaxploitation character (which Quentin already paid homage to in ""JAckie Brown""), O-ren Ishii represents the strong female roles often found in kung fu films and anime, and Bill and Beatrix represent the villain and hero roles which are universal in all of these genres.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I thought it brilliant that Quentin was able to pay tribute to these classic genres, while at the same time creating a wholly unique masterpiece.  My girlfriend, who has never seen a spaghetti western or kung-fu film in her life, enjoyed it as much as i did.  Just goes to show how this film can be enjoyed on several levels."

","Kill Bill 2 is, by far, the most powerful film to come out of Tarantino's massive head.  Maybe it isn't as hilarious as Pulp Fiction, or as jam-packed with blood, gore, and action as Kill Bill Volume One, but it is by far the most emotional. I'll be honest, when I went in to see this at a late night show, I had already heard that it was slow, boring, and that the dialogue was monotonous, and I feared that I might fall asleep at a Tarantino movie, god forbid. Instead I cried. The Bride and Bill now join the illustrious list of film characters who have illicited tears from me, next to Jesus and Samwise Gamgee. Quentin crafts a relationship with these two that is much deeper than any we have seen from him before.  There is a bittersweet kind of connedtion between the two, right down to the very end. But, aside from all of the emotions, there is also plenty of other good things about this picture. Michael Madsen's portrayal of Budd is so well done that I go from wanting to feel bad for the man to wanting to cut his head off in the course of two minutes and one plot twist.  I won't give away the big surprise related to him, but let's just say it strikes when you least expect it. Darryl Hannah's Elle Driver serves one purpouse in this film; to get the livng snot beat out of her in the most epic catfight of all time.  She fullfills her duties well. Quite honestly, this review doesn't really explain how good Volume 2 is.  You have to see it for yourself."
"halo_fourteen","8","1","3","21 April 2004"," Completing the birth of a legend
","The second part to this film has probably been one of my most anticipated moments in cinema of the last year at least (par Shaun of the Dead) and with good reason. The first came out with such a bang that it's hard to ignore, and you can't help yourself, but to want find out what could drive The Bride to kill so many people so violently. And yes, nearly all your questions will be answered (I do say nearly though). They may not always be the answers you were hoping they were going to be, (but this is Quentin Tarantino - when has he ever been one to go with the flow?) however as the story unravels in it's infamously non-chronological order, it all comes together.<br/><br/>After getting a severe beating from Budd, you begin to learn more about the Bride's past with Bill and Pai Mai, and this becomes a segnificent domino effect to how the twists in the plot are going to unravel and lead you into many moments of you thinking, ""ah, that's clever"". A few more excellent fight scenes (especially with Elle Driver), although the death and gore count is substantually less than Volume 1. However this is made up for.<br/><br/>It sometimes feels that Volume 1 and 2 are completely different films given the first finished so violently and to the very maximum that you have to allow the film to slow down ""before this tale of bloody vengence reaches it's climax"" according to Bill. Volume 2 kind of takes on a new plot as it's more about answering questions and discovering the meaning behind what is now a legend. If you were to watch this film as a single piece, as it was originally meant to be, then nothing is going to compare to the House of Blue Leaves scene (in other words, all the action gets over and done with) but your eyes will be peeled with awe at discovering the truths. So it's a double edged sward (excuse the pun) between action and the fantastic Tarantino script lacking from the first Volume.<br/><br/>Performances were astounding by everyone, and this goes without saying to be Uma Thurman's greatest roll to date. David Carradine is just the greatest villan in recent film history.<br/><br/>A few unanswered questions, such as why did Bill initially still want The Bride dead (when Elle tries to kill her in a coma) when he admits to regretting shooting her in the first place (true, he does abort the mission, but whether he was just telling Elle to calm down for B.B.'s sake or he wanted to actually kill her when she woke up becomes more of a mystery later on).<br/><br/>Generally though a satisfactory ending and combined with Volume 1, this will be one of the greatest films of the decade."

In other words, he now has the European love of character and the long take married to the American love of cinematic effects and action. I no longer have to make apologies to my Euro friends.<br/><br/>Beatrix Kiddo, aka Black Mamba and The Bride, played by Uma Thurman, calls her adventure in `Kill Bill' `a roaring rampage of revenge,' an understatement if you consider both `Kill Bill' volumes 1 and 2 barely miss a frame that is not aimed at her revenge for her attempted murder and the massacre of her wedding party at the hands of former lover, Bill (David Carradine), and his Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. <br/><br/>In `Bill' 2, Tarantino spares no comic book or grind house allusion to boast his former video clerk geekiness.  Perhaps the most influential young director today, he still has the childlike wonder about those stories of super heroes flying in the air or Kung fuing like ballerinas. As opposed to the frenetic martial arts and dialogue minimalism of `Kill Bill: Vol.1,' `2' lets us enjoy Beatrix and Bill enjoying each other with dialogue before they engage in deadly battle, albeit not the usual Tarantino gutter lingo.<br/><br/>Add to all this virtuosity a sense of humor as sophisticated as any in a French romance, for instance, when one-eyed Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) having introduced a very bad opponent to the venom of a black mamba snake, reads the web description of the deadly effects while he lives them. But Tarantino never keeps his two eyes off his revenge motif, in the end giving his viewers the sense of artistic unity and letting himself enjoy his uniquely stylized violence.  The poet Shelley seemed to be thinking of this auteur in ` The Cenci': <br/><br/>`All men enjoy revenge, and most exult Over the tortures they can never feel- Flattering their secret peace with others' pain.' <br/><br/>`Kill Bill: Vol.2' is more substantial than `Vol. 1' and closer to a type of filmmaking reserved for only the most talented directors. It's a killer."
"mattdvs","8","1","3","20 April 2004"," A satisfying conclusion to the epic
","Tarantino makes his return to the talky action movie genre with the second part in his Kill Bill epic.  The first, naturally titled Kill Bill Volume 1, followed the Bride, a former assassin played by Uma Thurman, as she exacted bloody revenge on her former colleagues.  All we learn in the first movie is that on her wedding day, while pregnant, Bill, the Bride's boss, and his gang of DiVAS (Deadly Viper Assassination Squad) ambushed the wedding and massacred everyone.  They presumed to have killed the Bride, but they failed and instead left her in a coma for four years.  After waking up and teaching her muscles to move again, she begins her rampage to kill all those who wronged her.  The first movie concludes with the Bride killing the two bottom-tier assassins in the squad along with sixty-something bodyguards. At the end of Volume 1, we learn that he baby survived and, unbeknownst to her, was taken in by Bill and raised as his daughter.  We didn't know who any of the characters were, why they wanted to kill the Bride, or really anything at all about Bill, the charismatic leader of the gang.  Volume 1 was a hyper-kinetic action movie that only really took pause once, to explain how the Bride got her samurai sword.  It was a great film, but felt pretty superficial compared to any of Tarantino's others, in that one of his trademarks is the intimacy the audience feels with the characters.  The two volumes were supposed to come out as one movie, but as shooting went on, Tarantino and Miramax realized they were gonna have a four hour action movie on their hands, and so they decided to cut it into two more manageable chunks.  After watching Volume 2, it's hard to believe that Kill Bill was ever supposed to be anything but.<br/><br/>If Volume 1 was supposed to just introduce us to the story and then watch the characters kill each other, Volume 2 explains all the whys.  Volume 1 was all action; Volume 2 is all talking.  This isn't meant to be a bad thing, however.  By the end of Volume 1, we wanted to know why we saw what we just saw.  In Volume 2, Tarantino explains it to us.  This serves to make us more connected with the characters.  We really care who lives and who dies.  And, the greatest thing about Volume 2 is by the end, even though we know what a heartless, murdering ba****d Bill is, we kinda like him.  We don't even like him in that villain-loving way, where we want to see him get his comeuppance.  We honestly like him and kinda wanna see him and the Bride (later revealed to be named Beatrix Kiddo) end up to raising their daughter together.  Obviously, as you can probably tell by the title, this doesn't happen.  No spoiler warning necessary there.<br/><br/>This is quite a feat for Tarantino to pull off, given everything that we've seen before the end and knowing full well Bill and his cronies did everything to kill the Bride in several heinous ways.  This is what makes Kill Bill Volume 2 a fantastic movie.  By making us wait to have our questions answered, our sympathies change and change again throughout the story.  Yes, it's a talky movie, as every Tarantino movie up until Volume 1 was, but the dialogue is largely interesting and only serves to give every character some form of dimension.  Don't go into it expecting more of the same ultraviolence and gore as we saw in the first one, but rather with the attitude of trying to find out why all the ultraviolence and gore was necessary.<br/><br/>My ratings (out of ****):<br/><br/>Volume 1 Writing             *** Acting             **** Direction          ***1/2 Action                 **** Overall             ***1/2 Volume 2 Writing            **** Acting              **** Direction          **** Action              ***1/2 Overall             **** Entire epic Overall             ****"

","I was very much obsessed about this movie for month and every thing other that what Volume 2 appeared to be would have easy resulted a disappointment, I don't think that there are too many people in the world that can appreciate the Kill Bill saga as much as I did, they might like it but not as much as I do. I mean it's like Quentin has watched an enjoyed the same movies I did and the same movies that I loved growing up and created this spaghetti western/kung fu epic masterpiece of an odyssey that I've always fantasized of watching. Delicious style mixed with great movie genre loving and savvy film knowledge, a great sound track, amazing acting performances and beautiful photography makes that movie a joy to watch.<br/><br/>I'll be waiting for the DVD that will combine the two volumes and it will be hard to find another movie to get obsessed about!"
"dfranzen70","6","1","3","20 April 2004"," Eh.
","My first thought is that this isn't nearly as good as the first one. But that's a little unfair, since the first one was (for me) an amazing film.<br/><br/>Making a two-volume movie is a huge gamble. If the first one tanks, then no one's going to want to see the second one, which has likely already been filmed. If the first one is a rousing success, though, then it becomes the standard by which the second one is judged. For the filmmaker, this can be a losing proposition.<br/><br/>The movie follows the revenge game played by The Bride (Uma Thurman), on her quest to find the man who ordered her wedding party slaughtered. Oh, and the man whose baby she was carrying when he put a bullet in her brain. Only the bullet didn't kill The Bride - it merely put her in a long coma. And when she woke up - look out!<br/><br/>In the first film, The Bride tracked down two of her former compadres in killing as part of an elite hit squad. Now she has three names left on her list: Budd (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), and her ex-boss and ex-lover, Bill (David Carradine).<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino takes an approach similar to the one he used to such great success in Pulp Fiction and that he reused in the first Kill Bill movie - scenes (chapters, in this case) that are shown to the audience out of order. Luckily, the scenes aren't so jumbled that the audience can't follow what's going on. In fact, the order rearranging is fairly tame by Tarantino standards.<br/><br/>Tarantino does a great job in incorporating various movie genres into his film; it's part samurai thriller, part kung fu actioner, part cheesy, kitschy, zap-powie seventies schlock. He's always been proficient in this area; Pulp Fiction's characters at times seemed to be stuck in the seventies, but at the same time they didn't appear to be fish out of water. That's the genius of Tarantino.<br/><br/>Where this film diverges from the first, however, is in its pacing. Volume 1 was chock full of fast-paced action scenes - The Bride taking on the Crazy 88 springs to mind - but while there are a few interesting, riveting scenes in Vol. 2, there aren't nearly enough of them. And because there are insufficient action scenes, there are plenty of times when the movie seems to flag a little. A lull in a Tarantino movie can be richly cultivated (remember the ""awkward silences"" scene with Thurman and John Travolta in Pulp Fiction), but if there's nothing going on either above or below the surface, then the audience will get a little bored. Especially if they've been expecting wall-to-wall gore.<br/><br/>The performances are rather remarkable, however. Thurman continues to amaze as The Bride (a character she and Tarantino came up with together). Quick - how many action movies can you name that had a strong female lead? Ok, now how many of those were any good? Thurman would have to be incredible in order to carry this film, and she doesn't disappoint in the least. Whereas she was a pleasant surprise in Vol. 1, we now expect her to do the same in Vol. 2, and she's up to the task.<br/><br/>Equally up to the task is 67-year-old David Carradine. Yep, 67. I didn't realize he was such an old goat! And one look at him... well, let's just say Mr. Carradine has lived a hard life. Leathery and craggy, he's a Mount Rushmore of actors - and I don't mean in terms of professional stature. Carradine's quickly approaching his dad's prolific career (John Carradine appeared in around 500 movies). But he's found the role of a lifetime as Bill, and he commands every scene he's in. That velvety-smooth, world-weary voice disguises a malevolent scheming that lets you know he will persevere in the end. But does he? Doesn't the title belie that answer?<br/><br/>Michael Madsen is just okay in his role as Bill's brother Budd, but that's not an insult. He's just Michael Madsen, turning in a performance one expects from Michael Madsen (who could forget him as Mr. Blonde in Reservoir Dogs?).<br/><br/>Another of Tarantino's more admirable traits is that he's able to get compelling performances of a lifetime from his actors. Take Daryl Hannah. Could anyone really have predicted she would even be IN this movie? The mermaid from Splash? But as Elle Driver, Hannah's cold, sexy.... and blind in one eye. (How she lost that one eye is explained, rather vividly.)<br/><br/>Tarantino also loves to bring back moldy-oldie actors from Back in the Day, partly to revive their careers and partly as an homage to those older films he grew up with. This time around, he has Gordon Liu, who plays the mystical Pai Mei, who trained Bill's elite squad. We see some amazing scenes of The Bride being trained hard by Pai Mei, scenes that are of course reminiscent of all of the wise-master-training-young-hotshot kung-fu films (such as Jackie Chan's Drunken Master). We also see Bo Svenson as the reverend who's about to marry The Bride, and Michael Parks as old Bill friend Esteban Vihaio. Oh, and Sid Haig, whom I last saw in House of 1,000 Corpses, is barkeep at the nudie bar at which Budd's a bouncer.<br/><br/>Aside from the sometimes-turgid pacing, another problem is the soundtrack. There were several times throughout the movie when the music was substantially louder than the dialogue on the screen! Now, I ask you - does that make any sense? Tarantino's always been a stickler for having the right song for the right scene, but come on - if I can't hear his strong dialogue, what's the point?<br/><br/>I guess this film, in essence, didn't grab me as the first one did. I didn't leave the theater satisfied. I didn't leave with some of my favorite scenes still being played in my mind, over and over again. For me, the movie was flat and fell below expectations. It's still a well-done movie, but it's not up to Vol. 1's excellence."
"darkish","10","1","3","20 April 2004"," I Could Watch it Every Day!!
","Quentin Tarantino's stylish revenge fantasy has come into conclusion and what a great one it was; Vol.1 and Vol.2 combined make an epic masterpiece which is a feast to the eyes and ears and a joy to the soul, a true movie obsessed spaghetti western marshal arts flick orchestrated by a genre savvy movie lover.<br/><br/>And in the end it turned into an emotional touching story yet keeping it's revenge theme loud and clear, the characters are all loveable (Elle and Budd are my favorites) the soundtrack, Quentin's dialogues and Bill's monologues are quite awesome!<br/><br/> I strongly recommend it."
"thniels","8","1","3","23 April 2004"," Ginger Rogers with at sword
","First of all, this movie should never have been split in two. It can't be said in less words less a few adverbs and I readily subtract 1 point for molesting it so.<br/><br/>As for Uma Thurman she was nothing short of great but first and foremost she was believable. Not stunningly beautiful, nor out of this world gracious. Just plain real. And being that in a role like this is really something else. Not only must it require considerable talent, it also adds a depth to the character seemingly impossible considering the genre which is far from being realistic. As an odd aside, the genre best compared to is that of song-and-dance movies with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers not as one would imagine the tacky kung-fu movies of the seventies. I wonder if my grandma would like it? <br/><br/>Distinctly a Quentin Tarantino movie and a good one at that.<br/><br/><ul><li>Thomas Nielsen</li></ul>"
"ocarina619","10","1","3","22 April 2004"," Fantastic Cinema Once Again!
","After watching Volume One, i was convinced that the pending sequel would round Kill Bill off as a fantastic movie.  Where as Volume One focuses on the Eastern style of cinema, Volume Two is much more Western.<br/><br/>After the first viewing, I have to say I felt let down simply because of the stupid amount of hype this movie got.  However, I walked out at the end of the credits, walked straight back in and watched it again and thoroughly enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Volume Two is different enough from Volume One so that when you watch them collectively, you will get bits of everything in the dosage you require, rather than overdoing one particular style of fight for instance.<br/><br/>What struck me most about this second part was the style in which the confrontations were done in.  Where I was expecting massive amounts of sword fighting and blood, following the fight with O-Ren Ishii, I was given two completely different confrontations for Budd and Elle. This was good I felt, because it makes each member of the DIVAS more unique and makes the fights more unique.<br/><br/>However it is the final moments of the movie where you have the remaining pieces of the story revealed to you and in Bill's final moments, i found it incredibly touching and my entire outlook on the movie as a whole was turned on its head.<br/><br/>While some may argue that Kill Bill isn't as good as Pulp Fiction, it never can be because it is completely different.  Similarly Pulp can never top Kill Bill.  But as far as movies go, Kill Bill is one of the best you'll see."
"SulphurMan","Null","1","3","22 April 2004"," A Powerhouse. Plain and simple.
","When all is said and done, Kill Bill Vol. 2 is quite simply one of the best Tarantino films out there. You will be hard pressed to find a film that better fuses the mans love for all shades of cinema and yet retains his unique style. Vol. 1 was a great, entertaining slice of film but it really cant stack up to Vol. 2. Here we have all of the things that go into a solid Q.T. picture: Excellent and engaging dialogue, eye poppping (forgive the pun) fight scenes and colorful charecters. Vol. 2 works on every level and watching it felt more relaxed and enjoyable than the first one. I think the key to Vol. 2 is to just chill out and watch what is given. RELAX, sit back and recieve it all. Thats how a good Tarantino film should work and boy does this deliver."

","Although this film has some very entertaining parts such as the Pai Mei sequence and other bits and pieces throughout but I have to say the dialogue which is Tarantios specialty is very lacking here , instead of being hilarious conversations most of it consists of David Carradine going on long metaphorical monologues which were neither funny nor intresting and proceeded to bore the hell out of me . Now to all those who say the second is more tarantino like and fans of the old movies who didnt like volume 1 will enjoy it I say No way in hell like i said alot of the dialouge is very weak and is infact noway as witty or insightful conscerning backstory as his otherfilms and I gotta say I was very disappointed .

Anyway, throw away your expectations when going to see this movie. It is still Kill Bill but the whole different one.<br/><br/>If the first one was 80% action and 20% drama the second one is 80% drama and 20% action.

","This movie is not on par at all with the action of the first one, so if your in it for the gore and decapitated heads-- save yourself the money. However, if your interested in the actual feelings of the characters, this provides plenty more. Overall though, as a story on its own, I'd say this isn't anything remarkable, and I think if it is incredibly acclaimed it's because of Tarantino's acclaim. Ultimately though, if you buy both the DVDs, I think being able to watch polar ends of a movie from the absence of conscience to the desperation at motherhood-- it is a pleasant thing to watch. But once again, even in that way, I'd say this is a pretty good movie, just nothing awe-inspiring, like Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs. (Although some of the dialogue in this film was classic Quentin Tarantino, and only felt refreshing, not dulled.)"
"sm22281-1","10","1","3","17 April 2004"," Awesome unique story told in a fascinating East meets West vision
","Spoiler Alert! I agree with the comments already posted, about the first movie being more Asian Kung Fu and rampage action killing scenes, and the second movie giving more characterization and explaining the entire story.<br/><br/>This movie kept me riveted on my seat the whole time, whether an action fight scene broke out, or the characters just kept talking.  Each actor is fleshed out as an interesting, complex individual, including Budd, Elle, Pai-Mei, and most of all, Beatrix and Bill.<br/><br/>This is a very complex movie with many layers and elements and I am still digesting and processing the scenes.  What did I like?  What did I not like or not understand?  What do I remember as striking?<br/><br/>Well, there is an ongoing sense of razor-sharp, never yielding cold-steel purpose portrayed by Uma Thurman's heroine.  Not just the self-dialogue voice-over as she drives to meet her final targets.  The intense fury in her eyes as she is caught in a death trap and her violent struggles; the endurance she demonstrates as she undergoes the tough physical training (think of Demi Moore as a soldier, it's even more intense) and most importantly, her mental acknowledgment of the superior master; her focused calm while she tries to get out of the death trap; in her exhausted state, her drive to hike back many miles in the desert to find the killer (Madsen). This is a woman who will never ever give up.  I like this determination as portrayed in the movie.  That's guts! One striking scene is the heroine striding across the street to the diner, dirt flying off her in the dim lighting, and her superhuman determination to keep herself together and to keep going.<br/><br/>The mental submission and acknowledgment of the grand master is a key to Asian Kung Fu movies.  Beatrix's mental toughness and ability to endure any impossibly tough circumstances gave her the edge in every life and death situations she meets.  Beatrix's submission and respect of the grand old master is what gives her the edge over the other assassin, Elle.  Elle lost her temper and lost first one eye, now the second.  And finally, Beatrix is the only student of Pai-Mei's who earns his respect and learns the famous death punch.  So, the serious determined good student wins at the end.  I kind of like that ending.  If you will recall, the central theme in Hidden Tiger Crouching Dragon was the female warrior girl who could not accept anyone being her master and ended wreaking havoc on everyone's life.<br/><br/>However, I found several scenes a little confusing.  For example, how come the gun shot from Budd took her out in one volley, stunned her, but there was no visible gun shot wounds or after effects?  How is that possible? Also, the shirt and jacket she was wearing showed no wounds in the back, so I was very confused about her ability to bounce back from that incident. Even with her kind of determination, how did she overcome serious bleeding wounds?   If she was such a good assassin, why was it so easy for a man with a gun to take her out in one shot?   The other scene in the hotel room where the Asian female assassin tries to shoot her shows that Beatrix is very fast and not that easy to kill.  So I find it difficult to understand how she gets toppled over in one try by Budd.  That was an anticlimax for me.<br/><br/>Why does Budd turn into a ""modern"" loser, when he seems to have the same assassin skills as Bill?  Budd says that he deserves to die for participating in Beatrix's execution, yet he has no wish to let that happen and he takes care to execute Beatrix again, in revenge for breaking his brother's heart.  Why does Budd keep the samurai sword inscribed with Bill's loving caption but tells his brother that it was pawned off?  He seems very ambivalent about his life and his relationship with Bill.  Clearly a complex kind of man.<br/><br/>Why is the scene at the Two Pines Chapel shot in black and white?  Apart from the fact that it's a different technical style and look.  I was wondering if it was meant to cast that entire episode of Beatrix's life as a scene that is almost surreal, or unreal in her mind, not part of the existing colorful intensity of her current life.<br/><br/>At the end, when Beatrix tries to reach the sword and gets a couple of warning shots from Bill, it seems incongruous that Beatrix, a well-trained assassin, is not be able to get at a weapon on the first try.  It seems that anyone with a gun can easily gain the upper hand on the sword and knife style of killing.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Beatrix demonstrates that at close range and in a tight spot, she does not need weapons, she has awesome powers with her FINGERS! alone.  So the old school fist fighting skills still triumph over the gun shooting style, that's the secret power.<br/><br/>What does the scene in the classroom flashing Beatrix Kiddo as a school pupil mean?  The only thing I got is that her last name is Kiddo, it is not an affectionate nickname from Bill as we might have thought earlier.<br/><br/>I had a little trouble understanding every single word said by David Carradine so I will have to see the movie again.  His acting is very compelling in this movie, the best I have ever seen.  He comes across as courteous and guarded, then relaxed and playful, then intellectual and tender, that's awesome.  Yes, the scene between the two of them is very powerful.  The death scene is very different from most final scenes in a revenge story.  There is a feeling of deep respect (of each other's killing skills) and love between the two antagonists, almost like in a Samurai fight.  When he realizes he is dying, she touches him with a final gentle pat.  He gets up and meets his death in a gentlemanly, courtly manner, with great courage, very ""old school"" as his character says.<br/><br/>As a woman, I had difficulty understanding why Beatrix felt she had to kill Bill at the very end.  Yes, Bill executed her and her friends in a fit of passionate hatred at the beginning of the story  But Bill also kept the baby alive and raised her tenderly. So could this act of love be his redemption, and could the heroine forgive him, and why not let them live happily ever after?  Then I realized that his parenting style was very strange, he discussed the child's stomping of the goldfish like some of us exclaim in delight at a child mastering the ABC's and he lets the child watch assassination movies at bedtime.  That's why Beatrix rejected him and his lifestyle, she could not allow him to live, it had become a choice of zero sum game, a life and death choice between his twisted lifestyle and the innocent child.  It reminds me of the Samurai execution in Tom Cruise's 2003 movie, where the winner Samurai watches the loser and helps him die, but with deep respect, dignity and love.<br/><br/>The scene with the Mexican octogenarian was very interesting.  At first, it was not too clear why there was such a consummate conversation going on when the director might have used a voice over saying that Beatrix obtained Bill's address by looking up an old acquaintance.  I had to think about this scene for a while to ponder the significance.  The meaning is this is Bill's background, his childhood parent figure and this explains the kind of person he is.  A murderer, a man who uses other women and men for his business income, a man who is used to lording it over women and who will not take no (rejection) as an answer and will abuse, maim and kill at the drop of a hat. See the shot of the serving woman with the grotesquely split lip, that's what happens to those who do not comply in that world Bill knows best.<br/><br/>Anyway, what are the hallmarks of a good movie, in my mind? that it should be technically excellent, visually compelling, and the story  should not only entertain but also  give me plenty to think about after the movie ends, and this is one of very few movies that meet my standard."
"darrell-garrison","Null","1","3","18 April 2004"," Stylistic but anti-climactic
","(5 out of 10)  I really enjoyed Vol. 1, and was looking forward to Vol. 2, figuring it couldn't miss.  It did...<br/><br/>Tarantino once said he likes to make three movies at once.  He's certainly done that with Kill Bill(s), but he could have done so with a single two and-a-half hour movie.  He could have combined his spaghetti western/chopsockey/blood-spattered Revenge of the Bride, and STILL gotten in all the style and different pacing.  Remember the scene with Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper in his home in 'True Romance'?  That movie slowed down for great dialogue in a great scene, then got going again.  And in Kill Bill Vol. 1, it was very much slow/fast/slow/fast, which was fine.  But in Vol. 2 it's slow down, slow some more, and in the climax, go extra slow (especially as compared to Vol. 1).<br/><br/>Kudos to Tarantino for getting his vanity project done in such a unique way, and for his overall flair and style.  There are some great scenes and great directing!  There is great cinematography and choice of music.  He has put his childhood memories on the big screen as seen through a kaleidoscope (pot-haze induced?).<br/><br/>Uma Thurman is outstanding!! David Carradine was surprisingly good! Unfortunately, Tarantino obviously loves Carradine TOO much.  He has so much camera time talking away and trying to look cool that it becomes annoying.<br/><br/>
I was really bugged by multiple continuation problems (blood appearing/disappearing, etc.).<br/><br/>The biggest blow to the film is its climax.  After almost 5 hours of movies, the final showdown was truly disappointing!!!  I wasn't alone.  The fairly full theater didn't seem satisfied as they left.<br/><br/>Tarantino apparently does as he pleases, but in this case, with no one reining him in, he has made a frustrating film instead of the near-classic it could have been."
"MovieAddict2016","7","2","10","25 April 2004"," One of Tarantino's lesser efforts; a notch down from the first KILL BILL; still very good...
","The opening credits of Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" roar across the screen with a vengeance, indicating a second installment that may very well be superior in many ways to that of its first. For about the first forty minutes or so, this theory seemed to hold steadfast, but as the clock kept ticking and the dialogue kept on rambling I found myself just a bit under whelmed by a film that, although a fine motion picture, is entirely different from its predecessor -- and not necessarily in a very good way.<br/><br/>I estimated that about forty rather unnecessary minutes could (and should) have been cut by the editor. There's the totally nonessential twenty minutes spent introducing us to Budd (Michael Madsen), a hit man who works for Bill (David Carradine), who in turn is being targeted by hate-filled Bride (Uma Thurman). The flaw of this setup is that it is superfluous and unneeded -- Budd is presented to the audience as a loser, working at a deserted strip joint in Texas, fired from his job and living the life of a bum.<br/><br/>Perhaps Quentin should have saved these scenes for the supposed director's cut of the films being released to DVD some time this year (or next). They don't exactly click with the entirety of his movie -- they simply slow it down. It is as if Quentin is paying his respects to ""The Matrix Reloaded"" with way far too much empty dialogue. It was great in ""Pulp Fiction"" because it *wasn't* empty, but here it is, to be frank, rather meaningless. One of many things I loved about the first film was its supremely fast pace with non-stop action -- but in a good way. It was a no-holds-barred revenge story with references ranging from Hideo Gasha to Sergio Leone to Brian DePalma in many literal ways. The first installment was very campy and just good ol' fun -- Quentin best described it as doing for '70s grind house cinema what ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" did for the serials of the '30s and '40s. The second installment is just plain different -- not much of an homage, all of the gratuitous style is gone. Also gone is much of the enthusiasm -- hard to explain in a review but very apparent to the viewers.<br/><br/>I also didn't appreciate the ending very much. Throughout the first installment of the series (now rumored to be a trilogy, completed in fifteen years) the goals of The Bride were most important -- nothing stood in her way. From start to finish it was a brutal, stylish ride designed for the movie buff within us all. We didn't feel the need to sympathize with her because she was not a particularly sympathetic character. Many people complained about this. It seems that Quentin has heard their cries -- the audiences who complained about lack of character progression and Tarantinoesque dialogue need not worry -- ""Volume 2"" has plenty of it. And in my own opinion far too much.<br/><br/>""Volume 2"" has too many long gaps that break the non-stop action -- perhaps to compensate for lack of actual storyline. It's a revenge movie. No need for long scenes with metaphorical speeches. When The Bride finally comes face-to-face with her final foe, Quentin puts the story on hold, completely throwing off the audience in a very negative way. Bill's dialogue to The Bride about superhero comic books was embarrassingly Tarantino -- he hinted at his love for comic books in the screenplay for ""True Romance,"" and here it seems oddly out of place.<br/><br/>As a whole, ""Kill Bill Volume 2"" is very good. As a sequel to one of the best films of 2003, it is a rather lackluster affair, very different from the original but mostly in rather unfortunate ways. As a whole its predecessor is far superior -- I left ""Volume 2"" feeling a bit under whelmed and disappointed. Had Tarantino chosen to delete forty minutes of unnecessary balderdash and kept up the style and pace and brutality of the first film, I feel as though I might have left feeling very pleased. Instead I left telling myself that it was, at the very least, a good conclusion to the story -- which may still be open for yet another installment in fifteen years, according to Tarantino, who wants to make it his ""Dollars"" trilogy. And so we wait...<br/><br/>4/5."
"bgar-80932","6","1","4","21 December 2018"," Better than the first
","The first Kill Bill was kinda non-sense KungFu crazy action. It had some cool ways to film it but I'm not a big Kung Fu fan so I didn't love it. This one focused a bit more on dialogue than the fighting and I enjoyed that more. The dialogue to me still wasn't near as good as the majority of Tarantino films so I still didn't love it but this was for sure better. This one had some cool interesting ways to film as well though and had some really cool scenes. It wrapped it up nicely and now I feel no need to ever watch these again."
"Leofwine_draca","6","1","4","10 August 2016"," Plenty of cult material, although it's not quite as memorable as the first
","Tarantino's hit sequel sees him taking the KILL BILL mythos in new and unexpected directions, with a non-linear plot that keeps you guessing all the while, elements of romance that are entirely unexpected, and a whole range of genres mixed together into one mildly satisfying and well-gelled whole. The film seems full of suspense, but the focus is on character here rather than action, as in the last movie, and it's a trick that works well; a simple repeat of the gory chaos seen in KILL BILL VOL. 1 may have been entertaining, but it would have been old ground, whereas this volume offers a different experience than before. Thurman has settled into her character now and her strong role model provides a pivot around which the rest of the story flows; stealing all of his scenes is David Carradine as the charismatic, strangely likable arch-villain Bill. Support comes from an excellent Michael Madsen (the best performance I've seen him give yet) and Daryl Hannah as an extremely dangerous assassin.<br/><br/>Although this film only contains three death scenes, it is very violent and gruesome. People are bitten by poisonous snakes and die graphically; eyeballs are popped from their sockets and the swordplay doesn't let up. There are many old exploitation/kung fu actors here, as well as Carradine; Bo Svenson pops up as a preacher, whilst the reliable Sid Haig has a cameo as a barman. Gordon Liu turns up again after his appearance as one of the Crazy 88 in the first movie, this time as kung fu stereotype Pai Mei, the old grumpy mentor who shows Thurman the ropes in some hilariously over-the-top training sequences. Others also appear, like a shadowy Samuel Jackson, making this a pleasing ""spot the actor"" viewing experience. For cult film fans, there's a whole slew of references, with nods at everything from spaghetti westerns to martial arts flicks, including loads of music tracks taken from some classics and some not-so-classics (including a great score from an Italian '70s polizia flick). At the end of the day, this is a film that offers up a pretty much well-rounded experience, offering all the violence, tension, and coolness that you've come to expect from a Tarantino flick, plus a whole lot more besides."

Bill is boring as hell and he just can't shut up, talks nonsense through the whole movie. There is no single interesting character, the teacher of Uma Thurman was not funny at all and also was boring. I think everything would be great if it was only Kill Bill 1, even though Bill is not shown, audience can imagine their whole life what happened, and not see this awful movie.

I mean The action movies are about the soundtrack but in this soundtrack captures the moment and emotions perfectly. The lead character's past is shown in this part and thus it appeals more and clearly shows how she evolved in the process. Even her relationships are shown, the face off between the assassins and the lead character are just awesome and the final end scene and the end are marvelous. The end conversation between Bill and Black Mamba answers all your doubts and closes all the loose ends."

","From the beginning, this sequel (Maybe) has impossible odds of surpassing such an impressive first movie, and overall wrapping up the story of The Bride's quest. Whereas not as good as the first one, ""Kill Bill Volume: 2"" has enough shining moments to keep the story going, and also reveals the characters origins thanks to that non-chronological story telling.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman is still as deadly as ever. Her quest continues as she goes after Bill's brother Budd (Michael Madsen), who remains in contact with other ""Deadly Viper Squad"" member Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah). All of which culminates with ""The Bride"" finding Bill, and a surprise revelation.<br/><br/>Martial Arts master Pai Mei, played by Gordon Liu is probably the best new character introduced in ""Volume. 2"". Both his & The Bride's scenes together are the movies highlight. Other than that, it's without doubt that this movie contains more dialogue heavy scenes than action. It becomes clear that when the production was coming together, Tarantino put all his best material into ""Volume: 1"". Saying that, there's nothing seriously wrong with ""Volume: 2"", and there are a few deleted scenes I wish made it into the final cut. All in all, it wraps the story up well and compliments the first movie more than most sequels do.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Another gem by Tarantino. 7.5/10. I hear of ""Volume. 3"", and I hope it never happens."
"dartslinger2","7","1","4","10 April 2013"," Slower than Vol. 1
","The sequel to Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is not nearly as good as the first. The first was excellent: it was quite poignant, it was exciting, fast paced, intriguing, and it had one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard.<br/><br/>The second was not so good in these areas. I didn't find it to be touching at all, as the first was. This one was exciting at times, but it was definitely a slower-moving film than the first one was. Not that being slower-moving than the first is necessarily a bad thing, but this one seemed to have excessive dialogue.<br/><br/>Another area where Vol. 2 fell short is the soundtrack: I found many of the pieces to be unhelpful in setting the tone of certain parts of the movie. The music, instead of drawing you into the moment, drew excessive attention to itself.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol. 1 was extremely gory, but chopped off heads and arms didn't really gross me out—at least not as much as the eyeball being squished between someone's toes, and the vitreous humor oozing out that appeared in Vol. 2. Overall though, Kill Bill Vol. 2 wasn't nearly as violent as Vol. 1 was. The entire tone was much sleazier though, especially the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol. 2 was a competent movie, but it was not the masterpiece that Kill Bill Vol. 1 was."
"illbebackreviews","9","1","4","15 November 2012"," A brilliantly paced film
","I'm probably one of the last people on Earth to watch Kill Bill and I'm truly glad I did watch the duology. 'Kill Bill Vol 1' was a brilliantly made Tarantino film and the ending of the first one set me up to watch the second one. From the first few minutes, I was already into this movie. I love how the Bride recounts the events and we see how the massacre happened at the wedding. <br/><br/>Then we get to cut back to present time and we meet Bill's brother. Bill's brother is another fine character and they are thoroughly enjoyable. We also see that the Bride has come to kill Bill's brother but she fails and is mortally wounded. She is then locked up and things start getting intense. After being locked up in a coffin and buried, the Bride recounts how she was trained in martial arts by a teacher named Pai Mei. The entire training sequence was well made out and a perfectly necessary addition to the film. <br/><br/>Then the story really begins to get intense. Budd, Bill's brother, calls Elle over about the Hanzo sword and she kills him. Then the Bride comes in and a duel ensues. The fight scenes are so well planned out and filmed with brilliant acting that its both realistic and enjoyable. <br/><br/>Then the Bride goes to some place and asks for Bill's location and the man eventually gives it away believing that Bill will be pleased to meet her. <br/><br/>What I like about the last half hour of the film (that is from when the Bride goes to Bill's house) is the further build-up to the ultimate showdown. Things really begin to get dense and you can feel all her hatred for him and all his malice. The ending is so brilliantly done.<br/><br/>There are many positives about this film. The acting, especially by Uma Thurman is brilliant. She gives such a powerful role as the bride. The plot, the new characters and pretty much everything is so well executed. <br/><br/>This is one of my four favorites of 2003: <br/><br/>1) Return of the King 2) Pirates of the Caribbean 3) Kill Bill Vol 2 4) Finding Nemo<br/><br/>Such a brilliant film!"

The action was good, or at least the only action scene, which was when Kiddo was fighting with Elle Driver and ripped here eye out... OK... The dialogs and the witty script just screamed out Quentin Tarantino, and it's just pure enjoyment watching the films of the perhaps coolest dude on earth. The cast was great too. I mean what can go possibly wrong when you have Uma Thurman, Darryl Hannah, Lucy Lieu, David Carradine, Vivica A. Fox and Michael Madsen? The only sort of bad thing was seeing Madsen 15 years later than Reservoir ¨Dogs, because there he was mysterious, cool, well a killer, and oh, yes.. hot! He's become an old and fat fart! Yeah, it has been 15 years... But still, some people age good and some bad. But he should really start taking care of himself... The special-effects were awesome and I totally enjoyed watching them. <br/><br/>I recommend this film to all the Tarantino lovers out there (although I doubt that if you really love him you've already seen this film) but don't expect anything from Madsen.

"poolandrews","6","1","4","2 July 2007"," Not as good as Vol. 1...
","Kill Bill: Vol. 2 starts as vengeful assassin Beatrix Kiddo (Uma Thurman) head towards El Passo & Bill's brother Budd (Michael Madsen) to continue her roaring rampage of revenge. Things don't go her way though & she ends up buried alive, can she escape & finally get her long awaited revenge on her ex-boss Bill (David Carradine) who left her & her baby for dead?<br/><br/>Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino I'll say it straight away, Kill Bill: Vol. 2 is nowhere near as good as Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) in my opinion. There, I said it & I firmly believe it to be the truth. In Kill Bill: Vol. 1 there was a definite energy, a zip, a breakneck pace that lead from one over-the-top set-piece to another. It had buckets of violence & blood while still maintaining that cool Tarantino vibe that was present in both Reservoir Dogs (1992) & Pulp Fiction (1994) which made them both iconic hits of the 90's. Here in Kill Bill: Vol. 2 the pace is sedate, the self consciously cool small talk dialogue just isn't as effective here with noting particularly exciting happening around it. Kill Bill: Vol. 2 just ends up feeling like a hollow mess with lots of irreverent dialogue which tries to be cool, I'm sorry but for me it didn't work & I frankly missed the violence, the gore & the character's of Kill Bill: Vol. 1 which I think I'm going to watch again to get the memory of Kill Bill: Vol. 2 out of my mind. There are still some nice scenes here & some mildly amusing dialogue along the way but as a whole I don't think it has what made Kill Bill: Vol. 1 so special, above average but below the standard I expected & hoped for.<br/><br/>Director Tarantino knows how to turn in a stylish action flick, it's just a shame the action doesn't really start until an hour in. Since Tarantino is a bit of a fan-boy when it comes to martial arts & cult flicks in general there are loads of references to other films which you may or may no notice although I thought it was nice that the film mentions Shogun Assassin (1980) by name as the similarities are obvious & for those of you who don't know Shogun Assassin is a real film & it's an absolutely terrific film at that. Rumour has it Tarantino has a thing for feet & you can tell here because there are a lot of scenes involving people's feet including another scene of Thurman stepping on & crushing someones plucked out eyeball, foot fetishists will enjoy this. I didn't think all of the visual tricks worked in this & preferred the comic book feel of the original. The violence here is much tamer than Kill Bill: Vol. 1, Vol 1 had over forty on screen death's while Vol. 2 has a paltry three of which Thurman only kills one, Elle (Daryl Hannah) kills Budd & Pai Mei (Chia Hui Liu) with Thurman killing Bill at the end. I know violence & action don't necessarily make a great film they sure as hell help!<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 Kill Bill: Vol. 2 is very well made with top notch production values, it definitely has that expensive Hollywood look to it, excellent cinematography & choreography. The acting is pretty good, Thurman makes for a sexy anti-hero & Carradine is a cool bad guy. Samuel L. Jackson gets about 30 seconds of screen time.<br/><br/>Kill Bill: Vol. 2 is a definite disappointment after the excellent violent & bloody excess of Kill Bill: Vol. 1, at over two hours it's too long & is a drawn out way to round the story off. Did this really get a 5 minute standing ovation from the audience it was premiered too? If it did why? If you have seen both Kill Bill films & want to watch one again watch the original."
"quicksilver-14","3","1","4","2 July 2007"," Totally overrated, empty and mediocre comic strip
","The amount of praise this movie gets is truly astonishing. I've seldomly seen such a boring movie, so completely empty of content. It's slow, it's practically mute, it relies heavily on music, it's nothing but a series of childish ideas, a comic strip, like the Coen movies, but they at least know how handle the genre. I think Tarantino understands the basic meaning of cinema (the burial scene proves that, with a totally dark screen and the slowly fading sound of earth falling on the coffin, a great scene). But Tarantino turns out to be rather superficial, as is proved by everything else and particularly by the total void of depth in either the story or the characters. So sorry, Quentin, maybe you should associate yourself with a good writer, somebody a little bit more mature...."

He was good here as a laidback, failing character.<br/><br/>To me the actress playing Kiddo is a tall skinny girl with a less than beautiful face. But she does her part well.<br/><br/>The only jarring note in the acting would be Samuel Jackson's overdone, campy attempt at acting in a bit part.<br/><br/>Am I wrong or is the movie about men ""disciplining"" their women?<br/><br/>1---Bill shoots Kiddo in the head because she dumped him.<br/><br/>2---Esteban says he doesn't agree with that and says Bill should have ""cut her face."" Then he calls over a girl of his with a face disfigured in such a way so Kiddo can see her.<br/><br/>3---The martial arts master (almost all the posters here are so clueless when it comes to martial arts they don't know there is much to be learned from those scenes) runs a non-stop disciplining of Kiddo.<br/><br/>There are two somewhat lengthy scenes involving food prepartion:<br/><br/>1--Bud prepares the drinks for himself and Elle.<br/><br/>2--Bill prepares the sandwich."
"dbdumonteil","9","1","4","12 August 2006"," the adventures of the Bride, round 2
","Here comes the Bride again in what was one of the most-anticipated films of 2004 which like its elder brother ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" (2003) generated much hype. So far, she killed two important enemies (and many more into the bargain) and so erased two names on her list. There are still three left including Bill who will come last.<br/><br/>Through its title, ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" is both a sequel and a non-sequel. The Bride perseveres in her vengeful adventure still related in a chronological disorder but in some chapters or telling flashbacks, Quentin Tarantino reveals us some facts of her past life, notably how she became an expert at martial arts and so how she acquired her knowledge in this domain. Otherwise, this second installment is here to illustrate the famous sentence: ""revenge is a dish best served cold"". And like its elder brother ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" (2003), it's still painstakingly shot. The composition of every sequence, the way they interlock even the position of the characters. Everything is precise, set in a pedantic manner and filled with neat visual or scenarist ideas. About this, I would like to mention the first sequence, the key one which is the origin of the Bride's bloody, vengeful adventure. It's of course, the famous massacre scene in the church isolated in the desert. Tarantino favored off-camera so we will see almost nothing of it but the sounds of the massacre. Another scene is the fight between Uma Thurman and Daryl Hannah. Tarantino pulls it off with gusto to insert a violent fight in a cramped place which is a trailer. Then like in the great tradition of the film in which two antagonist protagonists confront each other, the filmmaker delays the final, decisive meeting between them until the end and when this moment will arrive, it won't be what the audience will expect in its construction and its evolution.<br/><br/>Like in its elder companion, the Bride perseveres in her desire of revenge and its fulfillment and as for Tarantino, he continues in his quest to pay homage to essentially the samurai film and the spaghetti western. Thus, ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" is filled with cinema-going details, borrowings or influences, here mainly linked to the second cinematographic genre. John Ford and Sergio Leone's worlds are quoted and in another extent, I wonder whether the scene when Budd buries alive the Bride in the ground wasn't influenced by George Sluizier's chilling ""Spoorloos"" (1988).<br/><br/>But ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" differs from its elder brother on numerous points. About the influences, if the samurai film was essentially to the fore in the first installment, the second one favors the spaghetti western, would it be only by the scenery and the barren landscapes. And as many users pointed out before, violent fights were the most momentous scenes in ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"", at least the scenes which were the most vivid to the audience. These scenes take a back seat in ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" in spite of the admirable fight sequence I mentioned above. An increasing psychological tension in the confrontations between the characters reigns during a good part of the movie. Besides, the first sequence which partly showcases a long conversation between the Bride and her worst enemy Bill sets the scene for this chosen perspective. So, action and stunts are relegated to a position of secondary importance to leave the place to long, chatty sequences but Tarantino could have deleted Bill's superfluous words about Superman. Be that as it may, it was maybe the best choice from Tarantino because these long conversations have several functions: to act as a counterbalance to the choreographed action scenes, to unveil the characters' motivations and for the Bride, eloquent bribes of her past.<br/><br/>This assumed side from Tarantino to put the accent on the dialogs (very good in most of them) enables to appreciate the performances of the whole cast and this, perhaps more than in the debut opus. Minor characters aren't forgotten and I would grant a distinction to Michael Madsen as Budd, perhaps the best of the batch. The pinnacle of his acting has to be found in the scene when he's about to bury alive the Bride, he just has to say simple but formidable words to tame her.<br/><br/>I repeat it: I'm not really a Tarantino devotee but I have a warm spot on these two ""Kill Bill"" movies and I would trade ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) for this duo of films. Various influences from diverse horizons were melded to give two well-rounded flicks which in spite of their different contents complete themselves. Was it wise from Tarantino to release it on two volumes? I think so because if the two films had been bridged end to end, it would have given a spotty, irregular film. So, it was perhaps necessary to divide two distinct parts."
"Det_McNulty","8","1","4","9 July 2006"," It Could Have Been Great If It Had More Substance
","I'm a big Quentin Tarantino and seeing all of his films this would have to be my least favourite. Kill Bill: Volume 2 still manages to create a good ending to the self titled ""Roaring Rampage Of Revenge"". Like the first film it lacks the substance needed to gain a higher score, yes the movie is stylish, but the phrase ""Style over substance"" comes to mind. Unlike the first film which was a blood-thirsty satire, the sequel is surprisingly nothing like the first film. It does not contain the same kind of fight scenes as the first film and tends to reply more on the acting and visual flare Much of the movie is stolen, it's supposed to be a tribute. <br/><br/>But things such Ennio Morricone's score are stolen as well as some notable others. Unlike other Quentin Tarantino where he wonderfully references cinema this feels more stolen. A lot of the film felt very silly and un-satisfying for example some of the deaths are short which is disappointing seeing as Quentin Tarantino has managed to create really crazy death scenes in his previous masterpieces.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman once again steals the show and plays along side great actors like Michael Madsen. Now I'm normally a great fan of Michael Madsen, but this was a different matter. His performance felt clumsy and lacked depth/creativity to his previous past roles. A prime example would be none other than his performance as Mr. Blonde which for me goes down in my own personal favourite movie characters. His performance in Kill Bill: Volume 2 was a different matter. I felt a little unsatisfied after Kill Bill: Volume 2 after being entertained by Volume 1. <br/><br/>My favourite scene was probably when Uma Thurman (The Bride) finally met up with Bill and learnt the truth, it was very interesting. I also loved the scene re capturing what happened at the wedding rehearsal it felt very lonely and tranquil with the black and white photography.<br/><br/>One thing I did find impressive was the direction, it was very precise and held a lot of detail to the scenery and atmosphere that was in the movie. The movie mixes Spaghetti Western and Samurai Action to create something that is slightly operatic. The movies pace is very different to other films and holds few surprises. <br/><br/>People call the movie ""emotional"", I would definitely not say that, I found it more dramatic because it was so over the top. The movie still managed to be a lot deeper than the previous instalment, but still did not live up to Volume 1."

"Barky44","7","1","4","9 December 2005"," Not as good as the first
","While I thought Kill Bill Vol. 1 was a tremendously entertaining film, I was less than enthusiastic about Vol. 2.<br/><br/>Problem #1 was the casting and performance of Darryl Hannah as the second-ranking assassin under Bill. I just didn't find her particularly interesting or menacing. True, she was dispatched with aplomb, but it wasn't that enjoyable. Perhaps it was her set-up: in the first film the final ""baddie"" was a leader of the Japanese Mafia, someone who not only had to be tracked but who had a cadre of obstacles protecting her. This built up great tension and excitement and made the payoff fight more interesting. Darryl Hannah's character didn't have that big build-up, there wasn't much of a reason for her to be menacing at all.<br/><br/>Problem #2 was the unsatisfying way the final confrontation with Bill was portrayed. To me, it was a let down. Sure, how he finally meets the Bride is a bit surprising, but again, there was very little menace in that confrontation. Tarantino makes a great choice virtually eliminating the violence by that last encounter (by then you tire of it and want something different), but his attempt at bad-guy ""mind games"" falls way flat, becomes uninteresting, and lets the viewer down.<br/><br/>Sure, there's some good stuff in this film, the best being The Bride's training under the ancient Kung Fu master. But overall, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is more entertaining.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 Barky"
"xjuggernaughtx","5","1","4","7 September 2005"," Well, it's better than Kill Bill, Vol. 1...
","But it still doesn't reach it's lofty potential.<br/><br/>Now let's get one thing straight. This is a much, much better film than Kill Bill, Vol. 1. There is interesting character development and some twists and turns, plot-wise. Everything with Michael Madsen is great. Thurman's training flashback is well done.<br/><br/>However, it still doesn't overcome the fact that Tarantino didn't make me care about Kiddo in the first film and, by the end, I still don't care. The confrontation with Bill is absolutely the worst part of this film, especially with as much dialogue as they have. Dialogue has always been Tarantino's hallmark and it just generally falls flat here. It's not actively bad, just pedestrian. The superhero analogy is the one shining moment at the end of the film.<br/><br/>The film throws a plot curveball about two-thirds of the way through, but, strangely enough, it's not really a curve ball at all. The plot would have been resolved with or without it, so it really doesn't make any difference and eats up a lot of screen time.<br/><br/>Now I'm of the camp that if Tarantino had just edited these films together, this probably would have been a much better movie. There are good parts of both, but I feel that as two separate entities, they largely fail. Together, they could have shored up each others weaknesses. The first Kill Bill is largely plot less, with bad action and bad dialogue. The second is often times boring. Together they could have been an average movie, instead of two bad ones.<br/><br/>Once again, I would suggest seeing this, just because it is in our culture and it helps in social discussion to be able to talk about it, but don't expect a masterpiece. It's light on originality and heavy on cliché. Not quite as dependent as the first film, but there is not much inspired here in the script. A visual and technical feast, but a midnight snack as a creative film."
"newnoir","Null","1","4","19 May 2005"," Sinematic Sequel
","Yes, Sinema, movies that are too much fun to not be a bit of a sin to watch.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a worthy follow up to Kill Bill Vol. 1. But it's a bit of a letdown from the sheer perfection of 1.<br/><br/>It's a bit slow, talky, and without a doubt needed an action climax worthy of the final action sequence of 1.<br/><br/>But, that aside, it's still a fine film. With an Oscar worthy performance by David Carradine. I'm reminded of Burt Reynolds comeback flick Boogie Nights. Neither won the Oscar that year and it was a crime. Burt should have played the part of the coked out titty bar owner. He seemed like an ideal fit for it.<br/><br/>And Carradine is one of the coolest cats in Sinematic history with this performance. He has one line that sums him up in the flick, ""I'm the Man."" And he is.<br/><br/>The film cries out for one last epic action sequence with perhaps The Bride taking on a ton of Bill's henchmen and then Bill himself. Another thing that vexed me is that Carradine got into the best shape of his life for this film and he is almost NO action sequences in the film! None! Now who wouldn't want to see Bill kicking some serious ass in this? A flawed, but still awe inspiring, blood drenched, sin filled and sinematic sequel!"
"basrutten","6","1","4","28 December 2004"," A two-hour plus episode of ""Kung Fu""
","Seriously, I don't get why the ""Kill Bill"" movies are held in such high regard. I loved the first three Tarantino movies and thought ""Kill Bill Vol 1"" was OK. ""Volume 2"", however, is one of the biggest disappointments I've ever seen recently.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill 2"" continues the (paper-thin) plot of the first movie, but otherwise it's almost completely different. There is almost no action, much less eye candy (part 1 was ""style over substance"", while this one has neither substance NOR style), and a lot more talking. Normally, you'd say that a Tarantino movie with tons of dialog would be a good thing, right? In this case, however, I found the dialogs to be fairly boring. There are still a couple of amusing parts, but for the most part it's random chit-chat between rather dull characters you don't care about and don't relate to.<br/><br/>For all it's differences, there's also something that both Kill Bill movies have in common: they're both way too long. In part one, the violence got boring long before the end, and in this movie all the talking becomes boring even faster. Face it, a very simple and predictable revenge story just isn't enough to fill four hours of movie, but Tarantino over-indulges himself in way too many things that he thinks are cool or clever, whereas mostly they're just lame or silly. <br/><br/>I have to admit that Kill Bill 2 does a couple of things right, though. The flashback about the martial arts training by an ancient Chinese master is entertaining, and the fight between The Bride and Elle Driver is marvelous. I also think that David Carradine does a wonderful job of playing Bill. But those are only a couple of bright spots in a sea of dull dialog and unnecessary scenes.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Kill Bill Vol 2"" is a two-hour plus episode of the old TV series ""Kung Fu"": it's about martial arts, there are flashbacks, and there's a lot of talking and very little action. If you're into old Kung Fu movies, chances are that you'll still love this one. But for those who actually prefer an interesting story and characters over a lot of supposedly cool fluff, ""Kill Bill Vol 2"" is best described as ""fairly boring"".<br/><br/>**1/2 out of ***** stars"
"bowmanmike","2","1","4","24 December 2004"," not as good as the first
","The story was excellent, Quenton Tarantino the god of modern cinema, Kill Bill vol.1 excellent. So naturally kill Bill vol.2 should be as good if not better, but sadly its not. I got very excited at the prospect of seeing this film especially with the trailers and the tag line: two down three to go. To me however, although at first it was all meant to be one film, Mr Tarantino seemed to rush this movie. some of the fight scenes where lacking and looked sloppy and the simple story and plot took a nose dive into the ridiculous. I found myself regretting seeing this movie and wishing i had let the sequel stay in my imagination. This is the only film in my eyes of Quentin Tarantino's that is bad to watch. this film is a mere shadow of what he can do."
"jfarmer-2","Null","1","4","2 December 2004"," Please Kill Me, Volume 2
","Jesus Mr. Tarantino, vol. 1 was so good. You brought out the best acting in Uma Thurman that I've ever seen, Pulp Fiction included. I didn't know she had the ruthlessness in her, the determinism, everything the role of Beatrix required. Even the nurturing side. The character of 'The Bride' you and Uma created she played perfectly. And what's more, when she was trying to get herself to 'wiggle your big toe' in the car, she looked so ugly I actually could believe she had been in a coma for four years. And then in the wedding chapel, she looked beautiful. And in the fighting sequences--my God I had no idea she (as Oren puts it later a 'Caucasian girl with a samurai sword') could actually look good doing kung fu. A truly resourceful actress.<br/><br/>The soundtrack deserves honourable mention. Isaac Hayes, Al Hirt, Bernard Herrmann and Nancy Sinatra are definitely gigantic shoulders for your movie to stand on. Good for you. <br/><br/>Oren Ishii's animation sequence was the best part of the film. More specifically, the way it tied in perfectly with the live action scenes made your use of Anime absolutely excellent, timely, even (and I'm shocked to say it) tasteful. And the length to which you developed her character was such that even the horrid actress Lucy Liu with that squeaky little voice of hers seemed intriguing playing her role. The fight sequence in the winter garden at the Blue Lotus was the most stunning scene, particularly the grace Liu achieves in the kimono and when taking off her sandals in the snow. Gorgeous cinematography there.<br/><br/>Before I go on, I must say that the only reason I'm critiquing your film is because I KNOW you could have done better. Way better. You're an excellent screenwriter and director, and you really built up our hopes with volume one for the reasons I've listed above. What happened to the intrigue that you built up in volume 1? What happened to the fight scenes? For some reason, in the first one the plot seemed so much more believable, even that scene at the Blue Lotus with the Crazy 88's and Gogo. But in the second one you lost it. Your film almost achieved mainstream glory, but fell just short enough to 'maybe' get a cult following. Maybe. Here's why:<br/><br/>Vivica Fox barely got any attention, and her character Copperhead seemed anticlimactic, besides the surreal scene in front of her green pointy-roofed house and the suburban fight scene. Why was she in the film? Just so Beatrix could have five names to cross off? So the DVAS would be ethnically stereotypical enough to mimic seventies superhero teams or their like? Same goes for Budd. He didn't seem bad ass at all, just evil and dumb, what with his burying her alive and his cowboy hat and mobile home. Did you write pasts into the script for Budd and Copperhead and have to delete them later? Oren's story built it up like all of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad was likewise going to have a 'past' which would figure somehow in Beatrix's revenge on each of them, but this simply wasn't the case with any of the other characters. <br/><br/>Elle Driver. Oh my god you could have made her so much more captivating. When Twisted Nerve was playing at the hospital and Beatrix was in a coma, I thought I would shit myself in my seat watching Daryl Hannah in that red-cross eye patch and nurse's uniform, I couldn't wait to see what she would do with her syringe full of red poison. She seemed THE PERFECT insane nemesis to Black Mamba. But in the second one, she was not given a past besides her training by and subsequent killing of Pai Mai and her ruthless attempt to make Mamba die and suffer. Why did SHE hate Beatrix so much? You should have given Elle as much treatment as you did Oren, and possibly with animation too. In the second one she was just some post-Feminist bitch who killed any man who would condescend to look into her one eye.<br/><br/>Pai Mai. Eek. Those eyebrows and white wig and taped-on beard were all fake. In a single instant your movie moved from being a compelling reworking of cheesy seventies martial arts images into a blatant and even slap-stick rip-off (a TIRED rip-off) of old kung fu movies. Why didn't you get an ACTUAL old Mandarin sage-type instead of a clearly young man? You didn't even bother to put lines in his face or give him crow's feet, so your audience didn't really know what to make of this new character. Do we take him seriously, as when his tutelage proves useful getting Beatrix out of Pamela Shultz's grave? Should we fear him, as when he pulls Beatrix's arm behind her or when Bill informs Beatrix that he hates Americans, white people, and women? Or do we laugh at him, as when he strokes his beard when he's pleased at himself? You know as well as I do that your movie would have been stronger if Beatrix's time with Pai Mai was represented by a short few memories instead of over ten minutes of watching Uma flapping her wrists at a board and getting hit in the face with a forked stick.<br/><br/>OK, here's where I'm sure a lot of the audience is going to disagree with me, but I have to say that I didn't like the little kid. I didn't understand Bill's nurturing side, and I didn't get why the kid was so dumb and thought that 'Mommy was asleep for four years because Daddy went bang-bang at Mommy's head.' Now really Quentin, a girl raised by a ruthless assassin, even a four-year-old, would know a thing or two about cruelty and killing. Children aren't stupid, and what's more they're actually emotional sponges. Instead B.B. was a glaringly not-curious child who seemed to know her estranged mother at first sight, furthermore she seemed oblivious to the very real conflict going on between the father she knows and this strange woman who pops into her house with a gun pointed at her. You really needed to develop her more. I'm not sure that she killed her fish on purpose, you left that sort of vague. Wouldn't it have been more to the plot if you'd made her a conniving little monster instead of a sweet, oblivious little television-watching idiot? Maybe she would be angry at her mother, or overjoyed at seeing her? Show any emotion, perhaps? Instead she was some uber-cute figment of Beatrix's coma-emptied womb: a little house pet who clings on to anything that tucks her into bed, everything she could wish for. How trite. Instead of giving up her glamorous career as an assassin 'to protect my baby' maybe Beatrix should have had an abortion.<br/><br/>The history of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad as a group. It simply isn't there, you leave it wide open. Maybe this would have been successful if the minor characters were a bit stronger, like Elle or Copperhead or Budd, but they were all without pasts. You could have resolved this GAPING hole in your plot by portraying how they formed, their relationships with each other, or (possibly most importantly) how their special skills attracted Bill at first. I'd be interested in seeing the cuts you made from the film, which albeit are quite voluminous. I'd wager there's a lot of stuff there you should have kept. But you didn't, and the strength of your film is completely deflated because of it. <br/><br/>Why on earth did you make Bill so mellow? His only depth came from the dialogue about 'Clark Kent is the mask Superman wears to blend in with us, it's his comment on humanity. . .', that was compelling. I was expecting more brutality, but instead Bill turns out to be a somewhat persuasive, older samurai has-been with enough chemical know-how to wield truth serum. And he plays a wooden flute. I don't believe that a Renaissance man like that, who talks so sweetly to his four-year old about how much he loves Mommy, could have put a bullet through her head. Maybe I'm an unrealistic audience to go by, but that was simply a let down. For that to work, Bill should have been more blatantly psychotic (the same advice I gave for Elle). You'd think that we'd care more whether the title character of the movie lived or died, but I for one did not."

","I have to say that this movie is definitely not as good as the first and, if I hadn't seen vol. 1, I would have found this movie completely unwatchable. There were simply too many long sequences of nothing happening at all, especially the driving scenes. I am one who doesn't like flashbacks, but I found that these were the most interesting pieces of the movie. The fight scenes, though enjoyable, were too short. One fight scene in particular (I won't give it away), I found to be so short and so unrealistic that I felt like asking for my money back. The actors and actresses were superb with the material that was given to them, but something is missing that I just can't put my finger on.<br/><br/>The movie is watchable, especially if you've seen volume one and want to know how it ends, but it is not as good as the first."

","Discussing which part of Kill Bill is better is fruitless. It is not even talking about two sides of a coin, rather comparing two sides of the same apple. It is one and the same movie cut into two parts. Tarantino was either not willing or not able to produce a scenario that would stretch over three movie.<br/><br/>Anyhow, David Carradine basically repeated his role as Kwai Chang Caine, this time with a mane of a haircut. The trademark ""i'll put you all to sleep"" voice stayed, though. Uma Thurman is beautiful and offers several touching moments. There are also several interesting details and, all in all, this is a watchable movie.<br/><br/>I guess Tarantino did what he always wanted, he filmed a kung-fu movie."

","The scene where Black Mamba escapes from the buried wooden coffin is quite remarkable (even if as from a fairy tale). This scene earned the 2 points. Otherwise there has been no plot in part 1 and this did not miraculously change here either. <br/><br/>The character of Bill is one of the main problems. It is quite unbelievable that this rather chatty but otherwise not remarkable guy is the origin of all evil (read the Trivia, can you imagine that Warren Beatty ever seriously considered this role? I can't). It is further hard to believe that every woman in the movie develops a crash on him. It is then not easier to perceive that he has lovingly raised a child of the woman he had shot, but then again, did not get killed and waited patiently for her return, then had her buried, and then even various others attending to her. In the first place, he does not seem to be worth the trouble. <br/><br/>Then the part where Daryl Hanna's (first) eye gets poked out- in case you are a martial arts trainer and your pupil shows disrespect, take an eye but continue the relationship? Why only an eye? <br/><br/>The brother is an enigma. I won't go into details, but surely he could have put up more of a fight in case he was in the assassin business before now. <br/><br/>And the kill Bill part at the end? Uma Thurman actually talks him dead. <br/><br/>No spectacular fight scenes be here any more. These having been the only considerably good part of Volume 1, not much remains here to be credited."

","There's no trick to Kill Bill Volumes 1 & 2. Vol 1 presents slimly drawn characters engaged in a ballet of violence. Vol 2 gives their back story. That's some genius, I'll say.<br/><br/>I have serious problems with the pivotal conceit of the Bride's character (here's the spoiler): the moment she discovers she's pregnant is the moment she disavows violence. Huh? How come? Why should the fact that she has 'life' growing inside her suddenly turn 'life' into something to now cherish and respect? Is she just selfish, or self-obsessed? Why is a fetus any more valuable than any of the lives she snuffed out as a paid assassin? Truth is this film has no respect for life of any sort. Murder is an occupation like any other. Killing is a calling. Death is a cheap stunt played for laughs or curious novelty. Dead babies are merely narrative triggers to go out and do more killing. <br/><br/>There are a few cheap laughs in Kill Bill Vol 2. There's some effective suspense and a bit of canny art direction here and there. The actors sure think they're making something worth putting in a hard day's work. The gaping holes in the plot and the zero plausibility don't seem to get the way of their dedication. Poor old David Carradine thinks this is the greatest opportunity of his entire career (so he says on the DVD marketing featurette). He needs to go back and watch Bergman's THE SERPENT'S EGG again. There's a film that knows about humanity's dark heart. It didn't need to pick it up third hand at a comic convention.<br/><br/>Watching this film is like being urinated on from a great height. I'm sad I've contributed to the maintenance of Tarantino's lifestyle. There's something anesthetizing about this film. It's got no soul, a dead heart, and constantly requiring shots of adrenalin to give the appearance of signs of life. Stylish it may be. Entertaining even. But in the end, it lacks the gravitas it so clearly craves. I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE has more integrity. Go ahead. Waste a coupla hours and a coupla bucks. Who cares?"

And, while the story does continue, the style and pace are very different--almost as if the follow-up was made by a different film maker. Now this does NOT mean that either is a bad film--it's just that ""Vol. 2"" is so very different. I think the body count in ""Vol. 1"" was about 1792134935947523 more or less, but in the second film very few people actually died--and very few at the hands of Uma Turman's character. In addition, the pacing is much slower and the music is good, but much more sedate--and it's very drawn out and deliberately paced. Personally, I prefer the first film--even if there is less depth to the story and many things are unanswered. In the second film, there is more story and depth to the characters--but it's less stylish and intense.<br/><br/>Now I could discuss the plot or describe all I liked or didn't like about the film. However, there are already a butt-load of reviews for this film--too many to make any additional comments I could make particularly important.

"baileycrawly","10","0","1","16 March 2020"," An Improvement On the First
","""Kill Bill"" really needs to be viewed as a single theatrical entity. It was written as one long film. It was filmed as one long film. And, despite the split into two being appropriate from the terms of a theatrical standpoint, it's best viewed as one long film when being viewed in the home video market.
I loved the first volume of Kill Bill. It was a violent bloodbath and I loved every single second of it. Volume 2 improves upon the original, something I wouldn't have believed even possible. It speaks to the quality work of Quentin Tarantino, that he knows how to tell a story and he can keep his audience enthralled and unable to look away from the screen for hours on end.
This film is a lot lighter on the ""action"" than it is on the story, which is perfectly fine because Tarantino's story suffices nicely. Much like the predecessor, this film doesn't waste time, and there's never any point in the film that feels like it's filler. Everything flows well at the hands of a master storyteller who, more than perhaps anybody else in the business, knows exactly what he's doing.
Uma Thurman once again plays an absolute badass in the role, every bit as much as the first volume.
It felt like this volume had a little bit more of a focus than the first volume in the sense that it's a cat-and-mouse chase to narrow down the ""Death List"" until, ultimately, the title of the movie is achieved.
The only major criticism of note for this part would be that the ending wasn't as epic as it potentially could've been, but it's still a fantastic story so it's easy to overlook that minor personal criticism."

"sme_no_densetsu","8","0","1","2 February 2020"," Here Comes the Bride (Again)
","Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill: Volume 2"" followed less than a year after the first 'volume'. It concludes the story of the Bride's quest for revenge against her former allies in the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. As you may or may not know, ""Kill Bill"" was originally meant to be a single film but the distributor (Miramax) pushed for it to be split into two. Although they were probably more concerned about maximizing box office receipts, splitting the movie into two probably made it more palatable for most viewers as well. Whatever the motivation, I think that splitting the movie in half was ultimately for the best.<br/><br/>There isn't really a lot to say about the story since it just picks up where the first movie left off and puts us back on the road to fulfilling the promise inherent in the title. If you liked the first movie, this is more of the same (which isn't a bad thing). However, it must be said that this chapter is less action-oriented than the first one. There are both positive & negative aspects to that. On one hand, the violence is less cartoonish but, on the other hand, the pace can drag a bit at times. In an ideal world, the two movies would have been condensed just enough to strike the right balance between action & drama.<br/><br/>The cast is trimmed down a little from the first movie but we get to see much more from David Carradine (Bill), Darryl Hannah (Elle Driver) & Michael Madsen (Budd) this time around. All contribute good performances and it was also interesting to see Michael Parks & Gordon Liu return in different roles.<br/><br/>As with the first movie, the production values are top notch. Tarantino's direction & Robert Richardson's cinematography once again combined to produce a beautiful looking movie. Robert Rodriguez's music might not have produced as many iconic moments as The RZA's musical selections from the first volume but it's still a good soundtrack that gives the movie a unique flavour that sets it apart from the first one.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Kill Bill: Volume 2"" does a good job of bringing the Bride's story to a close. It may lack some of the excitement of the first installment but its measured storytelling is just as much a showcase of Tarantino's skill as a screenwriter and a director. Fans of the first movie will no doubt want to follow the story to its conclusion and I see no reason to dissuade them from doing so."
"Jeremy_Urquhart","10","0","1","27 January 2020"," Equally as good as the brilliant Vol. 1, managing to complement it perfectly while also being so different
","There are few certainties in life.
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.
When someone is born, eventually they die.
A person starts Kill Bill Vol. 1, and immediately needs to watch Vol. 2. With that cliffhanger in Vol. 1- where we find out The Bride's daughter is somehow still alive- how could you resist?<br/><br/>I'm not here to talk about which one is best, because in all honesty, I think they're equally good. Is that something of a cop out on my part? I don't think so, because I can rank other classic film stories split into parts with relative ease (Fellowship>Return>Two Towers, and Empire>New Hope>Jedi for a couple of examples). It really is the 100% honest truth that I cannot differentiate these in terms of quality. But with how different they are, you'd think that it would be easy.<br/><br/>Vol. 1 focuses on being a martial arts film homage, with tons of crazy action and violence to satisfy actions fans and provide so much incredible, visceral, extravagant entertainment. Vol. 2 is just as entertaining and engaging but for different reasons. There is violence, but it's certainly less frequent. Instead of extended scenes of action, we get a whole lot of extended dialogue exchanges, which if you go through Tarantino's filmography, is honestly what you get the most out of his films, by and large (despite his reputation for being a filmmaker who packs his films with violence, Kill Bill Vol. 1 in my eyes is his only true action film; that and maybe the second half of Death Proof). The dialogue is fantastically written, and even more impressively, likely wouldn't sound as great if this film wasn't so well cast and acted. This is Uma Thurman's greatest performance; as fantastic and cool as she is in the first volume, Vol. 2 is where she really gets to shine as an actress, as she goes through a whole host of emotions and commits entirely to a role that I'm sure a lesser performer would not take as seriously. David Carradine is also amazing here. I haven't seen much else with him in it, but he brings so much to what could otherwise be a very simple character, and for as terrible as Bill acted, and for as occasionally creepy as he can be, he really feels like a real person. You truly buy the chemistry between him and Thurman (despite the- again, slightly creepy- age difference), and he proves to be an oddly tragic villain. You want The Bride to indeed 'kill Bill,' but at the same time, perhaps you don't. Anytime Thurman and Carradine share the screen, time slips away and the film is utterly captivating.<br/><br/>Despite having less action, many of the things that were fantastic about the first volume are just as fantastic here. The look of the film is breathtaking, with a greater focus on paying visual homage here to old westerns rather than the martial arts references found in the first volume- although there is an extended flashback dealing with The Bride's martial arts training that reproduces and pays loving homage to similar old martial arts movies brilliantly. All the music here is selected and used just as perfectly as the amazing soundtrack in the first part. And there are sequences here that while not as over-the-top as the climactic fight against The Crazy 88 in the first, prove just as memorable. Scenes like a one-on-one swordfight in such an enclosed space that one participant cannot even unsheathe their sword, and a painfully drawn-out sequence that will have you on edge, even if you don't think yourself usually susceptible to claustrophobia. And then there's the surprisingly hard-hitting emotion of the whole thing. Vol. 2 is where the characters left standing after Vol. 1 start to feel like real people, and the whole concept of revenge becomes something less simple and straightforward; something that is perhaps even critiqued. The movie gives its characters time to breathe and speak, not just fight, and that's when the surprisingly deep character traits and frequently relatable emotional dilemmas begin to make themselves apparent.<br/><br/>I could understand Vol. 1 being seen by some as the better film, and honestly I have no ill will against anyone preferring one of the volumes over the other. For me, they'll always remain equal, proving unbelievably satisfying in their own unique ways while also blending together to create a perfect revenge epic that runs for about four blissfully cinematic hours. Vol. 2 has as much artistic merit as the first despite its different approach and focuses, and I believe as long as you're open to the story continuing in a matter you might not be expecting after the kinetic, violent, and relentless Vol. 1, you should come away satisfied."
"renofhate","10","0","1","26 January 2020"," The Bride closing in on the Dead Viper Assassination Squad's Remaining Members
","Kill Bill Vol. 2 is Tarantino at his best! The Bride returns to finish where she left off.. I might be one of those few people who prefers part two to part one. Don't get me wrong, they're both equal for me as is, but I do think I'd choose part two if I had to. Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a lot like the first instalment but also a whole lot different. Tarantino delivers once again with an amazing action/martial arts/crime/thriller extravaganza. I love how these films pay homage to spaghetti westerns and grindhouse. The little elements that add to this film make it all the more better. While Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a bloody showdown, the second Kill Bill instalment feels like a continuation in the form of story more so than anything. The scenes that depict The Bride while doing her training are some of my favourite scenes of the entire Kill Bill double-act. The villain, main antagonist Bill, is actually here in this one. As you could guess. There are some over-the-top scenes of epic sword brutality though, don't think otherwise. The music is a particular highlight for the movie as well, and co-stars Daryl Hannah, Michael Madsen, and David Carradine all give great performances. The choreography is good and the cinematography and set locations and scenery are all good as well. The dialogue is brilliant through and through. I love the character development in this film as well because you find out more about The Bride herself, and more of a backstory is prominent in this one. The fact that this one depicts more scenes from the past is interesting and one of my favourite things about the film. There are some unexpected twists that I really enjoy as well in Vol. 2. I love the scenes with Bill and The Bride as well, and I thought the film's opening act was a good choice given it starts with The Bride and Bill and looks back to when The Bride was gunned down adding to the story before the film is even properly started. Bill's death scene is so well done, especially given it's the shortest fight between The Bridge and anyone. A quick but effective death, full of impact, and the acting from Thurman in particular during the scene is outstanding. It's highly enjoyable from start to finish, I love it, and I can't recommend it enough. Tarantino does it again!"

"Dello_","9","0","2","9 January 2020"," Better than the great vol.1
","""Kill Bill vol.2"" is clearly the second part of a long single movie but is very very different in tone and in the scope than the vol.1. Indeed the first one is more action oriented and more fun, especially with its over-the-top violent fights but the second part is deeper and more emotional. And if the vol.1 was so memorable in terms of action, vol.2 has great dialogues that are now printed in my head (and in particular the last one). And I'm not implying that this movie doesn't contain some great duels, because it surely does, but I preferred this more narrative oriented style and the overall messages and theme explored by this vol.2. And in all of that I found the finale very satisfying, a perfect pay off to the previous four hours. The movies (vol.1 and 2) works so well because all the characters are greatly characterised and were always intriguing and I was interested in watching how they would have evolved in the story. I've already talked about the dialogues but I want to underline them again because they were fantastic and I feel I could have watched two hours of people talking about how to open a bottle of water and still being entertained.
""Kill Bill"" intended as a single movie is definitely worth watching again and again and the different type of narration between its two parts allows to love them both without caring about which is better than the other, but just enjoying a great storytelling."

"tkcadmaan","8","0","2","20 December 2019"," An Epic Action Movie
","Tarantino treats both volumes of Kill Bill as a single movie, and I feel that is true. At first I thought that perhaps the director took too long to arrange certain scenes, but that is most certainly not the case. Tarantino made sure to give each portion of the story the perfect amount of time that it deserved, and it was wonderful! Lots of action, lots of blood, lots of cliches, but in all the right ways. The first volume in my opinion is the better of the two, and is crucial for understanding the story, so I recommend watching the first volume before this one, or else you would have missed out on a lot of important plot points, even though this movie tries to have a kind of recap at the start. Overall a great action movie with great performances and amazing cinematography and set design, a must see for lovers of Tarantino's work!"

"andrewroy-04316","5","0","1","20 June 2019"," Lighter on action than the first, Volume 2 drags through its attempts to provide emotional backstory, but leads up to a good climax
","I found Kill Bill 1 to be a pure action movie completely lacking in personal interest, but so well done and energetic in the action set pieces to keep it enjoyable. Volume 2 is much lighter on action and tries to establish some emotional investment in the characters, but as that was the big weakness of Volume 1, it wasn't much better here. The first two acts (or the chapters before the final one) were quite a slog, as it was more seeing her past training and minor events, either before the wedding or with Bud. I don't think we really learn much about her character beyond what we knew of her as an intense killer from the first, until that final act. The fight between her and Elle is really well choreographed (though how could she just pluck her eye out? That just isn't how that works) and reminiscent of the action of 1. The final conversation with Bill is far and away the best part of the movie and what makes it watchable. Finally, we understand why Bill tried to kill her and why there is so much intensity in their relationship. It all fits into place clearly, and the conclusion in how he is killed is very fitting. There's a bit to ponder in redemption and one's reaction to shocking events, but it's still not a particularly deep movie, the ending just explains how it all happened. The good and satisfying but unexceptional ending certainly fails to make up for the boredom of the majority of the film. Kill Bill as a 4 hour movie is a passable action set piece and is classic Tarantino, but isn't anything I would ever recommend."

Stuff like this is all very intense and awesome to watch. Major props to Uma Thurman. The reveal of Bill having her daughter all this time was pretty shocking. In the first film we always knew she was missing but to see the man Beatrice has done so much to kill just he around her is very effective. To she her breakdown is kinda powerful and tough to watch even. The end title card is also a nice touch along with certain details scattered across the film. However, I did not like this movie as much as the first one. It didn't make me jump out my seat as much and I'm kinda disappointed by that. Bill's death was also not that good. I didn't find it satisfying at all. Overall, 8/10."
"BandSAboutMovies","10","0","1","23 March 2019"," The conclusion
","When we last saw the Bride, she'd crossed two names off of her kill list: O-Ren Ishii and Vernita Green. And oh yeah - we also learned that her daughter is still alive. Now, she's finally going to do what she's been promising. She's going to kill Bill...right after she gets through Elle, Budd and everyone else.<br/><br/>The Bride sets off for the trailer of Sidewinder/Budd, who is also Bill's brother. Speaking of Bill, he's warned him that the Bride is on her way, so as she gets close, Budd blasts her with a shotgun packed with rock salt, then buries her alive. To top it all off, he calls in Elle Driver and offers to sell the Bride's sword for a million dollars.<br/><br/>We go back in time to see Bill leaving the Bride behind at the temple of Pai Mei (Gordon Liu!), who in time will teach her his most deadly secret: the Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique. He's never shown it to anyone before because it kills any opponent before they take five steps. The training is beyond horrible - if you've seen any Hong Kong martial arts film, you'll understand - but the Bride emerges with Pai Mei's respect. She uses his lessons to break her way free from the coffin.<br/><br/>Elle Drive kills Budd with an actual black mamba, the snake that the Bride took her codename from. She calls Bill to let him know that his brother has been killed by the Bride, but that she's already killed her. As she does so, she reveals her enemy's true name: Beatrix Kiddo. Both of these women were trained by Mei, so the battle is beyond destructive (we have an entire article about the references in this film right here that will explain so much more), ending with Elle revealing that she poisoned and killed Mei after he took her eye. The Bride tears out her other eye and leaves her in the abandoned trailer, along with the deadly snake.<br/><br/>The Bride goes to Mexico, where retired pimp Esteban Vihaio (Michael Parks!) helps her find Bill, who is in a hotel with their daughter B.B. After a family-friendly evening, Bill shoots the Bride with a dart filled with truth serum. He learns that she left the Vipers to give her daughter a better life, but Bill only found out that she was missing and assumed that the man she was to marry was B.B.'s father.<br/><br/>The Bride then hits the dreaded Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique. Bill makes peace with her, takes five steps and dies. Beatrix Kiddo and B.B. leave to start a new life.<br/><br/>There were plans to make numerous sequels to this film, including two anime films that would be the origin of Bill and the Bride. There was also talk of Kill Bill: Volumes 3 and 4, which would have two killers whose arms and eye were taken by the Bride and then a cycle of stories about daughters who avenge the death of their mothers. But these days, everyone is non-committal about a sequel.<br/><br/>I love the dichotomy between these two films. The first is pure spectacle and brawls with hundreds of people. Just like the tagline to Jaws: The Revenge, this time it's personal."

It has some of the best dialogue written especially in the last parts of the movie when Bill and Kiddo finally meet. Their interaction is what makes the movie special it gives us an insight into what makes them who they are. Bill is cold and has a heart at the same time, Kiddo is deadly yet vulnerable and has a difficult time speaking her emotional state. This is most evident when Bill drops by the Chapel and her hesitation and fear is displayed by the frantic looks and tone changes Uma thurman uses, the Bride is most human then. Both movies are a one destination journey, the most touching part is her journey as a warrior under the tutelage of Pai Mei. This is where we catch a glimpse of the warrior that Kiddo really is, and what makes her different from all the others, she has a deep honor and respect for tradition. This casts her in a superior mold to Bill as a warrior, who is cunning and fierce but lacks the dedication Kiddo has for she has an honor code they all lack."

","'KILL BILL: VOLUME 2' - 2004<br/><br/>Directed by Quentin Tarantino<br/><br/>Starring Uma Thurman and David Carradine<br/><br/>Plot Overview: ​*CONTINUED AFTER EVENTS OF KILL BILL: VOL 1* After defeating 2/5 of her targets, The Bride(Uma Thurman) continues to wage her one woman war against those who wronged her. And she still takes no prisoners!<br/><br/>it's certainly different but I disagree that that makes it better. My issue with this film is the difference in tone and style. I adored Volume One for its masterful visuals, great action and fun story. This film is on the opposite end of the spectrum in genre. It's a more grounded, story driven conclusion to Tarantino's original saga. And I wouldn't be bothered if the two films were so different. If Tarantino did an entirely separate, story driven and grounded story; then I'd be down with it. I would. But the fact that the first film was an excellent action film and this isn't annoys me greatly and the disconcert between the two is stupid. Pick a style and stick with it. I personally don't think that this is the better half of the saga, not even close. Don't tell me that I am just a blood thirsty, action junkie who cannot enjoy dramatic stories. I am not. I love drama as a genre but I hate how Tarantino has tried to mesh the two into this saga. If you like it, then that is fine but it really did not work for me.<br/><br/>The carry over story is still really good. The through lines remain and I was still thoroughly engaged in the story-line. It includes some really incredible and gut wrenching scenes which were the highlight of the film. I really admired that and one scene in this movie makes me actively dislike the ending scene of the last movie(not action scene but emotional scene). The film finishes the story well enough but I do not think it recaptured the magic of the original. <br/><br/>Uma Thurman was excellent in this movie and maintains the highlight of this saga. We also learn a lot more about her character in this film which I thought was a genius idea. There is one specific piece of information I wish was left ambiguous about her that they revealed. It doesn't affect quality in any way but I think it would add a lot to the mystique of her character if we weren't told this piece of information.<br/><br/>David Carradine was great as Bill. Bill was strange. I THINK I liked him as an antagonist but I cannot be too sure. He hit all the right cues and was threatening enough but I can't be certain in whether he's an excellent villain, or an average one. He's in that little grey area.<br/><br/>Daryl Hannah was appropriately loathsome as Elle Driver. She did a good job and the actual character was a pretty decent one. She was a good minor antagonist.<br/><br/>Technically wise, it is still a very nice looking movie and I do still appreciate Tarantino's masterful style. That said, I do think that the novelty of seeing his style in Volume One does wear of in this film. Not that that retracts quality, it just makes it harder to praise when it doesn't feel as fresh and invigorating. The use of black and white was also very nice but it did occasionally come of as abrupt and strange.<br/><br/>The score for these films is incredible. The soundtrack is excellent and I cannot commend the composers and Tarantino himself for assembling such an awesome array of music and sound effects.<br/><br/>As far as action goes, I was underwhelmed in this movie. I had doubts that they could outdo the Crazy 88s but I still had hope. They. Did. Not. There is ONE action scene in this film and it was fine. It wasn't too memorable but it was certainly entertaining. None of the action is mediocre it just isn't great when compared to the original, which I am inclined to do because A] It's a direct continuation and B] I can.<br/><br/>​ I really wanted to like this movie but I was thoroughly disappointed. The first one was such a fun, inventive, stylised movie that I could barely poke flaws in. This tries desperately to ride of Volume One's steam and ultimately fails. I only, and I mean only recommend you see this film to see how the story ties up. Aside from that, it was a very bland and forgettable experience. I'll rate this movie 6 'Beard Strokes' out of 10."

","Kill Bill Vol. 2 is the sequel one year later than the original processor Kill Bill. Being released as two separate parts within a year of each other, Quentin Tarantino understood what he was getting at. Volume 2 in this franchise lays out more of a plot, more in depth and remains more focus than the original. There is more suspense and thrills and it is overall a more entertaining and intriguing watch. Mainly thanks of David Carradine's portrayal as Bill, as he has more screen time and answers are answered more regarding his relationship with The Bride (however her name was revealed).<br/><br/>Though what is less than stellar and quite disappointing is the final showdown between the Bride and Bill. We understood the main purpose of the film is the revenge of the Bride against Bill and the build up was all for a chaotic scene between the two, but what is left happening doesn't live up to the hype, as nothing mesmerizing occurs between the two. Though leading up to the final end scenes, occurs key and important scenes involving both the Bride and Bill, and introducing their four year old daughter. This was well done.

"mdenvee","1","0","3","3 April 2017"," Kill Bill 2: Kill everything about this movie & its prequel.. PLZ
","Yet another example of creative film making which had the potential to be fantastic but ended up miserable. Kill Bill Vol 2 (and Vol 1 for that matter) is an ponderous, pretentious, overlong, disappointing revenge drama which clearly and easily could have been saved via the normal efforts of a decent story or objective movie editor who was NOT Mr. Tarantino or influenced by him. I believe Tarantino, like Lucas, Stone, and many other notables, do their best work when they do not have too much control over the story and pacing. KB has many fine points- an original plot, great casting, music, great camera work. But, fails completely in the script, pacing, and yes the action sequences, which are vital to the creation of a good movie especially of this genre. The scripts were all too 'contrived', boring, irrelevant and unnatural for the characters reciting them- too brooding and overly philosophical, which was as distracting as it was annoying. And Tarantino seems to have this arrogant assumption that we enjoy his pretentious dialogues (and inner monologues) as much as he does. The character development was insufficient- primarily Uma's who is supposed to be such a deadly assassin yet there is little or no back story which validates this. It would have been invaluable to have included some earlier scenes with Uma as the warrior/assassin that she proves ONCE (and only once) in the ridiculous Crazy 88 fight sequence- but that is a sequence which is unconvincing because watching her slice up 88 stupid bodyguards is boring. So, instead of having one of the slowest-paced movies I have ever watched, simply speed things up a little (such as that painfully slow animated O-Ren sequence and in other areas) and add in some assassin background history on Uma. I enjoyed the fight scene of O-Rens personal bodyguard in Vol 1 and the all-too-short training scene in Vol 2 with the Kung Fu master, but that was not really showing Uma as this assassin, nor unbeatable swordmaster. In fact, probably my biggest pet peeve of the both KBs is the odd fact that neither film shows any real sword fighting or special combat scenes among the ""master"" assassins. There is plenty of ""talk"" throughout both films about sword fighting, etc, but ALL the scenes (except that long, repetitive, implausible fight scene with the 88s) involved quick sequences, usually in tight quarters. THINK ABOUT IT- all the people on her list were killed quickly and without any real martial arts!!! O-Ren, Elle, Green, and Bill all were killed by Kiddo (Uma) quickly and with hardly any sword play! Yes, there was a very brief sword fight with O-Ren... but with all the build-up of O- Ren's ability, I would have expected their sword fight to be 3x longer at least and more exciting- instead of spending 30 minutes watching Uma fighting 100s of stupid bodyguard ninjas, and all attacking her one at a time! This made no sense and for me, ruined the movie, since I would have expected all the villains on Uma's list to be killed in true martial arts combat scenes with SWORDS- since they spend both movies talking endlessly about Hattori Hanzo swords! In addition to O- Ren being killed easily with only a few swings of Uma's sword, Green is killed boringly inside her house (despite ""talking"" about scheduling a knife fight), Elle is killed inside a small cramp trailer house without even one swing of either of their Hanzo amazing swords- (yawn, yawn). All the fights were more of a street brawl or cat fight than a kung fu battle. Why not go outside for a real fight?? And Budd was killed by Elle (not even by Uma- again boring!). Bill, the ultimate villain and master, is killed in seconds by Uma with a cool, but all too quick heart explosion trick... after the audience sits through 2 long movies concluding with yet another excruciatingly slow pontificating, pedantic dialogue between them. In both films, there is nothing to support or exhibit how deadly and masterful a fighter Bill is supposed to be!! Geez. All in all, KB2 and KB1 are films which had great potential, but a misguided director and writers/editors who gave the audience ironically zero real kung fu or sword fight scenes among the 'main' characters and thus left us with never really seeing any impressive swordplay or hand to hand kung fu. Instead, we have an overlong, boring, unsatisfying film. A shame."

","Tarantino tends to make long movie stories, so Kill Bill"" wasn't much of an exception. With the overall time of over four hours, the quality and tempo of the story winds down in the second part of the saga, lacking the great standoffs from the first one. As for the directing, all the major elements are there also, with with a lesser level of homage, the creativity of sequences will be slightly lower, not diminishing Quentin's raw talent behind the camera. The epic ending will be somewhat of a anticlimactic when compared to the overall rhythm of the script as well. Kill Bill vol.2"" is a good movie, but slightly weaker than the first part."

","RELEASED IN 2004 and written/directed by Quentin Tarantino, ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" completes the story of 2003's ""Vol. 1"" and fills in the holes. Former assassin, The Bride (Uma Thurmon), seeks vengeance after the murder of her fiancé & friends at a wedding rehearsal in El Paso. She takes on formidable thugs Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle (Daryl Hannah) to finally get to ringleader Bill (David Carradine). Gordon Liu plays master martial artist Pai Mei while Michael Parks is on hand as Esteban Vihaio.<br/><br/>This part of the duology is more dialogue-driven than ""Vol. 1,"" fleshing-out the characters and answering many questions. Such as: How is The Bride such an unconquerable fighter? How did Elle lose her right eye? Why did Bill conduct the wedding massacre? How does Budd spend his retirement? The problem is that the characters are all cartoony caricatures, and merciless assassins to boot. It's impossible to give criminal scum ""more depth,"" at least as far as caring for them goes. Let 'em all kill each other for all I care. Moreover, the story is too shallow to warrant such epic treatment and would've been more effective if both films were condensed into a 2.5 hour flick, cutting out the fat.<br/><br/>Still, the movie's so offbeat that it's entertaining in the manner of 1996's ""Mojave Moon,"" but better. It's an interesting combo of spaghetti Westerns, 70's martial arts flicks, Bond-isms and all-around Tarantino quirkiness. But suggesting that the ""Kill Bill"" flicks are cinematic masterpieces of auteurism is overdoing it. Take, for instance, the ridiculous closing credits, which run well over 12 minutes: The plot and characters are unworthy of such pretentious veneration. If you want masterworks by Tarantino, see ""Django Unchained"" (2012) and ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994); or even ""Inglourious Basterds"" (2009) and ""Jackie Brown"" (1997).<br/><br/>Still, the movie's strangely amusing, the cast is good (especially Carradine) and Bill's Superman analysis is insightful.

","In this film, the second of two, the bride gets her revenge against Bill, the groom who nearly killed her in the day of their wedding. Directed and written by Quentin Tarantino, the film stars Uma Thurman and David Carradine.<br/><br/>This movie is the sequel of ""Kill Bill (Vol. 1)"", so the criticism I made for the first film almost fit perfectly in this second film. Tarantino thought both films as one. And I start by saying that I like some of the films that Tarantino has done, but I believe that Kill Bill was one of the worst of his career as a director.<br/><br/>The film deserves applause for the performance of the actors, the good soundtrack and the good special, visual and sound effects. The main problem of this film is the non-linear narrative. It was a negative option because it makes everything more confusing than ever would be normally. Yes, because this movie is confusing and mixes film and filmmaking styles that have no apparent connection (it's rare to see a Japanese martial arts film with logical connection to the universe of American western). As I said to the first film, a person who knows nothing about this movie and never read anything about it, don't understand it. Luckily, this film can, after all, to frame the events in a more logical way than the first film, where scenes seem much more isolated from each other.<br/><br/>The film's screenplay is interesting, although it has been virtually copied from another movie ( ""Lady Snowblood""). But despite the basic idea is good (the bride betrayed by her groom, abandoned at the altar and nearly murdered in his own marriage), the way the film develops that is quite negative. The film does not explain Bill's reasons to kill the bride, which makes the situation seem far- fetched. On the other hand, the seemingly random way the film shows action scenes, western, or martial arts makes everything with a very forced and unreal appearance. Fans can say that its a satire, a tribute... say what they want. The film is still poor and far- fetched at the expense of those bad choices of the director."

"tomgillespie2002","7","0","1","20 March 2016"," A fitting end to Tarantinos revenge saga
","While the decision to split Kill Bill, originally intended as a three-hour epic tale of revenge, into two separate movies was greeted by fans with accusations of greed. Whether this is true or whether the full version of Quentin Tarantino's homage to 70's exploitation was simply too much to consume in one sitting, it actually turns out to be a masterstroke. Volumes 1 and 2 incorporate two vastly different styles, both of which allow Tarantino to fully indulge his love for kung-fu movies and spaghetti westerns with ample time and care. These are two different movies, never forgetting that the character linking them together is Uma Thurman's determined The Bride.<br/><br/>Having dispatched O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) in the first film, we first meet The Bride as she drives to her final target - Bill (David Carradine). To even consider this a spoiler would be failing to grasp the movies Tarantino is tipping his hat to, and the director makes a point of this by constantly shifting around the time-line. It's not so much about if she'll achieve her goal, but just how cool it will be when she does. Bill remained off screen for the bulk of Volume 1, seen either stroking his samurai sword and talking menacingly off-camera, but we meet him in his full glory almost instantly in Volume 2, as we are shown an extended version of the events that left The Bride shot in the head and left for dead.<br/><br/>First though, she must face Budd (Michael Madsen) and the one-eyed Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah). Budd is a tough, hard-drinking redneck working as a bouncer when he's not clumsily making margaritas in his trailer, and he is given a generous amount of screen-time and isn't let down by Madsen's gravelly performance. Similar to Tarantino's early films Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994), Budd's story is given a patient build-up before the burst of inevitable violence, portraying him as a beaten man awaiting his death at the hands of the woman he knows is coming for him. Just when his fate seems sealed, Tarantino slaps us in the face and turns his protagonists fortunes on their head, allowing for some down-time as we flash-back to The Bride's training with the formidable Pai Mei (Gordon Liu).<br/><br/>Pai Mei's chapter is the entire saga's crowning achievement, full of ridiculous crash-zooms and beard stroking that manages to poke fun at the genre, while at the same time warmly embracing and even transcending it. This leads The Bride to her face-off with Elle, which is a scene of such ferocity, humour and sheer bad-assery that it more than makes up for the creeping pace. As Bill, Carradine is a revelation, with Tarantino once again pulling an iconic actor out of obscurity to riff on the type of role they became famous for in the first place to deliver the performance of their career. An early version of the script had The Bride and Bill duelling to a sunset backdrop, but the low-key scrap opted for instead seems more fitting. Towards the climax, it seems that Tarantino is struggling with how to end his epic tale of revenge, but some minor bumps don't derail what is undoubtedly the most Tarantino-y of his catalogue, and certainly his most all-out fun."

It's 2016 and Quentin Tarantino hasn't made a single watchable film since Jackie Brown. I get it, he wants to work on mini-series type projects like the ones that are thriving right now. But Hollywood needs Quentin to sell movie tickets. Even though he never even went to film school he can make a movie that can earn the studio millions of dollars. Even Disney tried to edge him out of the competition so that they could make more money over Christmas with Star Wars. People will always try to tell you how great Kill Bill is as a movie. I think it has some cool parts but as a movie it is sort of lame and drawn out. I enjoy the Bruce Lee subtext element of Kill Bill, but then you've gone and got Michael Parks playing a fake latino. Where does that leave us Quentin? Where does that leave us? Why didn't you just call Danny Trejo?"

","The remaining half of the whole bloody affair that was put into motion by the massacre that took place at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel, Kill Bill: Vol. 2 picks up right from where Vol. 1 signed off and continues The Bride's roaring rampage of revenge but in an entirely different fashion as Tarantino allows the plot & character development part to catch up to the frenzy, kinetic madness of the first to finish his saga without leaving any loose ends.<br/><br/>I guess almost everyone who ventured into Vol. 2 anticipating the same breakneck, thrilling & action-packed roller-coaster ride that Vol. 1 provided was left bemused & underwhelmed by what Vol. 2 had in store for them as Quentin Tarantino does a U-turn by applying brakes on the action and filling the plot with more dialogues, backstories & emotional complexities, thus turning this saga into a revenge dish that tastes better when experienced together.<br/><br/>After seeing her being betrayed & then watching her seek her revenge, Kill Bill: Vol. 2 finds The Bride going after the remaining members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad but before this tale of bloody retribution reaches its climax, it also focuses on few unanswered questions, like how did she become such a deadly assassin, who Bill really is & what led to the ultimate betrayal. And when it at last reaches its climactic showdown, Tarantino throws in another curveball.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, the second half of Kill Bill feels entirely different in comparison to the first half as this master filmmaker approaches the remaining chapters by taking an alternate route that finds the writer-director slowing down the pace considerably, unfolding the events in dialogue-driven fashion, addressing the characters' origins, toning down the blood-splattered action, and even changes the whole texture of the very moment this entire story had been heading towards.<br/><br/>The screenplay exhibits the usual Tarantino charm & wit, its homage to spaghetti westerns, Chinese wuxia, Japanese samurai films & other genres continues, Editing allows the plot to spread out a bit further but it lacks the tight, rigid structure of Vol. 1, thus resulting in a few plodding moments in its 136 minutes runtime, Cinematography carries the same vibe of the first half, and the existing musical tracks incorporated into this remaining picture continues to impress even if it isn't as seamlessly integrated as the last time.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Uma Thurman reprises her role of The Bride and chips in with an even better input this time. Supporting her all the way is an excellent ensemble of David Carradine, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah & Gordon Liu who play Bill, Budd, Elle & Pai Mei, respectively. Carradine lives up to his character's reputation, Madsen brings Budd to life in a reserved manner, Hannah is simply as manic as she appeared in her brief cameo in Vol. 1 while Liu plays the martial arts teacher with required over-the-top exaggeration.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Kill Bill: Vol. 2 may not be as enjoyable & gratifying as Vol. 1 but what it lacks in relentless carnage & unabashed spectacle of Vol. 1, it makes up in deeper examination of its characters & their motivations. While I was one of those viewers who felt cheated by its lacklustre final standoff during my first watch, I've only come to appreciate it more n more with every subsequent viewing as Tarantino turns what should have been an epic confrontation into an unexpectedly tragic & heartbreaking farewell. People will always be divided over which is the better volume but as a whole, Kill Bill delivers on all fronts."
"cartesianthought","6","0","2","22 December 2015"," Ambitious, eclectic, but slightly less essential than the original.
","Directly following up the first film, it meanders quite a bit before closing with an overall satisfying conclusion. The Bride escapes near- death several times, trains under the great Pai Mei and gets revenge on the people in her organization who tried to kill her.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman, in this film, gives arguably the best performance in Tarantino history. Atop from being every bit as ruthless, she plays the role of a mother looking for her child so convincingly well, that at the end, it inspires awe. But having already seen Kill Bill 1, it doesn't feel as novel. At the end of the day, both films are two halves of a whole: a pure escapist homage to old classic ninja flicks."
"brianberta","2","0","3","19 December 2015"," Makes the original look like a masterpiece
","When movie sequels are released, the common audience and critics consensus is usually that the sequel isn't as good as the original. Some sequels are pretty good but most people view the original as the better movie when compared to each other. I have seen very few sequels which are widely considered to be better than the original. Sadly, this is a case where the sequel to an already bad movie is so horrible that it makes the original one look like a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The Bride is back and she is continuing her quest for vengeance. In the previous film, she killed Vernita Green and O-Ren Ishii. In this movie, she must kill Bill's brother Budd, Elle, and Bill. Many things happen during her quest and she faces many life threatening situations so killing them proves to be quite a difficult task.<br/><br/>My first issue with this movie is that it contains many pointless scenes which drag the movie out even more. The movie could've been cut down a lot more if these scenes were removed. While it's nice to see her training montage and the massacre on the day of the wedding rehearsal, these scenes slow the movie down and they only show things that I have already been made aware of or am not interested in learning about. I wanted to get back to the main action and I didn't want to keep on seeing pointless interruptions which I found to be uninteresting.<br/><br/>Another huge problem with the film is that it has much more talking and less action than the first film. Volume 1 was much more fast paced and it had more scenes of action and fighting. However, since the pacing in this movie is much slower, it makes it harder for fans of the original who became use to its fast pacing to get into this one and become engaged. Come to think of it, I don't think that Kill Bill ever needed to be divided up into 2 parts anyways. It should've just been one movie and it would've been a better film as a result since it would fix the problems with the pacing from the 2nd movie.<br/><br/>Also, the main villain (Bill) feels very one-note and is very dull. Even though David Carradine gives a magnificent performance, I didn't like his character at all. He also gets some of the most stupid lines in the film including a theory that The Bride is a killer on the inside and that she wears her more mature self as a disguise similar to Superman (because as we all know, soldiers are destined to kill people for the rest of their lives since they once did it on the frontlines). One thing that I really hate about the film is that the more interesting characters are killed off first. Elle is easily the best character in the movie since she has the most personality. Also, Budd's trailer home provides a great atmosphere with gorgeous cinematography and his performance is filled with charisma. I wished that the film was more about them then some crazy psychopath and a one-note main villain. I guess the moral to this movie is that the more interesting your character is, the quicker you are killed off.<br/><br/>Also, the ending to this film is an enormous disaster and I could not feel any form of enjoyment after the movie ended regardless how hard I tried. One of my complaints with the first film was that the fight between The Bride and O-Ren Ishii didn't contain much swordplay and had more instances of them standing around and talking. I didn't think that the final fight could be any worse in this film, but it is. It is even more drawn out and there is even less fighting between them then there was in the original film. There were a few scenes when Bill shot her with a dart and held her at gunpoint, but those scenes really didn't contain any fighting so I was just waiting for those scenes to end so that the movie could get to the actual swordplay between them. Also, what makes the ending even worse is that when she reunites with her daughter after so long, I couldn't feel any sympathy for her whatsoever as I thought that she would make a horrible mother based on what she did (this is something she even admits to by saying that she can never live a normal life). Throughout the 2 films, she chopped numerous people's body parts off, killed a mother in front of her daughter, ripped someone's eyeball out and stepped on it, slammed a doctor's head between a door until he died, and many other things too. Because of this, it makes the film's ending harder to swallow and take seriously as a happy ending.<br/><br/>The film is a little less sadistic than the first film, but it still contains a fair amount of sadism. Examples of it include someone's eye being pulled out and stepped on, a man getting bitten by a snake over and over again and dying a painful death because of it, and a blind woman running around and screaming in agony. Because of these scenes, the film feels very crass as a result and I wish that Tarantino would just grow up already and use violence maturely and not just for the sake of it.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is a disaster and it should be avoided at all costs. It does have some good things to it such as great acting, some of the action is pretty good, and, while maybe a little less impressive, the cinematography is pretty good in some scenes (mainly the scenes which take place in the desert). However, these few flaws don't even come close to overshadowing the numerous flaws it has with pointless scenes, pacing issues, unlikeable characters, a horrible ending, and sadism. This film is completely garbage."

","The HUGE HUGE HUGE weakness of this film is the fact that it is so slow. If you have just watched Kill Bill Part 1 and expect blood and guts galore and lots of scenes showing Beatrix kick ass and sever heads and limbs then you'll be very disappointed. You need patience and to be in the right frame of mind to get the most from this movie. This film is definitely more like a western rather than a kung fu movie (besides the scenes with Pai Mei).<br/><br/>If you do have patience though you'll be rewarded. Many things that weren't explained in the first half are explained. It ties things up. People may often pigeonhole Tarantino as an action director, but here he really shines in the intriguing dialogue that he has the actors deliver.<br/><br/>The final encounter with Bill disappointed me and left me craving for more. It felt like something was missing and there were a lot of scenes cut from Beatrix's encounter with Bill. I feel this scene should have had a more epic fight scene, though the verbal exchanges were pretty intense. Bill shouldn't have been so easy to kill dammit! Overall this is definitely not a bad film, but it's incredibly imbalanced. Some scenes from this film should have been in the first half and some action scenes from the first half should have been in the second. I don't like the whole action first (part 1) and dialogue later (part 2)that Tarantino took.<br/><br/>I definitely agree that someone should merge Kill Bill 1 & 2 into one and re-edit the order of the scenes."

","Kill Bill Volume 2 continues off of Kill Bill Volume 1 (obviously), which I enjoyed quite a bit. Kill Bill Volume 2, however, is better if you ask me.<br/><br/>The movie is more focused on the story and development of who The Bride is, and how she ended up in her predicament. It's really interesting to see how it all went down, and that it was a lot 'smaller scale' than I originally thought. This actually confused me for a while, but it was really nice to get it all cleared up. The other characters are more delved into as well and that really adds to the movie. <br/><br/>Now with all this story and development you may think ""What about the action that the first movie did so well?"" Well, we got an even better fight scene in this one. Sure, the whole thing isn't completely consumed by action, unlike the first one, but the second installment still manages to throw in the best fight in the series and one of the best I've ever seen. <br/><br/>Bill and The Bride's relationship is brought into better light by the end, and I must say that I was impressed. It was a lot deeper than I originally thought, which was a really nice touch. <br/><br/>Overall, Kill Bill Volume 2 has the great fights that the first one did, but just with more development this time around. It's a great conclusion to the 2 part series. If you liked the first one, you'll like the second one. If your interested in the first one but decided to research the second one for some reason, then watch the first one and then watch the second. Their both great action movies that any action-lover needs to watch."
"jesusesque","7","0","2","8 December 2014"," Some Unsaid Critiques
","Reading old critics or new users, few are saying what I thought upon release and now, re-watching these. Only posting because of that. <br/><br/>1)the dialogue almost never coheres into the electric, fascinating rhythms of ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Reservoir Dogs."" This movie is more like ""Death Proof"": it often seems like a cheeky imitation of ""bad"" dialogue from genre movies Tarantino loves. There are actual cringe moments nobody dared tell uh, ""Q"" (cringe moment 1) made them cringe. The most ""Pulp Fiction""-like scene involves a strip-club owner yelling at a bouncer for being late. <br/><br/>2)The approach to dialogue and style nearly strangles the emotional film, whether it's a revenge drama or whatever it is. Tarantino's talent in his best movies clearly is utterly compelling episodic scenes, often grounded in a weird mix of references to real humanity and movie humanity. He's kind of chucked real humanity out the window here, and it hurts him. I don't quite see the throughline from ""Pulp Fiction"" to this, ""Kill Bill"" is trying something new, for better or worse. Often it's worse, as ""the Bride"" must carry the film, and her character motivations often get lost in the stylistic shuffle.<br/><br/>3)It's a revenge fantasy, but the sterility of the stylized reality and heightened Kung-fu world manage to strip vengeance of much meaning, reward or even coherence. Uma Thurman does a good job panting, looking hurt and crying, but she also frequently sits down and smiles and chit-chats. While contrasts between chit-chatting hit men and brutal killing were stunning in ""Pulp Fiction,"" in a film with a central protagonist fueled by (presumable) undying vengeance, these scenes undermine the character, and really undermine much emotional punch. <br/><br/>I think that's about it, most people (me included) mostly have positive stuff to say about the movie. There's fun, clever fights, brilliant use of music, much inspired stuff. But I think a mix of weak, possibly ""indulgent"" writing and tonal miscalculations make this clearly not a masterpiece. A tighter revenge-based action film might have been better, a more ""Tarantino"" (in the ""Pulp Fiction"") sense) ""realistic"" vengeance film might have been better. The two approaches don't sit in perfect harmony with one another."
"FairlyAnonymous","7","0","1","23 November 2014"," Not nearly as clever or entertaining as Vol. 1, but still good
","*LOTS OF SPOILERS AHEAD* Kill Bill Vol. 2 can either be regarded as ingenious for the way it does the opposite of the viewer's expectations or it can be considered mediocre-bad because it doesn't deliver anything as satisfying as the first film.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol. 2 is interesting in the fact that it has only ONE true action sequence, where as the rest of the movie is literally either flashbacks or dialogue. Yes. It is one of THOSE movies. This is where this movie's biggest problems start to show and it becomes obvious that these movies were meant to be shown as one movie and not to. Vol. 2, as a standalone film, is pretty boring and uninteresting because it is filled with flashbacks and subplots. It is really peculiar how many mini subplots are fit into this movie that really take away from what the main appeal of the first movie was. While the first movie dedicated 30 minutes or so into one action sequence (and about 10-15 minutes building up to it) this movie is mostly dialogue with one action sequence that lasts only a couple of minutes. Now this could work if the first movie wasn't a fast-paced martial arts movie, but it was... so you have Vol. 1 which is cheesy yet action-packed and then you have Vol. 2 which is mostly dialogue. Does this work?<br/><br/>What most people will say is that this works because you usually want a more serious tone for a climax and you want to dive more into your character and their back-story before you finish the movie. However, with this movie, that doesn't work because of a couple of reasons, but mostly one: 1) The dialogue isn't interesting 2) Bill isn't an interesting Villain. In the first movie we were lead to believe that Bill was going to be this intimidating villain with a lot of presence, but once we actually see him he starts to come off as a genuinely nice guy who is also a murderer. While this concept could work, the issue is that he still needs to have a presence on screen. Bill doesn't. There is nothing about him that is either intimidating, threatening, interesting, or overly unique. He is just plain. Him being plain may have been what Tarantino was going for, but it makes someone we do not care about. Do I care about Bill if he dies? No. Do I care if Bill is sad? No. Do I care if Bill is happy? No. So why should I care about him as a villain if he isn't interesting?<br/><br/>This mixed with very mediocre dialogue makes the final 30 minutes of the movie obnoxious. I loved Pulp Fiction and I am all for complex dialogue exchanges, but this finale simply doesn't give any interesting dialogue. A climax where rivals talk can work only if what they are saying is genuinely interesting or clever. Here, it isn't. So basically while the last 30 minutes of the last movie is all action, the last 30 minutes of this movie has an uninteresting villain who talks about uninteresting things for 30 minutes. Sounds like fun? It isn't.<br/><br/>I respect this movie for what it was trying to do, but I don't think it pulled it off well... at all. I think instead of the ending being a clever twist, it was more of a slap in the face. The fact that the movie tries to say that The Bride and someone old enough to be her father were in love is not only slightly unsettling, but it kind messes up the entire motivation of the story. If they really were in love and she did run away then she would've had to expect something. It kind of takes away the entire significance of her being... A BRIDE. The point was that she lost so much on her wedding rehearsal and that she is getting revenge for that. But when you realize she didn't really love the groom and didn't really care for any of the people that were murdered... it kind of breaks the entire motivation of the series. Basically, she SHOULD'VE known this was going to happen because in this movie it almost seems logical that her wedding rehearsal was logical. She literally runs away from her lover and gets married to some dude almost immediately (whom she doesn't really care for) and yet she doesn't expect her lover to get mad? <br/><br/>Lastly, the camera work in this movie is half that of the first movie. The first movie had beautiful cinematography, but this movie just feels standard. There are no open-top-set-shots, no crazy foot shots, and nothing much of note as far as camera work goes. Pretty standard.<br/><br/>All in all, Kill Bill Vol. 2 is good, but it isn't incredibly good. It takes away a lot of the charm of the first movie and replaces it with very uninteresting dialogue."

Where we saw her feet had to be the hardest.<br/><br/>I was expecting a lot more comedy, the way this was promoted. But what comedy there was I liked. Even if it was dark. Uma Thurman as her much younger self in school, for example.<br/><br/>Some great stunt work was done in one of the martial arts training scenes. Either that or CGI.<br/><br/>David Carradine also impressed.<br/><br/>While I didn't care for Daryl Hannah, I can't deny she was good. A long way from the type of character in ""Splash"" (which I liked far more).<br/><br/>Perla Haney-Jardine gave one of the best performances of all, really a delight as the 4-year-old daughter of Bill and Beatrix. And despite the nature of the movie, her first scenes were appropriate family viewing, should one want to watch just those, with the caution that in an age appropriate way, the girl is told her father shot her mother and that while pretend violence is not harmful, there is real violence that hurts.<br/><br/>An impressive effort. Just not my taste, for the most part."

","Beatrix Kiddo (Uma Thurman) is the bride. She tracks down Budd (Michael Madsen) but he takes her down first. He puts her in a coffin and buries her. Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) double crosses Budd and kills him. Beatrix manages to escape and finds Elle in Budd's trailer. They have a knock down fight. Afterwards the only one left is Bill (David Carradine). There are also flashbacks to the wedding rehearsal before the massacre and Beatrix's training with master Pai Mei.<br/><br/>It's slightly less compelling than part 1. Part 1 is bookended with 2 amazing fight scenes with lots of action in between. Part 2 really only has the great fight between Beatrix And Elle in its middle. The training segment is a bit of fun. The ending with Bill is somewhat a letdown. Quentin Tarantino should have realized that the girl is a great opportunity to subvert the traditional innocent girlie character. But that opportunity is lost here. The whole Last Chapter is a little too much talk and not enough action. Considering the first part ended with the big fight with O-Ren Ishii, this part ends with something less."

","To be fair almost all of Kill Bill 2 is a great movie, the only flaw is the ending, but oh what a flaw. The ending of Kill Bill 2 is equivalent to hiring the two greatest chefs alive putting them in fully stocked fully equipped kitchen with many fabulous ingredients to then pit these two master chefs against each other in some ultimate cook-off challenge, only to be settled by the two chefs calling take-out. Why build tension for a combat showdown climax of your movie if you then have your protagonist and antagonist talk it out? Maybe it's just me, maybe I'm the uncouth clod who thinks that when two opposing kung fu masters meet up at the end of a movie so as to settle an old score that those fighters should fight. I mean do you want to watch a porno where the big stud and the hot bimbo just talk things over and decide to just be friends? I do not understand."

It is more tender and internal. Quite the opposite of the external extremes of Vol 1. It is a satisfying wrap to the Director/Writer's Rap and should not be seen or examined apart from or out of sequence from the first half.<br/><br/>In the end it has a calming calamity and has a Personality of its own as there is a portrayal here of the other side, the Feminine side, if you will, as the Assassin/Lover/Bride/Mother comes full circle and returns to the Human Race.

","This film was good, but in my own eye it was not as good as the first film in the Kill Bill series. This fundamentally rested on the ending of the film being an anti climax as well as the fact that this film focused to heavily form answering questions from the first film, and so did not have as much action or storyline, instead it consisted mainly on flash backs. The flash backs were useful as to figuring out things about the 'bride' character, as well as showing more links between the assassin group. <br/><br/>Unlike the first film, most of the deaths in this film were disappointments as compared to the last film, they all were quick and there wasn't any of the intense fighting sequences that made most of the first film. Although music was integrated well into this film, I again feel that it was better in the first film, and that this film was more of a disappointment. The lack of more cartoon imagery used was again something that made this film look worse in comparison to the first film.<br/><br/>I only wish that more action had been put into this film, and more interesting shots to bring the film to life, especially in the flashbacks which were fairly frequent. My main problem with this film was the second half, as practically all action had ceased by then, and we just got pure mother issue with her daughter, this part was far to accentuated and although I enjoyed Bill as a character, I would have much preferred to see more of his so called amazing fighting skills.<br/><br/>Therefore all though this is a good film, it relies to much on the first film, and did not have nearly enough action, and that is the thing that would have made this film great."
"ujdur","6","0","3","19 August 2012"," Tarantino's worst = still a decent movie
","I am reviewing both the volume one and volume two with this review as Kill Bill was meant to be a one 4 hour long movie. So when I give it a 6 out of 10, I am judging both the volumes as a whole. First I will say that I am one of Tarantino's biggest fans, I watched all his movies, I look for Tarantino's interviews online, etc. I think Jackie Brown is a masterpiece, as is Pulp Fiction, as is Reservoir dogs. But Jackie Brown was met with mixed reviews, some fans thought the movie was too mild for Tarantino, some were disappointed. This most likely hurt Tarantino on a personal level, ergo after a long pause from movie making he delivers the Kill Bill(s), the most childish of all his works. That is right, no question that Tarantino enjoyed himself making the movies, and no question that he made what he wanted to make. But, I have a feeling he decided to bend over to the masses with this one. Everything to please. And the masses loved it, I loved it (when I was 16). Kill Bill is still a decent movie, and if someone else made it I'd have given it 7, 8 or 9. But Tarantino can do better, he should do better. Luckily, he made Inglorious basterds which carried a true message in it, delivered with skill of an artist. Now he is making Django unchained, a controversial movie that may break his career. That is what the artist has to do if he wants to call himself an artist. To conclude with what I think Kill Bill is about. It is Tarantino's fantasy of what it would be like if the Blondie was a female in a relationship with Lee van Cleef working together in a band of assassins. Pretty infantile. There is a deeper theme of how revenge is a sin, and who has the right to decide who lives or dies, and who is really clean and good (no one) and who is evil. But I think he did this theme better in his other works. I think the movie that inspired Tarantino, Death rides a horse, is a better movie than Kill Bill. Tarantino is a genius, I love him."

","When I tell people what my favorite movies is, my answer varies. One of the answers I will give them is Kill Bill, without saying Vol. 1 or Vol. 2. If you are a fan of the first movie (like myself) be warned: this is a completely different kind of movie! The first time I watched the movie, I did not enjoy it. The second time, I enjoyed it quite a lot. This movies contains long stretches of dialog, with only a few scenes of so called ""kung-fu action"" mixed in. This movie definitely gives us a more personal view of The Bride, and explains a lot of open-ended questions from Vol. 1. That being said, the movie does have some less than exciting parts. For example, every scene with Bud (in my opinion). Along with this, Beatrix and Bill's love story is less than desirable. Especially all of their attempts at killing each other (which, spoiler, she does in the end). It is kind of a sick love story meets a kung fu movie meets a dialog piece, but is an enjoyable watch in the end."
"toll-8","6","0","2","9 May 2012"," Claustrophobic and long winded
","Kill Bill Volume 2 isn't really a sequel. Granted it is called volume 2, but really it is one film that has been split into two. This volume is technically a complete follow on from the first one, so it is highly recommended to watch the first one and then possibly straight into this one. I didn't take on this recommendation so it took me a while to remember the pivotal points in the first one in order to catch up with the second. Do yourself a favour if you are planning on watching this film and watch the original first.<br/><br/>Volume 2 begins with the shoot out at the wedding chapel, where the Bride (Thurman) was left for dead by her former team of assassins. This is what sent her on the journey of killing all those involved in her betrayal. In the first one we see her destroying many who were involved and partaking in many huge fight sequences. In this volume we continue on with her journey, with the only three left to be killed; Budd (Madsen), Ellie (Hannah), and Bill (Carradine). Her first target is Budd, who has been warned by Bill that the Bride is on her way. Budd puts in a plan to stop her in her tracks and when his plan seems like it is working it is very disturbing. Basically he begins to bury her alive. Her next target is Ellie and obviously eventually Bill, the man who ultimately betrayed her. On route we see some flashbacks that tie up several plot holes of the first film, and to just why and how she became the big assassin that she is claimed to be.<br/><br/>I won't indulge too much into what happens. I'm sure you are all aware that she will plough through them and have her face to face with Bill but it is the way she gains her revenge that is the shock. There is not as much action and violence as there was in the first film but when the action does kick in it is riveting. The Bride and Ellie standoff in a fantastically choreographed fight sequence, and there are some nice touches when the Bride is taught her kung fu by her Master, all pays homage to old school kung fu movies.<br/><br/>As well as having action, I also found this film slightly scary. Sounds weird as it isn't a horror, but there are moments that are quite frightening. Claustrophobia is brought to the max here and that is what is scary. At one point the Bride is buried alive and her reactions make you believe you're in there with her, which would make it even more claustrophobic. The sweat dripping off her head helps you feel the heat she is also feeling. Tarantino does a great job of highlighting all this by using minimal light and some tense camera angles. This scene is uncomfortable. Also there is a scene with a poisonous snake which jumps out at you. This is frightening to me as I hate snakes. Watching it slither across the floor and attack helpless victims really spooked me out. The final scary moment is one that will make you grimace. A fight scene culminates in an eyes being gauged out. This also feels claustrophobic as you can just imagine the pitch blackness this person has been plunged into. To me this was horrific. It isn't supposed to be scary but I found it to be at certain points.<br/><br/>As I can't really remember the first one I am struggling to really decide on how good this film is. It is alright at times but at other times it becomes slow and has a lot of talking and telling us what is going on. This though is typical Tarantino and a lot of his films do have much time given to character's talking. Not that this is a problem but at times it causes me to drift out of the film. Much of it kept me on the edge of my seat but other parts I lost a little interest.<br/><br/>The acting is good in the film, Carradine is excellent as Bill, and Thurman, as well as looking gorgeous, really brings the character to life. The plot is over strung but the acting and camera work help you to ignore this. This is a typical Tarantino film and if you love him this will be a big deal, if you don't then it will probably just be average.<br/><br/>3 / 5<br/><br/>For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com"
"cadademon","4","0","2","23 March 2011"," Tarantino thought people wanted to see how the story unfolds and not better action. WRONG
","The Kill Bill movies are supposed to be silly and over the top. I get that, and I in some way applaud them for not being serious and going past rules other movies try so hard to follow. After watching Kill Bill 1, I was pretty happy with the movie. It was, well, silly and over the top with a very entertaining action scene. I don't think 2/3 of the movie should have been about trying to kill that Asian chick but whatever. Speaking of which, how come nobody else got a big animated back story? Like Bill's brother could have had a cool back story animated in some kind of western fashion... but whatever. So even tho Kill Bill 1 was silly it was still a fun movie and I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>But what the poop is up with Volume 2? I didn't give a darn and a half for the revenge story and none of the action was even half believable. The first one was far fetched too, but come on. Punching your way out of a coffin? Getting shot in the gut and never acknowledge any signs of pain for the rest of the movie? The 5 finger death poke? Now this would all be OK if there was any fun action scenes to go along with it, but dang, the whole thing is them sitting around talking as if Tarantino thought people actually cared about the story. Which was stupid, but hey. It gave a good reason for a bunch of guys to be thrown around a room in the first one. But if you really cared about the story for some dumb reason then by all means go ahead and watch it. But if you hope that the movie is as cool as the first one then you are in for a disappointment. A boring piece of crap."

However, something has thrown off her plans a bit. <br/><br/>Her daughter (whom she was pregnant with as she was getting married) is still alive. <br/><br/>What effect this will have on her quest for vengeance is unclear, but the question is, will The Bride have actually succeeded in completing her ultimate goal, to kill Bill?..<br/><br/>The second part of this huge movie, isn't as good as the first chapter, we've had all the introductions to The Bride and now we know she is down to the last three. This is more of a western, and spends a lot of time set in a sandy location.<br/><br/>Carradine is superb, he is almost the coolest character Taratino has ever invented, and carradines delivery of the lines are like chocolate to the ears.<br/><br/>Tarantinos direction keeps the film flowing smoothly, and proves he is still one of the best directors out there. The soundtrack is cool stuff too, on a par with the first volume.<br/><br/>This is by no means a boring dull movie, but compared to volume 1, it just loses it a bit."
"jusco15","7","0","1","24 December 2010"," jusco's review: Kill Bill: Vol. 2
","Was I satisfied with the finale of Tarantino's epic 4-hour Kill Bill (I combine Vol. 1 and 2 because you can't watch one volume and not watch the other; it's the same as watching just half of any film)? Yes. Did Vol. 2 reach the high standards set by Vol. 1? Not quite, but nevertheless it was still entertaining. Immediately, you'll realise that there is more talking and less action than in the first volume. Several things happen: The Bride deals with the final two assassins, a flashback of her martial arts training with a Chinese master is shown and we finally get to see Bill (his face was unrevealed in the first volume).<br/><br/>The pace significantly slowed down in comparison to its predecessor but it does relatively manage to maintain the suspense just enough to keep us riveted. A long-drawn flashback to the events that occurred in The Bride's wedding chapel was much too lengthy for its own good and unnecessary. The Bride's interaction with the last two assassins felt a bit disappointing. This time, it is China and its martial arts that provide the bulk of homages in the film (the first volume being Japan), presenting Pai Mei, the legendary master who teaches The Bride.<br/><br/>But it is David Carradine that shines as Bill. My first impression of his performance as the titular character was that it felt much too unnatural, too over-acted. But overtime, I came to accept that it was unusually fitting of the ruthless nature unique to his particular character. The way he talks, every move he makes seems perfectly calculated. We come to understand why people fear him. Bill is deadly, make no mistake.<br/><br/>Though not as commendable as Vol. 1, Vol. 2 brings sufficient closure to one of Tarantino's greatest films. It was an exceptional ride and you can only feel happy for The Bride at the end. People ask what's the point of this film; but then again, our world craves senseless violence, so I think I can confidently state the reason why this film is so popular is because there are a lot of people out there entertained by excessive violence. The threatening consequences of our dying morals is a topic for another time. I suspect this full-length feature inclusive of Vol. 1 and 2 was made for the sole intention of gratifying Tarantino's infatuation to create something that is just shocking and purely violent. Talk about intense self-indulgence. But if we were ultimately entertained, I guess that can be pardoned."

","Yes I am aware that these two films were originally supposed to be one film, but got split up. That still makes Vol. 2 a sequel, and it's one of those sequels that is better than the first.<br/><br/>I liked the first Kill Bill, it was entertaining, thrilling, graphic, gory, and there were no gigantic plot holes, at least none that I saw. But it just wasn't my kind of movie, and this one kind of falls under the same category. With that said, I still like this movie more than the first.<br/><br/>The movie follows the Bride, who has already knocked two people off her death list, with only 3 more to go. She tracks them down, kills, or blinds, one of them, after she already killed the fourth. So know she off to destroy the main man, Bill. But when she gets there, she meets someone that makes it much harder for the bride.<br/><br/>Kill bill volume 2 is a good movie, and one I will probably watch again sometime in the future, along with the first one.

"atlihafsteinsson","9","0","2","2 October 2010"," A good film at its heart, too overblown and misproportioned for its own good
","Granted, Kill Bill vol. 1 was a tough act to follow. Considering that the two films were meant to be one big film, I was rather taken aback when I finally saw Vol. 2. I enjoyed it. There is lots to like about it, certainly. Unfortunately, it has its pretty glaring flaws to match.<br/><br/>The cinematography of the movie is pretty impressive, as is the set-up. The camera angles and staging all work very well. The coffin scene is quite difficult to watch, B/W to perhaps subtly accentuate the Bride's feelings, not so unlike those she felt at the chapel. The introduction, with all the people in the chapel, makes the viewer generally afraid for them, because we know what will happen to them, in just a few minutes time.<br/><br/>The acting is also very good, and the characters are given good room to breathe (perhaps too much room but bear with me). Uma Thurman is still fantastic in the leading role. We delve a little beneath her icy, broken exterior of the first movie and get a good look at this troubled individual. Sometimes, it's hard to remember that she's even on a bloody quest of revenge. David Carradine is compelling as her yang, Bill, someone who also makes us forget that he is, in his own words, ""a murdering bastard"". Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver, finally appearing after the appetiser of Vol. 1, is wickedly chilling and at the same time hilarious. Even with her, it gets hard to remind yourself that this woman is a heartless, vile being. Michaels Madsen and Parks give good, laid-back performances as well.<br/><br/>What bothers me about Kill Bill volume 2 is the same thing that bothers most people - it is such a different film from Volume 1 to make it feel rather flat by comparison. Most of the satisfaction we expected to feel after seeing Volume 1 is not handed out. Both Budd's and Elle's demises, albeit pleasantly and freshly unexpected, feel totally contradictory to the element of this as a revenge flick. There are a lot of scenes that have no significance to the plot. The whole bar scene could totally have been cut out; Bill's and Elle's scenes with Budd were enough to register the character to the audience. A lot of the dialogue really could have been shortened. I know that Tarantino likes to have his characters talk about stuff that really is irrelevant to the plot, and that he likes to homage past movies. All the same, a film has to be able to stand on its own. If its only level of engagement is that it shows film buffs references, that's alienating the involvement of a large number of prospective audiences.<br/><br/>It would be cruel of me to accuse KB2 of having no substance, though. There are themes of moral dilemma and unsuccessfully trying to flee who you are. Uma Thurman really goes all out with her character and turns in one of the finest performances of her career. The flashback scene with her (douchebag) master Pai Mei are entertaining and fill a large gap in the void of her backstory. It's just a shame that the albeit furious fight scene with Elle follows, where the Bride seems barely able to keep up (and this being the same woman we saw walk over everyone in her way in the last film). True, she's not exactly in an advantageous position. There is a general theme of smarts prevailing over brawn, as well as symbolism about just what revenge is.<br/><br/>For me, though, and for many people, this just really wasn't the conclusion the first film had been building forward to. KB2 is a good film at its heart, but it's rather overblown and could easily have been trimmed down to simply have the meat. We don't even see the Death List, which was so symbolic for the first film. Even the excellent confrontation with Elle can't save the overall impression of the film. In conclusion, I was expecting a closure to the same story, not what felt like the closure to an entirely different story."

Here we get the ""why"" to go with Volume 1's, ""how"".<br/><br/>The Bride shows the human part of her self, and this results in a plethora of very human moments. Vol. 1 was about style and imagery, Vol. 2 is gritty and brutal. The hateful jealousy of Elle and Bud's cunning familiarity, offer stark counter-points to the indifferent Vernita and O-Ren's detachment. In Volume 1, Beatrix battled those who only hurt her because it was their job. In Volume 2, she confronts those who had a much more personal stake in her tragic past.<br/><br/>Despite the considerable changes in tone between the two volumes, the themes remain consistent. I prefer the first volume more, but the second volume is even more important to the overall story arc. There are still great fights, excellent music, and wonderful writing (the Pai-Mei scenes are some of my favorites from any movie, period), but don't expect a direct continuation of Volume 1's style.

","While relying on and ""lending"" from his vast collection of samurai movies, Tarantino may just have made the ultimate revenge flick. It's almost five hours long, but it still feels as if it flashes by. The fight scenes in this movie are downright unbelievable, great choreography and exillerating cartoon gore. The omnipresent music just tops them of, some brilliant musical choices there. Tarantino's touch is unmistakable, especially the Pai Mei sequences have his name written all over them. The Five Pointed Palm Exploding Heart Technique, the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, he sure had his fun with this project. Some people didn't like the final showdown, and it wasn't what I had expected either, but it's still a great conclusion. To me it was the perfect way to end the story, a climax rather than an anti-climax. ""Kill Bill"" is a wonderous journey through the samurai genre."

The soundtrack is slightly different as Robert Rodriguez scored the film but it doesn't feel out of place at all nor does it interfere with the flow of the movie. 'Vol 2' clearly is longer than 'Vol 1' but the story and the characters are further developed. The backstory adds more heart and substance to the film. This time Michael Madsen, Darryl Hannah, Chia Hui Liu and Keith Carradine have more to do and their performances are just as solid as the rest of the cast. Uma Thurman is just as fiery and energetic as in 'Vol. 1' and she has no problem carrying the film.

","Honestly, I wasn't anticipating Kill Bill Vol. 2 to be better than Vol. 1. In fact, I thought I would be bored since I already knew Tarantino generally cuts back on the action and ups the dialogue in the second half of his story lines.<br/><br/>Of course, I had to see the finale of the seriesso far. (Again, I'm not looking forward to a Vol. 3 – spoiler alert, I don't want to see ""The Bride"" die, like the future setup movie it's sounds like it might be.) I was NOT disappointed. In fact, Vol. 2 is actually better.<br/><br/>While Thurman still does an excellent job – her best performance (EVER) was in Vol. 1-2, everyone else stepped up their game. Madsen, as always, was great and Hannah was perfect. Even (new to the series, character) Esteban (Parks) was wonderful. But the scene-stealer award goes to the late Carradine, God rest his soul. Honestly, as many things that were masterful about this movie, he was worth the entire admission price.<br/><br/>Plot line: ""The Bride"" continues down her revenge path and continues to get knocked down in the process. Way down, like 6-feet-under, literally in one scene.<br/><br/>More background is revealed, as well as more subplots. And the obvious final confrontation with Bill and her daughter – no spoiler, since that was foretold in Vol. 1.<br/><br/>While the action is cut down in Vol. 2, the plot, dialogue, suspense and plot moves forward in fast-motion. Tarantino again delivers, but this time, 2-fold. And with the finale speech from Carradine, it ends on a perfect note. (It helps I'm a huge Superman fan.) Not to be redundant from my Vol. 1 review, again, everything works in this movie: Music, score, style, acting, originality, suspense, action, cinematography and dialogue.

The lush scenery is absolutely amazing. And you also get a real mystical sense that anything is possible (taking into account the kung fu aspect of it, which is learned and practiced by the Bride). There's a real spooky element to various aspects of the film, and the film really succeeds in drawing the viewer into its story. There is also a vague feeling that this movie is about a decade ahead of its time in terms of artistry in general, and especially of independent films.

","Many fans wonder why Volume I and Volume II weren't compacted into one big movie. After seeing this, I realize why. The tone of the movies are so different from each other. There is way less cinematic sampling in this volume and more focus on dialogue and character development. The audience is asked to deepen their care for the characters. So many of the questions that the audience wondered about in the first volume are answered here. We learn about how Beatrix ""The Bride"" Kiddo fell for a nice, record store working loser. She did it because she wanted her daughter to start with a clean slate. <br/><br/>We learn that his daughter is still alive, and we learn why Bill wanted to kill his former girlfriend. In the film, a story called ""The Legend of Pai Mai"" is told from Bill to the Bride when they are dating. It's about a woman who didn't recognize her husband's graciousness and left him, and he tried to kill her but failed, and she got revenge. That was an interesting metaphor for the movie as a whole. Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) is a sick, twisted, wicked dog but makes for a kickass character, and the music towards the end evokes many strange emotions. But most of all, there's a happy ending (The lioness and cub reunite!)"

","Kill Bill vol. 2 is the uninteresting continuation of the uninteresting Kill Bill.<br/><br/>Although the characters continue to live their paper-thin existences, and the dialogue continues to be more cool than interesting, the viewer has the pleasure of finally enjoying David Carradine's performance as Bill, the only actual interesting character in this two-volume epic of superficiality.<br/><br/>Although his role is short, Bill is one of those characters that suggests an entire life outside the action we're watching on the screen, and I couldn't help wishing I saw more about his life than The Bride's repetitive revenge.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the movie offers nothing new. I will give Tarantino credit, however, for having introduced me to some new Ennio Morricone scores. Since this man can't even be bothered to hire composers to compose original scores, he may as well steal the best music around, and no one is better than Morricone. During the movie I was more excited whenever I heard a new track by Morricone than anything I actually saw.<br/><br/>So for widening my musical horizons a bit more, and for giving me Bill at last, I rate this movie slightly above the first volume. But it's still an uninteresting piece of cinema."

","Kill Bill Vol. 2 is an even better film than the original. Now that sort of thing is hard to come by. Because the first film was already fantastic enough. Kill Bill vol. 2 is an even better sequel that explains stuff that they didn't explain in Vol. 1. All you know is that in Vol. 1 The Bride(Uma Thurman) was getting married and Bill, her former lover sent the group of assassins that she used to be a part of to kill her. Her former lover Bill put a bullet in her head. Four years later, she comes out of the coma to kill him and the assassins. That was what the original film was about. The sequel goes a little into it though. I think that the film's ending was right, though I would've preferred it another way. I like David Carradine as Bill, and he deserved a nomination. Kill Bill Vol. 2 is probably my favorite film of 2004. The thing about some of Quentin Tarentino's films is that when something really crazy happens that you just laugh. Like, in this film when The Bride is fighting Elle Driver, she rips out her eye. I laughed at that part because it's insane. I loved kill Bill vol. 2 and I give it a huge thumbs up. It's not like you have to see the original to see this film. They tell you pretty much what happens. You can just watch it for the sake of watching it and you'll love it. The Bride gets into so many situations in the film that I could understand and would be afraid of. I loved Kill Bill Vol. 2.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol. 2: ****/**** The Plot: In the second and final part of the Kill Bill films, The Bride continues her search for Bill, the man who ordered an attack on her in the original. She has already crossed two assassins off of her list. All she has left is Bill's brother Bud, Elle Driver, Bill's recent lover, and Bill himself."

","I am definitely not a fan of Quentin Tarantino. The only films of his that I have seen are the two in the Kill Bill series. I was interested in seeing them primarily because Uma Thurman and David Carradine (in the second one) were the leads, with an interesting supporting cast.<br/><br/>This second film in the series is not nearly as bloody and violent as the first, although there is plenty of both. The dialog between David Carradine and Uma Thurman at the end of the movie is fascinating, a complete departure from the action leading up to it. Carradine's performance is as excellent as Thurman's. As in the first, the selections of music are very interesting, fitting the different segments well, but also representing odd choices. I was most surprised by the very end of the film, which neatly tied up all the loose ends and had a storybook finish. This was not what I expected from Tarantino. It was a pleasant surprise."

There is much more dialogs than in the first part and some other scenes which reminded me of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. The scene where The Bride was buried alive was kinda creepy. I also liked the training scene. It reminded me of all those classic Kung Fu films I've seen. When I watched the first part I couldn't decide which character of Kill Bill is my favorite, but now I know it's Budd (Michael Madsen). I liked the way he talked that they deserve to die and The Bride deserve to get her revenge on them but she also deserve to die too. The second my favorite character was Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah).

"Cosmoeticadotcom","6","0","1","25 September 2008"," So-so
","Despite what many have said about KB2 being better it's not. It's an OK film that narratively stands on its own, but shows the utter superfluity of KB1, which could have had its backstory sliced to a 6 or 7 minute prologue. KB2 opens with the Bride ready to take on Bill's own baby brother- the 3rd member of the Assassins, Budd (Michael Madsen). After stalking him to his trailer home he blows her away with a buckshot of salt. Why he does not kill her with regular bullets is a silly question since this is comic book logic. Additionally, he offers to turn over the Bride's body to Bill's last assassin for $1 million. She's another blonde killer femme, Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), who is missing an eye & wears a patch. Cue classic 1930s serial film villain stupidity: Budd buries the Bride alive. He even gives her a flashlight in her nailed coffin. Flashback: to her training under misogynistic Chinese Kung Fu master Pai Mei (Gordon Liu). This is needless digression because the stereotyped character- similar to KB1's involving the Bride's training with master swordmaker Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba)- adds nothing to the tale that could not have been added in a few casual throwaway references in the script.<br/><br/>Length is also a big problem. The 2 films run 226 minutes, or just a quarter hour shy of 4 hours. They were originally to be a single entity but, having had so few films from Tarantino over the years his company wanted to double the bang for the buck. Thus the mishmash editing. Individual scenes are expertly paced and woven, but there are just reams of scenes that do not advance the essential shark-like plot. This is not just taste speaking- too many scenes with trivial but wannabe colorful characters grind the film to a snail's pace. Trim the 90 minutes of KB1 down to 20 or 30 minutes of action, trim the 136 minutes of the plodding KB2 in half & you would've had a very good 90-100 minute film with all the excellent action and revelatory scenes intact. The KB films are a triumph of box office greed and marketing over potentially good art (-cum-self-indulgent pointlessness). Another thing gained by making the films one would be that the teaser at the end of KB1, where we find out Beatrix has a daughter, could be cut and that revelation unfold to both character and audience when she actually confronts Bill. Not that the emotion would have overwhelmed, but knowing this fact about Beatrix before she does castrates whatever empathy we might feel for her near the film's climax.<br/><br/>That Tarantino did not see these points, or did but gave in to them, seems to support my belief that he has yet to show the maturity of a great director. He seemed to be going in the right direction with Jackie Brown (easily his best & most mature film) but has regressed with the 2 Kill Bills. Of KB2 I'd grade it 65 of 100, & for the duo of films I'd give it a 75. I hope I'm wrong, but he seems destined, and satisfied, to be merely an A director of B films."
"dave_wlogan","10","0","1","17 July 2008"," Not lacking in action but great character development
","I thought Kill Bill Vol. 2 would be just like Vol. 1 but i was wrong. Despite the first film being a classic, this is what Vol. 2 needed. Tarantino films are all meant to provide something different to audiences with each film. Vol. 1 gave us the great blood bath Tarantino film, in truth like all his films its a homage film, and Vol. 2 gives us a chance to see inside the minds of the masochistic characters. The best of which I think is Budd (Madsen) who portrays a remorseful assassin who has given up the high paying world of killing to live alone and work at a titty bar. Bill (Caradine) is a killer with only one regret, shooting the Bride (Thurman). But the more interesting thing about Bill is that he accepts who he is and tells others to accept who they are. Elle Driver (Hannah) gives us the most bad-ass female to grace the screen ever. Elle is completely cold to all but Bill which makes for some interesting altercations with other characters. The Bride's character is explained and some others are introduced such as Pai Mei (Lu) who is the one of the Brides most influential mentors. This film isn't deprived of action. Elle vs the Bride has plenty of that but there is no denying that this film is a homage to revenge movies and even spaghetti westerns to a degree. An exceptional and more dialogue/character orientated sequel."
"The_Void","7","0","1","12 July 2008"," Tarantino enters Spaghetti Western mode
","The first part to Quentin Tarantino's overly violent and exploitative revenge epic was a love letter addressed to Japanese Pink films and Kung Fu flicks. This second part is his homage to Spaghetti Westerns. The main difference between the styles of the two films is the pace - while the original was fast and furious, this one is a much more thoughtful and drawn out affair and while that may intrigue some viewers more; I have to say that Volume 1 did more for me. Still, it's quite clear Tarantino surely knows how to make a bona fide cult film and thoroughly entertain his audience on the way - and this film succeeds in doing that admirably. The plot is very simple and follows on directly from the first film. Having ticked off the first two names from her 'death list', The Bride now closes in on the final three killers that ruined her wedding day - Budd, Ellie Driver and of course, Bill himself. The film follows The Bride as she tracks down the killers, also filling us in further on the story of the revenge and her relationship with Bill.<br/><br/>The key to this film's success is really very simple - colourful characters and sharp dialogue. I have to be honest and say that I found the script for Kill Bill Volume 2 to be weaker than some of his previous efforts with much of the dialogue coming off as being extremely forced - but this is a comic book thrill ride at it's best and the characters themselves shine all the way through. As mentioned previously, the film is much slower than the first one, although there's plenty going on and the first hour and twenty minutes is a constant thrill ride complete with menacing characters and grisly situations (though nothing to rival the amazing climax to Volume 1). Of course, the entire two part epic is a build up to the central character carrying out the title's statement and Tarantino really had a lot of promise to deliver on with the ending. Anyone hoping for a spectacular face off (me for example) will be extremely disappointed, however. David Carradine does get lots of opportunities to justify his place in the film - he's by far the most natural actor in terms of how he delivers his dialogue and Tarantino rewards this by giving him plenty of interesting things to say; but the final showdown is over far too quickly. The film has other problems too; the biggest being some very silly and difficult to believe sequences (such as the flashback during The Bride's talk with Bill) that bring it down a little, but in spite of that; this is still a very good cult film that should not disappoint too many people that loved Volume 1."
"Stampsfightclub","7","0","1","6 July 2008"," muddled and not as quick and intense as Vol1
","In the follow up to the widely successful Volume 1, Uma Thurman reprises her role as the Bride who continues to search for the remaining members of Bill's group.<br/><br/>Tarantino (Pulp Fiction) had set the bench mark with the first instalment, a sharp, exciting and devastating film about a woman who loses everything and is out for revenge, and because the first film was practically perfect apart from a few faults, this sequel wasn't really going to challenge the first. Nevertheless it is a gripping and exciting watch.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman (Dangerous Liaisons) again excels in her central role as The Bride, with a strong determination on her mind to finally get full revenge for everything Bill has done to her, and in perhaps the best role of her career apart from Pulp Fiction, Thurman really steals the light in both films with a cutting devilish performance that does her character true justice. With a steely attitude and an emotional life troubling her, the Bride is given the depth and attention by Thurman to make the character an icon in the crime genre.<br/><br/>As with the first volume, Tarantino directs in a vibrant way, some scenes in black and white, stories told at different times, flashbacks, fantasises to give the film a very unique approach and something which I had never seen before. The first instalment was certainly better directed and with a wider choice of styles including animations but still there are some true iconic scenes, none more so than the coffin scene, the most uncomfortable scene ever created in such a unique way.<br/><br/>Despite the excellent direction and acting, the plot really lacks in comparison. The formula behind the first was more basic with fewer strings attached and there was a clear intention to where the film wanted to go. With the follow up, flashbacks and other stories seem more muddled and over the place, but still interesting. There are a few scary scenes, with snakes, coffins and surprises used to conform to the thriller genre.<br/><br/>Again, well directed with great acting and characters but it lacks the intensity and consistency that the first one had without even trying."
"hnt_dnl","7","0","1","21 May 2008"," Good sequel, but not quite there!
","KILL BILL, VOL.2 is a solid Tarantino offering, but having seen it several times, I still prefer KILL BILL, VOL.1. VOL. 1 literally cuts to the chase and although it had no character background and appeared plot less, it accomplished more with very little than VOL.2 did with a lot! And the LOT was a LOT of dialogue, a LOT of exposition, and a LOT of explanation! Trying to explain and justify everything and talk the viewer to death is not always a good thing. I'd seen Tarantino do the talkative stuff in PULP FICTION, which was brilliantly done. But KILL BILL VOL.2 is simply a retread, rather than being highly original.<br/><br/>I do think I understand why Tarantino did it differently from VOL. 1. I mean, if he repeats VOL.1, then he essentially presents more of the same, a plot less, action-oriented, bloodfest. But on it's own, VOL.1 is just a great film experience and even with it's open ending, I didn't care about a sequel. Ironically, I was not just enthralled by VOL.1 because of the great action, music, and swordplay, but also felt VOL.1 DID have its emotional, powerful moments, such as The Bride reacting to losing her baby, the Hattori Hanzo scenes, ORen's anime backstory, and The Bride and O'Ren's obvious emotional ties to each other. <br/><br/>VOL.2 continues the story of The Bride from VOL.1. Now we find out WHY she needs revenge on Bill and her former Deadly Viper Assassination Squad cronies. We finally meet and see Bill (David Carradine in the best performance of this film). Bill is the main reason that I really like this film. His character is world-weary, wise, and calm, yet at his heart he is spiteful, sad, and angry. I found myself completely focused on his character during the opening wedding rehearsal scene. Soon after Bill and The Bride's reunion, he has the squad massacre the wedding party, as we saw the result of this carnage in VOL.1.<br/><br/>Soon after we meet Bill's brother Budd (played by Michael Madsen in a really convincing performance). Budd is completely a broken man now, with a dead end job living in a trailer out in the middle of the desert. Bill warns Budd the The Bride is out to kill the squad and tells of how she did in O'Ren Ishii and her army in VOL. 1. Budd doesn't seem to care. When The Bride confronts him, Budd actually gains the upper hand and buries her alive.<br/><br/>During her burial, The Bride flashes back to when Bill put her under the tutelage of the great martial arts master Pai Mei. These are among the best scenes of VOL.2, a retro homage to those Bruce Li 70s martial arts flicks. It explains how The Bride learned her moves she used so effectively in VOL.1. She uses a technique she learned from Pai Mei to escape her grave that Budd put her in.<br/><br/>Soon after we meet one-eyed Elle Driver (Darryl Hannah in a really juicy role). Elle hates The Bride with a passion, mostly due to jealousy of her skills and her relationship with Bill. Budd has stolen The Bride's Hanzo sword (which Hattori Hanzo made for her in VOL.1) and is going to sell to Elle for one million dollars. Elle backstabs Budd by putting a deadly snake in the case containing the money. As Elle leaves Budd's trailer, she and The Bride have the big showdown. A really gritty fight scene, the polar opposite of the stylish presentation in VOL.1. We find out how Elle lost her eye and the end of the scene is kind of ironic, yet appropriate.<br/><br/>The Bride seeks out Bill for her final vengeance in Mexico. I really disliked the scene where she finds one of Bill's old mentors to track him down. It seemed so unnecessary and it was a really odd scene. I disliked the strip club scene where Budd was demoralized by his boss, too. I found these smaller characters to add nothing to the film and detract from the strong main characters. I really disliked The Bride's soon-and-never-to-be husband at the beginning of the film; he annoyed the heck out of me and her friends weren't much better. I just couldn't buy into the fact that a woman like The Bride would even be associated with people like this, even in her attempt at a new life away from being an assassin.<br/><br/>I still think VOL.2 has it merits, especially in the interactions amongst The Bride (whose name we learn in VOL.2) and Bill, Budd, and Elle. Their work really makes you believe these people have known each other for years and fallen out of favor with each other. The dialogue rambles on a bit much and meanders nowhere at times, especially with the supporting characters. Also, even though The Bride had a much tougher time conquering her final enemies in VOL.2, everything seemed strangely too ""neat"". Tarantino aimed more for realism, but didn't do a great job of making things ""realistic"". And you kind of have to do that with a film like this."

","After a bloody good time in Vol. 1 watching Uma Thurman slice of body parts left and right, Quentin Tarantino settles down to give us more story and heart as he finishes the tale of the Bride's revenge against all who betrayed her. While the first part was an homage to kung fu and samurai movies, there are more elements of spaghetti westerns here as well as swordplay. Still, the story is so captivating and miraculous that you get swept in and forget about everything else. Here, we have significantly less action, more impeccable dialogue, and we begin to connect with some of the characters, especially the Bride and Bill. It helps to have good actors and Tarantino has an amazing cast. Thurman carried the first film and is just as good here, but David Carradine as Bill really struck me as how passive yet brutal he could be. It really is a fine piece of acting. Here, we see the sentimental Tarantino, one not really popular with some but I love it. Here, Tarantino gives us situations and events that trigger different emotions and we feel for all these characters. This in my mind makes Vol. 2 a better film than Vol. 1, but really it is all one movie. So, be sure to watch this incredible story of betrayal, vengeance, love, hatred, and of course that impeccable dialogue. You'll be glad you did."

","I saw Volume 1 a while ago on TV, and enjoyed it. It was cinematographically inventive - eg the animated sequence. It had visually arresting and impressively choreographed fight scenes. And it had dark humour in the dialogue. So when I saw that Volume 2 was showing, I thought I was in for an entertaining couple of hours. I was wrong.<br/><br/>There was none of the stylishness. Shooting one chapter in monochrome does not make for an interesting technique. The dialogue showed only brief flashes of the dark humour that leavened Volume 1, but for the most part was stodgy and leaden. As others have commented, quite a few of the scenes served no purpose whatsoever - they were not entertaining, they did not develop the characters, they did not advance the plot.<br/><br/>As for the fight scenes - well, there were none. At least, none of the impressive ensemble scenes from the first volume. There were just two fights in the whole two hours. The first, with Elle, was not even a fight to the death, although I admit I did find the resolution of that one OK. But it was short and decidedly lacking in actual fighting.<br/><br/>The second, the final climactic confrontation with Bill, must be a contender for the biggest anti-climax in cinema history. It lasted a matter of seconds, and was resolved by a bit of mystical mojo. And to get there we had to sit through about half an hour of the Bride and Bill playing Happy Families and then reminiscing about what went wrong in their relationship.<br/><br/>Others have commented on the inherent misogyny in these films. I didn't get that with Volume 1 - it was too ""cartoony"" for that. It came through very much in Volume 2. Lingering shots of the Bride panting in agony or terror. Bud and his friend salivating over how they were going to kill her. And the ultimate in the idea of a wrinkly ancient like Bill with a young beauty like the Bride.<br/><br/>But the film's bigger sin was in being boring. Several times I found myself reaching for the remote to fast forward. It just could not hold the interest.<br/><br/>It is not the worst film ever. That honour is reserved for 2001 - A Space Odyssey. Now that is two hours of my life that I really want back. But it was a real disappointment, and hard to believe that it is part of the same project as the inventive and stylish Volume 1."

The body count drops dramatically and the plot is stepped up, making this the meat if the first film was the dessert.<br/><br/>When I saw this film the first time, I was really put off by it. With so much action in the first movie, I figured the same would happen in the second. But instead I was given a slow, steady series of conversations. And this just made me upset. Films don't work this way! You lay down the plot and then build up to a bloody climax -- you don't massacre people and then nap for two hours.<br/><br/>But upon my second viewing, I felt more okay with this when I realized that the idea was to give these final characters more depth and that in some ways made it a stronger film. While some conversations go on for too long (Bill's Superman analogy was interesting, but didn't need another fifteen minutes afterward), some are also very nice.<br/><br/>Also, I originally was opposed to Michael Madsen's character (Budd) because to me Madsen is best when he plays ruthless killing machines (""Reservoir Dogs"", for example). But on the second viewing, I saw the beauty of his character. He is actually more complex, wrestling with sibling issues and at the same time being the only one who seems to have a sense of honor: he knows The Bride deserves revenge while everyone else denies her this. And while he is now a slobbish drunk, at the same time he has turned away from a life of violence. His story would be fascinating.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill"" as a whole seems like a divider for Tarantino fans. Some people like or hate him altogether (I generally like him). But you will also find those who love ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" (and maybe ""Jackie Brown"" to some degree) but will detest ""Kill Bill"" for whatever reason. Is it the kung fu versus crime themes? I don't know. But that makes these two films Tarantino's most disliked movies, despite also being critically probably some of his best.<br/><br/>Obviously, David Carradine is a great actor for this role, and Uma Thurman (although I am not a fan) works well with Tarantino's style. Daryl Hannah does well, and I am especially pleased with the portrayal of Pai Mei. You're probably not watching part two unless you saw part one (but who knows?) and if you like part one, why wouldn't you watch part two? So a recommendation one way or the other is really not important. But I say go for it, even if you doubted the first part. I think the second takes more patience, but maybe you're the type who appreciates substance over action."

Unfortunately, the serious drama side isn't as convincing and successful as the light and stylish fighting side is in these movies.<br/><br/>The film is divided in five different chapters. Whereas the first volume was more or less linear in its storytelling, this time around the chapters are much more disjointed from each other. The flashbacks don't fit into the flow of the movie smoothly. The plot in itself is a very simple revenge story and I guess what most consider the main treats in the movie are the dialogue and the explosive albeit short action sequences. Well, the dialogue isn't the most typical one you hear in movies but it also often feels forced. The plot is full of absurd moments and sometimes those moments feel a little too self-pretentious.<br/><br/>The use of music, the absurd plot and some over the top characters...it's all intriguing to watch but it still is mainly just eye-candy. The substance in the story just isn't there. Even though this volume spends much more time evolving Uma Thurman's character it actually is a disservice to the film because I don't feel related to the character any more than in the beginning of the movie, as a matter of fact the exact opposite. The pain was much more touching in the first volume. In this volume many scenes are too long and and serve little purpose to actually explain the motives of main characters. The dialogue is supposed to be witty, I guess, but mostly it is either too simple and repetitive or tries to be funny a little too obviously.<br/><br/>I'm not saying the movie is completely bad, far from it. The style of the movie is still fascinating and the basic plot is OK in all its simplicity. Some of the acting is excellent (Carradine as Bill and Madsen as Budd especially) although Thurman's character loses a lot of its appeal. It might be due to some odd writing (the sequence where she's meeting Pai Mei is not very convincing) or due to Thurman's little one-sided facial expressions. Anyhow, this movie is something you should see just for the sake of it.<br/><br/>This movie comes down to personal preferences like all movies of course. If the often absurd plot and dialogue amuses you a lot and the small lack of substance or coherent storytelling doesn't bother you you might just love the movie for its cool style. The first volume was cool in its style and this has some of the same characteristics. However, the slow pace and the emphasis on the drama side isn't working as well as it should if you call this one of the best movies of all time. This is a nice experiment and in many ways you can see how Tarantino has had some fun adding funny little sequences and things here and there but in the end the movie as a whole isn't coherent or deep, it's just a fun montage of more or less cool and sometimes naive things and tricks."

But what can you expect from a cineast like Tarantino right? However I thought the fighting scenes were too long and the dialogues could have been much better. That's what the second volume was all about: more spaghetti western, less Shaolin monkey sh*t. And this was mainly because Michael Madsen en Daryl Hannah had a huge roll in it in comparison to volume 1. Also there was lots of funny stuff in it, f.e. the dialogue in the beginning between Michael Madsen and Larry Bishop, the Pai Mai priest ... One thing bothered me in a ""gargantuan"" way: the pauses between every spoken line, especially by Carradine. They were simply too long and that's why I rated this movie 7 instead of 8.

","Warning: very serious spoilers Well, now I've seen both halves, and as I suspected we wouldn't, we are given no answer to how the baby is retrieved from the Bride's supposedly dead body, without any trace of this being apparently visible to the law officers. This also brings up a major continuity error: she flees as soon as she is pregnant, Bill traces her three months later, yet she is evidently near term when the massacre takes place - where did half a year go? And there are more questions: how did Bill know she was coming, when the last he'd heard, from Elle Driver, was that she was buried? Are we to suppose that Elle Driver, even in her agony, warned him? (And what happened to Elle anyway? She was blinded, but not not killed) And were Elle and the other assassins so blindly obedient to Bill that they were ready to beat up and kill her and some perfectly innocent people - and why did he want them to, when he could have had the Bride taken out by other assassin methods)? And why did they disperse afterwards, one to become an ordinary mother, one the boss of the yakuza, and one (Elle) who knows what? So, though the acting is good (Uma Thurman's is great), this is even less satisfactory than Vol. 1, in my opinion. The fighting scenes are much more scrappy, less ""artful"" than in 1, and the most interest is generated by how the Bride gets out of her bonds and her coffin - which is actually reasonably plausible, if one accepts that her body was not searched."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","0","1","23 January 2007"," Well made but I wish it was more like ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"".
","It's a well made and constructed movie that entertains and again perfectly blends several styles into one unique movie<br/><br/>Unfortunately the movie is not as good as ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"". ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" was a way more entertaining because it was way more crazy mixture of style and because of that also very unpredictable and overwhelming. ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" spends more time on the story development and the emotional aspects of it. It perhaps makes ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" a better constructed and build up movie but I still prefer the more entertaining approach of ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"". In that regard ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" perhaps was a bit disappointing to watch but in this particular case that doesn't mean it was a bad movie.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" mostly mixed Asian cinema styles, ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" mostly uses a Western style. Of course the story alone of taking revenge always has been a popular generic concept for Westerns. The movie also uses some of the genre camera techniques and editing tricks and even adds in some cheesy dialog when two characters are standing across each other, ready to kill. Quentin Tarantino obviously did his homework again but what can I say, Western just isn't my favorite genre. Its style also makes the movie slow at times, so please don't expect another over-the-top going, non-stop spectacular, visual, gory, action spectacle that ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" was. Of course ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" also still features lots- and over-the-top action but it just didn't impressed as much, due to the different style and approach.<br/><br/>The movie features some great acting and dialog. Yes, this movie does feature some great typical Tarantino's dialog at times. Something I really missed in ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"". Also the movie as whole, in terms of its style and build up, is perhaps more 'Tarantino-like' than ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" was. The story, again, is for part told non-linear and this time that style works out fully, unlike in ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" sometimes wasn't the case.<br/><br/>David Carradine is really superb as Bill! What a comeback for an actor! The same goes for Daryl Hannah by the way, lets please not forget her. David Carradine really steals the show in the movie and at times he even puts the main character, played by Uma Thurman, in the shadow. Also Michael Madsen was great and so was Sid Haig in a small but amusing role. The Samuel L. Jackson was also one of the highlights of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is amazingly good looking and has a good visual style, also with the help of Robert Richardson's cinematography, obviously. Tarantino again successfully succeeds at mixing several styles of film-making into one unique great movie, with an own great one of a kind identity. Mission accomplished Mr. Tarantino!<br/><br/>There isn't as much blood spilled in this movie but yet the action does not disappoint. Like I said before, the emphasis of this movie is more put on its story and characters, rather than its action but still the action works out greatly in the movie. The movie features some highly memorable action sequences and also the ending does not disappoint.<br/><br/>A really great and unique movie, that could had been more entertaining and perhaps also better, had it been made more in the style of ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"". <br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","There's a lot of fat in these movies Kill bill vol.1 and vol.2 that is too much narrative explanation, just cut to the chase Mr. Tarantino please! the action is great, the violence is unnecessary, the story clichéd and spread too thin to make this 2 1/2 hour film worth bothering with. It was geeky self-indulgence. I watched the Maltese Falcon just before now there's a master piece, short, to the point, well acted and not a flatulent moment in the script unlike with Kill Bill which is just stupid in comparison. There's no mystery, no subtlety, no intelligence, no charm and no cool. The whole premise seemed to come from that parody TV pilot in Pulp Fiction about fox force five except this time the foxes are snakes etc etc. so to sum up this film has a story that is way too thin, the film is way too long but the action is really good. This is a B movie with A action far from a classic its made for TV parody material with little to warm to in it, just sass from an ugly American. Pai Mei would not be happy at all. Thank me I never paid to see this gaudy flick."

","Where KILLBILL V0L1 appeared to be a tribute, an homage, to Japanese film makers, VOL 2 is a tribute to QT's vision. As David Furey observed it was like Tarrantino spent a lot of his energies and inspiration in making this movie and said to the rest of Hollywood: This is the best I can do; try to top it.<br/><br/>I went to the theater to see the same movie seven times in a month twice in my life. The movies: DOCTOR ZHIVAGO and KILL BILL VOLUME 2. Volume1 is filled with gore; I found it overkill (pun intended); if you look closely, you will notice that no one as shop, hacked up, or otherwise stabbed. We are not shown the massacre and we only see three people die Bill is killed hand-to-hand, Buck is killed snake-to-face, and Elle shows us in a flashback how she poisoned Pei Mai. Quite graphic, but without a plethora of violent scenes. I admit to my students that this movie is in my top five (along with ONCE UPON A TIME IN America, CITIZEN KANE, MILLER'S CROSSING and THE RETURN OF THE KING),but I've never recommended it in class, not because of the violence, but because of the level of the vocabulary and the subtlety of the humour. Elle Diver: Gargantuan is such a lovely word, It's too bad one gets to use it so seldom in a sentence.<br/><br/>The daughter's role is so well done, I wonder how much more of the movie she was allowed to see."

It's almost a sad caricature of QT.'s work up to this point. The final ""superhero"" dialog between Beatrix and Bill was so unsuccessful and forced, I wonder if Tarantino was messing with his audience or committing career suicide... or maybe just feeling himself a little too much. In most other parts of the movie the actors fail to deliver on the dialog...and the pacing of the movie is so purposely slow that it renders the experience a snooze-fest.

","I've never been a big fan of Tarantino films. I watched 'Jackie Brown' a few years back, heard good things about 'Reservoir Dogs' and watched the first half hour or so of 'Pulp Fiction'. Enough said.<br/><br/>I came to 'Kill Bill Vol. 1' primarily as an outsider. I had sort of an idea who was in it, what the tone was and that it was meant to be a homage to '70s Hong Kong martial art flicks. And as an outsider I thought it was really good; it was enjoyable. So, I'm expecting the same for 'Vol. 2'. Because I figure 'Terminator 2' wasn't a 120 minute talkie, and in fact built upon the action and the violence of the first, and 'Vol. 2' will be the same. How wrong I was. As a non-Tarantino fan, you can enjoy the first film. As a non-Tarantino fan, you'll be falling asleep in front of 'Vol. 2'. There's 30 minutes of talk...just talk, mind you...and Bill is dispatched very easily at the end (I'm glad that actually happened, otherwise I would have given the film a 0). I'm willing to give the first film an 8 (yes, I'm that generous. Though I don't think I can give the second more than a 3. It was a waste of time, and nothing like I thought it would be.<br/><br/>But, apparently, this is how Tarantino makes movies. He makes Tarantino movies for Tarantino fans. He's a great filmmaker, I'll give him that and the first film was spectacular. But the second film felt more like an episode of 'Days of Our Lives' with one decent fight scene. Don't waste your time, I say. Fortunately for Tarantino though, he can do no wrong, and unlike Uwe Boll fans will continue to flock to his movies and praise him. Non-fans, however, will probably be tuned out for good after 'Vol. 2'. What a waste..."

","I hated Kill Bill Volume One. No, I have not seen all of it, but of what I have seen: I thought it was terrible. For example, half the film was style and violence, and the ""Bang! Bang!"" song seemed to set it up as a drama. (These were only a few flaws.) Luckily, the Kill Bill series was able to redeem itself with Kill Bill Volume Two. <br/><br/>The nameless Bride starts out in a scene talking about her attack, in a scene that seems too much to be like a Mystery Science Theatre Movie. After that long scene is done, we are introduced to Bill and Budd. Budd agrees to help Bill kill The Bride and return the sell the so-called priceless sword. But, to kill Bill, The Bride goes to a Shoaling Temple to learn the deadly ""Five Point Palm-Exploding Heart Technique."" <br/><br/>Kill Bill Volume Two improves on two of the main flaws of the first one. The first film was 100% violence, and the only thing besides that was a whole lot of incoherence. Kill Bill Volume Two has hardly any violence. It has more story than the original. This is an improvement. The second flaw was that the ""Bang! Bang!"" song in the beginning seems to set Kill Bill Volume One up as a drama. Volume Two is more of a drama, and the ending is fairly touching.<br/><br/>However, even if Volume Two improves on the first one, it creates some flaws of its own. First of all, the whole film is over-drawn. It seemed like Tarintino was trying to put a short script into 136 minutes, which makes the film pretty boring at times. Bill's ""superhero speech,"" the goldfish speech, the introduction of the ""Two Chapels Massacre,"" the fight between Elle and The Bride, and the whole thing about Budd's job all had one thing in common: They were hideously over-drawn. The second flaw was that the film seemed to try to be a kung-fu movie. I heard it was Tarintino's style to copy ""B movies,"" but nobody wants to watch a modern-day cheesy flick. Some things that made Kill Bill Volume Two look like a corny ""B movie"" were: the sudden zooms on the camera, the times the sensei flips his beard, and the colorful background with black figures. I recall somebody saying ""They must have felt so goofy working for Quentin Tarintino."" Kill Bill Volume Two is an improvement, but it still has flaws of its own. If you hated the first like me, than you might want to pick this one up, unless you think you will hate it equally as much.<br/><br/>6/10 <br/><br/>Good: Drama and Action <br/><br/>Bad: Over-drawn, corny B-movie style and carries some of the flaws of the first volume<br/><br/>Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment."

","Kill Bill Voulume 1 did not impress me. Sorry, but I was not happy. I thought a great story of revenge was ruined. Tarantino handled the first film like a demented road runner cartoon, with an overly goofy soundtrack, cheesy deaths of much blood splatter, its impossible stunts(of course an homage to old kung fu flicks). Now I didn't hate volume 1 (I would get the DVD)yet it caused me to see this film with much trepidtude. WOW!<br/><br/>Acting-10/10 Lovely Uma Thurman was really my favorite thing in Kill Bill 1, and she returns in this one with an even better and ore human performance. David Carradine is utterly fantastic as the title character, bringing a cocky output of his handling of the bride, but also a torture of losing her. Finally in comes Michael Madsen as my favorite character(Budd) and performance in the entirety of Kill Bill (excluding the main two of course). He plays a tricky character, at first he you feel sorry for him. He (like The Bride) seems to just want out, and put it behind him. You begin to feel as if he doesn't deserve his fate. Yet then he swings around full tilt, blasting The Bride off his doorstep so fast. He now acts like the bad guy he is, and all you could want is his death.<br/><br/>Writing-10/10 Tarantino spins a fairly simple yarn that works and flows. Get revenge. Most of QT's work takes place in his direction.<br/><br/>Direction-10/10 This time round Quentin has outdone himself. This film has such more of an emotional pull. This time it is much more emotional, and really at times stunningly beautiful. It really moved me. And of course all these Tarantino-isms from the first are here, but like everything else in volume 2 is smaller. This time around it is much more serious in exposition. In fact Tarantino has brought me and ending I find as unpredictable as The Sixth Sense. Expecting a big sword fight and god knows what I was surprised. Bill is killed quickly, getting the chance to get up and walk to his grave. <br/><br/>Many people claim you can't say one Kill Bill is better than the other as they are basically the same film. NO! They are not the same at all. They are completely different, and this time Tarantino has left me pinned to my seat. Bravo, extraordinary work..."

"diac228","10","0","1","28 October 2005"," Review of Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2
","One of the most acclaimed movies this decade is Kill Bill, Volumes 1 and 2. Both movies made over 60 million dollars each in the United States (over 330 million dollars worldwide in total) and has gotten so much praise one would wonder why is it that this doesn't have its own star in the Hollywood Walk of Fame yet. Directed by the unique and creative Quentin Tarantino, Kill Bill mixes bloody gory violence with a lot of beautiful imagery, excellent music, and a well-rounded cast of zany characters. Sounds great doesn't it? Well, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a very good movie, but it is not as good as people say it is. As for Kill Bill Volume 2, now that is a spectacular movie. These two movies in actuality is one film, but for marketing purposes and because the finished product is so long, Miramax decides to release it as two separate films. Despite the rather slow start, Kill Bill finishes so strong you know why Tarantino is as popular as he is today.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is about a woman, whose name is not revealed throughout most of the film (known as The Bride), looking for revenge after the gang of assassins she used to be with attacked her during a wedding rehearsal, killing every single person except for her. But before she goes after the man that started the massacre, she wants to get rid of the four people that were involved in the bloodbath first. Much easier said than done. The first Kill Bill basically is like an action flick, not concentrated too heavily on plot, but more on action. Kill Bill Vol. 2 does contain its amount of intense action, but also sinks deeper into the personalities of not just The Bride, but of the assassins, and Bill himself.<br/><br/>The first part of Kill Bill is advertised as a massive action flick full of intense sequences of sword fighting and action. The truth is, there is only two massive action scenes, and both are good, don't get me wrong, but there is a lot of fluff in between the two action scenes. They range from several scenes of chatter, to an anime sequence, to a long sequence of The Bride trying to wiggle her toes. Talk about slow-paced. To add to that, it took 10-20 minutes before the final fight was finally set up. In other words, she was at the scene of the major fight, yet it took forever for the fight to begin. This first part of the movie would be much shorter if it was Robert Rodriguez editing the film.<br/><br/>Tarantino also does this one-take shot that just can turn a potentially short moment into a very stretched and prolonged scene. And this happens twice. The movie is good, there is a good storyline, two jaw-dropping action scenes, good cast of characters(I fell in love with Gogo Yubari, and also the top assassin Elle Driver) and a shocking twist in the end, but overall I find Kill Bill Vol. 1 rather overrated. If there is one thing I love about the first part though, it has got to be the music, especially the credits theme and also the now famous theme to the hotel where the final battle takes place. Now enter part 2.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol. 2 is everything Vol. 1 wanted to be. Volume 2 perfectly mixes suspense with action, humor, excellent music, brilliant acting, and a very good ending. Volume 2 basically fills all the holes Volume 1 created, and also answers all of the questions as to why the events took place and how The Bride became so skillful. Volume 2 concludes the entire ordeal, as the Bride has to deal with Budd, Elle, and of course, Bill, but gets a little more than what she bargained for. Elle Driver makes an even longer appearance the second time around, and Daryl Hannah (well-known as the mermaid in Splash) gives the best performance of the movie, as she portrays the ruthless, clever, unpredictable, and rage-filled rival assassin of The Bride. Her battle against the Bride stands in my opinion as one of the best fights within the past 10 years.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie also has several flashbacks that helps weave the story together, and the flashback themselves were very entertaining and offered its share of foreshadowing. This was the pure filming brilliance that I was expecting from Tarantino. Very few flaws in the movie, and there never was a sense that the movie was dragging too long, and it is clocked in at over 10 minutes longer than the original, but it did not feel that way. There is not much more to say about the second part, except for the fact that it really picked up the slack and delivers one of the best movie experiences this decade. Kill Bill overall is a great film, overrated, but a superb film nonetheless. Not the best I have seen this decade, but has an entertainment value that is much higher than the usual films within the past few years. Kill Bill: packs a violent punch, a truly entertaining roller coaster.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol. 1 = 7/10 Kill Bill Vol. 2 = 10/10 Kill Bill overall = 8/10"

","Unlike its predecessor, ""Kill Bill, Vol. 1,"" which was basically a triumph of style over substance, the follow-up, ""Kill Bill, Vol. 2"" is a triumph of both style AND substance - a no-holds-barred action film that turns into a thinking man's thriller in its climactic scene. This installment picks up where the earlier one left off, with Beatrix Kiddo, the former assassin attempting to go straight, still seeking revenge against the people who killed her fiancé and friends, and left her for dead on the eve of her wedding. Beatrix, an expert at swordsmanship and martial arts, follows an inexorable path of destruction, culminating in a brilliantly choreographed showdown with the Bill of the title, her former lover and hit man boss who decided to turn his gun on her when she ran off and left him. But the surprise - and triumph - here is that the showdown turns out to be one not of bullets and blows, but of words and ideas.<br/><br/>The plotting could not be more simple and direct, a series of cat-and-mouse fight scenes, periodically interrupted by flashbacks showing how Beatrix got to where she is today. Quentin Tarantino's trademark dialogue is sharp, imaginative and witty, and the violence is a fascinating hybrid of the cartoon-like and the graphic. Tarantino is a lover of movies and this is reflected in the stylish look and sound of the film: the beautiful compositions, the bizarre camera angles, the razor-sharp editing, and the glorious soundtrack, all of which make this an eye-filling and ear-caressing experience for the viewer.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman delivers a pitch-perfect performance as Beatrix, bringing a mixture of steely-eyed ferocity and warmhearted tenderness - as well as an amazing athleticism - to the role. She is more than matched by Keith Caradine as the terrifying yet strangely likable Bill - and their final confrontation scene, in which these two natural born killers sit down and discuss both their love and hatred for one another before squaring off in their battle to the death, is amazingly compelling in its complexity and depth. It is here where the ""Kill Bill"" saga finally becomes a work of art. As a result, this second film is a more satisfying work overall than the first. But, taken as a whole, this is certainly Tarantino's best work since the seminal ""Pulp Fiction"" from ten years earlier."

","A film i would remember for generations. Not is this movie a great homage to the west but it is also the best direction i have seen from Quentin Tarantino. Hew truly knows how to put down a story on screen. The first one just blasted away like a wild cat, but this one gives a great measure of build-up to the story and the characters and the film.<br/><br/>Powerful Acting by all the main and supporting characters, this film will leave you breathless. Uma Thurman great as before, gives vengeance to this film. David Carradine, brought back to life by Mr. Tarantino, gets you on the on track and the main reason of the film. As for Michael Madsen and Darly Hannah, they are absolutely fabulous to watch. Michael does some nice stances and gives nice dialogs too like he did in Reservoir Dogs. Darly is like the ultimate Nemesis for The Bride and will stop at nothing to kill the Bride. Just looking at these guys will make you suspenseful of what is going to happen next The Cinametography is awesome, i have not seen any greater beautiful shots than this movie. The Editing is too good, his long takes makes you wonder of how Quentin pulled this off. There seemed to be no visual effects cramped in to make one element jump out of the film. The sounds too were very creepy and big enough to make you feel the effect.<br/><br/>Above all it is a fantastic watch. If you want to learn Film-making this is the film you should visit. I give it 9 out of 10 for its pure film-making talent and wonderful direction."

","Excellent movie that is superior to the first. As I walked out of seeing the first movie, I was jumping around re-enacting scenes with my friend Ed talking about ""Oh when she...."" After leaving Kill Bill 2 I was left with a different feeling; one of awe. Quentin as really made a wonderful homage to many of our childhoods with a flare rarely seen. References are abound in this movie that will make you remember instantly to the ""cheap channel"" on Sundays and you will instantly remember scenes from the past. Not to say it relies only in the past, there are many innovative concepts but this is truly a movie lover's movie.

","I'm very happy to admit that Tarantino proved me wrong. If you read my review of Vol.1 you'll see that I was very disappointed with the apparent lack of coherent plot and cinematic innovations. Vol.2 is so breathtakingly good that makes up for the sub-par (for Quentin's standards of course) Vol.1 and not only that, it makes you look back at the first installment with a much more appreciative eye. Vol.2 has a great plot and solid character building, blended with the unique Tarantino style. So Quentin has definitely not run dry of ideas, on the contrary he's become even more subtle and mature.<br/><br/>I also have to save some praise for the captivating performances of David Carradine and Uma Thurman. It is unbelievable how perfectly they fit their roles, as if they were made for them! In terms of comparison between 1 & 2, here's how I see it: Vol.1 on its own is a mediocrity, Vol.2 on its own is a fantastic movie, Vol.1 & 2 together are a monumental saga."
"Robert_duder","9","0","1","1 September 2005"," I eat my words!!
","Yes I said I never liked Quentin Tarantino. Yes I boycotted seeing this film and it's previous installment because I was furious that Tarantino continually gets more popular despite his constant attempts at being so called different and outrageous. He tries too hard and I still stand by that but when it comes to the amazing and brilliant Kill Bill Series, I gladly and whole heartedly eat my words.<br/><br/>The two Kill Bill volumes are as different as they are important to each other. They are both very much from the same series and the story continues over completely but nonetheless they are very very different and in that Tarantino finally finds some actual uniqueness. He managed to create two completely different films that are directly sequels of each other and keep getting better. The first Kill Bill was action packed, gore, constant non stop revenge whereas the second installment is softer in a grotesque kind of way. The initial fiery revenge has calmed some but ""The Bride's"" self imposed mission has not changed. Instead in Volume 2 all the characters and actors get the opportunity to really show some acting ability with more emotion than the original. Uma Thurman is still brilliant (and I was never a fan before) as The Bride. She will be one of the most memorable film characters in history. Her anger, and emotions, and in this volume we get to see where all this hatred and vengeance stems from. At the same time we get to see her brought to her knees by the one last thing she feels real human emotion for...her daughter. The battles and enemies in Volume Two are no less amazing then they were in volume one. Michael Madsen's character is a little underused but credit must be given to him as the only one who actually nearly stops The Bride's rampage. Daryl Hannah, who gave us a glimpse of her deadly character Elle Driver becomes a full fledged enemy in Volume 2. She is deadly and deceitful and wicked and their fight in the tiny, cramped trailer is awesome. Perhaps one of the best things about Volume 2 is the intense history we are treated to. Whereas Volume One opened a can of questions Volume 2 answers them all right from the beginning. We hear Bill, we know a little about him but we never see him in the original. Why was The Bride at that chapel, how did she get there, who is she, what is her history? Right from the beginning we see Bill, we get to know the history between them and what was going on during the execution.<br/><br/>One of the best things in the film is seeing where and when The Bride became such a gruesome, awesome killing machine at the hands of legendary Oriental Judo master Pai Mei. The shining star of Kill Bill Volume 2 is none other than Bill himself. David Carradine creates one of the most scary, brutal, maniacal, calculating killers and evil bad guys in film history. His voice and mannerisms can't help but give you shivers. This is without a doubt his most brilliant role. I was mildly disappointed at the brief encounter and battle between him and The Bride and how easily he is defeated although in a way it's poetic justice and makes sense...or...maybe that wasn't his defeat?? I think with what Tarantino has done with Volume's one and two it's safe to say he could do a smart and worthy volume three. I have a whole new respect for his direction and this series. It's captivating and original and stylish and classic film already. 9/10"
"departed07","10","0","1","26 August 2005"," Quentin Tarantino's best since Pulp Fiction
","The Bride is back and ready to kick ass in this conclusion to the two part series that Quentin Tarantino has establish as a masterpiece. Uma Thurman returns as the bride that everybody left for dead, until she got her revenge by killing two of the five assassins (Vivica A. Fox and Lucy Liu) and the crazy 88's; now she is after Bill (David Carradine), his lovely assistant Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and Bill's brother Budd (Michael Madsen in a larger role) and ready for her vengeance. What makes Kill Bill Vol.2 a better film than the original is not by the choreography action, but its dialog and getting to know the characters. During flashbacks with the Bride, we see her in training by Bill's former master, Pai Mai (Gordon Liu) in which he has not only taught Bill, but also his deadly one-eyed assassin for which it is explained how Elle lost her right eye. Pai hates Americans and thinks that women are lazy and futile; he trains and punishes The Bride, as he is proved wrong that there is a woman who can fight back. We also get a look back at the wedding in El Paso, Texas for which The Bride is pregnant and about to marry a hick who runs a local music shop and at the same time meets Bill for which we all know what happens next. The last scene between Bill and The Bride is a climatic scene for which I will never forget, as I was shocked to see how it ended. I'm sure you will feel the same way I do when you watch this film. Overall, this is Quentin Tarantino's best work since Pulp Fiction in which not only does the dialog take in effect, but also understanding the motives behind these characters makes it even better."
"Bogmeister","9","0","1","15 August 2005"," The Bride Ends Her Rampage; We Applaud
","The 2nd half of Tarantino's tale of bloody revenge doesn't have the spectacular battles, except for a one-on-one in a trailer, but it more than makes up for this fact with a sublime quality only possible from a master filmmaker. The wronged Bride (Uma Thurman) succeeds in tracking down Bill (Carradine), after a couple more confrontations with ex-compadres. The picture is also filled out with more detail of events prior to her coma, enriching what we already know about all the characters. Think about a half-dozen of your favorite films which never had sequels, which had characters you wish you could see more about. All of a sudden, here it is - volume two: the mysterious faceless Bill is revealed early in all his glory. As Bill, David Carradine strolls into the picture with all the grace and steely charm of a lost king, returned to show us all how it's done. As he says near the beginning, ""I'm the man."" That might sound trite and funny coming from anyone else; here, he makes you believe it in the same second and proves it throughout. By the end, he really is a scary son of a gun, without even having to kill anyone on screen.<br/><br/>The whole picture comes across as a more mature, polished upgrade of the exciting volume one. It doesn't get a full 10 stars from me due to Tarantino's indulgence in dragging out certain scenes (the one with Bill's brother's boss harassing Budd could have been accomplished in half the time). But Tarantino makes good use of the secondary characters played by Hannah and Madsen. Hannah comes across as a more spiteful version of The Bride and just as tough. As with many players who enter the Tarantino universe, this may be her best role. Madsen, brought back from his breakthrough in Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs""(92), seems very at ease as the self-destructive Budd. And then, of course, you have Gordon Liu as the master - unforgettable! But it's still up to Uma to carry the show, which she does. Tarantino really gets the most out of her when she needs to explode, whether in anger or outrage, or just about any strong emotion; she does it with a suddenness that startles us - towards the end when she bursts into the room where Bill is waiting and sees what she sees. Her entire body seems to convulse and we're all heaving with emotion right along with her."

So I saw Kill Bill: Vol 2 and liked it highly. The movie answered all of my questions to the previous one and had much of a better story and was not unrealistic that much. We finally get to see Bill, who is played by David Carradine who had a really good role in the movie. There is a great conclusion to the movie and had a very good story, along with likable characters, my favorite being Budd. Overall, good movie that answers tons of questions.

","While I feel that the 90 odd minutes of my life spent watching the first were not a complete waste (about 45 were spent dozing off) I felt cheated out of the rental price. I am not a great fan of Tarantino films. They are typically overdone caricatures of a theme and very shallow.<br/><br/>This was either a relief to see, or Quinten's head was a little clearer when he did this one. The supporting cast definitely adds to the story, and there are comedic moments of irony sorely lacking in the first.<br/><br/>Beyond this however, the violence and profanity is still grossly mindless- I am not at all opposed to either, however it must be justified with context."
"jboothmillard","6","0","1","23 June 2005"," Kill Bill: Vol 2
","This doesn't have as much violence or thrills as the first film, but Quetin Tarantino's directed and written (with the female star's help) part two is still essential for the reason why The Bride (Golden Globe nominated Uma Thurman) kills people from the death list. She was basically (nearly) killed at her wedding practise by Bill (Golden Globe nominated David Carradine) because she never told him she was getting married, or was pregnant, weird. This film tackles the practise day, her training with the mean Pai Mei (Chia Hui Liu/Gordon Liu), and facing the last of her enemies, Buck (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), and obviously Bill. The first film had the twist with finding out The Bride/Beatrix Kiddo had a kid, but the bigger twist this time is that she is alive, and has been living with father Bill for the four years she was in a coma! Also starring Michael Parks as Esteban Vihaio and Tarantino regular, Samuel L. Jackson as Rufus, a guest at the wedding. The first film is much more essential viewing, this second part is only good for the chat, and only one or two fights. Bill's death I have to say is rather silly, after the hype to see him die, and he was only given a pound to the chest, not slaughtered like everyone else. Uma Thurman was number 95 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and she was number 15 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols. Good!"
"ShootingShark","7","0","1","18 June 2005"," Terrific, Moody, Slow-Burning Spaghetti Western Conclusion To Kill Bill Saga
","The Kill Bill saga concludes as The Bride continues her rampage of revenge, targeting the three remaining members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad - El Paso cowboy Budd, one-eyed swordswoman Elle Driver and the enigmatic Bill himself.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Volume 2 is a great follow-up to the first movie, but also a different kind of film with a very different pace and mood. Where its precursor is fast, frenetic and action-packed, this movie is much more mellow and contemplative and its relatively few kung-fu scenes are short and snappy. What I enjoyed most is that we finally get to see the great Carradine strut his stuff as Bill, the baddest hombre in the west. Despite the change of pace, Tarantino is as inventive as ever with his film grammar, using filters galore, old-style telephoto zooms, a great blackout scene (when The Bride is buried alive) lots of wild overhead shots and all his usual wacky music cues - there is a particularly beautiful shot which uses an Ennio Morricone cue from The Good, The Bad And The Ugly to introduce Carradine (playing his flute from the TV show Kung Fu). The performances are all terrific again - Thurman manages to keep her performance dead straight amongst a gallery of nutcases, Madsen and Hannah shine and Liu and Parks are both great playing different characters to the ones they play in the first movie. Tarantino has succeeded in making a tremendous double-barrelled kung-fu classic."

","I am sure that everyone in their young lives had that terrible moment of finding out that Father Christmas did not exist. Whether it was catching your Dad eating the cookies and milk while dressed up as St Nick, or just realizing that Playstation 2 you asked for ages still have not arrived. Either way, you felt betrayed in a way. A person you see as infallible, who brings joy and happiness in your life, seems to be nothing else but only human.<br/><br/>That is how I felt when I saw Kill Bill Vol 2. Six years after Jackie Brown, Tarintino brings out Kill Bill Vol 1. After watching that movie, I knew that the genius was back in business. So knowing that Kill Bill Vol 2 was about to come out in a couple of months, I felt it was going to be more of the same. More mind blowing cinematic artistry, beautiful yet violent ballet of samurai swords and kung fu. As the months have passed by, my anticipations were rocketing sky high, and I could not wait to watch the movie, to see if my expectations were fulfilled.<br/><br/>So April 23 come along, and my waiting is over. Yet my disappointment began Watch Out; Spoilers Ahead.<br/><br/>The Bride now has only three on her ""to do in"" list, since Copperhead was annihilated in a show down in leafy suburbia, and then the scalping of O-Ren Ishii in the climax of the previous movie. So who was next on the list? The next person to meet their maker is Bill's brother, Budd. After a few scenes, Budd seems to have the upper hand over the Bride, when she was buried alive in a coffin. During her limited time in the claustrophobic space, she begins to think about her training with the wise and knowledgeable Pai Mei. Due to this thinking, she used this inspiration to get out of a pure solid wood coffin and six feet of dirt, and seek pure retribution on Budd. After the death of Budd, via a venomous snake, Elle Driver was next to feel the wrath of the Bride. It was during this altercation between the two female assassins, it has been found out that Elle Driver had killed The Bride's Chinese mentor. Due to this bombshell, The Bride just goes ballistic on cyclopytic blonde killer and rips off her other eye and leaves her to be blind. The list whittles down to one person, who is the main character in both movies, and also the namesake in this film's title. However there is a major twist in this movie, and that is where my movie review is going to leave it.<br/><br/>The actors and actresses were pretty good in their roles. I thought Uma Thurman was absolutely amazing as the Bride, and I though Chia Hui Liu was good as the wise but unintentionally funny Pai Mei. I thought Micheal Madsen was pretty good as Budd, though I did want to see him play a bigger role, since I think he is such a good actor. I think that Daryl Hannah will now be more remembered as the deadly assassin rather than the dippy mermaid in Splash! It was definitely good to see the legend of Kung Fu playing a meaty role.<br/><br/>I thought that the casting role was amazing, however the ending and the story really disappointed me. I just thought that the ending was such a damp squib, since all that crazy kung fu actions and the decapitations of enemies, just leads to someone who simply dies with a complex karate move, which no one sees. I just found it really disappointing, however that was only the icing on the cake. How can both Kill Bill Vol. 1 and Kill Bill Vol. 2 were the same movie? I could not see how is connected at all. To be honest, it feels like it was a money making stunt done by Mr Tarintino. I just wish that the movie was immediately released straight after the first installment. It has been said that this film shows the signature note that is always scrawled upon most of Quentin movies, but I felt that this one was a bit of a let down.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I felt this movie was such a disappointment. I wanted to like this movie so much, however I felt betrayed by one of my favorite directors. One quick word to the director; direct better movies and stop acting in mediocre ones."

Well I am glad to admit that I think I finally see why film fans are praising Tarantino the way they are. He really is a master in making us see into the hearts of violent people.

Presumably,Tarantino could make again a Pulp Fiction.Who would blame him?However,seeing that he is an omnipotent director and he hasn't the same power of surprising like 10 years ago,he did his wonder!And his wonder is double,completed in the second movie. <br/><br/>This part focus on Tarantino's attention on the perfection of the screenplay,of course always with the presence of his great directing man oeuvres. The union of the story isn't linear but this fact doesn't deprive the viewer of its complete comprehension.The film is embellished with various philosophical monologues and dialogs which prove that Quentin isn't behind in the ample and interesting shading of the characters and this very shading of Bride's enemies is the reason of transforming her revenge into viewer's revenge. This man certainly knows how to direct and it's easy-understanding that when he does it,he enjoys it.I take his influences from the East for granted and they're given in a masterly way.There aren't so many colors as Kill Bill 1,since the logic of the second part is black and white:Bill vs Bride.Also,there's an evident lyrical mood which makes Kill Bill 2 an epic. The core of the film is David Caradine.""Kung-Fu man"" is acting explosively in the most cool way and he is starring in 2-3 anthology scenes.What a father!The most interesting character is Pai Mei (Gordon Liu) who gives an East-atmospheric tone in the movie.Hannah and Madsen form firm values,whilst for Uma Thurman words are useless.Uma,will you marry me? Conclusively,in my opinion Kill Bill 2 is something different and it cannot be compared with the past Tarantino's films.Quentin steals and he knows it.However,he steals in a perfect way and he makes movies that he likes first of all.Is there any cult director more rich than Tarantino is?Think about it while you're listening to the marvelous soundtrack.Do you think that Kill Bill 2 will be a classic?It still lies in the womb of time..."
"cherold","8","0","1","20 March 2005"," more successful than volume 1
","I had been fairly underwhelmed by Kill Bill Volume 1, which I thought was entertaining but shallow and rather pointless. But I still watched Volume 2, because I had only watched Volume 1 because I thought the trailer for Volume 2 looked good, and Volume 1 came to cable first.<br/><br/>Since these movies apparently are really just two halves of one long movie, it is surprising that the second one feels somewhat more mature. Yes, it still has juvenile things in it that only an arrested 17-year-old would put in, like Pai Mei's playing with his mustache in that ridiculous way, but overall it feels meatier. It is also less gory, which is surprising.<br/><br/>Much of the sense of maturity is due to David Carradine's first rate performance as Bill. It is tempting to say Bill has an undercurrent of menace, but the interesting thing is he virtually doesn't. Carradine is calm and quite likable and the sense of menace comes entirely from our knowledge of how dangerous he is. His thoughtful character makes the entire movie feel more thoughtful, although this isn't to say that it isn't usually still silly and over-the-top. There's also an excellent bit by Darryl Hannah.<br/><br/>The question is, if you played these two as one movie, would I rate it an 8 star movie, like volume 2 or 7 star movie like 1? I can't really decide. Much of the problem with the first one is the hollow feeling one is left with at the end, so the second half could well elevate the whole movie. On the other hand, I don't if I could sit through a 4-hour Kill Bill. It is entertaining, but it is still very much a one-note movie."

What's up with Elle? Who is Budd? What happened to the daughter? All of this and more is answered in Vol. 2, with twists and turns galore.<br/><br/>Let me say first off that this movie is hardly like the first -- but that's in a good way. The spiffy blood and guts and martial arts effects are no more, instead replaced with deep-rooted psychological plot points and expecting the unexpected. It lacks the kick-in-the-mouth, spontaneous martial arts scenes from the first one, and is replaced by a slow abundance of dialogue that starts the movie off on what could be mistaken for the wrong foot. But after a while, the action starts, and we're quickly drawn into a wild goose chase following The Bride -- now known as Beatrix Kiddo -- and her mad chase after Bill and all of her remaining opponents. Stories are told, questions are answered, and everything that you may predict to happen will not happen, which puts back the spontaneous plot points that we know and love. The movie is an unpredictable, wild ride that ends with a heartfelt, nicely done conclusion that wraps it all up very well.<br/><br/>I don't expect a Kill Bill 3; on the contrary, I think I'd be rather disappointed by one, but we'll see what happens.

Revenge in Western thought should be more about justice and based less on emotion.

That's mostly in part because the targets are different and now most of the action takes place in American soil. This time we also finally learn The Bride's real name. Next on her list, is the white-trashy, trailer-dwelling brother of Bill's, Budd, played excellently by Michael Madsen, in his best role since Vic Vega in Reservoir Dogs. Budd is the only male member of Bill's killer squad. This time around we also find out why Budd is living the kind of life that he is, and are even taken on a little trip to his workplace to really see what his life has become after leaving the squad. <br/><br/>This time around we also learn how The Bride learned to kick ass the way she does, by seeing her taking a trip down memory lane while she's in a sticky situation of life and death and for about twenty minutes or so, we go back to the kung-fu, chop-socky tribute, and meet a new character in time, Pai Mei played by legendary kung fu actor Gordon Liu. We also see in action for the first time, the other member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, and only worthy match to The Bride, Elle Driver played by the still beautiful Daryll Hannah. Seeing Elle and The Bride's fight on screen is one of the best seen in recent Hollywood movies but the best part of the movie comes when The Bride finally finds Bill.I have to say, even for a role that was written specifically for him and that has somewhat to do with his earlier work, David Carradine still does an excellent job playing Bill. His charisma and coolness make him a natural at this kind of role. And speaking of coolness, one of my favorite actors, Sam Jackson, also makes a very brief appearance at the beginning of the movie that goes almost unnoticed, but as always he's great even if it's in a teeny little cameo. This movie, in true Tarantino style, is filled with great dialogue, in my opinion, the greatest since Pulp Fiction. Also, once again Tarantino chooses the perfect music for his work. The spaghetti-western music from classic films also blend with the movie perfectly. In conclusion, this movie delivers in all levels, action-wise, comedy-wise, story-wise, and dialogue-wise. So there is something for everyone in this movie. This one, along with volume one, make their mark as one of the first classics of the 21st century. 10 out of 10."
"preposterous","9","0","1","5 March 2005"," 9 out of 10
","I wanted to give it a 10 of 10, but the truth is that it wasn't as sublime as, say, Hitchcock's Vertigo, so I couldn't do that. However, it was only when I saw Vol 2 that I realized the extent of Quentin's brilliance in composing these two back-to-back blockbusters. Considering the length of these films, esp when laid back-to-back, it is amazing to me the mastery Quentin has over his material that not a moment is wasted. Far from it, every moment is poignant with some kind of word, action, music, or other, and it all fits like a dovetail, like a man who knows what he's doing and is going about it with a sense of purpose. I've been a fan of all his films until now, from Reservoir Dogs to Pulp Fiction to Jackie Brown, and I can say that it was worth the wait.<br/><br/>As for the acting, as usual the casting is superb. Unlike the usual parade of stars, Quentin finds the people who've been out of the limelight for sometime, or were never quite in it, and somehow or other they are great actors and actresses in front of his cameras. This time, for me, it was David Carradine who was the surprise. And there were many other great performances throughout, but of course this is blondie's movie. I don't think there's a moment that goes by with her on the screen that I am not filled with lust and desire for her body and her soul.<br/><br/>This is an absolute masterpiece and my only question is: when's the next one Quentin?"

","Many people say the first volume is better but I would say that I disagree. One reason I love Tarentino's work is because he is a master a creating the dialog for his characters in an unforgettable way. One scene where i really enjoyed the dialog was when David Caradine was talking about how Clark Kents disguise is Superman but it is Actually Kent because he grew up as superman and had to find a disguise.<br/><br/>This film continues the revenge of Uma's character ""The Bride"". The great way of ending the first volume was having Bill tell Ellle Driver that Uma's child was still alive, that made me even more intrigued for volume two. This one looks more at Uma's past with Bill(little spoiler) and her training with Pai Mai(Same actor played the role of Gorden Liu)and her struggles to find and Kill Bill. <br/><br/>With all the high stylized action and crude language this movie contains you just know it is a Tarentino film, he excites you with his odd violence in the first volume but then captures you in the second with the unforgettable dialog and flashback that will resolve your many wonders. The acting is sensational and Caradine should have got an Oscar nomination for his role of Bill, Uma Thurman was good but not Oscar worthy, she ended up being nominated for a golden globe award. Just like how ""Pulp Fiction"" won the Oscar for ""Best original screenplay"" I thought this also should have."

","I knew right away i had to see Vol.2 after i saw the first half. Tarantino has created something in Kill Bill movies that is totally mind blowing. The interesting characters, the killer soundtrack and the action sequence from the swordplay to the hand to hand combat. The second half i think i enjoyed more because it seemed to explore more of the characters and what has happened to all of them. Thats why i loved the Pai Mei scenes with the bride because it gives you all the answers of how she became such a deadly d.i.v.a. Not forgetting to mention the excellent fighting sequences by Pai Mei.It's also very cool to see more of Bill a.k.a Snakecharmer,Elle Driver a.k.a Clifronia Mountain Snake and my complete favourite in the whole movie Budd a.k.a Snakecharmer played by the great Michael Madsen (who i loved in Donnie Brasco and The Getaway) they are all amazing in their violence skills and character.

","What a film! The story twists and turns and strikes quicker than a cobra. You won't find references to Star Wars and Lord of the Rings here - you'll have to watch The Magic Roundabout for that. But it is a wonderful homage to David Carrafine's kung fu. It seems the film was written for him but there are brilliant performances from all the leads. ""I must warn you young lady that I am susceptible to flattery"" is delivered with dripping lasciviousness. The characters are alternative in my book - witness the assassin who meekly obeys a tart and the child who goes to sleep watching murder movies. They all create tensions, right, left and centre that are suddenly released in an almost unclimactic way. Twice as good as KB1 but couldn't have been, without it."
"Pinkgurl3533","10","0","1","26 February 2005"," So much better than Vol. 1.. SPOILER!!
","Personally, I thought that the second movie was better than the first one. Vol 1 didn't have a plot, just massive killing and the revenge to kill Bill. I fast forwarded through the whole fight scene in the restaurant when the Bride was going to kill O-Ren. The scene was ridiculously long and the killing was so dumb. Like when the Bride cut off a person's arm the blood squirts out like a water fountain... unrealistic. Also I thought the whole anime scene was bad. Yes, unique because not a whole lot of movies incorporate cartoon drawings to the movie but c'mon. The second one actually had more plot than random killing. There was emotion and a story. The whole situation came out as to why Bill tried to kill Bea Kiddo. But there was still awesome action so it balanced out. I loved when she crawled out of the grave and went to the diner for a glass of water. Hilarious!! Not many movies can pull off a better sequel but this one has!! One thing I didn't understand. Why didn't she finish off the girl with the eye patch (sorry I forgot her name). She poked out the eyeball but why not finish her?? Or did she?"
"TheNorthernMonkee","9","0","1","23 February 2005"," cleverly made second half of a Tarantino gem
","SPOILERS In recent cinema history, there are probably no directors who can write and direct stylish films as Quentin Tarantino. With a back catalogue including the new flawless ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992) and award winning ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994), Tarantino writes from an angle which is both endearing and genius. As a man who has worked in a movie store and has had a long running love of cinema, Tarantino creates the types of film he wants to watch himself. He uses his own personal knowledge to create films which not only contain facts and trivia, but which tend to remain as tributes to classic styles.<br/><br/>As a fan of classic martial arts films, in 2003, Tarantino released the first of his two part epic ""Kill Bill"". Telling the story of an assassin out for revenge, the first film was a masterful piece of cinema which, whilst maybe lacked slightly in substance, remained a stylish bloodbath, which any martial arts fan could happily sit and enjoy. In 2004, the second part of the film was released, and amazingly this film was significantly different to the first. Whilst part one was a stylish piece of constant bloodshed, this second encounter is much more plot driven, whilst retaining that inherent beauty. As good, if not better, as the first part, this concluding chapter in the story of the Bride (Uma Thurman) is yet another fine addition to anyone's DVD collection.<br/><br/>The Bride, or ""Black Mamba"" (Thurman) is out for revenge. Having dispatched two members of the assassination squad sent to kill her, this film deals with her pursuit of the remaining members, Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and Budd (Michael Madsen). With these two eliminated from the equation, the Bride has plans to finally kill the one man who ordered her death, her old master, and friend, Bill (David Carradine).<br/><br/>Upon the original announcement made by Tarantino that he would be splitting this film into two segments, there were many who questioned the chances of success. Well, with two finely constructed films, we have our answers. Whilst not quite as amazing as the one long, uncut, film would have been, both parts are worthy reminders of Tarantino's genius.<br/><br/>In this second part in particular, there are so many superb qualities worthy of mention.<br/><br/>Led by a great performance by Thurman and a constantly intimidating performance by Carradine, the films acting staff thrive with the exquisite script. Everyone puts in a good job, right down from the main cast, through to the creepy Esteban Vihaio (Michael Parks).<br/><br/>The true beauty of ""Kill Bill: Volume 2"" however is once again the way Tarantino has filmed it. With a black and white opening scene covering the original massacre of the wedding party, this film oozes style. When it returns to colour, it doesn't just return to your normal every day colours, but it returns to bright, vivid colours which stand out on the screen. Bill's house towards the end in particular is rich in texture and is just incredibly bright.<br/><br/>As well as colour, this film again has a stunning soundtrack. Whilst admittedly not as good as the ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992) soundtrack, Tarantino still manages to put some wonderful pieces of music throughout, whether orchestral or from his own CD collection.<br/><br/>In fact, ""Kill Bill: Volume 2"" suffers from the one minor problem that it's not quite as good as Tarantino's early work. Whilst the two parts mixed together to make one film would quite easily make anyone's top ten films list, the parts separated do feel weak compared to true classics like ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"". To say a director/writer's film is inferior to his earlier work is not an insult to the later work, but rather an enormous compliment to the previous pieces. Tarantino has created some of the most stylish films of the last twenty years, and whilst the two separate parts of ""Kill Bill"" are neither as good as his earlier stuff, nor as good as a combined piece would probably be, they are still wonderful films, and this second half is another Tarantino beauty."
"MLDinTN","7","0","1","21 February 2005"," less action than volume 1
","I think volume 1 was better because volume 2 dragged in bits and wasn't as entertaining. Volume 2 starts off slow as we see what happened between the Bride and Bill before the massacre at the church. We have a good fight scene between the Bride and Elle but it leaves the ending up in the air. Then there's Bud, who ""disposes"" of the Bride, which brings about the flashbacks of her training. She gets out of the coffin after being buried alive. Now that'a neat trick. But she doesn't get to take care of Bud, someone else does. Then the final act shows the Bride tracking down Bill and meeting her daughter. The two talk, but she's there to get revenge, so it can end in only one way. The final confrontation isn't that eventful. It's anti-climatic.<br/><br/>I guess my favorite scenes involved the training of Beatrix by Master Pai Mai. How many times was he going to flick his beard.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Definitely see it if you've seen volume 1. I would have liked it better if it had more fights like volume 1."
"daveysnoek","9","0","1","20 February 2005"," Great great movie, just an inch below Pulp Fiction.
","everything I missed in part 1 was made up here (the famous Tarantino dialouge was back) I was also glad this film was less gory than it's predecessor. and Bill's dead - which some people thought was disappointing - was very well executed. I mean, if she just had sliced him to pieces it wouldn't have been as emotional as it is now. Bill just walks away and falls down slowly.<br/><br/>The role that Michael Madsen played was small, but awesome. The Pai Mei bit was excellent (tarantino said his next film will be in this style, so I'm already looking forward to it) Daryl Hannah was convincing as the bitch Elle Driver. And some pieces were Hilarious. (The Pai Mei bit, The eyeball between the toes, Budd's wakey, wakey eggs and bakey line) The absolute star in this film was David Carradine, to me he looked like a father figure, a wise Indian. Cunning and intelligent. Uma Thurman (who isn't really one of my favorite actresses) was fabulous and convincing in the emotional area.<br/><br/>I rate this film a 9."

","Finally got to see Vol 2, the conclusion to a long journey that the Bride was taken.<br/><br/>First of all let me just say that if you are going into this film to see the violence that Vol 1 had, you'll be disappointed big time, this movie is heavy on the dialogue, that being sad, that would have to be one of the weak points in the film, too many scenes where Bill and The Bride are just talking. Don't get me wrong, I loved the Tarantino Dialogue, I was laughing 50% of the time through the movie, based on the brilliant dialogue that Tarantino puts in everyone of his films. David (Bill) was awesome, he was perfect for the role, he IS BILL, no one else can play bill, he has the perfect voice, the perfect look, and the perfect humour for it, I loved every minute he was on the screen. Another character I loved every time he was on the screen....Pai-Mei (sp). He was great, awesome comic relief for an intense film, which leads me to my second disappointing part. NOT ENOUGH PAI-MEI, and what a sh*tty way to die, this guy is the mother f*cking guy to kick your ass with his finger, this guy will f*ck you up, and he dies from food poison?? That was really lame for me, although the small amount of screen time he did have, was great.<br/><br/>This leads me into my third disappointment, the way Budd dies. Again at the hands of Elle (same as Pai-Mei) and she doesn't actually kill either of them (Budd=snake, Pia-Mei=poison) Come on b*tch, Budd was a great character and kicked some ass too, he has balls to bury her alive and we get to see no fight between the two? Which leads me into my final disappointment of the film, talking about fighting...no final battle between The Bride a.k.a Black Mamba a.k.a Mommy a.k.a Beatrix Kiddo. and Bill? As soon as he told her at the camp fire scene about the heart explosion, I knew that is how Bill would die and I wanted yo see some blood, but he just falls down, that all disappointed me. BUT!!! The movie is so good, that all that disappointment doesn't take the film down that much.<br/><br/>This movie felt more like a Tarantino movie than the first Vol did, and that's a good sign. The fight scene between The Bride and Elle was great, didn't expect the eye pluck part, then to top it off, she STEPS ON THE EYE (laughed me ass off when the question mark came up on her name in the credits). I felt bored at one scene, the talking of the fish dying, other than that, this film had me cheering for the Bride (and Budd for some reason). So see this flick not to see Vol 1's ""orgy of blood"", to finish the movie, see a great Tarantino flick and see some awesome acting."
"ryan_kuhn","10","0","1","13 February 2005"," ""You and I Have Unfinished Business.""
","I let this movie soak into my conscience for a day or so before I began to break it down. At first, I was a tad disappointed in this follow up to 2003's Kill Bill, Vol. 1, not a prequel to this sequel, rather the first half of the story. It turned out rather that Volume 1 was the appetizer to the main course that is Volume 2. If you recall, Volume 1 finds Uma Thurman's annoyingly unnamed Bride waking from a coma after her former boss and love interest Bill has her wedding party whacked by a gang of killers. By the end of the first volume, 2 of the 4 Bill underlings had been disposed of, leaving the Bride to exact her revenge against Bill's brother Budd (Michael Madsen) and Bill's current lover, the one-eyed Elle Driver (Darryl Hannah in super-bitch overdrive, a tasty character to be sure). Poor Budd had given up the world of murder for hire to become the under-appreciated bouncer at a California strip joint when the Bride re-enters his life, but he still has a knack for finding the ""right"" way of taking care of his former business. What he does to a captured foe is down right frightening for those who are claustrophobic or have a deep down fear of pre-mature burial. Elle on the other hand is calculating, cold, unwavering as she maneuvers herself through a transaction that leaves her on the winning end of the deal ultimately. Her battle with The Bride (where we finally learn her name, and the buildup really isn't that payoff we were looking for, but perhaps that was the point) is a Jerry Springer Show watcher's dream, two good looking blondes fighting it out in a trailer in the middle of nowhere. The outcome of that battle is ironic and leaves the viewer guessing what happens after the camera leaves the trailer. The ultimate scenes between the Bride and Bill are heartbreaking. Who would have guessed a movie with Quentin Tarantino, where nothing is to be taken seriously, has a genuine heart tugging set of events to end the film. Bill is played wonderfully by David Carridine, a man who knows who he is (""A murdering bastard""), knows how to raise the daughter of a woman he tried to kill (The Bride's daughter, THE source of the emotional conflict at the end of the movie), and even knows why he likes Superman over the other comic book hero's. Some people have complained that the ultimate scene was a bit of a letdown, and after the ballet of sword and fake blood that was the Bride-Crazy 88's battle in Volume 1, anything is quieter and slower and more poignant than that, and that's what Tarantino gives us here. There are no surprises to the plot of the movie as the story goes, but Volume 2 does fill in the holes on what happened, why everything happened the way they did, and how it made each character feel. The Bride is a warrior of zero emotion in Volume 1, the total opposite here in Volume 2. Tarantino goes from the far East film experience in Volume 1 to a Sergio Leone Western film in Volume 2 with sweeping landscapes, music featuring both guitars and trumpets (in fact, most of the most important songs are directly from A Fist Full of Dollars and other Leone movies), snakes and dirt and a dash for cash, all of which Clint Eastwood would feel at home in. The only thing I found askew when it came to Volume 2 was how complete it is compared to Volume 1. The credits give this away. Tarantino dips into the 1940s style of credits with fancy script fonts and the gray scale background, and even the opening music reminded me of something one would here at the beginning of a 1930s film. This is not a negative, but it just makes Volume 1 now feel like something to warm the audience up with, then the real meal comes with Volume 2. The credits go on for about 15 minutes and features a montage of all of the important characters in the movie, much like the end of the Super Mario Brothers video games, when you beat the game, the show you everyone you defeated to win it all. I don't know if Tarantino had that in mind when piecing it together, but it worked for me. After the day of playing the movie again through my mind, I found this movie much more satisfying than the first one. The story, the pace, the dialogue, all much slower, and slower is often better. The energy that is shown in Volume 1 is thrown away here, and the movie is much better for it. I personally think putting the two films back together would be risky. The styles are so different, the pace is so different between the two volumes, I don't know if I would enjoy a complete film as much as I do now as two separate pieces. Kill Bill, Volume 2 is a success from the story, the visuals, the music, and the actors all working as one, as the ultimate snake charmer, Tarantino, puts it all together."

","Vol. 2 is disappointing, a big contrast to vol. 1. I would give vol.1 9 out of 10, but vol.2 6 out of 10.<br/><br/>If you have ever been exposed to Hong Kong kung. fu movies, you cannot but say that the fights are too short and superficial, with no real kung fu inside. The way director QT portrays Master Pai Mei is even laughable. I'm afraid it can only appeal to those Americans who are not familiar with kung fu movies.<br/><br/>It's supposed to be an action movie about vengeance. Then, what's the point to add so much story-telling in vol. 2? I don't mean it's not needed, but it's just too much, slowing down the pace of the movie. It's just not cool. I think more than 10 minutes of the story-telling in the movie should be cut away. And there is just too little action. After the boring Budd's dealing with Black Mamma (it's boring because there is strictly speaking no fight at all), I expect a fierce fight between Black Mamma and Elle Drive. But it is very short, and there is no real fighting with swords between them, just American beating, punching, and throwing. These two characters are supposed to be students of Pai Mei and they fight like those drunk people in bars without any skill or tactics! <br/><br/>Rearding the plot, getting out of the coffin underground is too unbelievable. She has previously learned how to punch through a piece of wood. Fine. But there is a whole lot of stone and soil behind that piece of wood in the coffin.<br/><br/>The weakest point of the plot is the last moment, when Black Mamma retold why she left Bill. How incredible is it to give up a whole career (though it's a career of assassin) and a lover just because you find that you are pregnant? OK, it's not impossible. But it's surely not a nice thing to do to Bill, who is the boss of the assassin group and the lover, and there is no wonder that he would get mad. So, come on, Black Mamma, why are you so mad as if everybody owes you their lives? (Actually Bill raised similar question to her and she just said she couldn't imagine that Bill would do that to her. What an answer!) Yes, I know, I know, action movie about vengeance does not have to be reasonable in this kind of thing. But if director QT know that it's not that reasonable, why doesn't he just drop that part or shorten it to a minute? <br/><br/>No stylistic fight, no thrilling music, and lots of unnecessary and unreasonable story-telling make this movie much worse than the first. I really don't understand why it gets so high a score in IMDb. Maybe there are something too particular about QT that people vote for QT but not the movie."

","Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" hits home with the writing guns blazing! The whole movie is an exercise in homage to two particular genres of film: the spaghetti western and kung fu. The film is remarkably introspective and its characters reach a depth that they were not allowed to in ""Vol. 1."" Especially during the final scene between ""the Bride"" and Bill, and their daughter, whom ""the Bride"" did not know was alive. The final confrontation between ""the Bride"" and Bill, although abrupt, is so powerful that it leaves the audience stunned.

The only really jarring note to me is the end of KB1 how Oren - Ishi (SP?) is 'finished' in the beautifully snowy garden.<br/><br/>But KB 2 has a depth and a maturity to it that still sends tingles up my spine. OK, it's not the real world but what do we watch movies for. All the actors are great .. I don't know why people dislike Pei Mei by the way, I find him an 'old school Gentleman' - merciless, but with his own rigid code of honour.

The music is fantastic, and it took the second or third viewing for me to appreciate the humour (maybe graveyard humour, but humour nonetheless..)<br/><br/>Uma crossing the road after emerging from the dead, with dust flying off her clothes and calmly sitting down and asking ' may I have a glass of water please'...

","I know that it is rare to have a sequel that is absolutely better than the first film. Many feel that Spider-Man 2 is better than the first. The same goes for The Empire Strikes Back being better than Star Wars, and Godfather 2 being better than The Godfather. And the reason why these films are viewed as superior efforts over their original counterparts is simple............these sequels have their own identity. They have their own story to tell. And that is exactly what makes Kill Bill Volume 2 better than Volume 1. True. It does continue from Volume 1. True, the theme for both movies is the same......revenge! But Volume 2 is not in any way shape or form like Volume 1. It possesses more depth than the first film had. And the dialog in volume 2 is the best I have seen in a film since Fargo (and that is saying a lot.). But what really sets this film above Volume 1 is due to one person............David Carradine as Bill.<br/><br/>I loved how you never saw Bill's face in the first movie. This strategy only built up the anticipation for when you do finally see him.....which doesn't take long once Volume 2 begins. But how we first see Bill is where the tone of this film is set. He is calmly playing his windpipe, and once he turns to look at The Bride, he commands your attention from here on out. What really struck from his first five or so minutes on screen was how Carradine displays sadness, happiness, and anger all wrapped in one. We know that Bill is gonna kill her, but the way Carradine portrays it, you suddenly find yourself wondering if he really will. You also get the feeling that Bill does not want to kill her, yet he knows that he has to because (in his eyes) she betrayed him. I loved the final lines they shared at the church, where she asks him how she looks. He touches her and looks at her like he is a proud father, and tells her she looks like she is ready. That is powerful, and what is really great is how these two lines come up near the end of the film. Truly masterful.<br/><br/>Uma is solid as The Bride, and she shows why she is one of the best actresses in Hollywood today. She never gets the credit she deserves, and my hope is that these two films will give her that credit. Before these films came out, I had my doubts as to if she could pull off a performance like this. I'm glad to say that she proved me wrong. She is The Bride, and I don't think anyone else could have played her better.<br/><br/>My only gripe with this film comes down to some believability issues. I won't go into any details, but you'll know what I am talking about. Still, these are minor gripes that do not take away from the movies ""greatness"".<br/><br/>All in all, this is QT's best work since Pulp Fiction. I only hope he doesn't take another six years to make another film."

David Carradine (doing his best work since his ""Kung Fu"" days), Daryl Hannah (her 1st villain role -she's awesome) and Michael Madsen (doing what he does best... torturing people!) Carradine as Bill is not who we expected him to be after watching the 1st film. He's cool but he has a lot of humanity to him as well. As his brother Bud, Madsen puts Uma Thurman through one of the most claustrophobic suspense scenes in film history (Madsen, so calm and relaxed, does his best acting since his ""Reservoir"" glory days). And Hannah squares off against Uma in a spectacular catfight, a battle to the death amongst 2 of the cinema's reigning 6-foot blonde goddesses. This is a great conclusion to the stylish Kill Bill revenge saga."

I wanted more flights of fancy, but seeing everything brought down to a level of human-ness took away from the magic and fantasy that filled ""Kill Bill Part 1."" It seems strange that QT would get soft on his story of revenge and his viewers. I was not particularly impressed with David Carradine's final scene in the film, either. Too cerebrally, not fantastic enough.<br/><br/>I also did not like how Elle Wood kills Bud, when I would have preferred to see ""Beatrix Kiddow"" get the job done.<br/><br/>Despite my disappointment with the film as a whole, I did like the scenes of ""Kiddow"" on the mountains with the white-haired guru.

","Q.T's kill bill vol. II, has accomplished a feat that most modern film students will strive to achieve over the next decade. This great film touches on the eternal theme of love and its complicated struggles, all through the symbolic world of serial assassins. Carradine portrays a stunning villain, who like many of Q.T.'s bad guys, we desire to associate with. Thurman herself continues the passion carried on from first part of the film. The ability of the film to blend genres and still maintain a complete and functional story and style is very commendable.Also, deeper meaning is a waiting for those willing and able to look for it.

","After almost writing Tarantino off after the first Bill movie, the second one was a pleasant surprise. There is more movie and less manic Kung Fu nonsense. David Carradine is great as the sly Bill and there are lots of great character bits. There were fewer long fight scenes, and there was actually a wealth of that depraved dialog that makes Tarantino films great. The epilogue scene was weak and useless, but what the heck, lots of good films have less than stellar moments. I still wish I could have watched a more compact 2.5 hour Bill movie, but wish in one hand...and, well, you know the rest. I see the second Bill movie ranks lower than the first in the top 250.

","Kill Bill 1 was a pretty good hack 'n slash action movie. (The storytelling is great, but the fight scenes take up too much of the film). Volume 2 is more ""sophisticated"". The storytelling is as good as in volume 1, but here the focus is more on the story than on kicking butt. This is all good. Tarantino again shows that he's got more creative braincells than half of all the other Hollywood-directors together. Of course he's also very fu..ed up. I bet he would give Charles Manson a run for his money if he wouldn't focus all his violent energy on film making. Let's hope he continues to do so. One wish though. If he could just give therapy one (more?) chance we could hope for some extremely interesting movies in the future. Not to get rid of the creative twist, but to see other areas in life that are interesting enough to make movies about. Not everything in life circles around crime, drugs and violence. Or does it? When on the topic obsession. Quentin, when will finally you ask Uma to ""become your bitch""?"

","""That woman deserves her revenge. And we all deserves to die. But then again, so does she.""<br/><br/>There is nothing more satisfying than feeling so much hatred for a character, and believing that there is nothing in this world that can make you feel sorry for him, only to have the director/writer change your mind at the very end. We don't know much about Bill from the first Kill Bill. All we know is that he is evil to the eyes of the world and to the eyes of his own Master. He wronged our heroine, and we wanted to see him die. He must not suffer to faith of a normal death too. We want to see him die by the hand of gorgeous and extremely talented Uma Thurman. And then... suddenly... we don't want to. Because Bill never deserve to die. The Bride does.<br/><br/>This is classic he said she said story. I felt like when I was listening to my friend talking about how bad some guy treated her, only to find out later that the truth is often different. <br/><br/>I know Tarentino has always been capable of deep and symbolic storyline. But I never thought he would put those type of stories into Kill Bill. Considering all the other over-the-top subplot. The main plot is consist of simple domestic misunderstanding and over-reaction that put the bloodbath into motion. What a great writing. And that is all Kill Bill Vol. 2 is. Great story. Volume one was all about action without a doubt. The fight scenes in part 2 doesn't top the first one (though there are several good ones still). There are a lot more talk, and even though problem are still being solve by force, there are much more understanding of the situation and critical thinking. More than a pointless (but cool) conversation that just simply link one scene to another.<br/><br/>Big Spoiler (because I want to discuss the ending)<br/><br/>The Bride deserve to die. But the fact that the baby was his, Bill changed his mind about killing her. And this whole thing happened because Bill allow it to happen out of guilt. If he had kill her, this whole thing would have been over with long ago. Bill did nothing wrong. Even the Bride knew she was wrong because she said at the end (though she was talking about something else, we all knew what she meant) that she is a bad person. Again, to invent a morally satisfying conclusion for a story of revenge is something that is so hard and, if pulled of successfully, is something that is very ingenious. <br/><br/>Earlier this year Tarentino sponsored the release of Hero, another movie that is revenge driven, but something that happened stop our heroes in their track. I saw that movie before Volume 2 was release and I thought to myself that if Tarentino like Hero, then there's no way Kill Bill would end with just simply Bill dying and Bride walk into the sunset.<br/><br/>This movie also raise a question as to why the Bride chose her daughter over Bill. They were both killers. She was just as dangerous to her baby as Bill would have been. They were living together as husband and wife. And he never harmed her. Why did she think she have the right to run away with his child? Because it is inside her? In our society, when men do not pay child support and/or simply abandon the child, we frown upon their act. Because the mother is the one stuck with the baby while the father can just run off. But in reverse situation, the mother cannot decide she's just going to push the father out of the picture.<br/><br/>And at the dinner table in the final battle scene, The Bride knew that she was wrong. And she killed all those people not because they are evil, but because they punished her. They punished her for her sin that she did not want to acknowledge. And she felt good. At that point, Bill and Bride cannot live as husband and wife. One of them has to die. Bill chose for her to live on. At the very end Bill said ""No you are not, You are a wonderful person."" Not because she did the right thing. But because he loves her. And the Bride said Thank You for giving her a second chance.<br/><br/>I gave Kill Bill vol. 1 10/10 because I thought it was a celebration of movie by experimenting different type of styles (from cartoon to black and white) with no care for realism. Combine with one cool scene after another, that movie was an instant classic. But I regret giving it that perfect score, not because it wasn't as good as I thought it was. It's just that volume 2 is so much better and I want to give it a higher score than the first one. I'm not one of those people who gives 11, so I guess I'll just have to settle for 10/10. But this movie reached the level of quality far beyond my expectation. Even if you hate the first one. You gotta see this movie.<br/><br/>Panasit"

","One major complaint I have with this movie...there isn't enough action. Most of the movie is just talking. Finding out information. All of that stuff. Don't get me wrong, it's great we're finding out all of this, but come on Quentin, liven it up a little more! In volume 1, Tarantino combined mysterious, seductive dialogue with eye-popping, heart-stopping action. In this volume, he settles down a bit, giving us some ""dangerous"" moments and too much talking.<br/><br/>[Mild Spoiler]<br/><br/>For instance, the conversations between the Bride and Bill are way too in depth, and ridiculous at some points. First, we have Bill talking about B.B. squishing a fish with her foot on accident. Then, we have Bill talking about Superman with the Bride while B.B.'s in bed. And Bill goes on and on and on about superman and various things... it's ridiculous. I would suggest cutting it short a little and bringing in some action sequences.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this movie is great! Just could be improved.

There are however long drawn out scenes that don't seem to have a great deal of significance, and could have easily been cut out to make one 3 hour long film (Matrix anyone?). Everyone says it is ruined by too much deep conversation, but I'd say it was the montage that did it for me."

","Without going into any plot-spoiler details for those who have not seen it, I found Kill Bill Vol.2 to be at points overly pretentious (like Vol.1), disgusting, and amusing. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed it overall. But what struck me most is some serious inconsistency in ""The Bride"" character vs. what was portrayed in Vol.1. For that reason alone, I couldn't enjoy this movie with the same level of surprise and amazement as its predecessor. Among my friends who piled heaping praise on Kill Bill Vol.2 (somewhat more so even than Kill Bill Vol.1), I have to wonder about the extent to which they have gotten caught up the hype and ""cool factor"" surrounding Tarantino movies, vs. really acknowledging the shortcomings and inconsistencies of Tarantino's plot development and characterization. Both these movies will probably leave you ""agreeing to disagree"" if you're a Tarantino-phile."

","In many ways, Kill Bill:Vol.2 is to the Kung Fu genre what Shrek 2 is to fairy tales. Although these are very different films, both spoof all previous movies of their type and are loaded with insider allusions (just look at the length of the IMDb trivia sections for each!). Both use latest technology to create a hyper-real quality which goes beyond their forerunners to create a feel that the viewer is seeing something that has not been seen before. But each also stays true to their genres' conventions of character and plot that, though seemingly worn out, we still love. As a result these movies satisfy, meeting some deep rooted needs but in novel and refreshing ways.<br/><br/>2004 may signal a trend in this kind of treatment of well treaded genres, with Westerns and Film Noir as other potential future candidates."

","Possible spoilers.<br/><br/>The Kill Bills really need to be watched one after the other for the best effect. I saw #1 a while back and was less favorable to it than after seeing them together.<br/><br/>I knew there were tributes to Asian martial arts movies in #1, but I'm not a big follower of those, so it wasn't until I saw #2 that I realized that there must have been quite a lot of references, because #2 is filled with Western tributes, mostly Spaghetti Western tributes. #2 has Leone written all over it, with even a dash of Peckinpah and Eastwood in the way scenes are staged, and you can hear Morricone's haunting epic music a mile away. I love catching on to references like that and Tarantino has gotten real good at it. <br/><br/>#2 is probably the better half. There's much more dialog, the sort of dialog that Tarantino does so well. and enough action to keep things going, including another Battle of the Bad*ss *itches with Thurman vs. Hannah, as well as a claustrophobic segment that I didn't know about that also worked as a good tie-in to Uma's martial arts training. #1 has some classic scenes besides just fights, though, that entertained me. The whole big scene leading up to the Crazy 88s battle has all kinds of things going on that you don't see the 1st time. 9/10 for both when seen together.<br/><br/>Both DVDs have extras, but #2 has the best with a Making Of and some premiere night music. I'm tempted to buy a movie just because it has a DTS soundtrack so the fact that both of these do is icing on the cake. Thus the DVDs also get a 9/10 but perhaps a bit weaker 9. You can see a combined Ultimate Special Edition coming with this duo as there must be more stuff they're holding back on, milking the DVD buyers with multiple releases I'm happy with these so it would have to be really something to tempt me.<br/><br/>I read some of the comments so-called professional critics made panning these movies. They just don't get it. Most of the discouraging words are about the blood and guts, but I thought segments like the Crazy 88s were cartoonish, just like the wirework in that segment, and was deliberate overkill to keep it from looking real. How can you take those blood sprays seriously? At least I think thats what Tarantino was up to, but I didn't ask him. Maybe he just likes to gross out wimpy movie critics. I mean so what if Lucy Liu gets a real deep buzzcut Some dissed him for lifting characters from old movies which is really a dumb*ss comment since he did it on purpose."
"MF210","10","0","1","15 November 2004"," Tarantino really is a maserful filmmaker
","My Rating: **** out of ****. <br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill films can take their place as one of the best series in the history of film. Kill Bill Volume 1 and Volume 2 truly highlight(even more than his other films), how much he loves movies. These two films show his mastery of the medium. With these films, Tarantino is basically taking everything from the movies (or maybe the genres) he loves and mixing them together to form something fresh, which he has accomplished.<br/><br/>However, Tarantino's two films are radically different in tone. Volume 1 was a masterful kung-fu homage with some spaghetti western thrown in. That film showed that Tarantino was skillful in crafting action sequences and creating his most visually stunning film yet. It was a masterpiece and an instant classic. <br/><br/>Kill Bill Volume 2 is something different. Its mostly a spaghetti western with a little kung fu thrown in. While Tarantino shoots some great action sequences here, Volume 2 is not as concerned with action as its predecessor was. Instead, this film focuses on characters, dialogue and an emotional impact. <br/><br/>Out of all Tarantino's previous films, Volume 2 has more in common with the underrated Jackie Brown than Volume 1. Both films slowed their pace in order to develop their characters and both were going for a more emotional impact than any other of Tarantino's films. Volume 1's main purpose was to be a great thrill ride and give us a glimpse of things to come later on in the story. <br/><br/>Even though Volume 2 is more concerned with an emotional impact, it still has some thrilling scenes. There is a scene where The Bride is buried alive that is brilliantly filmed and as a result gives off a claustrophobic feel. We feel like were in the coffin with the bride. Also, the fight sequence between The Bride and Elle Driver is an exhilarating sequence. It may not quite be up to the final battle in Volume 1, but its damn close.<br/><br/>Another individual who deserves a lot of credit in making these films is Cinematographer Robert Richardson. Richardson's work on Volume 1 was just gorgeous and while is work here isn't as impressive, he still shines. The style is more subdued here but Richardson's camera-work during the Bride/Elle fight scene is terrific. He is also able to recapture the look of old kung fu films in one brilliant sequence (The Bride's training sequence with the treacherous Pei Mei). Richardson's work on these films is brilliant and he should get more credit. <br/><br/>Now we come to the emotional part of the film. The Brides quest is finally coming to the end. She is in Bills apartment about to shoot him when something unbelievably shocking is revealed to her: Her daughter that she believed was killed when she was shot is alive. the look on The Brides face is truly heartbreaking. The sequences with her and her daughter are touching. This is what she started killing for and now she has what she thought she lost four years ago. <br/><br/>Then there is the Bill/Bride situation. Oh I forgot to mention, she has a name: Beatrix Kiddo. The fight sequence at the end between them is more words than action. It isn't extremely satisfying on a visceral level but it is satisfying on an emotional level. These two no matter what they did to each other still cared about each other and a huge, epic battle would have cheapened their feelings for each other. <br/><br/>The acting is outstanding in all corners. Uma Thurman is just brilliant in this role. She shows the Bride was a more complex woman than we were lead to believe. Whether she does get an Oscar Nomination or not is in question, but she deserves it. <br/><br/>Michael Madsen turns in truly spectacular work too. This man is not some fodder for her to kill, his Budd is also more complex than I expected. Daryl Hannah is marvelous here. She plays against type as a cold, ruthless killer. Hannah removes all image of her nice girl roles here. <br/><br/>The standout is definitely David Carradine. Carradine is just sensational here. He opens Bill up, this is not some cartoonish figure with shallow motivations. He comes across as a real, deep person. Carradine deserves not only a nomination for his work, but the Oscar. <br/><br/>Kill Bill Volume 2 shows Tarantino at his best. His direction is flawless and he is back to writing dialogue. His dialogue here, while not ""classic"" Tarantino, is solidly written. Overall, Volume 2 is equally as accomplished as Volume 1 and these two together are a masterful saga."
"nitratestock35","Null","0","1","14 November 2004"," couldn't be better (contains mild spoilers)
","Of course both parts of kill Bill are actually one movie so I take the liberty referring to both parts emphasizing on part 2.<br/><br/>I like this movie so much because I can see no compromise, no hollywoodization, not a shred of it. Tarantino remains faithful to underground and indie movie making, but the photography and sound are both impeccably done and of the finest quality.<br/><br/>I love the wackyness of it. I already screamed laughing - in a happy way - when I saw the opening of Volume 1. A typical early 1970s title card saying ""feature presentation"" together with low quality distorted and whining (due to worn out machinery and prints that happened sometimes) trashy period music which ends with that typical noise coming from poor splices in optical sound tracks which were still widely used until a short time ago. The timing of this bit is so well done that we can expect that everything that follows during both parts will be that good. It is.<br/><br/>Tarantino trashes and loves every material at the same time. The choice of music is impeccable ranging from James Last/Gheorge Zamfir 1970s elevator muzak to these shrill synthesizer sounds used in 70s Kung Fu flicks. The Japanese female 1950s style rock 'n' roll band is too good to be true.<br/><br/>I don't know how Tarantino and his editor make it but the editing is just perfect. This is a mix of tempos, styles and lighting that probably violates all rules ever written - and it works. Tarantino did't fall in love with camera gimmicks though. Yes there is that typical 1970s fast zooming-in complete with the sloppy focussing, but Tarantino uses it very sparingly and more controlled. The whole two part movie also has us thinking about our own taste. We have to admit that secretly we like many thinks about what is officially considered bad taste. Not all of it that is.<br/><br/>I also like the fact that it is not Thurman herself disposing off Michael madson the stip club bouncer and the typical loser,loner,cowboy. He is too much of an American icon, also: except for Bill himself this is all about women. The story finds a great way to kill off Madson.<br/><br/>Of course the movie only works because of Uma Thurman. Tarantino practically constructed the movie around her. She is the movie. Thurman can be arrogant and deeply hurt at the same time, she is pure eye candy yet she has that edge necessary for her role. No matter how much of a superhero and ruthless killer she is, the moment where she is reunited with her daughter works completely. The trash movie spoof is lifted for a moment and her weeping and screaming of pure joy and relief in the bathroom for a moment is genuine - just as some few moments during the movie were such as when she was buried alive and tried to get out, but that still was within an absurd surreal context. Maybe Tarantino was trashing the movie ""The Vanishing"" in a way: that's what Kiefer Sutherland should have been doing...<br/><br/>Anyway it shows how much Tarantino controls the level of reality/absurdity and spoof. Nothing is left to chance. <br/><br/>I like the way the genuine tenderness is maintained during the end titles which are done in early 1950s style complete with period lettering and back projection plate, all in black and white. The level of spoof/trashing is only mild here and the mood remains happy, yet with a winking eye (literally BTW).<br/><br/>This is not made by someone greedy or full of himself. This is brilliant who loves movies with style. I like the fact that Tarantino never tries to be intellectual or artsy. He remains firmly in his own wacky world close to Sergio Leone's. <br/><br/>I wouldn't change one frame in any of the two Kill Bill parts."
"rodew","10","0","1","13 November 2004"," Movie-making that delivers a great story
","***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>OK so if you are a fan of Vol 1, then the expectation for Vol 2 is for more action like the first and a final intense climactic fight scene where Bill dies and the Bride barely lives. What this movie delivers is the rest of the story while telling the whole story. I liked Kill Bill Vol 1 because of the superb fight scenes, the Bride's single-minded intensity for revenge, and the homage paid to the 70's kung fu/karate film genre. What I did not understand was who she was, how she got there and why was she beaten and left for dead. Bill's answer, ""I over-reacted"", is as classic a movie line as "" dying ain't a good way to make a living"" (outlaw josey wales). <br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol 2 was a phenomenal adventure in story telling. I wish that there was more scenes with Pai Mei and the Bride training, I wish there was a scene were the Bride dismembers the pipsqueak who helped bury her alive, and honestly, a scene that defines or establishes Bill and the Bride's relationship (why did he choose her in the first place, especially over Vivica Fox and Lucy Liu who were much better looking). Also, the Bride carries significant respect around the world (the world's most dangerous woman), I appreciated knowing that near the end, but it would have been better to have that knowledge brought forth in some fashion, like Oren Ishii's anime story. I like Uma but I could not fathom how she could go from overdosed woman on the lawn (pulp fiction) to this uncanny killer (vol 1). Vol 2 brought this home for me.<br/><br/>I thought the acting was exceptional by Madsen, Uma, and even Darryl Hannah (a long way from Splash). Superb scenes: the Hanzo sword in the golf bag; the bride walking across the street with dirt being blown off after digging her way out; the bride being blown away with rock salt(?)shotgun pellets; the cruel tutelage of Pai Mei; Elle reading about the Black Mamba venom as Budd writhes on the floor.<br/><br/>Interesting plot lines: Budd selling the Bride's sword for 1 million; Budd not killing her with real shotgun shells; Budd taking that crap from that scummy owner; Budd disrespecting Elle before counting his money; how Elle is even still in the picture(was she a protege also, until she poisoned Pai Mei?); the brides name.<br/><br/>Questionable: why guns in this movie?; how did the Bride know her baby was alive or what she looked like?; Samuel L. Jackson is wasted; when do we learn that The Bride is Black Mamba?; and most questionable- why did the Bride leave Bill in the first place?<br/><br/>Her story seemed quite selfish, although it was superbly enacted in the movie. His answer, although incredibly long-winded, was helpful for me and I actually agreed with his other classic movie line, ""when a murderous bastard over reacts, what do you expect would happen"". Bill was saddened that the love of his life and his prized protege had died (or so he thought)and was angered to find her alive, due to give birth to their child, and getting married to a total loser. Chris Rock would say of Bill's actions: ""I don't agree with his tactics, but I can understand his mindset""<br/><br/>Finally, as I did with Pulp Fiction, I assimilated the entire Kill Bill story in my mind and fashioned that, although the story telling is disjointed and incongruous, the story is utterly fascinating with a great moral: If you are going to kill the love of your life because you found out she did not die, but she just left you to have a baby and attempt to have a normal life, and she happens to be the most significantly dangerous, skillful, ruthless and cold-blooded assassin on the planet, then your days are numbered if she survives. As Budd states, another classic movie line: ""the woman deserves her revenge and we deserve to die"""

","They had to be kidding.<br/><br/>To consider KB2 as better than KB1 (or, for that matter, any film) cannot be more wrong.<br/><br/>It seems that QT had run out of ideas when it came time to make part 2. The first was a thrill ride from the beginning, a feast of bright, bold colours, it was unpretentious and it was fun. The soundtrack was superb, especially the opening song (by Nancy Sinatra) and the set by the 5, 6, 7, 8s. And even though you might say that there was a bit too much red in it, it was grayed (aha) by the shift to b&w bits. And even though it was a bit hard to consider UT as a believable assassin - oh I bet she must be a good actress, but her character was weak - for its overall creativity and entertainment value, KB1 gets 4 of 5 stars.<br/><br/>On the other hand, KB2 drags in the beginning, and keeps dragging on 45 minutes later. And then after 2 hours it still drags. I didn't think anything could have the energy to drag on for over two hours. It's not like the dialogue was a joy to listen to, to merit all of that screen time. The writing is hardly satisfying. And, can I just say, the Bride is too emotional to be an assassin. All of the stuff she used to get out of impossible predicaments seem contrived. Sure, you can say that you shouldn't pigeonhole assassins. You can't put them in a box. But oh, please. She very easily, and so often, forgets her training, panics a lot, and she's not really into calm and calculated planning, either. The obvious lack of skill was forgivable in part 1, but the mental weakness in part 2 was just unspeakable. Are we sure she can even kill a rat? Much less kill bill. The colours were gone, the inventiveness disappeared. The only good parts (agh! Not even the soundtrack!) were the very cool DH (as Elle Driver, how an assassin should be), and the end song by Shivaree. Really, they should have buried this one with Paula Schultz."

","To me, when a movie audience either hates or loves a movie, that's a good indication that the movie probably is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>In Kill Bill you probably don't have a middle section, either you will love it or hate it.<br/><br/>Back in the 70s, after the legendary Bruce Lee's death, there was a boom on Chinese kung-fu films, fast action, full of violence and Bruce Lee's wannabes, they were the main juice on oriental movie theaters.<br/><br/>Kill Bill captures this time.. and then.... so much more. Its a ""70's Chinese kung fu movie"", a ""Kurosawa classic"", a ""spaghetti western"" re-visited, a ""Manga cartoon""... all that wrapped up in a fast-paced action movie, very well directed with superb soundtrack and magnificent fighting sequences.<br/><br/>I must say that this is the best movie Quentin made since the classic ""Pulp Fiction"". Some people won't understand it, others won't stand it, but many will love it, cause its one of those movies made with such good taste and so many subtle details, that will soon become a classic.<br/><br/>The cast was carefully selected, only ""Uma Thurman"" could play ""Black Mamba"" in such a way. She's fragile and deadly, innocent and ruthless at the same time. Uma always had that flexibility in all of her movies, and Kill Bill is no exception.<br/><br/>Sonny Chiba as ""Hatori Hanzo"" is perfect, the dialogue between him and Uma is one of the most memorial moments in movie history. He's the perfect samurai, a humble barman and yet the best blacksmith in Okinawa.<br/><br/>Beautiful Lucy Liu delivers one of her best performances (the Japanese garden scene is one to be remembered forever, Darryl Hannah makes a unique and great comeback (and looks hot in nurse uniform), Michael Madsen usual is icy and subtle as a rattlesnake and ""Kung-Fu TV classic"" series David Carradine is perfect as the cool, mature and deadly ""Bill"".<br/><br/>To review Kill Bill part 1 and 2 separately is a mistake, both are only 1 movie and should be watched one after the other (same goes for Lord of the Rings trilogy, in my opinion).<br/><br/>Just as Kubrik and Polanski, Tarantino is the master of one thing, ATMOSPHERE.... you really get sucked into his creations, forgetting real life for a moment and live a unique experience.<br/><br/>Thumb's up to one of the best directors of our time."

","There are certain movies that are just so amazing you almost can't review them because what can you say that hasn't already been said? Such is the case with Kill Bill. In fact my review of Pulp Fiction was quite short as well. Terrentino's movies are so brilliant in their making that even if you don't like them you gotta be awed at the not so simple task of making these movies. And in the case of this one, there isn't one performance that isn't Oscar worthy. And I think it deserves it's place in the IMDb top 250 even more then Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is a movie I enjoyed throughly and part two is more my thing then one because I am simply more into talky dialog driven movies then movies with less talk and more violence but since 1 and 2 are part of the same film basically spread out over time, I Don't suppose it matters. Nothing brilliant to add-it's all been said. <br/><br/>BUT A FEW SPOILERS NOW: <br/><br/>My favorite scenes may have been where the bride trains with Pai Mei and the non verbal as well as verbal interaction between them. I sorta wish all performers in this could win Oscars. Just one interesting note to those who may not have seen this.<br/><br/>The best films are actually stories that come to life in such a vivid way that they cease to become movies and become a true to life story unfolding in front of you. Kill Bill could be a walking advertisement for such a film. Call it twisted, odd, call it talky, call it violent and unnecessarily brutal(And part two IS violent have no doubt about it). It is all the things mentioned. But it is also an intense movie where the characters are so real you feel like you can reach out and touch them. The direction is perfect and you are with the bride on her heartbreaking journey every step of the way. There isn't one scene in the movie that could have been done any better.<br/><br/>The movie is upsetting, to be sure, and will haunt you for days afterward. But the most interesting thing is how hooked you will become without knowing you are hooked. For anything about the movie someone may not enjoy, (if indeed there are any), If you decide to walk out, there will probably come a point when you just won't able to. Great script. Q & U did good!"

","Kill Bill Vol. Two is a great sequel. It is interesting, as well as action packed. It was as good as the first, if not better. It has more plot twists than the first movie, and also explains some things from the first movie that was hard to understand.<br/><br/>In Kill Bill Vol. 2 the bride continues her mission to kill Bill. With two assassins out of the way, she only has two more to go before she gets to Bill. She hunts down Budd (Michael Madsen), Bills little brother, and then goes for Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah). Before she gets to Bill she learns that her daughter, that she thought she lost, was actually alive. Bill was the father of this child and now has the girl. Will this stop the bride from killing Bill, or will she have no compassion when she gets to his lair in Mexico? <br/><br/>I think this movie was very good. It would have been better if it was one movie instead of two. I watched both movies one after the other and it was much better. Then it seems like one great movie. It has many twists in the second movie that are so important. They could change the decision of the bride or not. She has vowed revenge against Bill, but will she succeed? If you like movies, then you would want to see Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2. They will keep you on the edge of you seat and wanting more."

","This movie was a more story telling movie than the original which was basically just an action movie made to entertain from scene 1. While this movie wade to be as exciting as the original it was definitely made to be a better movie which it was. I mean a movie doesn't have to be people cutting each other to pieces to be an exciting movie which is exactly what this movie portrayed. Daryl Hannah (Elle Driver) was very good in her role as was Michael Madsen (Budd). David Carradine (Bill) was alright but didn't really live up to the expectations of The Brilliant ""Bill"". Samuel L. Jackson did a wicked cameo which I think gave the movie a bit of a kick for that chapter. But of course as you would expect if you haven't seen this Uma Thurman is the best actor and does every thing very well. I personally think Quentin Tarantino will be very happy with himself and the two movies."

"kmfolkpunk","Null","0","1","25 September 2004"," Analysis of Kill Bill Vol.2
","The more I see this movie the more I like it. Tonight I really got into the camera work. Way too many over the shoulder camera shots. It made me wish Tarantino included an Ozu film or 2 in this homage orgy. (Which, lets face it, is what Kill Bill is). There is this one shot in the wedding rehearsal scene that showed the back of Rufus's head, the Bride, Plimpton and a couple of her friends all in deep focus. It really reminded me of the opening shot of the suicide attempt in Citizen Kane where it shows the the bottle, the glass with the spoon in it, Susan and Charles Foster Kane bursting in the room all on a 70 to 80 degree angle. Gregg Toland is crying for joy somewhere. <br/><br/>I really like this movie mainly because I like westerns. I appreciate shots like the one that showed the Bride walking from the grave to Budd's trailer. I like the long takes. The opening scene with the Bride driving was great film noir (another genre I like). I think people were disappointed with this one because they wanted another ""Kill Bill Vol. 1""; all blood, guts and quick editing. <br/><br/>Another thing I like is the dialogue. The writing in here is more classical prose as opposed to the hard-boiled stuff used in ""Resevoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction."" I especially like the monologues on the Black Mamba snake, the story of Pei Mei and the Superman myth. Many people want the dialogue to be similar to Pulp Fiction. Please. People seem to forget that Bill, Elle Driver and the Bride are millionaire assassins, not low-rent criminals like Vincent Vega or Mr. Pink. Millionaire assassins do not talk like those kinds of people. You can imagine discussing ""La Dolce Vita"" or Noh theatre with Bill or Elle or even O-Ren. And if you lived to tell the tale, well then that would be something."
"hencole","Null","0","1","21 September 2004"," Not impressed.
","Oh dear. Having thought that the first Volume was tripe I didn't hold up much for this. The dialog was so unengaging as to mystify me as to why it takes up vast swathes of this film. Action there was little which is no bad thing judging by the comedic and poor fight scenes from the first film. A complete mess of a movie which swaps chronography around for no reason whatsoever, has characters I presume you are supposed to relate to, but have no hope in doing (unless you are perhaps and assassin). I would have thought that in a revenge movie empathising with the lead character would be a pre-requisite, but not here. Therefore you don't care what Uma does, in fact I wish she'd never woken up from her coma. The end was as awful as they come. Could easily have been done as one film, but should have been less than that."
"Jaft","Null","0","1","12 September 2004"," True Tarantino
","Tarantino, a man that could be nick-named the Human Roller-coaster, does perfectly what every other director struggles to do. He takes you on a ride, and leaves you wanting more. And he does not sell the viewer a bid of goods and expects them to be satisfied. He makes sure that every detail in the movie is brought out and nothing contradicts itself. His genius spills out even to the music in his films. I dare someone to go into this movie and pick out something that is not a tribute to something. Tarantino is at the top of his game in this film and no one could ever think that he is going to decline in his movie making glory. If you think that this movie is a bust with lack of plot and substance, you obviously no nothing about the history of Hollywood movies. Tarantino has nowhere else to go but up."
"gilmoresmore","Null","0","1","12 September 2004"," A great finale to a great revenge epic.
","Quentin Tarantino's second half of his epic is a true mark of a master filmmaker at his best. While the first film pays tribute to the highly stylize revenge films of the seventies, the last half pays tribute to the dark and complex films that made the seventies such a celebrated time in cinema. The story progresses into a moody and complex film about violence, honor and human frailty that is a true treat to behold. Any other filmmaker would have kept the pace of the first film by adding more violence but Tarantino gives a human aspect to the last half of his epic and makes his over the top characters more human and more complex in order to give the revenge aspect of the film a little more meaning. Uma Thurman once again is great as our heroine who still is after the man who wronged her and David Carradine is great as her nemesis Bill and he adds a funny, touching and yet menacing aspect to his character that makes his demise a real treat to wait for. This is a real classic in Pulp cinema and Quentin Tarantino cements his mark in cinematic history with this fine epic that will be celebrate for years to come."

","I own the DVD, and just now I watched it for the second time. And I find it even better than the first time I watched it (if that's even possible). Now I got to notice a lot of little details that I didn't saw the first time. And all scenes, both action and dramatical ones, are just perfect. I really liked the first movie, and this volumen 2 is just as perfect as vol. 1, but on its own right. It's very different from the first movie, and there, I think, lies its value and the genius of it all. It is not a xerox copy of the first movie. Both movies are perfect on their own manner. I've noticed most people who don't like vol. 2, is because of it lack of action scenes. Well, that's a plus for me. Tarantino, the genius that he is, didn't try to repeat the same formula, creating just a clone.., he took the plot to a whole new level, where we can see the characters' development and depth. And the few actions scenes.... well... they are incredible. I'm just sad the story ended...."
"bsinc","8","0","1","12 September 2004"," Now that's more like it
","I frankly didn't like ""Vol.1"" that much because it border lined on an average, although banal script and because of the amount of overdoing it with those chopped hands and feet in the end. But ""Vol. 2"" is sooooo much better. Gone is the uncomfortable and unconvincing feeling of watching a Tarantino movie (because let's face the truth - that's what it is and that's why we're there watching it) and in come those magnificent (Oscar worthy even) monologues and the true feeling of spoofing old Asian martial arts movies. Also the antagonist characters are much much more interesting and believable to watch. But most important of all, the humor is back on track and the acting is all together quite excellent. David Carradine's character of Bill would make every girl's panties wet in a flash in real life because everything he says sounds just so unbelievably interesting and true. I'd want to go and fight him in that beautiful moonlight down on that sandy beach because his gentle words were that convincing. Amazing job quite frankly. Michael Parks as Esteban Vihaio is another great example of a supporting role, as well as comedic talent. His lines are drop dead funny.<br/><br/>So the comparison to ""Vol. 1"" is quite unnecessary. The first one simply laid the tracks, even if in a rather mediocre way. The second one has everything else. Truly brilliant monologues (Superman's perception on humanity being my favorite), great sense of humor, quite astonishing performances (Uma plays the part with style) and loads of fun.8/10"
"ed_metal_head","8","0","1","11 September 2004"," Would Be Better As One Film
","'Kill Bill: Vol. 2' is the second and final part of Quentin Tarantino's tale of revenge. As has been well documented, 'Kill Bill' was supposed to be one film, however studio concerns over a three hour film meant that it was split into two 'volumes'.<br/><br/>This film begins where the last one ended. The Bride (Uma Thurman) having already dispatched Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) now seeks out the two remaining members of her would be assassination squad - Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and Budd (Michael Madsen) - along with their leader and her ultimate goal: Bill (David Carradine). <br/><br/>As was the case with Vol. 1, Vol. 2 is told in chapters that do not always occur in chronological order. However, Vol. 2 is more linear than the first part was (scenes that are out of order tend to be flashbacks). The pace of this film is, surprisingly, much slower than Vol. 1. Tarantino wisely eschews the gallons of fake blood and focuses on the story and the development of the characters. The result is that the cast get more of a chance to display their acting talents and they duly oblige with some fine performances. With less action, it also means that this film is more verbose than the first part. Unfortunately, the dialogue is not the classic Quentin Tarantino type (with the exception of Bill who has some great lines), it rather serves to further the plot and fill the back-story of the characters.<br/><br/>Tarantino's direction in this film is not too different from the first part (as it should be since this is really one film). Some scenes are still shot in black and white, but this time it feels like they were done for style rather than to diminish the on screen violence. Tarantino also manages to create a memorable moment by changing the film's aspect ratio during a claustrophobic scene, giving the viewer a better feel for the situation of the character. <br/><br/>Visually, Vol. 2 is quite appealing, but it never reaches the beauty of the first part. This is not the result of the cinematography (which is still excellent), but rather due to the colour palette which is not as broad as in Vol. 1. Thankfully, the fake blood effects of the first part are gone and are replaced with blood that looks more genuine, so that when fight scenes do occur they feel more realistic.<br/><br/>Where Vol. 2 really shines is with its acting performances. Uma Thurman gets to show off a broad range of emotions as The Bride and she does so effectively. The way she shows the suffering of her character is truly award-worthy. The actors that play the two assassins she faces in this film (Hannah and Madsen) are definitely a huge improvement from the actors in the last film (Fox and Liu). Of the two, Madsen's performance is the better as he plays Budd with great restraint, which is a surprising trait of his character. Hannah does her job solidly  although she never really has to do anything other than be a badass. David Carradine (better known for the 'Kung-Fu' series) gives the best performance of this movie as Bill. Carradine does not only have a great on screen presence, but he also delivers his dialogue flawlessly throughout. Michael Parks and Gordon Liu, who both acted in the first film, return as different characters in this part. However, both fit into their roles so well that it is virtually impossible to recognise them.<br/><br/>The original Kill Bill was supposed to be 180 minutes, however after it was split, Vol. 1 was 111 minutes and Vol. 2 was 136 minutes meaning both films are a total of 247 minutes. The fact that some 67 minutes combined were added to both films accounts for most of the faults of Vol. 2 (and to a lesser extent Vol. 1) since too many scenes feel out of place and like they should have been cut from the final version.<br/><br/>Generally, Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a fine motion picture. However, if the original film was not split into two it might have been great."

","Although most people seem to rate Volume 2 as the lesser film, there is no way QT could have come out with a blood-splattered, ultra-violent exact replica of Volume 1 - what would have been the point? Instead what we get is a more thoughtful film, albeit with the odd eyeball-plucking here and there.<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>The body count in Volume 2 drops substantially from the first (from 41 down to 3) which is a very welcome addition really - there's just no need for a repeat of the Crazy 88 scene at all. What we DO get however are some top-notch action scenes with, dare I say it, a little more class - the eye plucking being a particular highlight, the Black Mamba biting and the subsequent speech by Elle also a standout, along with The Bride being buried alive - admittedly done quite a few times before in other films, but what hasn't in a QT film?<br/><br/>A few points to consider - just where did the Black Mamba go in the 15 minute interlude between biting Budd and showing up near the end of that scene?, why make the subtitles almost unreadable? (copying off other films with yellow text, I presume), and just what purpose did the Mexican pimp and his messed up prostitute serve to the film?<br/><br/>But showing 'Shogun Assassin' to a 4-year-old, and killing her father in the back garden only 20 metres from her bedroom, certainly qualifies as dark humour in my book. Top stuff.<br/><br/>I'm sure there are a few people out there who do prefer Volume 2 to Volume 1 - me included."

","Pump up the volume! Pump up the volume! Pump up the volume! Kill Bill!<br/><br/>That is what masterful director Quentin Tarantino does in the exhilarating ""Kill Bill Volume 2"". Various questions are answered in this version so there is no doubt that you will get your kicks out of Volume 2. Uma Thurman returns as ""The Bride"", the vengeful martial arts master who continues her quest to, you got it, kill Bill. Those of you who experienced Volume 1, know that she had her ""Bill of Rights"" to do that after what Sir William did to her in the dress wedding rehearsal. Along her vengeful voyage, she still possesses the need to liquidate some of Bill's associates: Budd (a.k.a. Swidewinder) & Elle Driver (a.k.a. California Mountain Snake). Tarantino budd, I mean bud, Michael Madsen was cool as a Bud Light with his performance. Daryl Hannah as the California Mountain Snake was venomous with her sly work also. Both are deserving of Supporting Actor noms. However, let's kick it up a notch; the sharpest supporting work of ""Volume 2"" was beheaded by no other than the ""King Fu"" himself David Carradine as Bill. Let's not forget about our temperamental bride: Uma Thurman should get her comeuppance by being nominated for a Best Actress Oscar after being snubbed for Volume 1. Memo to the Academy: You do not want to p*ss her off! Just ask Bill! Volume 2 does have its arduous lapses but it is incorporated for the sake of the story. Tarantino's ingenious dialogue is what still drives his films, and it is no different here in ""Kill Bill: Volume 2"". So get up and go biller blading by viewing ""Kill Bill: Volume 2"". **** Good"

","What I like about the BILL movies so much is how QT drops itty bitty pieces of information and he uses it as a *plant* while he self-indulges in action and bloodbaths (Ok, we know the Bride is deadly, she can pull eyes outta people's sockets) - and then the payoff comes when we get the Pai Mei training sequence. - Oh, so that's how she managed to cut through those 27 some body guards<br/><br/>Death List Five.<br/><br/>She coulda killed them all easily and QT coulda used different methods for their massacre... yes, easily killed them. But what's also great is this nice contrast in rhythm and pace the both films have, and the fact that the plot never does seem redundant:<br/><br/>The sh** happens moments in VOL. 2 when B. gets shot with rock salt... or the unexpected turn when Elle poisons Budd.<br/><br/>You hear comments from fans (or fan-boys) who state that all the DVa's should have been extensively ""characterized"" as O-Ren? THAT WOULD HAVE MADE THE FILM REDUNDANT! And besides, didn't anyone love how O-Ren's exposition revealed what the genealogy of KILL BILL would be(a ongoing tale of bloody revenge)<br/><br/>While the film is more talky than not, and a lot of heavy OTN at that; it has its trailer moments of action... action in V2 isn't overblown but it still rivets attention and awe from the viewer when QT blends his images with the music from Westerns like Navajoe Joe, The Good the Bad and the Ugly and this track called ""Silhouette of Doom"" which plays in the film's film noir recap intro and in the gruesome 'eye for an eye' scene in the chapter called ELLE AND I<br/><br/>Its also got the flavor of the cheesy oldies rear-screen projection; rear-screen thats B&W with colored F.G. elements. Also the different film stock and Chinese Shaw Bro. crash zooms in the Pai Mei chapter. Its a mainstream film that has the flavor of NONMAINSTREAM movies. Had Michael Bay directed this, it would have been CHARLIE'S ANGELS.<br/><br/>But its directed by Quentin Tarantino. He's a weirdo and a psycho. But a bona-fide weirdo and whack job at that.

The Viper Squad really went to pieces after ""The Bride"" realizes that Budd, Bill's brother lied about selling his katana. And I thought it was cool when Elle lost her right to her master. And Bill warned ""The Bride"". And Elle poisoned the master in the process for the loss of her eye. The movie did tone down the blood violence, but it packed it a lot of detail into every scene. I liked the part when Elle betrayed Budd, with a mamba-lace million dollar luggage in order to find ""The Bride"". Then in the short sword fight, she was blind, indefinitely! It was cool when The Bride squashed Elle's left eye! It was creepy for some, but not to me! At least she fulfilled her prophecy: To KILL BILL! Man, was this movie action-packed or what?

","It is unfortunate that the greatest and most stunning works by the most brilliant directing minds in cinema, are never honored until years after they have wrought their masterpieces, and loosed them upon the world. We may now count Quentin Tarantino in that esteemed company, as KILL BILL, VOL. 2 brings his four-hour opus to its stunning and unexpectedly moving climax.<br/><br/>Viewing both volumes together back-to-back is a revelation; you finally come to understand why Tarantino meant his epic to be experienced in one sitting. True, he has used this film as a playground to indulge in his wildest Saturday-morning-Shaolin-slasher-spaghetti-western fantasies, complete with a literally orgiastic streak of over-the-top violence and gore. But for those willing to peer beneath the trappings (and what most would consider travesties), is the single most important element that sweetens the sour blood-and-bile fueled revenge that powers The Bride like a post-feminist Energizer Bunny with a Blade...the redeeming and overwhelming power of love.<br/><br/>I've read some posts that actually liken this to some of the great relationship dramas like ""Kramer Vs. Kramer"" or ""Ordinary People"", and as sick or off the mark as these comparisons may be, trust me on this one: actually, they're not. And that is about as much as I can say without dropping the spoiler that ties both parts of KB together.<br/><br/>I've already ranted enough about QT as an auteur; what deserves just as many kudos is the eye and the feel he has for selecting exactly the right actors for the right roles. As the benevolent-yet-malevolent Bill, David Carradine will probably never again have a role of this caliber in the remainder of his career. Ditto the fearless Michael Madsen as Bud, and Daryl Hannah, who erases whatever sympathy we felt for her in BLADE RUNNER by playing supreme snake-bitch Elle Driver with balls-to-the-wall panache, and whose comeuppance is about as gruesome and fitting as anything you'd find in other QT films.<br/><br/>And then, there's Uma. Not even Meryl Streep could show as much passion and complete commitment to a role as Uma has done with The Bride, and Meryl is considered the best we have; our American equivalent of a Dame Judi Dench or an Emma Thompson. Because so many members of the Academy will be turned off by the ""fanboy-fantasia"" portion of KB, they may never even notice how with seeming effortlessness and uncanny grace, she crosses every emotional boundary an actress can in a single role, and then travels the arc again backwards, charting The Bride's trial-by-fire and transformation from vengeful Valkyrie, to someone so tender and loving that it seems impossible to find those dualities existing in the same persona.<br/><br/>Which brings us back to the very spine of this revenge/passion play. Even in the midst of people so seemingly evil and unredeemable, that you'd never want to get within three hundred miles of them in real life, it's all about love. How its loss can wound us, twist us, tear us apart, destroy our lives and drive us to seek to destroy others. And how finding it, whether for the first time or for that most fortunate of second chances, can transform, heal and uplift us in ways that no words in our language can accurately describe.<br/><br/>But then again, hasn't that always been one of the hallmarks of QT's work?<br/><br/>I hope that in my lifetime, this gifted filmmaker does truly receive the recognition he deserves. And not when he's nearly on his deathbed or in a wheelchair.<br/><br/>For KILL BILL, in its entirety: Five Stars. My highest recommendation."
"rainking_es","8","0","1","15 August 2004"," Tarantino, the one-eyed...
","Some critics say that Tarantino is nothing but a copycat. A guy with huge cinematographic knowledges that copies scenes and arguments from other movies that are completely unknown for most of the people (so nobody is gonna accuse him of copying something from a movie that no one's has seen). I agree with that up to a point, because he has ""stolen"" stuff from other movies since the very beginning. He's the kind of artist that ""inspires"" himself looking other's people work; but he's not the first, and won't be the last. Bowie did it, Warhol did it too, the Rolling Stones, even Picasso did. Hey, I'm not comparing Tarantino to that people, because for me Quentin Tarantino is not a genius (neither Warhol): for me is just a very smart guy, so talented, and so smart. He's just taking advantage of the fact that Hollywood only makes rubbish. So, as it's said here in Spain: in the land of the deaf, the one-eyed is the King. So, that's what Tarantino is: the one-eyed. He'd hardly stand out from 1930 to 1975. OK, let's talk about Kill Bill Vol.2:<br/><br/>There's this saying ""after the storm the calm comes"". Kill Bill Vol.1 was the storm, the explosion, the action; and Kill Bill Vol.2 is the calm, the drama, less dynamic, but much more intense (emotionally intense). In Vol.2 The kicks, the killings, etc. from the first volume make way to the life-story of The Bride. Her personality, her relationship with Bill, her doubts and her fears, her training... her past. There's only one fight scene in Kill Bill Vol.1, the one between Uma Thurman and Daryl Hannah. But this doesn't mean KB2 is sort of a boring movie. No way. For me is the best of the 5 Tarantino movies, and the more serious. He may have copied ideas from some other movies, but he has definitely makes a great movie out of those ""inspirations"" (and that's not easy to do). Maybe the final parts are too slow. The scenes with the Bride's daughter are not like Tarantino's... they're too sugary. But I guess the original story ends that way so there's nothing Tarantino could do about it. Uma Thurman makes the perform of his life, and so does David Carradine (though I think he's never been a great actor). Tarantino has the ability to resurrect the dead: he did it with Travolta, Keitel and Pam Grier in the past, and so he does with Hannah or Carradine in Kill Bill. <br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol.2, one of the best Hollywood movies from 2004.<br/><br/>PS: I assume the middle-American doesn't know a thing about Spanish or Mexican cultures. But Tarantino is a man of the world, so he should know how ridiculous is to put flamenco music in a scene that takes place in Mexico. In México they have rancheras, corridos, etc. but not Flamenco."
"unNeCeSsArY","Null","0","1","23 August 2004"," Better than Vol.1???
","I thought that Vol. 2 was much better than the first for several reasons. To begin with, I thought that (and I say this as a guy who didn't flinch at Saving Private Ryan) the first one was much too gory. Although it was brilliantly choreographed I found it to be an overload of violence. I didn't think that the dialogue was exceptional but Quentin Tarantino wanted to make a spaghetti western so he accomplished his mission. But just in terms of entertainment I found Vol. 2 much better. I loved how Tarantino broke down the movie into chapters and I was wondering why he decided to exclude the scene that was in the deleted scenes portion of the DVD. One could say that the reason why I didn't like the first one too much was because it didn't have an ending but I just thought that the second was better done. A thing I didn't understand though, was that Uma Thurman said at the beginning that she only had one more person to go after, Bill, so why did she go after Bud?"
"TLan52","Null","0","1","19 August 2004"," Classic Tarantino
","I have seen every one of Tarantino's movies and I would argue that Vol. 2 fits right in with each of his pictures. The fact is his directing style is versatile and unique. Despite that, the thing that I love about Tarantino is that each of his films are supremely watchable. Think about anyone else trying to explain the premise for Kill Bill to a studio manager. White girl from a team of international assassins wakes from 4 year coma to seek revenge. It sounds crazy but like every other Tarantino movie, he makes it so enjoyable and intriguing. Every shot is important and exciting. I really can't say enough about this man as a director and Kill Bill Vol. 2 is not a let down.<br/><br/>9.2/10"

I have only watched three films back to back due to their unexplainable genius, two were Tarantino films, Kill Bill Vol. 2 was one of them, the other was Pulp Fiction. Every thing was perfect down to the last word, down to the last song (I mean, 'Malagueña' wow!). Uma just exudes natural power that is so non-gender. Her acting alone had me standing on the Hattori Hanzo sword from beginning to end.

"ev_snyder","9","0","1","23 August 2004"," More story, less action, but still fun to watch (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)
","Kill Bill Vol. 1 got most of the action, while Vol. 2 got all of the story. Vol. 2 still has enough action to satisfy a normal person, but what makes Vol. 2 so fun to watch is not what made Vol. 1 just as fun last year.  It's fun to see in Vol. 2 how all of the different story points fit together so well with the facts from Vol. 1, even the little ones, like Elle Driver's eye.  This goes to show you how talented Quentin Tarantino is as a writer and director.  If you haven't seen either movie, it would be smart to rent Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 together and watch them together, instead of a year apart like everyone else did.  This way, if you watched them together, you'd probably miss fewer of the plot points and you'd get the most out of the story.  If you really like the films, you may even consider watching them more than once, until you understand everything.  <br/><br/>Excellent acting from Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, and, as always, Uma Thurman.  David Carradine, who I've never considered a good actor, gives his best performance in Kill Bill Vol. 2.  Good acting from the rest of the cast.  Good story and good directing, but not Tarantino's best.  Nine stars out of ten."
"tw-18","Null","0","1","14 August 2004"," A great conclusion to a rather confusing film
","I'm sure there was a mass of cinema-goers who, despite enjoying KB Vol. 2 on some level, do not consider the film to be a 'serious' one. Many have in fact silently labeled it a gratuitous, unrealistic, cheesy comic-book style ""beat-em-up"" flick. Although I disagree, such opinions are completely understandable.<br/><br/>Tarantino has really gone all-out with the gore and violence in this series and I must admit the constant bombardment of bright red splashes, surreal combat sequences and Magyver-style escapism is as distracting as it is shocking. I'm almost certain Tarantino has a legitimate reason for this wan-ton element, but I'm not sure what it is. I guess I'm not that perceptive...<br/><br/>However the films are, in my opinion, powerful in their simplicity. And the action is very entertaining. Tarantino presents the film in a quasi comic-book way, which works very well with the juxtaposition of characters, scenes and sequences. The characters, despite their comic-book-like presentation, are actually believable and likable. A mother, a bride, a woman with a past she wants to forget, was betrayed in the most vile way and seeks vengeance against those who have wronged her - ""more serious"" films that have tried to portray something similar to this powerful-yet-simple characterisation have often come across as cheesy and 'try-hard'. The film is not trying to dazzle with its gore and superhero-style fight scenes. To me (and I may be alone in this), the comic-book factor and surrealness of the world in which Kill Bill is set, desensitized and directed me to view the film, its simple plot and the characters in a less critical way... The acting is superb, despite a hint of melodrama. Harradine is fantastic. We as an audience can't help but join Beatrice on her quest, we understand her. We come to see she is not crazy or irrational - just merciless to those that showed her none.<br/><br/>KB Vol. 2 follows the Bride as she moves down her list. Tarantino tones down the action slightly in this volume to give way to character development. Thurman, Harradine, Hannah and Marsden portray their characters well. The dialogue, however dramatic the actual words were, was presented naturally and believably. Harradine is especially superb. Hannah and Marsden are surprisingly effective together on screen.<br/><br/>Tarantino uses black+white colour and polarised lighting to give emphasis to memory flashbacks. The audience is privy to plenty of background of the Brides history as a trained warrior, where we are cleverly shown some of her physical and character strengths... And weaknesses. We come to understand how she became what she is.<br/><br/>The relationship and history between her and Bill is explored, but I found myself not fully understanding if it was completely genuine on Bill's part. He is a possessive man, and Tarantino allows ample time for Harradine to illustrate and develop his character.<br/><br/>KB Vol 1 & 2 are both give to the audience what they take in with them. Less philosophically, if person sits in the cinema and rolls their eyes the epic, gory and comic-book elements of the film they are likely to be either too closed off or too distracted to notice the subtle and beautifully simple aspects of the film. Watch Uma's face closely, look away (with disregarding) from the centre-stage action and notice the body language, juxtaposition and voice of the characters - Tarantino has created a story that relates to every one - it takes the basic elements of revenge, comradeship, pain and possession and presents them in a raw form that most will recognise - even those without PhD's and those who do not 'dig art-house movies'.<br/><br/>The conclusion to this film is satisfying, with Thurman giving it her all. I felt pumped, relieved and indeed, slightly sorry to say goodbye & good luck to the Bride when the film was over."

","As is the case with most directors whose careers, albeit short or long, have seen sharp peaks and abysmal valleys, Tarantino has made his definitive statement with a film that is a far cry in quality from his previous accomplishments. Undoubtedly, his two best films were the first two: PF and RD. Though KB(s 1 'n 2) may be (2) big step(s) (for moviekind) up from the disappointment (yeah, I said it) of the purportedly emotionally mature (*ha*) ""Jackie Brown"", it's laughable to me that similar qualities have been ascribed to the KB film. This movie is terrific...don't get me wrong! It's unabashedly fun fun fun entertainment...but it's campy...""what is that supposed to mean?"" That a little polish and esoteric nods/bites here or there can pass off for style, and the true charm of this movie is the moving, BAFTA-nominated performance of the ""great"" actress Uma Thurman? Me thinks not. Her spirited performance in ""Even Cowgirls Get the Blues"" did little to assuage the general public's belief that she is selective in her film appearances by choice. She's not F. Murray Abraham, or anything - she's Mia Wallace. KB is a comic-book movie, and its actors are about as under-the-top as Alfred Molina in Spider-Man 2 (a bad, but fitting performance for the definitive comic book movie.) After all, Kill Bill, Vol. 2 might just be the definitive comic book movie to never have been based on a comic book. It's got all the fixins. Tarantino is an American filmmaker - his ""knowledge"" of the techniques utilized in foreign films is not nearly as extensive as the number of films he has watched. Upon seeing his work, a neophyte might make such observations. He loves the moving image. The ""neat"", ""cool-looking"" things he can do with a camera, or in post-production. The camera eye, studying arbitrary qualities of a room. He likes talking heads - he likes to hear himself pontificate endlessly about popular culture. He seems to have an obsession with feet. In KB, Vol. 2, he has fallen into self-parody, but it's brilliant. Tarantino has come into his own: he can use the aforementioned bastardized strains of Eurasian film-philosophy to create a moving comic book, tongue-in-cheek references to the film-styles he loves (simply because, after seeing all of his directorial efforts, it seems that Tarantino's sole wish as a filmmaker is to keep alive dead styles of film-making) and, for once, a film that is so inconsistent in style, that it functions as a continuous, running joke completely detached from the proceedings of the film. Of course, part of the reason we love Tarantino so much is that he is the frontrunner of his whole style over substance movement...""it's a good thing."" It's a little disconcerting to read a Tarantino script that is devoid of humor. There are far too many straight lines in KB2 (however, not as many as in KB1 - however nothing as funny as: ""I beseech you on behalf of my daughter."") The acting is another problem. Uma Thurman, as I mentioned before, gets by on attitude on her physical presence. Michael Madsen is a convincing sadistic hick - but I think I liked him more as a sadistic gangster in Reservoir Dogs...of course, Tarantino also has the unique distinction of being an anomaly of sorts when it comes to working with actors. On the one hand: outside of their work with Tarantino, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, John Travolta, Bridget Fonda, Harvey Keitel, [Madsen], Chris Penn and Pam Grier (and god only knows who else) have delivered nothing but lame-as-lame could ever hope or wish to be perfunct performances with other directors at the helm. One the other hand: he managed to direct Robert DeNiro (one of the greatest actors of all time) to a performance that would rank amongst his 1990s worst. Darryl Hannah is definitely not sexy anymore and (judging by this performance) was never a good actor. Her best performance was, most likely, in Blade Runner (where she plays a robot.) Carradine steals every scene he's in with his creepy presence and menacing lisp. This is an exciting, scary, high-octane adventure/revenge flick with a genuinely crowd-pleasing ending and exploding eyeballs. 'Nuff said. C"

So, to any fan reading this review, it is just my opinion. <br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT!!!<br/><br/>The beginning is great. Great dialouge, acting, and action. There is more drama and explination than the first Kill Bill. Elle's kill is the best by far with the removale of the other eye. And the black mamba is a great touch. We finally get to Bill. The big and final show down. And we're going with it. This has been the Bride's goal since the first movie. And she just kills him within 5 seconds. It's very lame and pathetic.

","Kill Bill. Wow what a movie. <br/><br/>Volume 2 starts off with a the little bit of the beginning of Volume 1, and goes to ""The Bride"" driving a car and reciting a few cheesy lines as in ""I went on with what the movie advertisements referred to as a roaring rampage of revenge"" and of course ""When I arrive at my destination, I am gonna KILL BILL."" The wedding scene was a good way to start the film. We get to see Bill's arrival in the chapel and some great dialogue with Bill and the Bride and we see the Bride's fiancée. The last shot of the chapter though is phenomenal. The Vipers heading into the chapel with their guns is just a great shot, and I'm sort of glad that they didn't show the massacre. Next we see the Bride's, (Ok now I'm going to start calling her Bea) next target, Budd. A trailer trash brother of Bill who works in a strip club. Though I didn't like the scene in the strip club we kind of started feeling sorry for Budd. Michael Madsen does the role very, very well.<br/><br/>The burial scene, wow that was a great scene and brilliantly done.<br/><br/>The Pai Mei bit are one of the best parts of the movie. Gordon Liu does a fine job playing the uptight Chinese trainer for Bea and the whole chapter is fun to watch. Elle's chapter is probably the most fun to watch. Daryl Hannah who plays the downright b*tch Elle Driver is just fabulous with the role. The whole Black Mamba speech which she got from the net with a notebook is priceless.<br/><br/>The Elle vs. Bea fight is fun, fun, fun. It's dirty, raw and fun to watch. The conclusion was finely done, better than in the script.<br/><br/>The Bill and Beatrix confrontation is probably my favorite part of the whole film. Uma Thurman just seems so natural in the role of Beatrix and definitely deserves an Oscar nod for this emotionally challenged role, I mean the scene where she sees her daughter is just an example of how GREAT she is in this movie. David Carradine is very charming as Bill, who has some of the best lines and dialogue out of all the characters. I thought the solution between Bea and Bill was beautifully done and I'm not disappointed with the film one bit. Tarantino is just a man who really loves movies and Kill Bill is a celebration for everyone who loves movies.<br/><br/>Still so far the best film of the year and one of my favorites ever.<br/><br/><ul><li>10/10</li></ul>"

","It's hard to review Kill Bill, Volume 2 without mentioning Volume 1, since both films make up an entire movie. So instead of just reviewing Volume 2, I shall end up combining the two films and submitting a review of Kill Bill. So let us begin. Kill Bill is Quentin Tarantino's bloody epic masterpiece that pays homage to those 70's Japanese shows, Spaghetti Westerns and Italian Horror Films. He combines the three elements to create a masterful story of revenge, featuring Uma Thurman as The Bride. The Bride is an interesting character who is indeed a woman of the world. She was about to get married and have a baby and ended up being massacred by Bill and The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (composed of Elle Driver, Budd, O-Ren Ishii and Vernita Green) and left in a coma for four years. She wakes up and immediately wants revenge on all those who ruined her lives. What results is approximately 4 hours and 8 minutes (that's what you get if you add the two films together) of action-packed, in-your face drama that can't get any better. Quentin Tarantino is a masterful writer and director that one can compare to Martin Scorsese. He is totally original in what he creates and doesn't hold anything back from the audience. He shoves it in your face and all you can do is squeal when he does it. Uma Thurman delivers quite possibly the best performance of her career (the only one better maybe occurs in Tarantino's Pulp Fiction) and honestly richly deserves a Best Actress Oscar nomination for her work in this epic film. But what is really the centerpiece of this whole entourage of violence and blood is the character of Bill. One would expect bill to be such a hard-ass, a man so violent and so insane that you wouldn't be able to like him at all. Yet Tarantino creates him as an intelligent, sweet, loving man who feels sincere regret for what he did to The Bride. The man who plays him is David Carradine, son of the legendary John Carradine, whom, like John Travolta in Pulp Fiction, Tarantino resurrects with this film. Carradine plays Bill so well in Volume 2 that he too deserves a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his work in this film. Tarantino's writing and direction are nearly flawless in this movie, the editing of the film is spectacular, the cinematography is absolutely stunning, all making Kill Bill a vast, beautiful tale that is more than just about revenge. Volume 1 was a bloody masterpiece, Volume 2 was a beautiful masterpiece, Kill Bill is One of the Very Best Films Ever! <br/><br/>Lenny's Grade for Volume 1: A Lenny's Grade for Volume 2: A Lenny's Grade for KILL BILL: A"

"dee.reid","10","0","1","10 August 2004"," Conclusion
","With the two-volume series of films that come to be known as ""Kill Bill,"" Quentin Tarantino has achieved a level of creativity lacking in most modern films that will take years to surpass.  ""Kill Bill"" is, in fact, an amalgam of all the grindhouse cinema outings that Tarantino made during the 70s.<br/><br/>When you think real hard about it, the plot to ""Kill Bill"" is absolutely ludicrous, and under the direction of a normal filmmaker, wouldn't make it past the 50-minute mark.  But under Tarantino's careful guidance, that ludicrous plot remains ludicrous, but he injects his requited love of cinema into the material and the plot suddenly takes a life and a whole new spin.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill"" is by far Tarantino's most accomplished work as a director, considering that I typically favor his non-directorial efforts (""True Romance,"" ""Natural Born Killers,"" ""From Dusk Till Dawn"") over his own directorial outings (""Reservoir Dogs,"" ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Jackie Brown"").<br/><br/>I certainly look forward to more from Quentin Tarantino in the future being that with ""Kill Bill,"" he has created a cinematic epic of one man's love of movies and then seeing it realized on the screen."

He did a horrible act out of love for her.<br/><br/>Chris Rock's Quote: ""Have you ever loved somebody so much that sometimes you want to kill them."" That quote sort of makes sense in this film. This is a Quentin Tarantino love story. Some people feel sorry for Bill because he loves her. Not that people will kill in the name of love, but some have. Now all of a sudden Uma Thurman is the bad guy for at least a little while, but you feel sympathetic to her aim as well. She wants revenge, because he did wrong by her, she feels betrayed, like he cheated her in some way, cheated her by taking the idea of a normal life for her and her baby.<br/><br/>I don't like Bill, but I do understand why he did what he did, and I understand why the Bride feels so angry. And with there last words, Bill Quotes: I love you Kiddo.  The Bride Quotes: I love you to. In my opinion, this is one of the craziest and one of the best love story's ever created.<br/><br/>I give this film 4/4 stars."

","Quentin Tarantino closes his epic of betrayal and revenge with a slightly more meditative film, a pretty far cry from the action packed bloodbath that comprised Volume 1.  Uma Thurman returns as `The Bride' a.k.a. `Black Mamba' a.k.a. but that would be telling.   Anyway, she's back from being left for dead at the altar, to take revenge on the trio of killers left on her hit list:  Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver (California Mountain Snake), Michael Madsen as Budd (Sidewinder, also Bill's brother), and David Carradine as the titular `Bill.'  Along the way, we're treated to a further salute to eastern cinema, in flashbacks to Black Mamba's training under the querulous Pai Mei (thirty year Hong Kong vet Gordon Liu, playing his second role in the Kill Bill story, and reprising yet another classic recurring character from Asian cinema (like Sonny Chiba's Hatori Hanzo in Volume 1)).  What emerges from the whole is a story about love, redemption and the possibility of moving on from the ways of violence and war into, perhaps, an uncertain future.  And Volume 2 confirms my thought that the movie was better served shown as a whole.  Brilliant stuff."

","QT does a fine job once again. I will admit that I don't think that either of these two movies will live as long as Resevoir dogs or Pulp Fiction at all but as a movie addict I was pleasantly surprised with this second installment.<br/><br/>I've heard so many times that QT despises the new SFX/CGI trend in Hollywood. If he does feel this way I think it's a pretty weak way of thinking. Sure you can always argue that the CGI takes the focus away from the story, the acting and all the other things we as individuals feel would make a better movie. I disagree, it's just a tool, just like the strings he works with, the fake blood and the stuntment. QT draws the line on what movies can use to convey their message, big man, but kinda stupid considering the business he is in.<br/><br/>Getting back to the movie, for quick reference I would like to say that I think KB1 was a very mediocre film where QT decides to take make a ballet of violence combined with mange cartoon to make it more artistic, because if you make violence artistic you can cover up for the fact that you are still going for the shock effect which sells tickets. <br/><br/>This second movie shows a lot more depth, better acting, reveals the characters, offers more story buildup and a few twists that were also left out in the first movie. <br/><br/>Overall I think QT has probably succeeded in achieving his goal with these two movies. Each of them gives us the moviegoers something different to get excited about, where KB1 definitely gives us violence galore and overtime action, this sequel brings depth to both.<br/><br/>I'll give this one 8/10 and say that I'm sorry for thinking after the first one that QT was heading for a disaster. He pulls out fine, but not a masterpiece."

This volume 2 is rich in funny scenes and dialogues, violence and yes emotion. Like in Jackie Brown, Tarantino is good at creating strong woman characters. The bride is determined to go to the end of her revenge, and she won't let go even if that includes resuscitating a second time (a tribute to the Night of the living dead). The soundtrack is great as usual, and as usual, you can try to find the influence of hundreds of directors and movies in this last Tarantino opus (the most obvious one being Sergio Leone).

"bix171","10","0","1","22 July 2004"," Rich And Meaty
","Perhaps it was Quentin Tarentino's intention all along to present `Kill Bill' in two parts--how else can you explain the elaborate correction he performs on the first film's know-it-all attitude towards women? Where `Volume One' seemed to want to explain and ultimately dismiss women, `Volume Two' finds Tarentino in awe of them, especially his heroine `The Bride' (Uma Thurman), who, by the film's conclusion, has ascended to the throne that the director holds dearest: motherhood. It's an arduous path to that throne, going, as she does, from `natural-born killer' to loving parent but the respect that Tarentino gives the female mystique is as sincere and reverent as the respect he gives his cinematic and literary sources and it's part of what makes this film a masterpiece. The second volume is meatier than the first, with far more attention paid to the story and the richness of the relationship between `The Bride' and Bill (David Carradine, a perfect performance) which alternates between father-daughter, mentor-pupil and husband-wife. (Early scenes between them feature stunning close-ups bathed in warm sepia backlight and the chemistry is intuitive, palpable and instructive.). It's also somewhat less insistent on its revenge motif (though the battle between `The Bride' and Daryl Hannah's Elle Driver and its denouement is both films' high point). But the director turns up the psychological assault a notch and his ability to manipulate and terrify his audience is on a par with Hitchcock's. (Thurman's living burial is intense and agonizing.) As a filmmaker, Tarentino shows a remarkable mastery of his medium, employing, as he does, techniques that establish him as a scholar and not an imposter--the single-take reverse crane shot that frames the massacre in El Paso where the story has its' center is worthy of Ford and Peckinpah--and it confirms he's a true auteur who walks the walk: by culling from so many sources he's created a distinctive style that seems fresh and honest. He's also the only one who can execute it."

It just didn't give the same satisfaction as the first movie.<br/><br/>I thought the action scenes were not up to the standards of the first one.

After all the hype in the first film as well as the first few parts of this one I found it rather disappointing and anticlimactic. <br/><br/>I absolutely loved the story of the Bride and Pei-Mei.

"HATED_IT","7","0","1","8 July 2004"," Not as good as Volume One, but still enjoyable.
","The main difference between Volume on and Two, is that in the latter, Tarantino ditches the violence in favor of the dialouge. That's not to say there aren't some great action scenes, but it felt a little uneven after all the fighting in Volume One. Like I said, it does have some adrenaline pumping scenes, like the fight between The Bride and Elle, the training scenes with Pae Ming (forgive me if that is not his name, but it's something along those lines), and the chilling burying of The Bride's living body, but it couldn't hold a candle to the adrenaline rush I got from Volume One. <br/><br/>I know this movie was supposed to focus more on the plot, and the dialouge in this ones will feel right at home compared to Tarantino's other movies. But I still felt a little cheated, especially the way Bill was killed. I was hoping for a much grander final showdown between him and The Bride.<br/><br/>Maybe it was just because I was wowed so much with Volume One, and the way it unfolded, but Volume Two just seemed to fall out a bit to straight forward for a Tarantino movie. Non the less I did enjoy the film in particular the amazing performance of David Carradine, who seems to be the next Travolta that Tarantino pulled out of post fame B-Movie obscurity. I will say right here that Carradine deserve at the least an Oscar nomination for his role. In fact, all of the cast give great performances, and there are no weak links.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>PS- You don't need to see the first one to go into this, in fact it may make Volume One more enjoyable if you see it after this."

"warnerclassic","Null","0","1","30 June 2004"," A good film, but self indulgent
","Kill Bill Volume 1 was a film that proved that Tarantino's self imposed exile from film had not been a wasted. A Rip Roaring Rampage of Revenge shouted the posters for Kill Bill volume 1 and indeed it was, telling the story of the bride (Uma Thurman) who, after being shot by her former employers, awakens after being in a coma and vows revenge. This film gave a karate kick in the pants to Hollywood and the film fan with the most iconic female lead in a movie this side of Alien. But when the film finished it was not the end, merely the close of a chapter. And so Kill Bill Volume 2 beckoned, but where the former was an tightly edited piece of cinematic wonder, Kill Bill Volume 2 is a frustration, a film that has smacks of genius that are on display, yet saddled with self indulgence. Indeed self indulgence is what dominates this film from it's characters over written scenes to the films very creation, with the studio agreeing to let Tarantino split the pie into two and hoping the second portion is just as sweet. It isn't. And let me tell you why. Kill Bill Volume 2  makes several fundamental mistakes that makes it inferior to the first instalment. This is due to the films centring on characters that, with the exception of Daryl Hannah's California Mountain Snake, simply do not grab the viewers attention as Vivica Fox and Lucy Liu did in Volume 1. The character of Bud, one of the Brides assassins, is not of interest no matter how much back story is developed, feeling like someone that could have been knocked off quickly in Volume 1. Flash backs to before the bride became The Bride' manage to destroy a little more mystique that served her so well in Volume 1. Here we find out her background, how she came to be, just who was at her wedding, and even her name. These mysteries are what served the first film so well, but here all questions are answered, stripping the film of suspense. But there is still much to savour, Tarantino filming with the style of a true film auteur, with fight scenes that draw from just about every kung fu-spaghetti western film that ever hit a video shelf. Daryl Hannah steals her scenes as the one eyed assassin and Uma Thurman once more puts her heart and soul into the character of the bride. And then we come to Bill himself, so much an unseen presence in the first film and a dominating visual threat in the second, played with a cold icy charm by David Carradine, who brings the qualities that make Bill worth killing. But Tarantino milks too much from each scene giving an enforced importance to scenes that need less time and more punch. Kill Bill Volume 1 was a film that was lean and mean, and stripped of any fat. Volume 2 inherits that very fat and feels padded in places. But there is still much here to enjoy and Tarantino once more proves that even with a weaker second film, no-one kick ass quite like Quint.<br/><br/>3 stars. Kick ass Tarantino"
"Autonome","Null","0","1","17 June 2004"," With this much style, who needs content?
","This film is a stage for Carradine, and it is so great to see him finally have full reign on a screen. This is one of Carradine's films that really crystallizes his style and attitude.<br/><br/>The plot is about as thin as projector film, but the characters are so grand it seems like a modern tribute to film noir anyway. Violence is often used in movies as a blatant substitute for an intelligent story, and Tarantino may be the poster child for using that device, but memorable characters are his (and his actors') great accomplishment. You can try to interpret the violence as metaphor for internal psychological dilemmas, and in this movie you see love ultimately win out over all the adrenalin addicted characters, but realistically Tarantino works from a gore-fetish basis and that is his most avid audience. That is the underlying vibe, but his films are more than that. Tarantino's films take on meaning simply by virtue of the characters and the interplay.<br/><br/>The film is vaguely reminiscent of Thelma and Louise, and I even see similarities in the methodology of Tarantino's films and Ridley Scott's.<br/><br/>It was great to see funny references to other films, too. There is this female character thrashing wildly on the floor in her death throws, uncannily like the replicant in (coincidentally) Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, and it actually did turn out to be Daryl Hannah! I love NOT knowing everything about a film before seeing it. For the whole film I wondered if that could be her, and if Daryl Hannah could really still look that good.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that all the actors did great work, which is typical of Tarantino's films.

","SPOILERS CONTAINED BELOW:<br/><br/>Heads up to anyone going into the movie expecting the action which its predecessor excelled at providing. The second installment, picks up exactly where the previous left off i.e. the Bride (Uma Thurman) proceeding merrily along with serious scars and bruises, to cut down the remaining three on her hit list of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, namely Bud (Mike Madsen), Elle Driver (Darryl Hannah) and Bill (David Carradine).<br/><br/>The movie begins as if it were a film straight out of the 1940s early 1950s, with Uma clearly restating her intention, while cruising in her convertible, that she's going to Kill Bill. However, the foundation is set easily within the first twenty minutes, that this is more than just a revenge tale. <br/><br/>As the mayhem ensues, surprises unfold and we learn more about the Bride's past. At this stage, all I've got to say is that the chemistry between Carradine and Thurman is undeniable. Tarantino, we know has a way of reinventing careers, and he has done it again, with the meaty roles presented to Carradine of the movie (part of the heart and soul of the movie), and the vicious Hannah. These are equally matched pound for pound by Thurman (with her matriarchal tendencies), and the madcap Madsen. Each character is given such treatment by the director, resulting in tremendous depth and Oscar worthy performances; coupled with such alarmingly irreverent and funny dialogue, you are left reeling.<br/><br/>To choose which scenes stand out, is virtually impossible. Although, there is one situation in which the Bride finds herself, that freaked the heck out of me. However, in typical QT fashion, we are transported to another scene, where the master of martial arts training, Pei Mei (played by Gordon Liu......a name which all Kung Fu junkies would know), schools the Bride. That scene in itself completes the East meets West vision which Tarantino brilliantly began executing in the first movie. Action junkies fear not, the showdown between the Bride and Elle, is beyond anything I've ever seen, choreography and editing wise.<br/><br/>Each speech by the cast members is delivered with such gusto and is the set up for an event of proportions (Elle's research on snakes; Bud's chastising the Bride on making good choices; Bud's boss chewing him out for coming to work late and Carradine's Superman treatise). This is the only way Tarantino knows how to do it, gratuitously and again....funny. As with every Tarantino movie, the music is hand picked from his personal collection and used most effectively.<br/><br/>The final showdown, between the Bride and Bill, is not about action, rather it's about their journey and the true plot of the movie is revealed. Revenge was really just secondary.<br/><br/>Do I think I might be giving too much credit to this movie? Certainly not......the mere fact that the movie blends so many styles and has become a genre onto itself is a testament to the sheer brilliance of Tarantino and his ensemble.

The first one was a beautiful flower of death, as the bodies piled up the flower blossomed and film became an action epic. The second one feels more like a Tarantino film because it focus more on the conversations and the interactions between characters rather than the overall violence. If we were to put both films together it would be easier to see that one section must be violent and the other must be calm.<br/><br/>It's like comparing ""Friday the 13th"" to ""Halloween."" Both are iconic films in the horror industry, both being the slashers that are ruthlessly copied. Friday, has a large body count, as with all the sequels. Halloween was more subdued and had a smaller body count. I preferred the latter albeit both movies are great.<br/><br/>There are many scenes in this film that are very memorable, and I'd rather not give them away.<br/><br/>The film has a spaghetti western feel to it, especially with the music and the locations in the film. it's a much lighter film with a good dash of comedy. <br/><br/>Tarantino is very imaginative behind the camera as he usually is, providing unique angles to convey even the simplest of events.<br/><br/>In the end those who like action will like the first one and those who like conversation will prefer the second one.<br/><br/>Kill Bill as a whole is the closest thing I have ever seen to my dream movie<br/><br/>The Glengarry Glen Ross meets The crow"

While the first is a samurai spectacle, volume two is much calmer and has a very strong Spaghetti Western feel. I didn't enjoy volume 2 as much as volume 1, it's a lot slower and I felt that there were chunks of this film that could have been left out to keep the speed and adrenaline that made the first one such a feast for the senses. However, there was a space of 5 months in between me watching the two films which I think is partly why I'm not so impressed by the second film, I had huge expectations for it and had been anticipating it for so long. For me this was a plain piece of low fat grilled chicken compared to the thick sizzling piece of steak that is Volume 1. But put the two together and you're left with a meaty feast of pure entertainment.

","This is a great and satisfying conclusion to Tarantino's spaghetti western kung-fu, B-movie extravaganza. The film continues where we left Uma, having killed off Lucy Liu and Vivaca Fox. Now she has Michael Madsen, Darryl Hannah and David Carridine left to obliterate.<br/><br/>Much like the last episode this is super cool and very violent. Tarantino takes great delight in referencing the genres he loves and referencing movies in this from Drunken Master to Blade Runner. The 2nd part is far less visceral and less action packed, giving us more story concerning the Bride and we also get more insight into Bill. This installment really has something going for it with the more central appearances for both Madsen and Carradine as Bill. Madsen is excellent and once again Tarantino gets the best from him. This is a great role for him as Budd. Budd initially seems like a beaten down, shell of a man who has no inspiration left in him and in many ways regrets what he did to the Bride. He seems as if he will just kneel before this angel of death and take his punishment, that is until he gets a taste for the kill again and finds he can enjoy torturing her, he becomes invigorated by violence. Carradine rocks as Bill. This is the best thing I have seen from him, he is excellent here. Carradine rules the film when he is on screen. Darryl Hannah has rarely been as good in a role that really pushes and kicks the ass of the image of the cutesy and loveable girl next door she was most famous for in the 80's. Uma Thurman is once again brilliant, sexy, and tough. This part really allows her to stretch as an actress and episode 2 gives the depth to the character to move the Bride to the next level from the first part. I am not the only one who feels that Thurman should get an Oscar nomination for her part in Kill Bill 2.<br/><br/>This is a satisfying conclusion to a great and refreshing story.

Combining pretty much everything I've ever loved about movies since I was a little kid into one fantastic (half of a) film, it was like a blast of pure oxygen, a jolt of adrenaline that stayed with me for weeks. <br/><br/>""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" is not the same kind of film. The people who are saying that the two movies are very different in tone and style are correct. This is by no means a bad thing, though, because their differences make for a fascinating comparison. <br/><br/>""Vol. 1"" is paced to kill, a movie that seldom pauses for character development or even dialogue, yet STILL possesses extraordinary emotional depth, mostly because of Uma Thurman's stunning, Oscar-worthy performance. The Bride (whose name is revealed in ""Vol. 2"") is one of the most fiercely sympathetic characters in movie history. <br/><br/>""Vol. 2"" is much more introspective and relaxed, more about emotions than violence (although there is plenty of it). I have a feeling that many will be bored with it, as they were with ""Jackie Brown"". But like ""Jackie Brown"", I think this film will also reveal layers upon layers of riches upon each viewing, and will age beautifully. <br/><br/>In ""Vol. 1"", The Bride crossed O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) off of her death list, and now in ""Vol. 2"" she has three people left to kill who played a hand in the Massacre at Two Pines: Budd (Michael Madsen), the one-eyed Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and of course Bill (a great David Carradine), none of whom are going to make it easy for her.<br/><br/>
During a terrifying scene where the Bride is buried alive, the film switches to a flashback of her days as a student of the ruthless kung-fu master Pai Mei (Gordon Liu). This sequence is actually my favorite part of the whole movie, and Pai Mei is hands down one of the most entertaining characters I've seen in a long time. When the flashback ends and we find out why the Bride was remembering his teachings at that particular moment, it has a remarkable emotional payoff (set to the gloriously triumphant ""L'Arena"" from one of Ennio Morricone's spaghetti western scores). <br/><br/>In the end, I think I slightly prefer the no-holds-barred mayhem of ""Vol. 1"" to the more laid-back ""Vol. 2"", but is it still a totally awesome and entertaining movie?

","Once again Quentin Tarantino has released a masterpiece. Though not as violent and action packed as Volume 1, Volume 2 offers the a more story like movie, but with a sufficient amount of action. The plot thickens as the story unfolds and the viewer begins to understand the mysterious incident between The Bride (Beatriz Kiddo) and Bill. You get the sense of a little kung-fu training with Pai Mei, but you still get that Tarantino retro feel with some tasteful gore. The ending has some excellent suspense as you are on the edge of your seat (No spoiler for those who did not see the movie) constantly waiting to see what will happen next. Tarantino never fails to add suspense to his films. Even though I loved this film I felt it lacked the action that I enjoyed some much in Volume 1, but nevertheless a fantastic film, just a notch short of Volume 1. Everyone should go see this movie, it is a treasure. <br/><br/>My rating: 8/10"

","For all of the complaints about pacing in Vol. 2, with the meandering and dialogue-heavy scenes, what I think people are missing is what Q.T. said early in production of the original full-length Kill Bill. He made the point that this was going to be a ""chop-suey"" Hong Kong-style film AND a spaghetti western. Anyone who grew up with the spaghetti westerns knows that dialogue advances the plot as much or more than the action. The old westerns spent two-thirds or more of the movies leading up to the ""final showdown."" That there is the whole set-up with Bud and Elle Driver says that Q.T. was winding down intentionally.<br/><br/>Anyone who has watched this director's work knows that he does nothing accidental as far as style goes. The music in this movie is an auditory demonstration of what the expected action is to be.<br/><br/>My only real complaint, and it may just be me, is that I expected a little more from the confrontation between Elle and The Bride. But at the same time, some of the rumors about the coming comic series give hope that The Bride (Beatrix) and Elle Driver will meet again, though it would not be much of a fair fight (not going to spoil it for anyone)."

","Though I consider Kill Bill Volumes 1 and 2 as separate movies I view them as part of the same Tarantino ""era"" and so therefore whether I like Volume 1 better or not I still believe that Tarantino is continuously bettering himself. This movie continues the trend as his films become increasingly emotional, mature and beautiful. Much like with Vol. 1 Tarantino outdoes himself in every possible way, the casting is better, the script is better, the music is better, the cinematography is better.<br/><br/>Tarantino has become the master of the emotional roller-coaster movie, both Kill Bill Vol 1 and 2 run the full gamut, mostly played out by Uma Thurman.<br/><br/>The whole thing is just great.

","Breathtaking film experience. No one matches the intensity and wit of Quentin's dialogue. The story is original, and the emotional turbulence the characters each go through are brilliantly portrayed, especially by Carradine, Madsen, and Uma. The training scene with The Bride in Asia serves as some type of emotional and intellectual barometer; if you aren't involved in a rally cry for her at that point, your probably not paying attention or dead. I also love how The Bride has a punk-rock, do it yourself attitude; what drew me to the first film (aside from the directing credit) was how she didn't go to a man for help, she was going to Kill Bill herself. I don't remember a film where the heroine was actually showing independent bravado, at least not a film that was worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Darryl Hannah is wickedly over the top, just so that she's entertaining. David Carradine plays the villain that you hate the most: A character who is likable, even admirable by ever account, as long as you don't have knowledge of his actions or motives. Michael Madsen's performance shines brightest, residing in the vacant shadow of the thoughts of who he used to be, remorsefully determined. Uma plays The Bride better than any other actress could have, and better than most actors could play a character with such intents. And absolute must see, ranking above Resorvior Dogs and near Pulp Fiction on his ""So Far"" list."

The Bride continues her quest to kill Bill, and must kill two of his associates first. Kill Bill is a smart tale of revenge and vengeance, and gives dialog similar to Pulp Fiction. Vol. 1 was missing emotional scenes and dialog that was very interesting. Bill and the Bride's (Kiddo) conversations were very fun and witty after watching edge-of- your-seat action scenes. Way less bloody than the first and replacing it with more dialog makes it just as good as the original. 9/10 stars. 10/10 stars for both films combined."

After watching it, I'd be hard pressed to mention a single moment in the movie that made me think it was worth splitting into two episodes. The overall feel is that he HAD to throw in every gag, reference, character and cameo he could, and then repeat some of them until you winced. Tarantino at his best is like a hyper, geeky-funny friend who makes good weird jokes. Tarantino in Kill Bill 2 is like the know-it-all geek friend who talks to himself in Klingon and quotes from cheesy movies only he has seen, all through the roadtrip. There comes a point where you just wish he'd shut up and do a crossword puzzle or something. <br/><br/>The first part had great visual moments and awesome fight sequences: the battle against the Crazy 88's - (the part silhouetted against the blue backdrop stands out), the motorcycle scenes in Tokyo, the fight with O-Ren Ishi.

","The second half of this gigantic homage collage piece turns out to serve as an explanation for the unrevealed background of Vol. 1. In many cases, unresolved mysteries hold the viewers' interests by making them keep guessing, while resolutions are rarely satisfying. Kill Bill is no exception; the plain excuse for The Massacre at Twin Pines even eclipses the brilliant Vol. 1. The odyssey of Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) concludes with the poorly executed family drama, where Thurman and David Carradine seem totally lost. Extreme close-ups (of both characters' faces and objects) look cliched and lose their impact when overused.<br/><br/>The four-hour epic (combining Vol. 1 and 2) may be more suitable for TV; each chapter has a decent content to comprise a decent series."

Quentin Tarantino's story is great in every aspect and with this last movie confirms all the things that I ever thought about him and that's the fact that he is one of the best directors of the world ever. I had seen all of his movies and definitely this is the best of all. Kill Bill is creative, beautiful, refreshing and above all spectacular! The idea of splitting the movie in half was brilliant and really makes you be impatient to see what's going happened next. Kill Bill 2 wasn't as great in terms of action as the first one but the story is absolutely amazing and unexpected. This is the best film of the year so long. You must see this movie as quickly as you can. Great!"
"psi_fla","Null","0","1","25 May 2004"," Thurman finally gets to Kill Bill as Tarantino's genius comes shining through.
","Rating: ***** (out of *****)<br/><br/>I labelled Volume One of Kill Bill a ""straightforward, arty and sometimes overly pretentious hybrid of The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". I expected Volume Two to simply provide more of the same and nothing else. I even thought it would be the same length as Volume One.<br/><br/>In this case, I really like being wrong.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino's and Uma Thurman's long-term project has successfully met its aim. Both have now truly redeemed themselves, Tarantino for splitting this film in two, Thurman for her turns in Batman & Robin and The Avengers. I now doubt if the split really was a completely commercial decision, although maybe Vol. 1 could have been a little shorter and added onto the back of Vol. 2. Mind you, that's a minor complaint. <br/><br/>Anyway, on with the show. The assassin still only known to us as The Bride (Uma Thurman) must complete her revenge against those who thought they'd done away with her at that wedding massacre. With O-Ren Ishii and Vernita Green dealt with in Vol. 1, The Bride now has to take care of Budd (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), and, of course, Bill himself (David Carradine). But, as we have already seen (in Volume One) and are about to find out to a greater degree, that definitely won't be easy.<br/><br/>Most of the dialogue in Vol. 1 could have easily passed for anything in a typical action movie. By contrast, what you hear in Vol. 2 is more in-depth and moralistic. Crucially, the characters are more human, especially our two leads - this largely results from the film's flashbacks. The old Pulp Fiction strengths show signs of creeping back.<br/><br/>Certainly, there are plenty of treats in store for film goers in Vol. 2, one of which is the discovery of The Bride's name, but the film has other great moments as well. My personal favourite was the flashback showing us The Bride's training at the hands of Pai Mei (Gordon Liu). Close second was the funny, extremely interesting and surprisingly heart-warming denouement. Tarantino has shown us both his dark side (mostly in Vol. 1) and light side (mostly in Vol. 2), and when merged together, they click astoundingly well.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman amazed me with her convincing, no-nonsense approach in Vol. 1, but in Vol. 2 she impresses even more. Emotionally, she is believable. And tough she certainly is. Yet she takes second stage to David Carradine. He's said before how grateful he is to Tarantino for revitalising his career. This particular career decision has paid off. Bill is more of a gentleman than many central villains Â– so much so that you actually pity him a little when his inevitable fate arrives. This isn't the case for Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah, who simply devour their parts.<br/><br/>If you're still puzzled by now about why I am so astounded, it is simply because Vol. 2 doesn't just make Kill Bill more of a real film, but also a completely different film. It's not always pleasant to watch, and it's not exactly what you'd call a stunning artistic achievement, but ultimately, it is thoroughly rewarding cinema. And I'll take that over any self-important art film any day."

","There's nothing new to write or say about Tarantino's fourth effort. This film, as well as he's done with his prior movies, is cooler among the coolest. I strongly believe there's no need on writing stuff about the premise or the multiple and very well used tricks he spent on it -besides, I'm pretty sure hundreds of others here are gonna do it-, so I'll keep it short and say that never mind whether you are a Quentin fan or not, this is a must to see, to appreciate, and to give to the word ""joy"" a whole new perspective and weight. You now The Bride is on Bill's track, her anger is the strongest will, and this, on Tarantino's hand, is spectacular.

Looking very much forward to VOLUME 2 I really got what I wanted. KILL BILL VOL.2 is not as bloody, not as action packed, not as insane or not as Eastern inspired, but it's just as good! Here Tarantino has slowed it all down and we get to know the characters more. Uma Thurman is just as fantastic as the main character The Bride aka Black Mamba aka Beatrix Kiddo (that most be the coolest name ever!) Uma slashed both Vernita Green/Copperhead and O-Ren Ishii/Cottomouth in the first, but there's still tree standing tall. Elle Driver, Budd and Bill himself. <br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino being, probably, the best director in the world does his job simply perfect! It kicks a lot of ass, especially the scene between Elle Driver and The Bride in a caravan, wow! KILL BILL VOL.2 is Tarantino's western movie, and a beautiful part is when Budd picks up The Bride laying on the ground heavily wounded and you can clearly hear the brilliant theme from Morricone in Eastwood's early on movies.

","I think it goes without saying but Kill Bill Vol. 2 is well worth seeing. Even if you haven't seen the first part you can see this one and not feel like you've missed anything. If you're expecting to see as much blood as in the first one you might be disappointed because there's really no blood shed, in terms of Vol. 1 blood shed, at all. The fight between Elle and The Bride, who's real name is revealed, is pretty good and ends quite painfully for Elle. The ending, when she kills Bill, is a bit of a letdown but she got her revenge so I guess that's what counts. If you were planning on staying to see the blooper, all five seconds of it, after the end credits I'd suggest waiting until it's released on DVD because it's really not worth it. The movie, with about ten minutes of end credits, last just under 2 hours and 20 minutes. Thumbs up."
"rnapier-1","Null","0","1","21 May 2004"," Top Billing?
","I came to this movie, as I often do with Tarantino movies, somewhat exasperated with his last movie. The first volume left me in a difficult position. I liked the movie as a whole, but couldn't help but get bogged down in the interminable ""look at this, and this, AND THIS"" sequence of bravura set pieces. OK, so he is clever. But the montage of tableaux makes you just want to have a story, a plot, a coherent set of images, anything to follow in a linear fashion. Maybe I am just too linear a guy.<br/><br/>
So the second volume was a nice surprise. Less pirouttes and showy ""look Mom I can do this"" pieces, more character development and some great character acting. The story moves along at a nice pace, the dialog is wonderfully poignant in places (check out the arrival of Bill at the wedding rehearsal) and the main effort of the director seems to be in the right place, that is to say getting the story from a to b (or b to c I guess since this is part two). I loved the sequences with BB and David Carradine (and he is totally cool by the way). I loved the Mexican pimp. I loved Mother and the wedding chapel. The weaknesses are however glaring. Bill's brother and Daryl Hannah frankly added nothing to plot dynamics.<br/><br/>And to put it clearly, this was not enough to warrant a second movie. It must be annoying to realise that you have made a movie and a half. But between the two of them I reckon there is a three hour opus waiting to get out. Long live the director's cut (yeah, never, never ever have I seen a Directors cut that gives a smaller movie).<br/><br/>Better than the first, and nearly the best movie of the month."

Fantastic utilization of the locations, unbelievable use of light and architecture and enough Tarantino to make me laugh until I cried.  I was honestly afraid the people in the theater were going to throw me out but after I laughed loud enough, the rest of them decided it was Okay to laugh along.  I will go see this movie again and will definitely buy the dvd when it comes out.<br/><br/>
My favorite part, Daryl Hannah.  I didn't realize what a hottie Uma was until the second installment.  I asked everyone I knew if those were really Uma's feet in the first installment because they did look quite nasty.

","Before I write this comment on Kill Bill 2, I must point out that I have always been a QT-fan and I looked forward to this film for many months. I wanted it to be good. I really did. For the first 20 minutes I figured to myself ""yeah, it's pretty good"". But sometimes after she escapes from the coffin and fights the other girl, I just completely lost interest. I never thought that could happen, cause KB 1 had me sitting on the edge of my seat, and I agree with whoever said that as long as QT signs his name on something everyone will praise it. But until now that has been true. Everything he has done has been great, I even liked his acting in PF and FR. I spent all of 10th grade discussing and watching pulp fictions with some friends. He made me love movies, and when he made this, it just felt like the old all of a sudden got old. The dialogue was disgustingly pretentious, the character Bill was a weak actor and I guess he is unknown because of just that. Uma did NOT prefrom well in this movie. She could give courses in overacting. I mean, the same as with QT, she has made nothing but great movies, but even in the trailer when she is driving the car, her acting is very sub-par. Facts: I looked at my watch after 20 minutes. I thought it was a joke. Like QT made a practical joke and in the end said: ""Here is the REAL movie"" The use of blue color in the movie did NOT work at all. I started blinking a lot at the end, not cause when she killed Bill it was sad or her daughter made me sad, just cause I had trouble staying awake. Kill Bill 1 is one of the best movies I've seen. Kill Bill 2 is one of the worst. It's so weird when I talk to people who liked it (and there are a lot of them). I still feel like I watched another movie than them. I haven't written one of these for many years, that's how much I did not like it."

","First, let me start off by saying that it's a shame that volume one is not among the ""best action sequence"" nominees at this years mtv movie awards. After falling in love with volume two, i've realized that the action sequences might have been the best part about volume 1.  But, if volume 1 happens to be the ONLY tarantino movie you enjoy, then you'll probably wrestle with enjoying this one.<br/><br/>david carradine does an amazing job as the title character.  His sentimentality, interwoven with his evil nature, is the ""cherry on top"". I'd never really seen him act before.  I'm only familiar with him ""walking the earth"" on Kung-Fu.  David probably has the most lines in the movie.  I wish i had other david movies in mind to compare this too.  Quentin is the only person who can swim in left field with a full-proof game plan. Quentin is a genious.  Gordon Liu, who played Johnny Mo in vol. 1, is awesome as well.  He plays Pai Mai, a very old Kung-Fu teacher.  What's impressive about his scenes, and more reasons why quentin is a genious, is the attention to authenticity.  One noticable difference between the kung fu movies of today versus yesterdays' is realism.  i can imagine hard-core fans of bruce lee disapointed in the lack of realism in movies like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon for example.  The Pai Mai scenes make the modern kung fu classics more believable and, in the long run, produce everlasting movie magic with it's attention to ""human"" details.  Michael Madsen, who plays bill's brother, has the most memorable role in the movie.  I've seen him in enough movies to think i knew what was going to happen when the movie pulled me into his story.  I was wrong though.  His character was very bold.  It would be very easy to compare him to his role in Reservoir Dogs, but this character was so bold and real that it feels like it's from Pulp Fiction. But, he wasn't the coolest person in the movie.  That was Elle Driver, played by Daryl Hannah.  If your a fan of hers, then this is the movie to put on your pedestal.  Daryl was like the Sandra Bullock of the 1980's.  I forgot about that during this movie.  Daryl Hannah kicks butt as the villain.  Surprising, because i wasn't very impressed with her introductory scene in vol. 1.  Quentin gives her her time to shine in this one.  Those who were in love with her during the eighties will be in love with her again.  She is very sexy, until . . .<br/><br/>Volume 2 works on a level that's more satisfying then volume 1.  Volume 1 was a samurai/yakuza homage that was filled with GLIMPSES of characters, the latter is a western kung-fu movie spilling with character simultaneously bringing the saga into full circle.  Other highlights include Cinematographer Robert Richardson's beautiful capture of the mid-western landscape, and Robert Rodriguez's acoustic/electric guitar score.  i wish it would have been included on the soundtrack c.d.  hint hint"

The contrast of b&w scenes, color scenes, and colorized scenes, and even `home movie' footage, the highly stylized costuming, the lighting perfectly effective throughout. Even the soundtrack is nice and effective in volume 2, as it definitely was not in volume 1.<br/><br/>So what if it's a lame story (it totally is). So what if David Carradine has an annoying lisp (and it is very annoying). So what if kung fu guy's hair style rivals Donald Trump's. None of it matters. Because, Mommy rules!<br/><br/>

","Well, I didn't much like the first one, finding it vulgar and tasteless, so one can't really be surprised that I didn't like the second one. To be fair, however,<br/><br/>Tarantino has made a fair go at adding story and character to his revenge saga, but it's ultimately to little effect. He performs any number of post-modern stylistic pirouettes, sly cultural references, witty asides and cinematic homages, but the end result - for this reviewer at least - was to shrug and say: ""So what?"""

Now it might not be solid action like the first one which had the fight between the Bride and the Crazy 88, but instead we got cool scenes, a strong story line, and we learnt The Brides real name.

","OK first of all let it be known that i loved Kill Bill 1 because it didn't have any pretensions about what it was, a cool, witty samurai movie which draws upon the best of genre films only does better which leaves the viewers with a feast of gore and chick fights which stand up against 'crouching tiger'. Unfortunately the 2nd volume does not rely on action and cool laconic Dialogue which is OK i grant you. Clearly Tarantino wanted to spend the entire film with characters exchanging pointless below average lines (not Tarantino quality of 'Resevoir dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction) because he had faith in the cinematic appeal of Bill which im sorry wasn't there. Their is one semi decent action scene in the entire film between daryhl Hannah and Uma Thurman's the bride and the rest is dependent on the on character relationships which are .. well ..LAME! I don't mind a slow paced film but if it lacks the dialogue and emotion that makes them enjoyable they are the worst type of film to have to sit through. Sorry to disappoint my friends - Kill Bill 1's an 8/10 possible DVD purchase, Kill Bill 2's a 5/10 at the most and i suggest you suppress your curiosity until it comes out on TV or something."
"tnnick77","10","0","1","9 May 2004"," To anyone who has anything negative to say.
","I would like to comment on Kill Bill: Volume 2.  I was surprised to see a few other users commenting about this film negatively.  Although entitled to their opinions, I feel that they do not show this second volume any justice. First of all, Kill Bill: Volume 2 is equally as excellent as Kill Bill: Volume 2.  There is simply a different atmosphere, to a degree.  Your enjoyment of the film is what you make it.  Tarantino finds it necessary to show a considerable amount on Budd, but I do not see how it slows the movie down.  Kill Bill: Volume 1 has fast-paced parts and slow-paced parts, as well.<br/><br/>What most people do not understand is that although this is a revenge movie, there should be no major issue about sympathy or empathy with the Bride. The issue, rather, is WHY she is doing what she is doing.  Unless you are involved completely in the life as an international assassin who is among a social group of outstanding martial arts experts who are assassins themselves, you cannot begin to understand the complexities involved.  The Bride and her enemies have totally different mindsets than the average commoner in society.  The Bride's issue is ""kill or be killed"" and as mentioned within Kill Bill: Volume 1, all human emotion and compassion are compressed within a warrior's mind.  Things happen in this world that are right and that are wrong.  If someone wipes out a person's family, two wrongs don't make a right, but that is beside the point in these movies. It is arguable that just there is a time for peace, love, sadness, war, famine, etc., there is a time to fight...and yes, a time to kill.<br/><br/>
Finally, Tarantino is telling a story in HIS very own unique and brilliant manner.  I myself felt sympathy with the Bride in Volume 1, but I feel that that was not Tarantino's goal, so that is merely a side effect.  The movies seemed to be different simply because of the EMPHASIS on different characters.  Each Death List Five character has a different amount of emphasis...so any issue of HOW LONG TARANTINO DECIDED TO STRESS A CHARACTER'S PERSONAL STORY is irrelevant and unnecessary."
"valadas","7","0","1","12 May 2004"," Sentimental violence
","Well first you must take for granted that The Bride (Uma Thurman) is a superwoman that can survive injuries that would kill the strongest mortal in this earth. This second part has a much less poetic atmosphere than the first one and less ballet-like fighting scenes and dwells more upon the psychological displays of the characters which culminate in the final scenes where sentiment and emotion prevail over violence though the latter is always present more or less intensely. In this movie you'll find the full explanation of what looked like a flaw of the first movie: the motive behind the killing of all the people at the wedding rehearsal and a quite plausible one. Well these killers may have sentiments too, who knows? Negative or positive of course. Anyway the love-hate relationship that exists between the two main characters is depicted with real strength and a certain contained emotion well displayed by Thurman and Carradine, emotion that explodes in the very last scene played by Thurman. It's a good movie of its kind (of course) after all."

","For those of you that have already seen (and enjoyed) the first film, this film may be a  disapointment.While the first film was full of frantic action, and super-human kung fu moves,  this film is definitely waay slower in execution.<br/><br/> First things first.  This film is far too long.****   SPOILERS AHEAD****<br/><br/> I don't understand why the spanish pimp was in this film at all.  He seems to talk very slowly,  and neither his words nor his actions have any consequence on the film at all.   Likewise, the  same with Bill's last scene.  He seems to talk at length about, well not much at all really.<br/><br/> While one complaint of the first film was the lack of dialogue, in Volume 2, there is simply  too much to handle.  Long, drawn-out  passages from Bill try to illustrate the depth of his  character, but by the end of the feature, its clear that's he a pompous ass.  Bud is a loser,  and we are not told why his scene in the bar was included, as it has no bearing on any of the  other characters.<br/><br/> The one saving grace is Gordon Liu's character, providing some comic relief.  His character  (Pei Mai) is a ridiculous parody of nearly every 'master' character that ever existed, and Liu  seems to relish the role.<br/><br/> On balance, I think Volume 2 is a slightly better film than the first, as Tarantino does not  seem intent on showing off his cool film collection every 5 seconds (this was one thing that  really riled me through Vol 1), but the pacing is too slow. The camerawork is great, the fight  scenes are superbly choreographed, the sound track is cool ( and Daryll Hannah is brilliantly  vampish ), but for reasons cited above, this movie is less than brilliant."

","I sure am tired of all the snobbery displayed by the self-anointed film afficionadoes over the ""Kill Bill"" movies.  The films are simply not good. Yes, they are stylish and have some great action sequences, but the dialogue is poor (unusual for Tarantino), the plot uninteresting, and large swaths of the footage wasted.  I understand he dragged it out in order to split it into two films, but to me, the best part is still the very first sequence of the first film.  It would have made a better single film; instead we get two pieces of drawn-out schlock.<br/><br/>KB2 is most noteworthy in that the body count and gore is way down from the first film.  Best of all, as a kid who grew up on Kung Fu, I really enjoyed seeing ""Grasshopper"" again.

","After viewing this motion picture, I felt complete. It had taken almost six months to watch this movie as a whole, but it was worth the wait. Kill Bill, as a singular film is one of the best of all time, probably Tarantino's best work. Vol.2 as a film worked well, rich in classic Tarantino dialogue, Bill's Superman soliloquy being the perfect example, less of the rapturous violence that filled number one, but made up for by the inclusion of the coolest character in the Kill Bill saga, Pai Mei. His scenes of 'cruel tutelage' shot in a 70's kung Fu movie style really demonstrate Gordon Liu's martial art mastery (yes, the same Gordon Liu that played Johnny Mo in vol.1) All is explained in this concluding chapter, with twists and turns as is to be expected from the great director and a cameo from the man called Sam. The ending of this film had to be good and it is, it is. If you haven't already, watch Vol. 1 on video or DVD, then go to the cinema and watch no. 2, then spend three days trying to remove the smile from your face.

","Let's take, for example, 'The Godfather'.  I can't remember any sword fights, jumpsuits, or acrobatics.  There were only one or two moments when anyone was even firing a gun.  This, clearly, is one of the worst movies ever made.  Where's the action?<br/><br/>Another example would be 'Taxi Driver'.  Sure, the end has some fine elements to it, including a hand being shot with a .44 magnum pistol, but the rest is all this 'I'm Travis and I'm afflicted' crap.  No action! Garbage!<br/><br/>Now, in our day we have Kill Bill Volume 2.  Volume 1... now there's a movie.  No real motives, no sympathy, no true focus besides veins and arteries being severed that spurt blood with more vigor than an open fireplug.  As for volume 2, it's unfortunate, shocking even, that the film would open with something akin to the 'Bonasera' scene from the Godfather (not counting the reprise of the first scene from Vol. 1).  The tension that the wedding chapel scene builds, forcing the audience to wait for the inevitable and gory (but mostly unseen) conclusion is heartbreaking, but.. . where's the blood?  Budd getting chastised by his cokehead boss in the most dry and outstanding bit of honest humor since the Dude got chewed out by the Malibu chief of police was nice, but Michael Madsen didn't subsequently slash his face, remove his ear or even shoot him in the skull somewhere. Why not?  It's an ACTION movie!  They should have had Jerry Bruckheimer do Vol. 2... that way some kick-ass spaceships and aliens would have come in and blown the place apart, just at the climax of the two-part epic where Uma Thurman and David Carradine have the most intense battle scene in the movie before even lifting their swords.<br/><br/>I hope that an audience which does not recognize, admire and enjoy the abilities of the writers and actors who generate more suspense, fear (claustrophobia in this case), excitement and laughter without a drop of blood or a fart joke does not become too powerful.  The failure to appreciate what Vol. 2 has to offer will cause us to miss the value in the sublime and psychological tactics of books like 'Great Expectations' and 'Of Mice and Men', movies like 'Dr. Strangelove' and 'Vertigo' or anything that prefers to evoke an emotional response from its viewers over a knee-jerk reaction.<br/><br/>Then again, I should probably never accuse Tarantino of being sublime..."

","How clever of Quentin Tarantino to plunder his favourite movies and rework the highlights into this one note revenge tale, the second half of which tries to add substance to the story after a first volley which had all the depth of a teaspoon of water. You'll read on this site and many others that Kill Bill is a great work, a superb directorial effort, too good to be dismissed as trash according to Kim Newman. Well, not wishing to be rude to Mr.Newman, but this is a load of Thurman. Well directed your action surely is but the dialogue is as clumsy as this sentence without the ironic and therefore clever constructivism exhibited therein. Like this horribly self-indulgent review, every scene has the 'tino yelling 'did you see what i've done there?' at the audience before the entire enterprise eventually collaspses under the weight of it's own self-satisfied smugness. The literary framing device is also a dubious decision as it draws attention to the lack of story and character on display. If Kill Bill were a novel it would be airport lounge material. It could have been great had it been edited with the same ruthless efficency as the action, but it's overlong as a single film with an uneasy shift in pace and tone between the two halves that will surely weaken it as a single film should anyone choose to view it that way in the future. Kitchy, well made rubbish it may be but it's rubbish all the same. Ok, so it's not supposed to be profound but when Tarantino mentions your Kill Bills in the same breath as Raiders of the Lost Ark and Leone's Dollars Trilogy, it's clear that seeing every film under the sun and enjoying them enough to rip them off is not akin to understanding how those movies work and why or, lets face it, how the filmmakers involved reworked genre conventions and movie tropes to produce something fresh and sustantial without being simply derivative. <br/><br/>Soulless stuff."
"Chris_Docker","9","0","1","5 May 2004"," Classic Tarantino
","Tarantino movies are almost a genre in themselves. Stylised violence, trendy sequences, all delivered with great panache and storylines that are original enough to be noticed. Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction set a high standard to follow, even though they were acclaimed by audiences more than serious critics. Dusk till Dawn was something of a flop as vampire and gangster stories failed to gel, whilst the understated Jackie Brown seemed little more than an aberration from established Tarantino style. With Kill Bill and Kill Bill II, Tarantino is back on form with a vengeance. Part One demonstrated extreme and polished action scenes into which much thought had gone - for instance a martial arts stand off that contrasts genre wirework fighting some of the most realistic fighting on film since Bruce Lee; the overall effect was a surfeit of stunning action where viewers would probably have been content with the simplest of explanatory codas to justify the visual experience. Kill Bill II, on the other hand, rather than just filling in these holes, presents us with some fantastic characterisation and an underlying plot for Parts I and II that is as gut wrenching as it is believable. As we follow elite killer Uma Thurman in her quest to hunt down and kill Bill we are given insight into her physical prowess (learnt at the hand of a legendary and unique teacher), and dragged through the emotional turmoil that has sparked off the whole raison d'etre. Complex relationships between the members of the elite group of killers spiral into an insoluble dilemma for the two main players: one that can only be resolved by taking a heartbreaking decision. Kill Bill is a major triumph for director Quinten Tarantino and worth every minute."
"BIGHAIRY-1","6","0","1","2 May 2004"," Good but not great
","As a stand alone action/drama, Kill Bill Vol.2 can be held against any film of this kind & would compare favourable. Which was why I had a problem with it. The standards that Mr Tarantino set in the first volume come no where near to being matched in terms of impact, style or balls. Don't get me wrong, KBV2 has some truly wonderful set pieces (the eye popping trailer catfight between Uma Thurman's Bride & Darryl Hannah's Elle Driver standing out) and some typical Tarantino humour. The performances are top notch too. Particularly David Carradine who portrays Bill with dignity & menace in equal measures. The problem I had with this film is that it's trying too hard to be a Tarantino film. It's packed with unneccesary dialogue that is trying to be cool & snappy (a usual QT trademark) yet over does it. Lines like ""wakey wakey eggs & bakey"" sound contrived, as if it is someone trying to write like Tarantino, rather than the man himself. And QT seems to have taken his directing style straight from the Sergio Leone school of film making. (The camera dollying out of the church to show the 4 assasins waiting out side is ripped out of most of Leone's spaghetti westerns) It's ok to parody someone, but to pilfer someone in this fashion feels a bit cheap. That said, it's still well worth a look. Especially if you've seen the first installment, as the characters are fleshed out a bit more & aren't as cartoony as in they were in Volume 1. You also get a cracking good flash back when the Bride is sent to train with Master Pai Mei (Gordon Liu). If however you haven't seen Volume 1 don't bother seeing it because it will probably confuse the hell out of you. Overall, it is a film that is peppered with genius yet falls short of expectations."

"thepts","Null","0","1","2 May 2004"," Shocking, terrifying and fun. A full movie - more enjoyable than vol 1
","Kill Bill Vol 1 and Vol 2 are two quite different movies, and to be able to describe the movie experience I had today I'm simply going to have to compare the two. Here goes:<br/><br/>Vol 1 was highly anticipated by most Tarantino fans and ""film buffs(c)(tm)"" - and I just couldn't shake off the feeling many of these people liked Vol 1 simply because they wanted to like it, and because it fit easily into their ""Code of Coolness in Film"". To put it in another way, I saw a lot of people just swallowing Vol 1 whole without being able to explain to me what they found so amazing. Hence, Vol 1 became, in my opinion, overrated.<br/><br/> The concept that most annoys me with Vol 1 in particular, is that when a fightscene is introduced, you know the one(s) not being Uma Thurman will die horribly. Then, it takes a lot of time before said death(s) occur.<br/><br/>Like it was in vol 1, where you knew ridicoulusly little on characters and background, it left you as a puppet watching people you had no relationship with - shed ketchup aesthetically, and ""fighter B"" inevitably having to die.<br/><br/>Boring - unless you're the kind of guy/girl who enjoys it to the max every single time you see a gush of artificial blood. Though I'll admit that might have been fun back in VHS days when parents still frowned at ""violence as entertainment"".<br/><br/> In Vol 2, events and scenes take more surprising turns than in Vol 1. Vol 2 also goes deep into characters and story, and lets actors ACT in addition to doing the ""grrr!"" thing. We see more of the reasons why the characters did what they did - and why they do what they do. Tarantino is first and foremost good with shaping solid characters and solid scenes, and that comes well out for this part of ""Kill Bill"".<br/><br/> Vol 2 is also quite horrifying at times, and yes, I am more or less pointing to the grave scene here. That one shakes you good for a long while. Then follows the parodic and fun chapter with Pai Mei, The Bride's strong ""kung> fu""-master - this is refreshingly light and feels good after The Grave. That contrast had a lot of good movie energy in it.<br/><br/> A lot of people have been calling this movie inferior to Vol 1 - they're simply wrong - on several levels. I think it's safe to say Tarantino wanted to make two contrasting parts, where Vol 2 had the actual content and plot of the movie. So basically what it boils down to, is whether you were ready for Kill Bill to become a Movie.<br/><br/> OK - Vol 1 is quite predictable, but a good 2 hours - it has a lot better music than Vol 2, and is also more experimental in filming than this one.<br/><br/>In fact, both are good movies, and as a whole, ""Kill Bill"" leaves a mark in your memory. Still, as separate parts, Vol 2 is surprising, shocking, emotional, terrifying and fun where Vol 1 was more or less ""shocking and fun"" alone. Was this contrast intended? Probably. Anyway, if you're only going to watch one of them (for some reason), watch this one."

One of my friends even fell asleep during the movie!<br/><br/>Now i'm not saying that this film is awful. It is good and has some great moments, even a good send off to the first movie. But there were so many moments where the characters were just sitting round a table and talking for ten minutes which did make me want to yawn and look at my watch.<br/><br/>
(possible spoilers) the great moments were the bride and elle fight sequence, and the brides escape from the grave. Other than that there weren't really any points that made the story from the first that gripping or exciting. the Tarantino directing style was definitely there, but not as obvious when compared to his earlier work. top marks for Tarantino's shots and camera movement, but the storyline and flow of the film was a little slow and basic. <br/><br/>I'd say for any Tarantino fan, whether u like it or hate it, it's worth seeing for the presentation of the film.

The action was good but the rhythm felt somewhat wrong with the big ending fight (the kill'em all and the one-on-one felt kind of like one big thing with only a slight pause to mark the intersection) being sort of all there was to the climax of a so far dull plot. For a film to be really great I think it has to surprise me in some way or make me think about things, this is absent in Kill Bill.<br/><br/>Volume two put the plot to a little higher grade though it still isn't the most fascinating ever. The style of the film isn't as much Japanese manga-inspired (with the Japanese subject of revenge dead and all) but feels more like a classic American action movie..<br/><br/>The playing with styles is really the strength of Kill Bill and this is just as wonderfully displayed in vol 2 as it was in vol 1. The film felt more fluent, and though there was a lot of dialogue it felt pleasurable listening to, perhaps more because of the way it was performed than what was actually said..<br/><br/>Overall - a better film throughout than vol 1 but even better as the ending to the great movie that is ""Kill Bill"" 8/10"

","In the original film, we saw Uma Thurman kill loads and loads of people to get to two people. She namely out to kill two out of the Assassin squad she had once been part of, but which later betrayed her. After she managed to kill two out of it's four members, the movie ended. But we all knew that a Volume 2 was coming up.<br/><br/>In Volume 2 she goes after the remaining members of the Assassin squad, plus it's leader: Bill. This time, it's awhole lot of more talk and less action. In contrast to the assassins played by Lucy Liu and Viveca A. Fox in the first volume, the assassins in these films (played by Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah) are very much developed. At least Michael Madsen's character (Budd). We follow him for a few hours of his life, prior to the moment when the Bride shows up. However, it appears Budd is quite resourceful and manages to evade the Bride's attack.<br/><br/>Daryl Hannah's character Elle is brought into the picture as Budd wants to sell her a sword. Elle get's a little less development as we don't really see any scenes from her normal everyday life. But from the dialogue she later shares with The Bride, we get to know quite abit about her character. Superbly done, everything. The Bride and Elle share an awesome fight scene, with a very surprising and perfect ending.<br/><br/>So anyway, that fight scene is the only real action we get in this film. And one might say that that's not what we wanted, considering everyone loved Kill Bill Vol. 1 for it's over the top violence and action. This film is more story driven than the first Volume, and it's definetly great. Altough some scenes tend to get a little bit to slow. Quentin could have cut some scenes down by a minute or so, to keep the audiences interested, instead of starting to lean back in their seats, waiting for something to happen.<br/><br/>The soundtrack, like all Quentin's films, is superb. The acting is great. The dialogue may not be as good as his other films, but it holds up (most of the time). It has a good ending (altough there's not a big fight involved, if that's what you want). Pretty much, this film has what we wanted from Kill Bill vol. 2. It's an excellent, but not flawless, continuation of Volume 1.<br/><br/>You should definetly go see this.

Unfortunately the most common defense I hear by supporters is that if you didn't like it, you didn't understand it (as if it were Shakespeare) or you're a simple action-movie junkie who needed a fix.<br/><br/>I've enjoyed many other films where dialogue successfully keeps the film engaging and interesting, driving the plot forward (i.e. Miller's Crossing, Chinatown, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Reservoir Dogs etc.) and chuckle at this poor attempt of KBv2 to do the same (yes I know QT did Reservoir Dogs).<br/><br/>I can appreciate nearly any kind of film type in what it tries to do, as long as it does it WELL. At first, I didn't know what to make of KBv1 because it didn't have the usual QT banter we're all used to. I wasn't sure where he was going.<br/><br/>It didn't matter in the end because the action was more than satisfactory, and some of the best communication in the film was subtle and not endlessly over drawn: Oren Ishii and Beatrix's profound respect for each other as warriors behind the HoBL, Beatrix's deep appreciation of Hanzo's assistance towards reaching her goal, Bill's mysterious and omnipotent puppeteering in the background in key scenes... you didn't HAVE to be knocked over the head with a play-for-play explanation as to the motivations of the characters - a lot was inferred.<br/><br/>In KBv2 however, nearly everything is explained to us as if we're eight year olds. Talk talk talk talk talk. In Miller's Crossing, the dialogue is cleverly written and serves to constantly reveal layer after layer of it's complex and twisting plot with hints of symbolism throughout to reveal the emotional state of the characters.<br/><br/>In One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, the dialogue-based script (based on the excellent Kesey novel) successfully holds up to light the conflict created when one tries to inject individualism into a repressive system designed to force the masses into conformity. It's entertaining, disconcerting and unpredictable all at the same time.<br/><br/>So here comes KBv2. I know it's not meant to be particularly deep, but it decides to put aside the rock'em sock'em excellence of the first film to spoon feed us the plot details in the second. Well that can work better if the dialogue had something to offer - sadly, KBv2 for many it seems, does not. It's often over drawn and heavily in need of editing (why take so long to make a simple, barely important point?).<br/><br/>Bill's parables, some of which are interesting (Clark Kent), take faaaaar too long to say something. By the end, everytime he opened his mouth you knew he was going to just begin babbling off another 5 minute story (""the truth serum doesn't take effect for two more minutes! babble babble babble""). The mexican pimp only adds to the tediousness of it all. Budd didn't say one memorable line the entire excessive time he was on screen (except the 'and we deserve to die shown' in v1).<br/><br/>While KBv1 said a lot (despite some cheesiness) by saying less, the excessive talk in KBv2 could've served the audience better by being tighter and more engaging.<br/><br/>The other main disappointment of KBv2 (when compared to KBv1) is in the way it handles it's ""genre homage"". The Japanese samurai attitude is well represented in v1, as is it's nod to Japanese modern pop culture, along with the taste of 70's american pulp fiction (glasses, van, music, Vernita). In v2 we get a taste of old school Chinese film influence which is the highlight of the movie.<br/><br/>But I take a strong exception of KBv2's attempt to be compared to the great spaghetti westerns, which makes up the theme of at least half the movie. Besides being in a western setting, mimicing the music, and maybe biting a few camera shots and angles, it has NOTHING to do with the Sergio Leone/Eastwood classics. Go watch the movies yourselves (Fist Full of Dollars, A Few Dollars More, The Good the Bad and the Ugly). You don't ""feel"" none of that greatness in KBv2.<br/><br/>For instance, there's no one as pitiful as Budd in those movies. Also, there's no character presented with the awesome presence of Eastwood's ""Man with no Name"" character. There's no intensely skilled and confident antagonist like Lee Van Cleef (who at least proves his skills by doing something on the film, unlike Bill). The style and coolness factor of those films is DEFINITELY not in KBv2, which only adds to the disappointment of what's left. Even Sam Raimi's ""The Quick and the Dead"" is a much better homage to this genre.<br/><br/>I didn't like how we are to assume that a character deserves their title as a world class assassin. Oren Ishii -now she deserved all the awe and respect we gave her by the end of the KBv1. She is by far the only DiVA (besides Beatrix) to be fully fleshed out. The Metal Gear Solid approach to give us background on the villain was successfully used with her, and I wanted it for all the DiVas and Bill. Do we get it? No... too much time instead is wasted on unedited dialogue and a weak Western side plot.<br/><br/>Budd's character - we're supposed to assume he's a great DiVA assassin? Throw us a friggin bone to chew on QT! After Oren Ishii's innovative background introduction, can we see at least ONE awesome flashback of Budd in top form? Something where he's not a portly oaf, slobbing along cleaning up dirty toilet water? Contrast is what's missing to fully appreciate his degradation because we don't have a clear point of reference to compare him to. So for 30 minutes of the film, we see him arching his eyebrows and mumbling nonsense... what a waste.<br/><br/>Vernita Green - In v1. we at least get to see she's all that in the first scene of v1, but then she completely disappears for the rest of both volumes! Another great opportunity wasted to make room for endless babble. A flashback showing her origins and entry into the DiVAs was SORELY missing. A great story wraps up loose ends like that, and to tell O.Ishii's story fully without giving the others a near equal treatment is just plain sloppy, let alone the fact that the alternative given was far less entertaining.<br/><br/>Elle - Her constant presence in v2, along with a presentation of her disposition in v1 was at least a good attempt to flesh out another DiVA. I enjoyed what was there, but would've also like to see her and Bill's past relationship highlighted. A minor request, but at least her scene with Pai Mei was included.<br/><br/>Bill - As much as I liked him in v1. I disliked him more in v2. As a character, he had all the potential in the world but comes across as extremely underwhelming of a main villan. Like Budd, we get nothing to show he's the most dangerous man in the world.<br/><br/>With Hanzo's eyes trembling at the suggestion of Bill in v1, after seeing what DiVAs like Vernita, Elle and O.Ishii are capable of under his leadership, after seeing Beatrix kill over 100 dangerous people just to get at him, THIS is all we get?!?!?! How underwhelming can a main villian be?!<br/><br/>
He sits around playing the unassuming assassin who blows his Kung Fu flute and intimidates by cutting sandwiches with a butcher knife, all the while just talk talk talk talk talk on end, non stop... shut up already please and get to the point. Screw that, throw us a friggin' bone QT! I understand that a scene of him in hardcore killing action was cut - it might've helped, but still he disappoints. And to go out like a punk at the end of KBv2 (some elaborate beach fight with Beatrix was not filmed either). Oh man what a waste. Beatrix kills dozens of enemies just to take out Bill in seven seconds at a coffee table by attacking his heart (corny symbolism)... booooooo!<br/><br/>KBv1 wasn't particularly deep, but it found it's purpose and pulled it off well: it had many innovative presentation styles, an unexpected anime sequence, a death attack theme riff to get us pumped for the ensuing battle, perfectly layered and memorable musical themes, PLENTY of exciting action, and interesting, memorable characters (Vernita, O.Ishii, GoGo, Hanzo, Crazy 88s, Buck, Sophie, a mysterious Bill, Elle the nurse, even ""Charlie Brown"" etc.).<br/><br/>KBv2 is appallingly weak in comparison. Innovative presentation styles? The B&W church scene is a nice unique intro but WAY to long at 30+ minutes (plus the HoBL B&W takes away some of the uniqueness for the series). Pai Mei's scene is infinitely awesome, but the burial scene is just above interesting. The remaining 80% of the flick is just a standard movie.<br/><br/>
Memorable music? Only one of the themes in the final credits caught my interest... notice how there is no buzz about the music like the film before? Even the death musical riff feels out of place... Beatrix doesn't kill anyone with it! The serviceable but forgettable music in v2 is definitely a disappointment. Compare that to KBv1:<br/><br/><ul><li>Bang Bang in the opening credits - Twisted Nerve's evil whistle tune in the hospital - The soft humming melody when the Bride sees Hanzo's swords in the attic. - The Flight of the Bumblebee during the Tokyo motorcycle ride - 5678's songs in the HoBL - Don't Let Me be Misunderstood opening in the Japanese garden's final battle</li></ul><br/><br/>That's musical greatness in one single movie! How could KBv2 be so average in comparison?!<br/><br/>How about interesting characters? Bill went from cool unseen in v1 to boring and long winded in v2. Strip bar characters are forgettable, no one in the church opening (even the great Sam Jackson) raises an eyebrow, her husband-to-be was a joke, the mexican pimp was a waste, Budd was just plain blah with no background story, the Korean assassin added nothing, and B.B. was a one-dimensional, smile-happy character as the emotionless Nikki was in v1. Pai Mei and Elle are all in the movie that are memorable.<br/><br/>KBv2 was not wrong for going in a different direction, it's wrong in the execution of it. While not as bad of a sequel as Reloaded and Revolutions, it has too many problems from the gifted filmmaker to be as basic as it is.<br/><br/>
There are people who obviously liked, loved, or are enamored with KBv2... I have no qualms with you. But try not to paint every critic as a disappointed action junkie. What QT tried to do in v2 is actually more difficult than making a decent action film sequel, but the payoff could've been more satisfying, and in my opinion it misses the mark."

","First I would like to point out the fact that I wrote this comment several times, and each time was different from the other. My idea was to make a short review of the plot, but there are so many spoilers on the other comments that it was just pointless... so I preferred to talk about the movie without actually revealing anything. Take it from someone who didn't know Tarantino until he saw Pulp Fiction, just one year ago.<br/><br/>In a sequel that made us wait for 5 long months, Quentin Tarantino finally brings us the conclusion of an excellent story. Within the two hours, we can see the other side of the story, the non-violent side, if you will. With a lot less fights, and a lot more plot, this movie is just what the fans were waiting for.<br/><br/>From the beginning of the movie, when it repeats exactly the initial part of the first film, I knew I was heading for something good. Just watching the reaction of people, thinking that there was some kind of mistake, was enough for me to say ""I'm gonna have a ball here"". And guess what... I did.<br/><br/>The movie has this particular way of telling you stuff without actually showing them to you... a Tarantino trademark, one might say. Take for example a scene that show us nothing but a black screen. There's nothing left to do for us but imagine just what's going on in there, and that's what a movie is all about: get into you and make you participate, have you identify with the plot, that's the only way to have a good time. And the movie is full of this kind of stuff. Like the Bride's name, for instance. What other brilliant mind, besides Tarantino's, could possible figure out a way to make the viewer really get into the movie? From the first time, on Volume 1, when they beeped her name; it made us all see in detail every aspect of the movie, looking for that hidden name. Well, the secret is revealed in the sequel, and it sure made me say ""Quentin, you're a genius"". Those little details that make you say that... that's just good entertainment. It's not only about telling you a story, but also make you really be one with the story. He uses those kind of details to make you pay attention during the whole time.<br/><br/>Now, in the acting part... well, I'm no judge, but Uma Thurman deserves an Oscar... it's not easy being The Bride, but somehow, she managed to do it. I would give her the Oscar for the final part only. Don't worry, I'm not gonna tell you what it is, but pay attention at the end of the movie, and you'll know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Just one more thing... if you're gonna watch this movie, PLEASE, first watch Volume 1... it's against nature to see a sequel without knowing what is all about."

","The writing is  fresh, well conceived, and engaging.  (The Superman monologue and the flapping-fish metaphor are core achievements in writing that will resonate for a long time.)  Robert Richardson's  cinematography is beautiful.   Compostitionally captivating.  Thanks to the writing, I've never seen a more evil and likable villain.  Caradine should be remembered for this performance.  Thurman shines as well.   Budd doesn't put up a fight when his titty-bar boss verbally pistol whips him, yet he proves to be a scary assassin.  Perla Haney-Jardine sets an unprecedented standard for child acting.   There are many good things to see here."

","Well,well......Vol 1 made such an impression, I was forced to see the 2nd one as soon as I could. Former was great , the latter greater(again not as great as the greatest::::PULP FICTION). Still a wonderful movie xperience where the characters actually come out.In the previous volume Uma's character was much of an action hero.....which turned into a complete woman. First was about fury,anger,revenge.....while the second one about love,depth and motherhood. It was only possible for QT to bring such a remarkable but still enjoyable contrast in the storyline of the two volumes which comprise of the same story. Still some faults may be detected with this one.Firstly Budds personal life description was not essential,secondly Pei Mei part was a bit comical which I think is harmful for a crime-drama-action movie,thirdly Bill's image could have been made a little bit more cunning(although brilliantly portrayed by Caradine). Overall a great movie made with a completely new style of story-telling.It's a must watch.Just can't miss.........9.5/10"
"black_fog_uk","Null","0","1","30 April 2004"," Crap!
","The first Kill Bill was an original, high-octane offering and I was eagerly waiting for the second installment. What a disappointment. Kill Bill 2 is a very long film, to long in fact. Not enough action but more than enough meaningless dialogue. Uma Thurman is impressive as the Bride and Carradine is full of charisma, but the film is just boring. Tarantino should have left this material where it belongs - editing room floor. This film is basically a wimpy soap opera, with swords.. Crap!"
"masercot","Null","0","1","4 May 2004"," Tarantino Does the Impossible
","Quentin Tarantino actually does the impossible:  He is able to get David Carradine to act.  And act he does, for one of the best and possibly ONLY performances of his career.  The final chapter of the second volume is incredible...although predictable...<br/><br/>I also love the fact that they use Gordon Liu, not once, but twice in the movie.  I have enjoyed the popular Chinese movie star with my two boys for a number of years and it was a hoot to see him playing Pai Mei;  he did, in fact, play a student of Pai Mei in the movie, Fist of the White Lotus (a movie that one should see WITHOUT subtitles 'cause they are generally the same color as the background and completely invisible for much of the movie).<br/><br/>There were fewer interesting villians in this movie; however, it was the better of the two ""volumes"".  Killing is all well and good in an action movie; but, the truly evolved action movie sends you out of the theater thinking...and not about how to rig up a motion detector, fertilizer-bomb to rid yourself of your neighbor's barking dog.  You will remember the ""Bride"", Bill and O-Ren Ishii for quite a while...<br/><br/>I'd give this movie three and a half out of four stars...."
"Infernalflora","10","0","1","29 April 2004"," I haven't seen this great a movie in years.
","I was quite astonished at the work put into this film. I hadn't seen Volume 1 in theaters. I purchased the movie upon it's release, just in time for Volume 2. I knew little about the film's details, and only a little more about it's plot. I must say I was thrilled with Volume 1, and far more thrilled with Volume 2. Tarantino's work is unique to say the least. He has a distinction all his own, and it is the dialogue within his films I find most exhilarating. The character of Bill is, well, a literary piece of perfection. Normally, long scenes of dialogue are boring and uninteresting. However, when ""Bill"" tells his tales and spills his stories, it is hard to not be involved. Volume 2 is a bit opposite of Volume 1. Gore, guts, and gross-out stuff prevailed, while explanation, tied-up loose ends, and revelation ruled Volume 2. Each piece of this story is excellent alone, but when you travel back to reality and remember that it's a two part film, well, then you can learn to appreciate such unity, organization, and perfection in film-""creating""."
"mightyalgo","Null","0","1","29 April 2004"," The western half.
","Firstly, If Kill Bill was supposed to run as a whole film, I think Tarantino would have re ordered the chapters so that the Oren fight comes towards the end - rather than make two identical movies with a linear plot he decided to make two diffeent ones.<br/><br/>The first one is a full on kung fu fightfest with spurting blood etc. (it even has the old shaw brothers logo on the front). The second one is not. Not at all. The different presentation should have set that up, at least. No Shaw logo on the front of this one. Hence; it's a completely diffent movie. The difference is a great as that between say, (excuse the simplification) ""Enter the dragon"" and ""Once upon a time in the west"". Actually this film's pacing and long shots would be a dead ringer for Leone's masterpiece, except I think it'll be a cold day in hell before Tarantino uses only a halfhour of dialogue in a three hour movie!<br/><br/>
So, they're two completely different movies but, when it comes down to it, who cares? Surely, we all know what happens at the end of this movie, so why not appreciate the movie as it is rather then trying to fit it into some mould to make it easier to describe? I preferred the fact it's not more of the same, and despite being a claustrophobe to some extent, enjoyed it all the way through. Especially the training sequences, that were so out of left field you had to love them, and were the only real eastern influence in this (america-set) movie. I would probably have swopped the training here with the Vernita Green section in the first one to keep with the east/west divide, but that's nitpicking.<br/><br/>So, what's my point? Dunno, maybe we should view these films as more separate than most people seem to have done. They are completely different and as such, maybe this pair of movies are the most wildly differing original and sequel since the highlander series (though nowhere near as crap as highlander 2. So basically, don't know Vol 2 because it's different. There's nothing more boring than genre sequels (see Speed 2, Under Siege 2, even Die Hard 2 in parts) so enjoy this cross-genre masterpiece while you can. It really needs to be seen in the cinema to really appreciate how uncomfortable everyone gets when a woman is buried alive in front of them, and they're in the coffin.<br/><br/>Alec"

That is the way ""Kill Bill"" was supposed to be seen, not one after the other with a few months in between but as one movie, and definitely not on a TV mini screen with commercial breaks.  I am a happy man now;  I purely enjoyed it;  I don't want to talk about it.  Folks who didn't like this monster movie, please hold your peace and lead fruitful lives.  Probably you're right, maybe it's just monstrous garbage, but the message that got across to me is: Quentin Tarantino loves this garbage and he's top at it.

Kill bill vol 2 is a breathtaking, Kung Fu epic that deserves the fullest attention. Its true that it doesn't have much blood in it; but don't let that stop you! The fight between Elle driver and The Bride was defiantly the highlight of the movie, as the fight with O-Ren in the first film is gorgeous to look at, this fight is gruesome and gory. Quentin Tarantino has made the best film of 2004. When it came to Bill vs Uma i was expecting a Neo vs agent smith fight from The Matrix Revolutions but in instead what came was a great way for an evil man of that standard to die from. The cast was brilliant especially Bill and Budd Tarantino's greatest characters. I could go on about how great this film is, instead i will say my final words: Kill Bill is a fitting climax to one of the best action films of recent years. Go see it and have a blast. 10/10 Saul"

","Great dialogue and great action scenes make Kill Bill-Vol. 2 Quentin Tarantino's best film since Pulp Fiction.  I really wasn't overly impressed with Vol.1.  The expectations were so high, and I felt like I got a Three Stooges cartoon.  This one, however, was elevated with the additions of Michael Madsen & David Carradine, and the focus on the relationship between The Bride and Bill.  The training with Pai Mei was great stuff, and the fight scenes were better in this one (the battle between The Bride & Elle Driver is an all-time classic).  Tarantino's obsession with the 70's is getting a little tiring, but it doesn't detract from the great dialogue (Bill's super-hero analogy is great).  After Jackie Brown & Kill Bill-Vol. 1, I just didn't have the enthusiasm for Tarantino like I did after Pulp Fiction & Reservoir Dogs, but it's back now.  And Uma Thurman is outstanding in this.  She should really be in more high-profile roles than what she's getting."

","Some Spoilers Within!<br/><br/>Much has been said that Vol. 2 is nowhere near the quality of Vol. 1, but it is far from true.<br/><br/>What is true, it that it is very much a different film. Less action yes, but with it we get more depth. You still get your action scenes, the battle with Elle Driver has to be the standout, and ends in a very satisfying conclusion.<br/><br/>The big dramatic scene of the burial is also gripping, and really needs to be appreciated at the cinema, rather than at home.<br/><br/>I have also seen criticism of the amount of talk in the film, but when the words are those of Tarantino, surely this is unfair. The actors do a superb job with the material in most cases. Uma Thurman the standout in every scene she appears, with the possible exception of Chia Hui Liu as Pai Mei, who is nothing short of superb. Speaking as a UK viewer, the one thing that was grim for me, was the acting and script for the Bride's daughter. Attack of the sickly ""Spielberg"" child, if ever I saw one!<br/><br/>Overall though, an excellent experience. Perhaps a little long in places, and the final killing of Bill, although maybe appropriate, may be short of the blood lust some may have craved.<br/><br/>Well worth the viewing, whatever kind of film fan you are. 9/10."

","Volume 2 like Volume 1 is lacking, and the story misses that special sauce. This movie in reality is 1 cut into 2, thus watching 1 leaves the story lacking, and too silly, and watching 2 the movie is serious, but lacks depth, because the viewer loses continuity and background from the 1.   If I watch the 2 films together, the movie would be a 7 or 8, but separate the viewer loses the film's rhythm, making the film awkward, giving the film a less deserving 6.  Kill Bill is outlandish  and entertaining enough to compare with Dusk til Dawn.  Rent the two films together and watch them one after the other so that the story makes sense.  I would not have minded if the movie was long at the theatre, they could of just had an intermission. For example, Scarface and the Godfather had intermissions.  I hope the studio did not cut this movie in 2 for revenue reasons.  Imagine how awful the Godfather or Scarface movie experience would of been if the audience had to wait 3 months to see what happened after Sonny got killed or Tony got arrested for washing money.  6 out of 10 possible 7 or 8 if the 2 volumes were watched together."

"Anonymous_Maxine","10","0","4","28 April 2004"," They must have used up all the fake blood in Volume 1.
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** When you have a movie as hugely popular as Kill Bill Vol. 1, it is to be expected that it's sequel, or in this case it's other half, generates a huge amount of expectation and attention, especially when it also involves a director as hugely (and deservedly) popular as Quentin Tarantino. Combine this with the depth of Tarantino's films and the amount of subject matter that he wisely leaves up to individual interpretation, and you have a virtual blank canvas upon which just about anyone can insert almost any meaning that they want the movie to have. This makes for some pretty interesting film criticism read, on the IMDb and elsewhere, but the reason I bring this up is because I just read an article in the April 26, 2004 issue of Time magazine in which Richard Corliss claims that Kill Bill II has `enough blood to appease the Passion of the Christ crowd.' Is it just me or is this a display of a massive misunderstanding of the Passion of the Christ and it's intended audience?<br/><br/>Anyway, back what is arguably the less violent of the two movies under discussion. Kill Bill II is not a sequel and it's not a prequel, but while it is simply the other half one the same story, it has elements of both sequel and prequel. It's part II but it also tells about the story before part I began but it also picks up directly in the middle of a story, in the middle of which Part I also ended. We learn about what exactly was going on at the fateful `wedding party' where the first film began, we learn about the past of The Bride, why Bill tried to kill her, why she was getting married, and why she is so heavily trained in martial arts (hint: it's not just because she's starring in a movie directed by a life-long lover of kung-fu movies).<br/><br/>(spoilers) There is a memorable scene where The Bride, whose real name turns out to be Beatrix, is enduring some of her early training from an old kung-fu wizard who, when he stands up and fights, reveals that he is not as old as he looks from far away, but rather about as old as he looks close-up. No that the make-up was bad. In fact, that endless beard managed to earn itself a spot as one of the best sources of comic relief in this movie which, being a Tarantino film, is literally brimming with comic relief.<br/><br/>Like Part I, however, Tarantino is very aware of which scenes should have a comedic edge, and which scenes would destroy the movie if they were made amusing. The scene where Beatrix is buried alive, for example, is like the scene in Part I where she realizes that she is no longer pregnant. Neither should be funny, and neither are. In this case, it comes dangerously close, as Budd (one of Beatrix's targets) and one of his Texas hillbilly friends are looking down at the restrained Bride, and said hillbilly, in his miniscule amount of screen time, presents himself as a staggeringly backwards and idiotic inbred moron, such a clod of a man that you almost have to laugh in pity. There really are people like that in the world, it's tragic.<br/><br/>Volume II has been called a character study, and I have to agree. The movie is essentially, and importantly, about the vague and blank spots in Volume I. Specifically, the other characters in the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. While it's true that much of the suspense is killed by the little factoid that it's not hard to guess that these former partners of Beatrix are going to meet an unpleasant end at some point in the movie, the ultimate face-off with Bill could not have been less expected. At least one of the characters, Michael Madsen's Budd, believes that Beatrix deserves her revenge, but none of them, himself included, are planning on allowing her to achieve what she deserves.<br/><br/>I was initially pretty surprised at how talky Volume II is, mostly because I expected it to be even more violent given the fact that is necessarily includes the climax of the overall story. On the other hand, after a movie like Kill Bill Vol. 1, Quentin really had a lot of explaining to do. The dialogue in the movie is unnervingly thoughtful, much of it, especially in the scene with Bill, even psychological, which is another of Tarantino's signature film tricks. He can make brutally violent characters speak like philosophers and you don't even really realize it until you write a movie review about it later and think to yourself, Hey, who talks like that in real life? Or maybe that's just me. My favorite example is most of the dialogue between Vincent and Jules in Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>The females in Kill Bill are famously much deadlier than the men (Budd, for example, has graduated in life to a dingy trailer in the middle of the Texas desert and earned himself the highly skilled job as a bouncer at a topless bar), which is good, because our hero is a woman and what would be the fun of her just running around and exacting her revenge on a lot of men? Compare Daryl Hannah's Elle Driver to Madsen's Budd (and the way she calmly killed him) and you'll know what I mean.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, here's an interesting scene. Elle Driver comes to Budd's house because he's called her to inform her that he has buried alive their highest value target, and he wants to sell her priceless Hattori Hanso sword to Elle for a measly million bucks. Elle shows up, gives Budd the money as he stumbles around the trailer in true redneck form, spilling his drink everywhere (doesn't matter, he's rich now, he won't be living there much longer anyway), and as he sits down and starts greedily pulling out wads of $100 bills, he uncovers a black mamba snake, for which Beatrix was code named.<br/><br/>I assume Elle used a black mamba both for symbolism reasons, as well as to punish him appropriately for burying Beatrix alive before she was able to have her way with her first. At any rate it provides an excellent opportunity for Elle to provide the toxicological contents of the black mamba's venom as it seeps into Budd's bloodstream from all of the bite wounds to his face. Animal Planet was never this muc fun! What makes no sense about the scene is that after the snake delivers a series of fatal bites to Budd's face, it disappears and Elle walks calmly around the trailer, even stooping to the floor to gather the pile of now-loose $100 bills back into the suitcase, never once worried that the snake might still be around to deliver another fatal dose a venom. I doubt if black mamba snakes take sides in such a conflict as these people are engaged in. And besides that, how did she get it in there in the first place?<br/><br/>Sure, there are some holes here, but I like to think that despite such inconsistencies and loose points like these, the movie doesn't even falter. Indeed, it is surely a testament to both the popularity and skill of Quentin Tarantino that he is able to so smoothly get away with a scene like this, where literally the only thing that makes sense is that the snake would be in a biting mood after being stuffed in a suitcase packed with wads of $100 bills.<br/><br/>I've read articles here and there about Quentin talking about putting together a Kill Bill Vol. III sometime in the distant future (after part 1 I had a theory that Vernita Green's daughter would come back in Vol. II to get her revenge against her mother's killer the way O-Ren Ishii did for her parents' killer, but then I realized that she would still be a little girl in Vol. II), as well as an animated prequel in the same style as the animated sequence in Vol.I. Tarantino is, however famous for leaving projects on the back burner for years and years, if not indefinitely, so while a Vol. III would not be released for years anyway, there may be little use in holding your breath waiting for more of the Bill saga to come from the Tarantino camp. I can't believe I just said that. I hate it when people talk about this camp or that camp.<br/><br/>Anyway, Kill Bill as a whole is an intricate and self-sustained movie that is not in need of any other movies to supplement it, but it is also clever in that it leaves tons of room for at least one more or two more movies. And given the popularity and quality of the two parts so far, I don't imagine there would be a lot of complaints about more."

","Before I start, I want to point out I have not seen the first of the two movies.  So i may kick myself in the butt after posting this.  I want to say kill Bill 2 was decent.  I am not a Tarantino fan so I don't expect much out of him.  But I am a film student, so what I am about to say is coming from a film student point of view.  The movie had a lot of dialogue, most interesting but some seemed to ramble on & on.  Also what irritated me was that he doesn't use a lot of a shot variation.  He sticks with a constant shot for every scene and it gets boring, there is nothing there to hold you attention.  If he changed the shots up from time to time and not go back  & forth between two different shots, the movie would have been more interesting.  He does well with the action sequences but the other parts the shots are just boring.  I thought the black & white to color style was effective, relating to past & present.  That worked well.  I will say I am gonna try to rent the first film and watch it but so far i am impressed with the story but not with the filming style.  Tarantino needs to get with the damn program."

","(MINOR SPOILERS)<br/><br/>As The Bride (Uma Thurman) takes her vengeance quest back to the States, the nearly unlimited violence of the first volume is overtaken by story in 'Kill Bill: Volume 2'. Following the new trend of multiple films completed at the same time (a la 'Back to the Future', 'Lord of the Rings' and 'The Matrix'), it is a true continuation of the movie that was released last fall, and is a sequel only as far as the title is concerned. It is rumored that cinemaphile director Quentin Tarantino had originally wanted to create the experience of putting out 'Kill Bill' as a single film with an intermission between the halves. It would have been a moviegoer's dream to watch both parts in the same evening with a run time totaling over 4 hours. However, economics would not permit the artist's vision to be the way he had intended, but the sheer joy of witnessing the completed experience is a rewarding payoff for the wait.<br/><br/>'Volume 1' was about The Bride's (Uma Thurman's) rage at being left for dead. It wasn't important how she got these other assassins to turn on her or how she herself was part of the gang. It was all about the action of bringing violent karma to a full and bloody circle. 'Volume 2' is all story. The whys and hows are put up for discussion, and Tarantino's characters all love to talk. In nonlinear style, we're back to the wedding chapel where the whole mess started and where everyone is alive and kicking. The emotion of the moment is what everyone is concerned with when Bill (David Carradine) shows up (deceptively alone). Because Bill is such a calm and seemingly reasonable figure, we hope against hope that the massacre will not occur as foretold. Unfortunately, nothing changes from the story we were told in the first movie, and The Bride is the only survivor. With the first half of Bill's former of assassins gang (played by Lucy Liu and Vivica A. Fox) dispatched in 'Volume 1', the film picks up with assassin number three, Bud (Michael Madsen), who is also Bill's estranged brother. When Bill comes to warn him of the vindictive heroine, Bud is living in a trailer on the fringes of small-town Texas and taking a great deal of grief at his job bouncing at the local strip club. The Bride moves in for the kill with her new Hatori Honzo sword, only to find the tables suddenly turned. Bud sets up her demise, and calls the fourth assassin, Elle (Daryl Hannah) offering to sell The Bride's priceless Honzo sword. In this time, we learn about how The Bride became such a star pupil in the lethal arts. The sale between Bud and Elle goes sour, and The Bride (who does eventually get a real name) dukes it out with the winner before moving on to Bill. Revealing how she gets to the object of her lethal affection and what happens when she gets to him is simply too well done in film to do it justice in print. It is full of Tarantino's trademark dialogue and tension, and in its own way, this steps above the masterful swordplay of the first climax.<br/><br/>Revenge has never been this much fun, and it is Tarantino's lust for 70's pop culture and cinema that make it possible. (The recently style-less and dry 'Punisher' could take a note or two from this work.) The characters move in their own world and with their own story, but it is a world that we see through the filter of every other tacky revenge movie made in the 1970's. The movie envelops the audience into a camp world of retro pop culture thanks to director of photography Robert Richardson's exhaustive use of varying film stocks and obvious camera moves. In the flashback where we learn of The Bride's training, it is chemically washed out and aged to mute the colors. There is a wildly out-of-place shot where The Bride and Pai Mei train in silhouette against a red background, and it beautifully matches a shot of sword-fighting silhouettes against the blue background from the first half. Director and cinematographer pile on the homages to different directors and films like a kid at an all-you-can-eat make-your-own-sundae bar. It's a dizzying achievement that is all the more enjoyable because you know that Tarantino has done it because he loves it and wants to share that with the whole world. It's the approach Andy Kaufman took to comedy. 'Who cares if the rest of the world thinks its good or not? I think it's great.' 'Kill Bill' is all the better because of that carefree attitude. It's Tarantino's ability to convey that feeling which keeps everything from being just a collection of miscellaneous nods to other directors.<br/><br/>Even if you haven't seen the first half, 'Kill Bill: Volume 2' is a giddy treat of cinema. Rarely does a movie come along and make you feel like a kid in awe while also appealing to your adult sensibilities. Go and see this. Leave the kids at home, and make sure you have enough time to get popcorn. This is a movie experience that just won't be complete without it.<br/><br/>9 out of 10<br/><br/>PS: Stick around until the end of the credits for the rumored blooper reel."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","1","29 April 2004"," Hilary's favorite movie?
","Spoilers Warning !!<br/><br/>On Oscar Night, Billy Crystal casually mentioned that Hilary Clinton's favorite movie is Kill Bill. Is it? Take a look at Vol. 2.<br/><br/>The first thing you'll notice is the striking contrast with KB 1. Take two good examples. On the two top showdown scenes, the duel with O-ren Ishii in the snow displays pure elegance and grace (albeit deadly) while the brawl with Elle Driver in the reeking trailer can't get any more gross. Ultimate polarization, this is. Take also the two scenes with the two teachers. The scene with Hattori Hanzo (forging of the sword) is bathed in an air of solemn, serene reverence. The scene with Pai Mei is comical to the point of being farcical. What has happened? Tarantino, the master of stunning visual compositions, has apparently run out of stylish things to do after Vol. 1. A better answer, however, is that this is supposed to be one movie, not two.<br/><br/>In Vol. 2, then, it's only Chapter 10 that is really delivering. Blending beautifully music, dialogue, story-telling and cryptic action, it delivers a package not seen in the first nine chapters, as well as an opportunity for Thurman and Carradine to act. It could almost be a love story, although under the rules of the game of two killers. Also quite fascinating is the thesis on how Superman is different from all other super heroes in that exactly opposite to them, Superman the hero is the real person while Clark Kent is the altered ego. <br/><br/>Kill Bill should have been one movie. It's painfully clear that both volumes distinctly lack something and they complement each other perfectly. There is also the question of completion of an integrity: both the opening and ending fights (against Vernita Green and Bill respectively) have a little girl in the background. Come to think of it, they should have waited a little bit longer, choosing Mothers' Day as its opening day.<br/><br/>So, is this movie intelligent enough for Hilary? You be the judge. Well, in any event, this Bill is killed. The other one will likely live happily ever after, not to mention being terribly missed."
"mrausch","Null","0","1","28 April 2004"," not enough original spin on traditional genres
","Sometimes I think the mythology behind Quentin Tarantino is greater than the reality.  Tarantino, of course, attracted a following of critics and film buffs with his ultra-violent tale of cops, robbers and betrayal, Reservoir Dogs, then broke into Hollywood's upper echelon with his seminal tale of hitmen and other ne'er-do-wells, Pulp Fiction.  Pulp Fiction's music became annoyingly prevalent everywhere, and the dialogue between stars John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson was quoted everywhere.  Since then, however, Tarantino's record has not been all that impressive. He exec-produced and acted in From Dusk Till Dawn, his modern-day horror yarn of vampires in the dusty southwest desert, a miserable failure despite the star power of hunky George Clooney.  He returned to directing, and resurrected the career of 1970's black action star Pam Grier, with Jackie Brown, another intriguing tale of good guy thieves that failed to live up to the hype.  Along the way, there was always talk of Tarantino's genius, but it always centered around Pulp Fiction, and yet there was never any solid follow-up.  Then came Kill Bill, Vol. 1, with its quirky dialogue, impossibly high body count and kitschy homages to Sergio Leone `spaghetti westerns' and Bruce Lee `chop-socky' movies.  `Tarantino is back!' fans and critics exalted, and with the impending release of Kill Bill, Vol. 2, the anticipation has been strong and widespread.  But while Tarantino honored film masters and genres in his earlier movies through a sly reworking of codes and conventions, as well as a brilliance for scripting indelible dialogue, here he seems content to allow others to dictate his style.<br/><br/>Kill Bill, Vol. 2 picks up where Vol. 1 left off, with the Bride, Beatrice Kiddo (Uma Thurman), having made it past numerous groups of hired killers, now hot on the trail of Bill (David Carradine) the man who left her for dead four years earlier after putting a bullet in her head.  She first sets her sights on Bill's brother, Budd (Michael Madsen), who sidetracks her for a while by burying her alive.  She moves on to Daryl Hannah's eye-patched Elle before ultimately coming face to face, once again, with her one-time mentor and murderer, Bill.<br/><br/>Along the way, we get some of the back story leading up to Bill's attempted assassination of Beatrice filled in, as well as details of their relationship together, as a way of explaining his motivation for trying to do her in, so the film effortlessly crosscuts from past to present, as that which came before comments on the action at hand.  Bill's tutelage of Thurman's youthful assassin, his securing her apprenticeship with the harsh martial arts taskmaster, Pei Mei, and Bill's sense of betrayal resulting in the Massacre at the Two Pines which began this epic tale of bloody revenge.<br/><br/>Tarantino pulls out all the stops in this homogenized homage to pop cinema history.  There's the Hitchcock-inspired black and white photography during the film's opening monologue.  A pullback from inside Two Pines recalls Orson Welles' audacious opening to Touch of Evil, while quick zoom-ins, flashy fast cuts, and the over-the-top acting of the white hair and bearded Pei Mei during Beatrice's grueling tutelage are culled from classic Kung Fu movies.  The desert scenes are accented by Hugo Montenegro-inspired music recalling Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, while other scenes are propelled by 70s influenced action music, calling to mind iconic influences like Chips, Starsky and Hutch and The Streets of San Francisco.<br/><br/>But while Tarantino indulges his obvious fetish for classic pop culture and cinematic history, and while Kill Bill, Vol. 2 is very much a satisfying conclusion to this blood-soaked saga of retaliation and retribution, Tarantino gives us no surprises.  There is nothing here to make you sit up in your chair and gasp, `did that really just happen?'  Even the script, the Tarantino specialty that typically crackles with one pop reference after another, doesn't jump out with any wildly quotable lines of dialogue. That's because Tarantino seems so intent on saluting his own mentors by resurrecting their styles, he's forgotten to craft his own."

","***************** SPOILER WARNING ******************<br/><br/>
I came away very disappointed with the ending of Kill Bill V2.  The first three-quarters of the film had me captivated, but it completely lost me once the Bride got to Mexico.  Half an hour of predictable and uninteresting talk and then a criminally short end fight.  After sitting through four hours of KB, I had at least expected a spectacular ending, but instead we saw a very short and amazingly predictable fight. Some of the acting in KB2 is awful. Michael Madsen, although very charismatic on screen is one of the worst actors I have ever seen, and seems lost unless he is doing the one emotion he has mastered, menace. <br/><br/>
Many people have been raving over David Carradine, and to be fair his performance when judged by his usual standards was pretty good, but when judged against a decent actor, would only appear mediocre.  Fortunately, Uma Thurman, Daryl Hannah and Gordon Liu are all awesome, so the film isn't all bad.<br/><br/>I'd give it 6/10."

","The grand enterprise is all out in front of us now. The spectacular, well-oiled cinematic entertainment machine. It works very nicely and it looks like it's built to last.<br/><br/> By now many moviegoers know the program. `The Bride' (Uma Thurman) got badly beaten, shot in the head, and left for dead at the altar. She survived a four-year-long coma, came to, and set out on a vicious revenge quest to wipe out her former Deadly Viper Assassination Squad cohorts who'd betrayed her. Now, in part two, she gets to their boss, her lover, Bill, who's responsible for the Massacre at Twin Pines that started everything off in the first place.<br/><br/> Volume 1 was mostly battles and back-stories as Uma wiped out the first Deadly Vipers and a whole army of Asian killers in a Tokyo nightclub called The House of Blue Leaves in a dazzling bloody sequence ending with a silent mano-a-mano in a beautiful snowy garden. Volume 2 finishes up the story and delivers a fuller serving of trademark Tarantino talk and more of the Western element, as well as more Asian stuff, this time Chinese. The big change in the equation is that The Bride's adversary, Bill (David Carradine) finally appears, and talks - a lot.<br/><br/> If Tarantino has an obsession as a filmmaker, it's back-stories, and both segments have major flashbacks to develop them. But what Volume 2 does is develop characters more with on-scene dialogue, while continuing with the back-story element.<br/><br/> It's a little bit misleading to try to draw contrasts between the two parts, though, because the whole thing was conceived and reads very much as a whole, even if Volumes 1 and 2 were edited separately. There's a harmonizing rhythm shared by the whole approach (and brilliant'look' provided by Director of Photography Robert Richardson) as well as the way both parts start with The Massacre at Twin Pines and have a series of smaller battles that leads up to a grand finale.<br/><br/> For anybody who can open up to it the whole thing functions admirably, showing us along the way as much movie virtuosity and fun as we're likely to experience in a good long while. Mr. Tarantino has now proven himself not just the brilliant `enfant terrible' of American filmmaking of the 90's but definitely one to watch out for in the 00's as well.<br/><br/> As the Terrytune clip in the movie says, `The magpie deserves your respect.' The man is a genius magpie, and both `Kill Bills' are the apotheosis of those collecting tendencies and videogeek obsessions of his. He's said `Kill Bill' is `a duck press of all the grindhouse cinema' he's seen in his life. It's predominantly a synthesis of different Asian martial arts sources (shooting was done in both Tokyo and Beijing) and stuff from Westerns ranging from classic John Ford to Sergio Leone -- a quirky compendium that transcends the traditions it feeds on by blending elements of allusion and reference into a language this filmmaker speaks like nobody else. `Kill Bill 2' has something to say, but it never ceases to be a product of allusion and referentiality -- to grindhouse, to itself and to other Tarantino movies.<br/><br/> You don't have to recognize all the allusions, but if you don't even know they're there, you won't see how `Kill Bill' came together and you may miss out on a lot of the fun. You'll complain of `excessive violence' when in fact every fight scene refers to the tradition of the movies and is about moviemaking -- not really, in the final analysis, about people being cruel to people but about loving movies. Both `Kill Bills' are quintessential movie lovers' movies. This means they're movies that are best not so much `served cold' (like revenge) as warmed over - watched over and over and over (the way a movie geek, or a kid, does) till the `what' isn't at issue any more and you just savor the `how.'<br/><br/> `Kill Bill 1 & 2' really ARE `about' something, though. As they don't hesitate to tell us, they're about revenge. That's why they both begin with `The Massacre at Twin Pines.' That's the motive, the time when The Bride AKA Black Mamba AKA Beatrice Kiddo (Uma Thurman) was horribly wronged, got shot by the man and mentor she once loved and had her new life with a man in El Paso ended. And that's why, in the last reel, she hunts down Bill -- and we find out why it all happened and what has to transpire before it's all going to be over. Both `Kill Bills' are dominated by the wronged one, the avenger, Tarantino's muse, Uma Thurman. And the credits in huge letters (credits being as important to Tarantino, the moviegeek, as back-stories) proclaim that the whole story of `The Bride' that's the movies' basis was penned by `Q & U,' Quentin and Uma. Like a lot of brilliant egomaniac movie directors - P.T. Anderson is another example - Tarantino is much more of a collaborator than some people realize and owes huge debts to his homeboys as well as to idols he revives and uses, if he can, in his movies (like Sonny Chiba, Gordon Liu, David Carradine, Daryl Hannah; earlier John Travolta, Pam Grier - the list goes on and on).<br/><br/> The new scenes that stand out in Vol. 2 are the ones where Budd (Michael Madsen) buries Beatrice alive; where she fights with Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah); and the one where she finally confronts Bill in Mexico.<br/><br/> The `how' is so important in Tarantino it can overwhelm the `what.' But the `what' is always there. And the `why' -- the complete back-story, so to speak -- is slowly unreeling, and that's the reason `Kill Bill' ends climactically. It's not till the end that all grievances are clear and all measures have been taken to set things right. Outcome does matter. And story matters. There's more to the geek than just technique.<br/><br/> But `Kill Bill 2' is as much about back-story as foreground action. After you watch it, you realize how back-stories make a movie work. Tarantino creates a world where everything's in order, because everything has an adequate explanation. Back-stories are like legends. They're glorifications of the characters and reasons for their actions - or like the comic book heroes Bill goes on about while Beatrice's truth serum is taking effect at the end of Volume 2. Critic J. Hoberman wrote about Bill: `He proves to be a master of long-winded b******t and the bamboo flute.' Indeed so, but listen to the b******t, because it's all part of Tarantino's personal back-story.<br/><br/> Both `Kill Bills' show us Tarantino isn't just about spectacle and allusion and jokey dialogue. He blends back-story and front-story like a master storyteller, b*********r and weaver of myth to create this intensified pop acid trip tale.<br/><br/> Some of us are gasping for air at the end of the Tokyo nightclub sequence in `Kill Bill 1'-- even as it flows out into the lovely snow-filled garden -- because we've had to go too long without any Tarantino dialogue. That doesn't' happen in `Kill Bill 2.' Even in the middle of a lightning hot battle like the one between Kiddo and Elle Driver in Budd's trailer, the two ladies take the time to stop in their tracks, look at the inscription on a Hattori Hanzo sword, and exchange taunts. Some of Carradine's dialogue may also leave you gasping for air, but the `Kill Bills"" are so well put together you'll want to go back to them again and again - and like them more each time. Because Tarantino is a dish best served warmed over - and over and over."

Also, I felt so much hype around the movie that it inflated my expectations.<br/><br/>When some people read my One Line Summary ""We've seen it all before"" they will think, ""Thats the point, Tarantino is paying homage to films that influenced him.""  However, I don't think recycling old ideas to squeeze a few more bucks out of them is paying homage.  One of the things I anticipated the most when watching Kill Bill Vol 2 is finally finding out The Bride's name.  I thought this was a pretty cool idea, but its really stolen from The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.  If you've seen many martial arts movies, like me, you'll probably be pretty unexcited about the action in both Kill Bill volumes.  It definitely doesn't break any new ground with special effects or new styles of displaying fighting.  *This part of my comments could be considered a minor spoiler so skip to the end of the next paragraph if you want* I loved and hated Pai Mei at the same time.  I loved his laugh and how he played with his beard, but personally, I find the stereotype of the ancient and insanely strict kung fu master pretty tired. I can't count the number of movies I've seen where someone goes to be trained by a kung fu master.  The master is ALWAYS barking orders to the pupil and ALWAYS uses some weird training techniques (wax on - wax off, catch the chicken, etc).<br/><br/>Personally, I felt the best thing about Kill Bill was its style, and I felt that most of its style came from the music.  The Kill Bill soundtrack is definitely something I'd look into getting."

","Now, I really love Tarantino, and I particularly liked Kill Bill Vol 1. Maybe not his best, but still: The 60's inspired, extremely styled format, the utterly cool kung fu/manga/splatter mix, pretty cool dialogue (not in the league of Pulp Fiction, but still), all presented in a quick fashion with hardly any dull moments.<br/><br/>But, no matter how much I liked Tarantino and Vol 1, I must say that Vol 2 hardly has any of those qualities. Lots of uninspired dialogue, slow story-telling, a lot less fighting scenes and those who are there are pretty lame.<br/><br/>In addition, the violence in Vol 2 is no longer of the distanced, choreographed kind (except for a few scenes with Pai Mei), but of a closer, agonizing, if not to say disgusting kind. B being buried alive, plucking the eye(s) out of Elle, dying in agony of poisonous snake bites, and so forth.<br/><br/>
Also, the fighting scene at the end between Bill and B is a disappointment. A few seconds fighting after endless minutes of uninspired talking, where the 30 years older lover Bill is talking sooo slooowly and dropping the word ""kiddo"" to his former lover a number of times too much. Adding to that, the redundant end scene where BB is watching cartoons.<br/><br/>All in all, I feel that Tarantino rushed this one out the door to fast.

","Kill Bill Vol1 was a very very good movie. It was violent, but violence with a purpose of redemption. It was an action thriller with the rare topic of a plot. I also liked how the director mixed Japanese-style Animation with live-action. This created a unique way to tell the story. That was certainly part of the charm and mystique of the original movie.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol II was tried to be made into a drama, straying away from the original piece. I just never bought into that much. The acting was not that great as well. Just a little too 'Hollywood'.<br/><br/>The ending buildup, which of course should have been loaded with action, was kind of a let down, in my opinion."

","Kill Bill Volume 2 shows the continuation of the Bride's (Uma Thurman) quest to kill Bill (David Carradine) as well as the rest of his deadly viper assasination squad: Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah).  The movie has great cinematic style as it harkens back to the '70's Kung fu flicks as well as many of the elements prevalent in the spaghetti westerns.  Tarantino seems to draw the best out of the actors that he directs witness the return of David Carradine.  He also has a unique storytelling style that never seems to lose steam or viewer interest.  The fight choreograhpy while not as prevalent as Volume 1 is still masterful and a wonder to watch.  The music, which was done by the RZA of the Wu Tang Clan, is awesome and helps to create the kung fu atmosphere."

","Kill Bill Volume One explores the journey of The Bride (Uma Thurman) as she attempts to avenge the massacre of her wedding which left her with a gun shot wound in the head resulting in a coma, and evidently killed her unborn child.<br/><br/>Volume two compliments the first by incorporating the familiar aspects of Clint Eastwood style westerns and classic Asian Kung Foo movies, as well as introducing a more cultivated atmosphere that is a welcome, though not necceserly 'better', change to Volume I through clever dialogue and more impressionable action scenes.<br/><br/>Tarantino uses clever filming techniques that really bring the audience in to the picture, the 'grave break', a scene in which the Bride is buried alive in a coffin, really stands out as a scene that transferes the claustrophobic sensation from the screen to the cinema, and the audience. A fantastic soundtrack ties in perfectly with this fantastic sequel.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Volume II does what it intends to do and does it well, the end a fitting finale for this fantastic duo, a tribute to classy director, Quentin Tarantino."

","WOW , This movie is incredable. As Kill Bill Vol 1 was all out action and simplistic dialogue so Kill Bill Vol 2 was a journey into the personas of all the main characters. i cant believe people are saying that they liked the first film but hated the second . the 2 films are QT,s double edged 'sword' his yin and yang of his Film Life. Vol 1 is his male/ yang side ,all testosterone and bang ! bang ! explosive side . Vol 2 is his female/ yin side , delving more deeply into the reasons and emotions of why The Bride is hell bent on seeking to ""Kill Bill !"". All the performances are great but Uma and david are absolutely outstanding Plus Michael Parks who i hardly recognized asa 70 year old mexican. The music is the soul of both films and demonstrates thats QT is the master of the record collection ! My fav scene is  probably when The Bride remembers her teachings of Pai Mei ,this scene got the hairs to stand up on the back of my kneck ! but there are too many to mention and i recommend you find out the gems for yourself.

","Tarantino has truly outdone himself with the second installment of Kill Bill!!  This movie and its predecessor transcend the normal parameters of, ""sequelness,"" and usher an innovative and sheik perspective on film making. The first film was a true, first-rate action movie, driven by frustration, anger, and of course: VENGENCE!  The second was truly a great movie, that wasn't so driven by revenge as it was a critique on motherhood and dysfunctional relationships.  In any case both of these movies compliment each other to no end.  Kill Bill Vol. 2 especially sits close to my heart alongside Vol. I as truly one of my favorite movies!!

","In many ways this is a cheeky piece of style over substance. But if you can swallow that pill then it's also a masterpiece. And if you've seen the first ""volume"" then you shouldn't really expect anything else. The opening black and white church scene is shot in such outrageous contrast you'd be forgiven for thinking the projection room had caught fire. The leap back into colour features what could be the most technicolour mud in north america.<br/><br/>Unabashed cliches of dialogue and character will have film nerds giggling like schoolgirls (well that's my excuse). One particular line will have me shaking my head in disbelief for weeks to come. And possibly the cheekiest trick of all: warming up the slasher fetishists with the samurai orgy in volume 1 and then restricting volume 2 to a stifled brawl in a trailer. It's the chop-socky equivalent of showing fourteen year old boys a ten minute blowjob with no money shot. Genius.<br/><br/>It's worth saying too that the characters in this film are almost without exception well-written and well-acted. I've seen several reviewers fuming ""fight don't talk"". Bollocks to that: ""talk don't fight"". You want more fighting go and rent Iron Monkey."

","After being a huge fan on Kill Bill: Volume One, I was not particularly expecting to be impressed by Volume Two - mainly due to the much rumoured genre change.  Upon viewing the movie, however, my doubts were all set aside easily.<br/><br/>Volume Two builds up the characters a lot more, and we begin to understand the motivations each character has much more. We are also introduced to several new characters - my personal favourite of which has got to be The Bride's martial arts master ""Pai Mei"", who provides much comedy with the numerous times he laughs and strokes his beard. The music is of course a huge asset to this movie - utilising pre-existing spaghetti-western soundtrack pieces with great effect.<br/><br/>This movie was well worth the wait.  Ten out of Ten."

Vol. 2, tells us a story, comedy/philosophy/drama type. I like vol. 1 more than vol. 2, coz I appreciated the director style of vol. 1, thinking it differentiate the director from other thriller/action directors. But the vol. 2, I guess, maybe consider too much about the common psychology and needs. It can make you laugh and chuckle all through the whole movie, it has much dialogue, but it neglects the expectation most audience would have been waiting for since vol. 1.

Uma Thurman looks like enjoying her role and Darryl Hannah is equally good as her opponent. The dialog between Bill and the Bride at the end of the film is very clever and I believe that has a lot of suspense, explaining at the same time, everything about their previous relationship and the reasons of their violent behavior.

","CONTAINS ONLY MINOR SPOILERS<br/><br/>TARANTINO's revenge saga may have sounded like a one-note concept on paper - a bride/assassin gets gunned down on her wedding day and sets out to murder those responsible - but boy has he proven us wrong. Dead wrong. Splitting Kill Bill into two parts appeared to be a cop-out for such a long-winded director, too lazy to fiddle with the editing knobs for too long, but instead it was a masterstroke that you cannot help but wonder might have been up his sleeve from the start. Vol. 1, as everyone now knows, was the verbose one's love-letter to Japanese cinema. The elegant simplicity, a tidy list of deserving victims, physics-defying martial arts and clipped, referential dialogue, Tarantino took all his days as a video store clerk watching 70s Kung Fu flicks and created his own blood-soaked homage - while splicing in his own iconography (the yellow tracksuit for one). True, it was a gory, genre bouncing visual treat that matched the audience's expectations but still it often felt like just an overblown exercise in cinematic excess. Where were the plot, the characterisation and Tarantino's trademark verbalisms? What, ultimately, was the point? He promised Vol. 2 would not be more of the same and, while the critics already had their Hattori Hanzo swords at the ready for a bloody backlash, he really wasn't lying. The Bride (Uma Thurman), after polishing off her first two victims, now has just three left on her 'Death List'. The washed-up psycho Budd (Michael Madsen), the downright evil, one-eyed Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and some guy named Bill (David Carradine). But if you were expecting another semi-linear samurai sword clashing spectacle, then think again because Vol. 2 is a whole different kettle of fighting fish. The first hour contains almost no violence at all but instead relies on Tarantino's oft-imitated verbal sparring, in style more like the more mature Jackie Brown than the masculine tirade of Reservoir Dogs.<br/><br/>The characters trade words not blows and only resort to fisticuffs when they can apparently talk no more. Even the sadistic/masochistic (see Bill's oblique explanation in the intro) church massacre is shown off screen. However, this is not to say Kill Bill has become a Linklater-esque talkie. We still have The Bride being buried alive, some truly tortuous martial arts training (Gordon Liu as our heroine's perpetually beard-stroking mentor Pai Mei is brutally hilarious) and Bill himself floating around the scenes like a malevolent ghost. The visceral catfight between The Bride and Elle Driver provides the only real action in the movie and, while intricate in its detail, never matches the climactic conflict with the Crazy 88 in Vol 1. Instead the 'sequel' focuses more on the intricate relationship between Bill and his protégé/lover, leading on from the twist that her baby is still alive. We learn that The Bride scorned our villain's affections and the carnage at the church was his form of revenge - an act he admits was an ""overreaction"". Like all great romantic tragedies, the strategic use of violence symbolises the cruelty of emotions and begs the question: 'Does a broken heart deserve a broken leg?' The scene where The Bride storms into face her final opponent is so disarming in its exposition, only someone whose read the early draft of the script on the net will fail to be flummoxed. Of course, such a humanistic film relies on captivating performances and in Carradine (he was once on TV in the 70s don't you know) and Thurman, Tarantino has picked the perfect (anti) couple. Bill is at turns charismatic, funny, self-depreciating, warm and unrelentingly violent, while Thurman walks a fine line between emotional mother and ruthless killer. Both actors truly inhabit their roles and even the lame truth serum scene, where Bill bangs on about superheroes in sub-Kevin Smith style, is glossed over by the duo's enigmatic screen presence. The director may leap relentlessly between genres - grindcore martial arts, spaghetti western, black comedy and theatrical drama to name only a few -, but his over-confidence and egotism help the film feel almost seamless. Vol. 2 is self-indulgent slightly overlong, some judicious cutting at the end could have been a blessing, but it is still a unique piece of cinema that will confound the expectations of everyone who sees it. To put it bluntly, Tarantino still kicks ass, even when he puts his stars' weapons away.<br/><br/>Four stars"

There is the great fight with Elle which tore the house down. Literally. We also finally get to see Budd played by Michael Madsen. His scenes were some of the best in both movies. And then there is quite possibly one of the scariest and most exciting scenes ever involving the Bride being buried alive. Having a fear of suffocation myself, this scene was extra effective.<br/><br/>The acting was excellent all around. Uma Thurman proves she is not only hot and deadly, but that she is also one of the best actresses today. She is especially good toward the end. Micheal Madsen is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. He always gives a great performance. Darryl Hannah is superb as the sole female assassin in Vol.2, and David Carradine is great as Bill himself. It's just too bad we don't get to see some more of his fight skills. Still, Vol.2 is a great second half to an instant classic. 7/10"

","Kill Bill Volume 1 blew me away. It had such an impact on me that I saw it twice within 12 hours when it first came out. I had to see it twice to believe it. The music, costumes, visuals, anime, and bloodletting were too much for me; I instantly fell in love. I didn't think that it was possible to fall in love with a movie, but Tarantino proved me wrong.<br/><br/>
I very anxiously awaited the release of Volume 2. I had never been so excited about the release of a movie in all of my life. Then it happened, April 16th 2004; Kill Bill Volume 2 was opened to the public. Opening night I went to see it with such hope of a continuation of the first half, an adrenaline rush of hip music and intense action. Then the movie started. The first hour or so I sat in the theater waiting for a repeat of Volume 1. It never came, and I was o so disappointed. I left the theater in utter disbelief wondering how the film, or half film, of my lifetime (Volume 1) could possibly be concluded (Volume 2) in such a way as to disappoint me. It wasn't until the next morning, after a night of mental processing, that I realized Volume 2 was PERFECT. Volume 2 was everything that Volume 1 wasn't; an ideal compliment. I had to see it again. Upon second viewing, my post-movie-going euphoria rivaled that of Volume 1. (For those of you who disliked this film after seeing it one time, I strongly recommend a second run through)<br/><br/>Tarantino knew exactly what he was doing with this project. He hooked audiences with the delicious sinful superficial pleasures of Volume 1, then smothered the same audiences in the rich textural storyline of Volume 2. Like a parent-child relationship, he knew what I needed, and gave it to me against my ignorant wishes. It was only upon the subsequent epiphany of maturity that I realized that he had my best interest in mind. God bless you Quentin!<br/><br/>In Volume 1, the characters and the fates that they suffered affected me very little (this includes The Bride). The film left little room for emotional attachments, as viewers were filled with adrenaline and utter disbelief from the visual gluttony that they had just experienced. Tarantino knew this, purposely squeezing out every morsel of storyline and character development in order to please the audience's lusty desires. Yet in Volume 2, my empathy for every character was overflowing, as once again Tarantino had fulfilled his goal of over stimulation, only this time in the opposite direction.<br/><br/>Tarantino took a great risk in creating this project and releasing it to the world. To make such a film work takes an ultimate amount of skill and passion. Luckily for us all Tarantino has both. Now that all is said and done and the entire world of Kill Bill has been revealed to us, there is nothing left to do but marvel in the brilliance of it all. We have to put it all away and move on with the memory of it in the back of our minds. But we will always remember that this is what cinema is all about. We will never forget Kill Bill."

Even though people get sliced, cut and decapitated the katana massacre was't exaggerated nor gross.<br/><br/>I believe I represent a typical QT fan and from this point of view KB2 was a disappointment. Not a big one but still. First of all the flick is way too long. There are couple of scenes which have very little/none to do with the plot and they are somewhat loose from the rest of the movie. If QT hadn't cut the story in half, these scenes probably would have not been included.<br/><br/>Secondly the dialogue is surprisingly dull. This issue was also somewhat included in vol 1 but it wasn't that noteworthy 'cause the movie had lots of action and little speech. This movie is the opposite. It wouldn't bother me if the dialogue was good but this time it's incredibly far from the level which we have been used to in QT movies. Mostly it's just merely meaningless chit chat.<br/><br/>But the movie isn't actually that bad. The cast is good and acting is quite excellent. David Carradine steals every scene he appears in. Daryl Hannah is also good (losing the only working eye and getting blinded in a trailer in the middle of a desert, that's just sad.

","Okay... just want to clarify this because everyone says it's a homage to kung-fu movies (which is true with the part of Thurman's training flash-back) but the movie is ultimately a homage to old westerns.<br/><br/>Westerns typically have one main guy, set out on revenge against one other guy.  The Bride sets out to kill Bill, because he killed her life in the chaple.<br/><br/>This half of the story is VERY western... the drama, quick fights with the heartless killers, and a showdown ending that is subtle and ""slower"".<br/><br/>
Now that im done explaining that, I'll say I thought it was OK but I didn't love it.

","There's something about violence, where if it's cartoony, then it's just fun to see stuff blow up. Like most action films. But if it's overly realistic, such as Black Hawn Down, a war film, then it's like being in a war. That's just horrifying. Nobody thinks a war experience is a fun thing to see at the movies.<br/><br/>Except for Quentin Tarantino fans, who have something of the sick humor about them. Pulp Fiction has a lot of real pain mixed in with happy music and likable sadists. I sort of liked Reservoir Dogs but the endless blood was too much for me. The pain is realistic, not cartoony.<br/><br/>I'm turned off by that, so I skipped Kill Bill Volume One and I almost didn't see Volume Two. But I went and fortunately the violence was cartoony and generally fine. On a par with Training Day. Not as bad as RoboCop. So having gotten past that, yes, the film was interesting, arty and very creative, often funny, with several neat twists.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- Action film junkies, but not young teens<br/><br/>-- Anyone who's been curious like me but worried about violence, you'll be fine<br/><br/>I'll give Kill Bill: Vol. 2 an 8 out of 10."
"MF210","10","0","1","23 April 2004"," A Very Difficult Film to Review
","My Review: ***1/2 out of ****.<br/><br/>Spoilers<br/><br/>When I wrote my review for Kill Bill Volume 1, I said I would raise the rating to a 3 1/2 if Volume 2 completed the story in a satisfying way. Well it did it in a much more than satisfying way. Volume 2 is a compelling film with many scenes of greatness. So many that in fact they almost erase the small sense of dissatisfaction(more on that later).<br/><br/>Volume 2 is a different film from Volume 1. Volume 1 was a kinetic, stylish, kung fu gorefest homage. Volume 2 is a slower, talky film that has more in common with spaghetti westerns than kung fu. Its still a stylish film but the action and the violence are toned down.<br/><br/>In terms of action, it was unlikely that anything in Volume 2 would top the Crazy 88 Gang Fight in Volume 1. However, the fight between The Bride (or her name is Beatrix Kiddo) and Elle Driver comes close to matching it. Its a brutal, exhilirating fight that is masterfully directed and ends with a hilarious moment. This is just one of many great scenes.<br/><br/>
Stylistically, Tarantino does a lot with this film (arguably more than he did with Volume 1). He uses a split screen during the Elle Driver fight. He changes the theatrical ratio during one scene(Im not sure I have ever seen that done before). Tarantino also does a bunch of extreme close ups (ala Sergio Leone). Once again, he shoots some scenes in Black and White (Including the opening which is brilliant). However, there is one scene that really deserves mention. That is the scene in which the Bride is first placed in the coffin and buried alive. When shes being buried alive Tarantino uses black and white which makes the scene extremely uncomfortable (as it should be). Than he switches to just total darkness. The scene is brilliantly filmed and it is just another great scene in Volume 2.<br/><br/>
Now we come to Volume 2's most obvious strength: The Performances. Uma Thurman was terrific in Volume 1 (she deserved but did not get an Oscar Nomination). But its her performance in Volume 2 that proves she is one of the best actresses working today. The character is developed much more in Volume 2 and Thurman proves she is more than up to the task. Its a more emotional performances and Thurman nails it. She better get an Oscar Nomination this year.<br/><br/>Thurman isn't the only one to turn in a top notch performance. David Carradine matches her scene for scene (although he does have less screentime). Carradine also develops Bill into a more complex individual. Bill isn't an evil, over the top individual. Carradine shows us the human side of Bill. Tarantino originally had Warren Beatty in mind for the role, but I can't imagine anyone doing a better job than Carradine.<br/><br/>
The supporting performances are also top notch. Remember Daryl Hannah? The sweet, shy actress who played innocent characters like the mermaid in Splash. Well theres none of that here. Hannah is frighteningly evil as Elle Driver. Michael Madsen also does an excellent job as Budd. Gordon Liu is a standout in an interesting segment of the film, he plays the person who trained Beatrix.<br/><br/>I will not deny that Volume 2 strengthens Volume 1. It fills in the holes. However, Volume 2 has some weaknesses of its own. First of all, like I mentioned, this is a talky film. But no one in their right mind will confuse the dialogue in Volume 2 with Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. The dialogue in Volume 2 is occassionally bland which causes some scenes to drag. I wish Tarantino would have shortened the film just a little. I mean there are some memorable lines (""Roar and Rampage"" monologue for example) but just don't expect Pulp Fiction-type dialogue.<br/><br/>Put separately, I would say for right now, the two films are equal. They are both compelling films with many great scenes but there is still a small sense of dissatisfaction. If Tarantino puts the two films together and possibly cut a few scenes from both than he could have a masterpiece on his hands, just like he did with Pulp Fiction. For now, I stronlgy recommend Volume 1 and Volume 2 but I would just love to see them together."

The dialogue is back... okay it's not as great  as classic lines like 'you know what they call a quarter pounder with cheese in  france' and 'are you gonna bark all day little doggy, or are you gonna bite?' but  still there a streams of dialogue that inspire a good chuckle. All the characters in  the film are good and they each have their moments of dialogue spotlight.  The  films conclusion is satisfying so go on see the final volume of the roaring rampage of revenge."

My prediction is that fans of QT films will enjoy vol.2 the most, but for the average cinema viewer they will feel as though there are not enough action sequences. Me as a huge fan of QT and Kill Bill vol.1 was disappointed in the lack of 'that something special' which defines his other films, however throughout the film I was steadily entertained. My favourite part of the film was the wedding scene at the start and fight with Elle (Daryl Hannah). My worst parts Bill's death  and Budd and Bill being brothers seemed pointless. Great ideas: when we find out her name and a clip shows her in class. Referring to the movie adverts at the start. Score 7/10"

","I don't know whether or not I liked this film. While watching, I enjoyed it and was interested to find out what happened next. Yet, after leaving the theater, I was left feeling that maybe there should have been something more. Or maybe something less.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman's performance is something I can say that I liked both while watching and afterward. She has more character development in this film than in the first and she wastes no time sinking her teeth deep into the part. She is one tough chick and at the same time she is still human, which is something the film needs. She grounds the movie while everything else spins along side. <br/><br/>Maybe the best word for my reaction is that this movie felt creepy. Tarantino's obsession with Thurman is made very obvious, especially in the last chapter. She responds with the reaction of a young girl when her father tells her how pretty she is; one of those comments that you know means something else. I say this is some of Uma's best acting right here in this scene.<br/><br/>Without all the gore of the first film, this one does some background exploring of the characters and it makes a very good follow up to the first. Despite my weird feelings, this film is still one that I recommend. ***/****"

I think this just let you know that while the Black Mamba is a great fighter, she also isnt invincible.  I've talked to many people and if you liked Pulp Fiction, then Kill Bill is for you.

"rogerdarlington","Null","0","1","25 April 2004"," A cracking double bill
","Apparently wunderkid Quentin Tarantino, writer and director of ""Kill Bill"", conceived it as a single work, but Harvey Weinstein of Miramax, suggested that it be cut in two. Looking at the double bill (sorry!) now, it's hard not to believe that it was always intended to be a two-parter, because the tone of the two parts is so different. If this doesn't sound too perverse for a Tarantino work, Volume 2 is a gentler movie - slower paced, much more character-driven and, in spite of some ugly violence, with a much, much lower body count.<br/><br/>In my review of Volume 1, I concluded: ""I don't think that the other squad members (including former lover Bill) will have much of a chance in Volume 2. But I want to see how they meet their well-deserved end and hopefully in the process discover where the bride learned her martial arts, what exactly was her relationship with Bill, and why was her wedding day the subject of such savagery."" In this sense, the second part is satisfying: all the questions are answered, all the issues resolved, and all of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad are well and truly eliminated. <br/><br/>Whereas Bill hardly featured in  the initial half, he is central to the latter segment and David Carradine - whom I remember from the television series ""Kung Fu"" - gives a compelling performance in which he has the best lines, notably his apologia for the massacre. Again, though, it is Uma Thurman - as The Bride, Black Mamba, Beatrix Kiddo, and Mommy - who is brilliantly cast in a role which has already become iconic. Her rise from the 'dead' has echoes of Hammer horror ""The Fall Of The House Of Usher"", while her eye-catching battle sequence with Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) in the constricted confines of a trailer reminds one of the train fight in ""From Russia With Love"". <br/><br/>If I came out the cinema with a slight sense of disappointment, it was because Bill is dispatched just too quickly, creating a slight sense of anti-climax. The smooth-talking brute deserved to suffer much more..."

I would recommend this but I would also warn that it is not as fast paced as the first.

","""Kill Bill, Vol.2"" is another masterpiece by Quentin Tarantino.  His artistic application of brutal violence is mellowed by the ballet like choreography.  There are few directors who can get away with this extreme violence, and yet attract the interest of the broad public.  His cinematography is unsurpassed by most such film genre.  Uma Thurman gives a stellar performance as Beatrix once again.  Darryl Hannah as Elle is a very strong character, and she is the antithesis of what one would expect.  David Carradine portrays an intense Bill, the Snake, and it is refreshing to see him in this difficult role.  It is not a film for the weak at heart or the squeemish, however, it fulfills the complete cycle of the ""Kill Bill"" story is a satisfying manner.  It is a must see for the film buff.  It must be seen on the big screen to appreciate the color and the breathtaking desert views."

","It seems that a lot of people on imdb consider Tarantino to be the greatest director of all time. As such, I'm sure that this film will shoot into many peoples top 10's along with Vol 1, Dogs and Fiction. I myself find his work increasingly indulgent although Vol 2 suffers slightly less from this than Vol 1.<br/><br/>Overall Vol 2 is better than Vol 1, which isn't really surprising since Vol 1 didn't really have a conclusion. I think if the two films were edited down to a single feature running about 135 minutes we could have a real classic film. This is the 'Special Edition' I would like to see released.<br/><br/>Anyway Vol 2 has a few of the trademark Tarantino dialogues and David Carradine steels the acting honours. Uma Thurman also puts in a good performance in the lead. Although it does drag slightly at times there's always a good scene that arrives just in time to save the day. 7/10."
"oneflewovertheapocalypse","Null","0","1","24 April 2004"," Very Good but Flawed towards the end
","Possible Spoilers!<br/><br/>I came out of the cinema buzzing like a bumble bee after viewing Volume one. I hated the idea of waiting for Volume Two but if I could do it with Lord of the Rings then I was sure I could handle the wait for Volume Two. <br/><br/>
The wait has finished and what do we now think of this second volume of Tarantino's Sword Wielding Revenge Fest.   To be honest Volume 2 was not as good as it could have been.  Volume One had this ecstasy of excitement that wouldn't stop where in Volume Two you get a more chilled out look back to why and how it all started.   The opening scene at the massacre of Two Pines was stunning as far as filmmaking goes.  It was nice and easy and then bang the massacre comes in such an artistic classy way I had change my pants. There the film starts straight off where the last one ends with the story of how Bud and The Bride meet and to me this was the best chapter in the whole film.   Michael Madsen is a bad ass as Bud and the coolest character of both Volumes just like Mr Blonde in Reservoir Dogs but not as menacing and sick. Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver was the mega bitch and David Carradine as Bill is just amazing and is the real star instead of Uma Thurman who is still great, but the slick and cool presence of Bill and the sound of his voice was to good.  It's just to hard to fault him and to hate him as a character. Throughout Volume 1 we are given this indication that Bill is someone who must not be trifled with and is the most vile and sadistic person one can meet, but we see a more nurture and respectful side to him than the one we are lead to believe is really him and it works well.   Of course that is what Bill is but we don't see hardly any nasty side to him.  At the end of the day Bill is someone who is trained in the art of Kung Fu with a crazy and vengeful side to his personality but is still a human being with feelings and emotions and that's what we see in Volume Two.  Not so much in your face kind of thing but characters like Elle and Bud talk of how nobody but The Bride has made Bill feel the way he does so it was nice to see a more human side to him rather than the ruthless one.<br/><br/>The music was just as fantastic as the first one with For A Few Dollars More numbers popping up in occasions which was nice to see but not very fresh as far as originality goes.  Set pieces were ok but nothing special, if anything the desert where Bud lives in his caravan is epic enough to last the entire film as it is so secluded and relaxed.  It feels more like a western in those parts which in a lot of the film is desperately trying to be along with other films but that's what Kill Bill is all about and this is what Tarantino is here to celebrate.  He has come up with his own story and to coincide with that he has borrowed, more than stolen some classic character plots and music but in a way which works really well and is brilliant in every way.  What Lacked in Volume One is definitely made up in Volume Two when it came to the characters.  Tarantino gave them the chance to shine and shine they did as the development of them all was absolutely brilliant.   <br/><br/>As much as I wanted to love the whole film I just couldn't.  The last 20 minutes were what spoiled it for me.  Everything before then was outstanding apart from one or two scenes which could have been easily avoided like when she goes to Mexico to see Bill's guardian where The Bride turns up and asks if he can tell her where Bill is now living is a scene that died the moment it started.  There are a couple of other ones but I don't want to give to much away but Tarantino obviously saw the chance to add more scenes to the film as it was spilt into two which doesn't seem such a good idea now.<br/><br/>Tarantino's Masterpiece is Reservoir Dogs and Pulp fiction but they didn't blow me away, they were very good to watch and entertaining so Tarantino's masterpiece is really Kill Bill Volume One which is excellent and Volume Two is very good but nothing to what we expected but overall as a whole a masterpiece.   It has good closure but it didn't satisfy me the way I hoped it would.   If somebody asked me what I thought of Kill Bill as one film then I would say `The first three quarters of the entire 4 hour plus epic was outstanding but it had a weak ending'.  It was still a pleasure to watch Kill Bill and it's an experience I will never forget and I hope it will be remembered in decades to come which it will.   It is definitely the best revenge movie I have ever seen and I will look back on the movie to get ideas but the ending could have been so much more and I think we were given a little less than we and the film deserved."

Its biggest strength is that the movie knows what it is doing. You are meant to take the movie seriously in a different way - not as in caring deeply about the characters and whether certain things happen to them or not - but how cool the movie really is. Quentin Tarantino has brought together an immense array of talent and has stacked them exactly the way he wants them stacked. That then is his genius, to know what exactly what you want to do and to do a damn good job of that.

","***Minor Spoilers***<br/><br/>I was absolutely floored by this movie.  When I wrote about Kill Bill Vol. 1, I wrote a lot about the themes (maternal, feminist, violence as catharsis, etc.), and neglected to also point out the sheer FUN of the movie.  That movie was the<br/><br/>most enjoyable experience I've had in a theater in years.  Now that I've seen Kill Bill Vol. 2, I have to say that the bar for both levels of enjoyment have been raised.  Vol. 2 takes the motifs of the first movie and complicates them, making what was black and white in the first volume shades of gray.  We see villains with humanity, and we see the Bride grow to realize the weight of what she is doing.  Philosophically,  her journey becomes more and more complex as she<br/><br/>nears its completion.  Where in the first movie, she could make the statement about revenge ""It seems irrefutable proof that not only does God exist, but you're doing his will,""  in the second that moral certainty is no longer so simple. The film ends with Bill's revelation--in two beautiful monologues--that she is no better than the ones she kills; She is a killer, and will never be able to hide from that.  She knows that she will have to suffer as much as the ones she kills, and that her actions may have incalculable consequences.  And she still does it, so committed is she to her goal.  All of that said, the movie is just plain fun to watch. Tarantino puts music, dialogue and images together to create such a cool effect that it is almost impossible to sit through the film without a great big goofy grin on your face.  The acting is phenomenal, the writing amazing, the<br/><br/>cinematography (and old movie allusions) breathtaking. 10/10."

",":Spoilers: :Spoilers: :Spoilers:<br/><br/>The only thing disappointing about this film is the weak-tea reviews being dished out by some critics. Critics who should know better. There's an unhealthy air of 'Kill-The-King' Syndrome doing the rounds.<br/><br/>Let's not beat about the bush, this film is a MASTERPIECE, and is infinately better than Vol.1. All the kick-and-rush of Vol.1 is replaced here with pacing, depth and texture. This is a homage, not just to Spaghetti Westerns in general, but to the ultimate Spaghetti; Leone's ""Once Upon A Time In The West"". The opening scene with Bill and Beatrix outside the Two Pines Chapel is played out against almost total silence, pretty much like the opening of Leone's marvel. Beatrix then makes a long, slow methodical process of elimination as she wipes out those who surround Bill, almost in identical fashion to Charles Bronson's 'Harmonica' as he edges closer and closer to Henry Fonda's reptilian villain, 'Frank'. The final confrontation between Beatrix and Bill is also similar to the meeting of Harmonica and Frank; it is long and never rushed(there's almost 50 minutes between Beatrix bursting through the door, and the eventual outcome). Just as Harmonica and Frank's confrontation is dealt with in mutual respect, dignity and understanding, so Bill and Beatrix's final meeting is touching and emotional as both still love each other, but must ultimately kill each other. Bill's death is dignified and romantic, a master-stroke from Tarantino.<br/><br/>The film is heavilly littered, or should that be bejeweled with references to the great Spaghetti Westerns; the backwards tracking shot out of the Chapel as the Deadly Vipers move in is pure Leone; the mariachi trumpet score from 'A Fistful Of Dollars' and the whistling motif from Sergio Corbucci's 'Il Mercenario'; and the whole chapter of Budd and his reformed 'gun-slinger' taking on a lousy job but being dragged into one last job for a suitcase full of cash, these are all classic Italian Western traits. Just as Vol.1 was his Eastern, so Tarantino now gives us his Western.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is astonishing. David Carradine is an utter revelation, and his lengthy monologues are a joy to listen to. Uma Thurman again delivers, and kudos to Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen for putting in the performances of their career.<br/><br/>The 'buried-alive' sequence comes as blessed relief to someone like me who was haunted by the denouement of George Sluizer's 'Spoorloos', and remains surely the most atmospheric and realistic burial scene in movie history.<br/><br/>Only two loose-ends bother me; What happened to Sofie Fatale? And if Bill felt Beatrix could never lose her Assasin mantle and live a normal life, how come he allowed Vernita to do just that? She married, had a child and settled into the family-routine. Hmmmm......<br/><br/>That aside, this is a work of genius, PURE GENIUS. 10/10."

This film,like the amazing Vol 1,is Tarantino playfully presenting everything he loves: cinema and pop culture, great music and great acting, badass characters sayin' badass words,etc. And unlike the action orgy that is volume 1, this one gives the characters a couple of minutes to breathe, B.S with each other, and philosophize. Volume 2 has a different vibe; this one is a compliment the first film's wild non-stop frenzy. Tarantino displays the surest of hands; making the audience laugh, scream, jump, even feel for these gleefully nasty characters. His answers-before-questions structure is still there,and it works very well. He's turned a simple revenge plot into an astonishing saga. Tarantino is 5 for 5(excluding the tragic FOUR ROOMS).

You were here for the eye candy, blood spraying/action scenes that you got from the first volume, or possibly just an over zealous film buff that expects every film they see by Tarantino to be nothing short of amazing with unsurmountable originality.<br/><br/>I found this film funny, sad, shocking, thrilling, and exciting all throughout the movie whereas I didn't quite get all those emotions in the first.

"movieguy1021","6","0","1","23 April 2004"," Kill Bill: Volume Two: 6/10
","Most people waited six years from Jackie Brown to see Kill Bill: Volume One, the next eagerly awaited movie by Quentin Tarantino. I did not have to, since I had seen none of his previous works. I did, however, see Volume One, and loved it, making this six month wait for Volume Two almost unbearable. The two films, originally to be fused together as an epic, could not be any more different. While Volume One was relentlessly and gleefully violent, without much in the way of plot or characters, a truly entertaining movie. Volume Two, however, was a complete 180: it's mainly a talking heads movie, with a few (generally) non-violent fights, an over development of characters and plot, and a style that Tarantino seems to be stealing from his own classic movie.<br/><br/>The Bride (Uma Thurman), a deadly assassin, after having been put into a coma in a wedding chapel by her employer Bill (David Carradine), awakens four years later and swears to kill all involved in that massacre. By the opening of Volume Two, she had already gotten two of them. Next on her list is Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), Budd (Michael Madsen), and, of course, Bill.<br/><br/>I would have loved to see one four-hour long version of Kill Bill. The series just doesn't work as two parts. They're completely different; if they were one, then, being fused together, it would work perfectly. The first half wouldn't be this extremely entertaining part and then suddenly switching over to drama. Basically, though, that's what the movies are if placed side-by-side. There's not even much material to link the two. Events mentioned in Volume One are shown, but the only repeated scene was the opening scene in the first one, one that wasn't needed to be repeated. Why not show some of the fight between The Bride and O-Ren Iishi (Lucy Liu), or, when The Bride's daughter comes into play, a flashback for when she killed Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) in front of the latter's daughter? They seem like two completely different movies (when they're supposed to be one complete movie separated into two parts).<br/><br/>But enough comparisons between the two. Let me go into the specifics of Volume Two. Almost everybody, if not everybody, loves Pulp Fiction, understandably. It's Tarantino's masterpiece. The trouble is, we've come to expect Pulp Fiction from everything he does. Now, Volume One was no Pulp Fiction, but it was just as entertaining, if not more so. I was at least hoping as much for Volume Two. Tarantino has become so cocky in his directing that he believes that any well-written dialogue is entertaining dialogue. This movie's dialogue is well-written, but has nothing to do with the plot and isn't entertaining. It's not funny, nor amusing. In Tarantino's script, we get backstory on people who don't need backstory, which always annoys me. I must admit, however, that the eyeball thing is one of the funniest things I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The fight scenes (though few and far between) were amazing. The obvious training that everyone went through must have been quite rigorous. That was always fun to watch and always entertaining. I must also comment on the cinematography. Oftentimes I found myself wondering how they managed to do that. It amazed me in Volume One, also. Its sweeping views, long shots, close-ups, etc. were simply spectacular. Something not so spectacular, however, was Tarantino's ""stylish"" choices. A few scenes were shot in black-and-white for no reason, others in partial color for no reason, and others in 1.33:1 aspect ration (the size of your TV screen) for no reason. Why? Because he can, I suppose. The black-and-white sequences meant something in Volume One-the difference between an R and an NC-17. But they were completely worthless here.<br/><br/>Volume Two is an entertaining movie for the most part. Some of the dialogue became repetitive and was unnecessary, but for the most part it was a fun watch. Thurman is great, as usual, and was even better here than in the first. Carradine had more to do, but I found him rather flat. Hannah, as Driver, was very good, because her character was more interesting than Madsen's Budd. Madsen, to me, will always be Mr. Blonde, the best part of Reservoir Dogs, to me. I must say, I am disappointed by how this chapter of the killing of Bill is as a whole, but in fifteen years or so, we can look forward to a Volume Three. I'll be first in line there.<br/><br/>My rating: 6/10<br/><br/>Rated R for violence, language and brief drug use."

","That's right- a QT movie with less violence in it than the last one. Some sections of the UK media have attacked the morality in the film, but that a/morality becomes much more complex when Uma Thurman's character finally meets Bill again (the name of the film is Kill Bill, that wasn't a spoiler)- that's when the sole motivation of bloody revenge suddenly gets much, much more complicated.<br/><br/>I was shocked to see brief scenes of TENDERNESS in a Tarantino film as well as full exposition and fleshing out of the characters. It's great that he's matured but then yanks us back to his usual territory which his fans demand- fast visceral and violent action, with dialogue to match in not just English. He might love all those old classic martial arts films but isn't afraid to add a dash of subtle parody to the proceedings - all the while never losing sight of Yuen Wo-Ping's talented fight arrangements and team.<br/><br/>
I'm posting this on the night of the release in the UK, which means I can't spoil anything- that makes it hard to talk about.

Just watch it and make up your own mind- and  stay to the end of the credits for a preview of the first DVD Extra you'll see in six months."
"gregsrants","8","0","1","20 April 2004"," You won't find a better movie this year
","You gotta love this Tarantino guy.  Having made only three movies in 11 years, he came back to the spotlight in 2003 with the ultra-violent and critically acclaimed, Kill Bill Vol.1.  The movie was another non-linear story about a pregnant bride who seeks revenge over the fellow thugs that massacred her at her wedding rehearsal, and in particular, the ringleader and former lover, Bill.  Now, just six months removed from local theatres comes the next chapter of the vigilante in the suitably titled Kill Bill Vol. 2.<br/><br/>Reprising her role as The Bride (although the films were shot simultaneously, so the word reprising might not be appropriate) is Uma Thurman.  For those that remember, she awoke from a four-year coma in Vol. 1 and quickly began her roaring rampage of revenge on O-Ren Ishii and Vernita Green, two of the five participants in her botched murder.<br/><br/>That left Ellie Driver (Darryl Hannah), Budd (Michael Madsen) and father figure Bill (David Carradine) to cross of the list and The Bride begins with Bill's brother Budd.  Not that this is where the movie begins however.  In true Tarantino style, Vol. 2 actually starts before the massacres of O-Ren Ishii and Vernita.  A black and white opening chapter takes us back to the wedding chapel where the assault takes place and we understand more of the love Bill has for The Bride and how his jealousy overtakes him.  Actually, Vol. 2 goes even further back in the past and spends a good portion of its 21/2 hour running time showing a quiet fireside moment between Bill and The Bride and later her training with a martial arts and discipline trainer, Pai Mei.  I was sure that if Tarantino had another hour from the studio, we would have seen The Bride's birth and first communion.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol. 2 is an extension of Vol. 1 that together showcases the best of Quentin's talent.  Where Vol. 1 had all the violence, blood and a pussy wagon, Vol. 2 has conversations about Superman, a reunion with a long lost daughter and a focus on the motivation for each character.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong; Vol. 2 has more than the average movie's share of action and carnage.  When The Bride first encounters Budd, she is shot with salt bullets and then buried alive.  Her resurrection then leads her back to Budd's trailer where Ellie is finishing up some business and soon the two are involved in a catfight involving swords, fists and even a television antenna.   Kept within the confines of the tight trailer space, the fight claustrophobically exciting with a conclusion that will leave you wishing you were not listening in Dolby Digital.<br/><br/>The biggest difference between the two volumes will probably be what the average filmgoer complains about the most, and that is the dialogue. Known for character rants on everyday conversation topics like a Madonna song (Reservoir Dogs) or a Quarter Pounder in Europe (Pulp Fiction), Tarantino has always been praised on how he whips verbiage to his audience with such fluent accuracy that you marvel at it's insightful perceptions, yet it is probably no different from a conversation you would have with a friend or neighbor.  In Vol.2, he exploits his gift and whether it is Ellie reading an internet history on the Black Mamba snake or Bill telling the story about his favorite superhero we are subjected to long speeches that take their time and unfold like origami.<br/><br/>But despite all the gibber jabber between characters, it will not be a sentence or an expression that you will remember when you leave the theatre. Instead, you will remember The Bride being buried alive and fighting her way out of the darkness.  You will remember how Ellie lost her fight and you will laugh at how she is remembered in the final credits.  And you will remember that The Bride gets her revenge even if they don't all fall as a result of her hands.<br/><br/>To say that Kill Bill Vol. 1 is better than Vol. 2 or the other way around is to forget that they were shot simultaneously and is essentially the same movie split in two so that Miramax can make as much money as possible. Both are definitely unique in their style and presentation.  You may not appreciate Vol.2 after being so wound up after the fight with the 88's at the conclusion of 1, but give it a couple of months and watch both volumes back to back on DVD.  You won't find a more unique or better film this year I'll bet."
"coletrickle90","10","0","1","19 April 2004"," Better than Vol. 1!!!
","Quentin Tarantino's latest effort is so thoroughly satisfying, even his strongest supporters might be amazed.  I certainly am.  Although it can't match ""Pulp Fiction"" outright, it reminds us of how much he can obliterate our notions of what is possible, or perhaps just prove that QT is the singular most clever and entertaining filmmaker today.<br/><br/>
Vol. 1 was a rock 'em sock 'em video game action extravaganza that borders on saturation.  But now with Vol. 2, any doubt about the values of the first installment can be forgiven.<br/><br/>Vol. 2 hits on most every element I love about movies.<br/><br/>QT's God blesses him.  We thank him."
"alan-mayer","10","0","1","19 April 2004"," What a masterpiece! Such a brilliant turn for Tarantino to make!
","I would like to say that I have read some comments already made of the film, one that gave a dissatisfied review. His comments made of the film were that it did not have a very clear love story shown between Bill and the Bride, and that the fight scenes were not of the caliber of Vol. 1. In reply, I would like to state that the love story was one of the most poignant touches in the whole film. You feel Uma's anguish in this piece, and you sense a very heartfelt love between the two when they share the screen together. The fight scenes were not that of the House of Blue Leaves sequence in Vol. 1, nor were they meant to be. This movie is a Spaghetti Western and Kung-fu epic at heart; it's ferocity and wit is astounding to see, and the writing is, above all, compelling. In fact, there is not a single piece of dialogue that lost me, and the flashbacks tie in to important sections of Uma's survival that I cannot reveal to you until you have seen it (wow, what a shock and surprise!). The dialogue may not be blunt and frank, but its depth speaks for itself. The story about the fish on the ground, or Superman's masked identity is probably one of the most awe-inspiring pieces of dialogue that I have ever heard. This is a film that brings back some of the things that have brought aboard fans of Tarantino. Granted, Vol. 1 is just as pleasing to Tarantino fans, but this one reminds us of the genius of Tarantino's writing, and what he brought back to cinema with Reservoir Dogs. This is a tour de force or massive cinematic power, it is Tarantino using his budget to the best of his ability, and is his ability exceptional! Prepare yourself for a classic!"
"mugoldeneagle03","Null","0","1","19 April 2004"," Critics are clueless...
","I just recently have seen Kill Bill Vol. 2, and the day before I saw it, the movie was the talk of all my friends. Almost everyone I talked to said it was either horrible, or not as good as the first movie. And after reading some of the comments made by other people on this website it made me wanna voice my opinion. Tarantino is one of the best & weirdest directors ever. People need to understand hes not like anyone else when they see his films. The way he gets in depth with characters and plots in Vol. 2 is unreal. Although there Isn't the same amount of action as in the first film, he makes up for it in drama. The sequel wasn't supposed to be action packed. Instead it was supposed to get the viewers to catch the symboligy of things in the movie, and how it works the ""cause & effect"" of the film. Vol. 1 is still my favorite, but with Vol. 2 on its side, there isnt a better 1-2 punch than what Tarantino delivers w/ these great flicks!"
"vegged","10","0","1","19 April 2004"," Even better than Vol. 1
","What can I say?  Vol. 1 was awesome, but Vol. 2 is even better!  Tarantino is a genius filmmaker and this movie is another masterpiece, perhaps even surpassing (dare I say?) Pulp Fiction.  Vol. 2 is not as cinematic as Vol. 1 but it ties up all the lose strings and questions of the first movie and it does so in a very unpredictable way.  We all know that the bride is out for her revenge, but there are many twists and turns along the way that I never saw coming.  I don't know what it is, but Tarantino has a way of getting great performances out of his cast.  Don't get me wrong, it's a great cast, but I've never seen them better than in this movie.  The long stretches of diologue between the action is fantastic, due largely to great writing and great performances.  It's all very entertaining and gripping.<br/><br/>It's been a long time since Jackie Brown, but it was certainly worth the wait.  If this is what we can expect from Mr. Tarantino then I'm willing to wait seven years between pictures."

","I can take gore. I can take extreme violence. Hell, I can take graphic sex and masochism. BUT, the scene where Budd buries 'The Bride' is the most disturbing thing I have ever seen. I know it's been done before, but QT did such a great job of communicating the claustrophobic feeling of being in a casket underground. I couldn't bare to listen to the dirt falling on the thing!<br/><br/>Really though this drives home my 'point'. This is the most masterfully acted movie I have ever seen. Ever. Uma Thurman gives us a real feeling of how any of us would react in that situation. Total fear, isolation and helplessness. I have never felt so claustrophobic in a giant room full of people.<br/><br/> On a side note, when Elle (Hannah) gets her eye plucked by the vengeful bride her screams began an incredible onslaught on me. It was the most convincing portrayal of a person in mortal pain that I will (can) ever see. Absolutely blood-curdling.<br/><br/> It must be said however, these are just two of the reasons I LOVE this movie!"
"JackBauerPowerHour","8","0","1","19 April 2004"," So Many Thrills From Start To Finish
","Some SPOILERS AHEAD. So watch out.<br/><br/>It's rare to find a film that is thrilling, hilarious, disturbing, dramatic, emotionally moving, and powerful. It's even more rare to find a film that has all these qualities often on the screen at the same time. ""KILL BILL Vol. 2"" is the second half of one the best films of last year. Originally meant to be a four hour epic, KILL BILL was split in two volumes. Vol. 1 amazed so many people and this film does even more than that.<br/><br/>KILL BILL is a homage to martial arts and samurai films that writer/director watched as a child. Both volumes constanly change genres which makes them even more amazing to watch. Vol.1 started as a 1970's revenge flick, became a samuria film, and then a japanese anime, where gore erupted in which limbs and heads flew. Vol.2, in the other hand, is more about story, character development, acting, it has a western feel to it, is a fun kung fu film which makes it even better than Vol. 1.<br/><br/>Many critics and moviegoers were turned off by the lack of depth and often cartoonish nature of Vol One. This is one of the reasons why KB should of remained one film. The thin but exciting characters of V1 become more human in V2. What starts off as a stylish and exciting action film becomes more of a dramatic film for the ages. As we learn more about the backgrounds for each character, we start to understand them, like them, hate them, and finally, connect with them. Volume 2 has less violence than V1, but does it mean is less exciting. It's a richer, deeper and overall, an amazing story-line. The final themes are not revenge, or justice, as were those in V1, but love, courage, suffering, and what the future holds.<br/><br/>With these themes aside, KILL BILL is downright fun to watch. Uma Thurmans ""The Bride"", who was a killing machine in the first one, has some layers revealed here, and she becomes a warrior with purpose. Uma definiteley alot of notice, come oscar time. Not many actresses can potray this angry and violent character but shes does a great job at it. She becomes a memorable and heart breaking character here.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast deserve alot of notice to. Micheal Madsen, here becomes a great villain in a film with other great villains. Darrly Hannah is even better as Elle Driver, who was the brides main rival when they were both assasins. Her and the bride face off in a exciting fight which had the audience laughing, screaming, and covering their eyes. Then there's BILL. In V1 we never saw his face which made him mysterious. He's played by David Carradine, BILL is one of the most complex and involving villains since Darth Vader. As much as we despise him at first, we get to know him through flashbacks, we kind of start to like him a bit. What the bride and BILL both prove, is that within every killer, there is a nice person hidden. Carradine is excellent. Another fun character is Pai Mei, who in flashbacks trains the bride through some amusing scenes.<br/><br/>What more is there to say about this film, well edited, shot, acted, written, and directed. KILL BILL Vol 2 is a masterpiece. This movie definitely deserves some big oscar buzz because this is not only a masterpiece but one the greatest films of all-time. (A+)"
"teppertaylor","10","0","1","19 April 2004"," For those who think this movie is too violent...
","Go back to your suburban pc world where things make sense for you. Let those who operate in the real world watch and discuss movies. This movie was not excessively violent, nor was it really all that violent. There is violence in the movie, but its about a professional killer taking her revenge on other professional killers, so grow up. The dialogue was amazing; it was funny, clever, witty and simply brilliant. The bit about Superman is vintage Tarantino (i.e.  Tipping in Reservoir Dogs and Foot Messages in Pulp Fiction). If you didn't like the dialogue, plot, premise, or direction thats one thing, but do not dismiss this movie as being too violent. Tarantino is an artist, and it is about time people start appreciating his art."
"fellc","10","0","1","19 April 2004"," Excellent plot, edge of my seat every second. A must see.
","If anyone had any problems with the first volume, Quentin answers those naysayers with this spectacular conclusion.  David Carradine is especially good, and Gordon Liu is hilarious as the master Pai Mei.  Fight scenes not as extensive or bloody as the first movie, but the plot is more developed, and all questions are answered.  Quentin doesn't fail to use flashbacks and black and white sequences.  This volume is more of a tribute to spaghetti westerns than to samurai films, although there are some references in certain scenes, most particularly ""The tutelage of Pai Mei"".  It doesn't seem to be necessary to have seen the first volume, all though I would definitely recommend it because it is a dazzling film and supplements vol 2 quite well."
"darkjoker9455","10","0","1","19 April 2004"," An awesome movie experience
","Kill Bill Volume 2, as well as Volume 1, are not movies to critique. Sure, there are flaws with them, but in the end, who really cares? These are the types of movies that are meant for enjoyment, they are meant to honor kung fu movies and to satisfy an audience. Tarantino isn't proving anything, or showing off, he is just creating something that years from now, someone can look back and say: this is some seriously awesome shit and not help but smile.  You can watch other movies and be shocked, or empathize with the character, or maybe cry if someone dies, but for once it is nice to just walk into a movie theater and just enjoy a movie! That is what Tarantino tries to create, an enjoyable experience and he does so masterfully.  I just hope those Kill Bill 3 things are rumors!<br/><br/>A+"
"catroni","9","0","1","19 April 2004"," Quentin's best feature
","I will say it right away: I was sceptical about Tarantino and always viewed him as talented yes, but overrated. It seamed he never had a style that really stood on its own, but rather based on the cinema he had been watching since a kid. He was an excellent recycler (the best and what I truly liked of him: never tried to hide that he was referring and sometimes copying some of his mentors.)<br/><br/>Still, I couldn't wait for Kill Bill. And I enjoyed it very much. A lot of violence, yes. But unreel and not to be taken seriously. But in my mind, this film was a B-movie. One of the best. Along with memorable films such as The Killing(Kubrick), Touch of Evil (Welles)... and Pulp Fiction of course.<br/><br/>Then came Volume 2. I was infiltrated in the picture and felt the magic in every scenes. Uma is unbelievable as is Caradine. As I watched this unforgettable film, I now understood why this film was separated from its predecessor: The tone is different, and so is the ambiance. Vol.1 was a Samurai picture, this one is a Spagetthi western. The editing is also great, because some of the scenes that could have been unbelievable, were believable because of the way the film was constructed. It reminded me of 60's cinema, and the intro reminded me of 40's film noir.<br/><br/>With Volume 2, Tarantino actually polished a genre that have not been taken seriously for a long time: The B-Picture. He could have sell his soul and do typical Hollywood pictures, but Quentin has a quality that most Hollywood filmmakers don't possess (besides Burton and a selected few): Passion and dedication for the stories he wants to tell... and no compromise."

","Although volume 2 of this extravagantly excessive, indulgently fun endeavor is quite different than the first installment, it works undeniably well. Where volume 1 is a ridiculously gory thrillride paying homage to several of Tarantino's favorite movie subgenres (grindhouse martial arts flicks, 70s exploitation flicks, etc.) Volume 2, although containing some of these elements as well (including a spaghetti western type feel throughout) differs in that it is more plot driven and story focused.  Although some critics may suggest that Tarantino is too stubborn and excessive because of the incredibly elaborate plot elements that lie within volume 2 (the fifteen minute segment with The Bride training with martial arts master Pai Mei, and the unusually long intro) however, I dismiss the ramblings of these types of critics because every second of both movies are absolutely necessary as we see the plot come full circle.<br/><br/>In volume 1 we get to witness Tarantino's visionary genius machismo at work and it is truly awe-inspiring, however, in Volume 2 Tarantino shows us that he is not simply a visual genius behind the camera, but that he can also weave quite a tale of intrigue as well.  Individually, each movie is stunning with that unforgettable feeling of ""coolness"" that have accompanied every other one of his films.  However, together, ""Kill Bill"" is a masterpiece."
"Fitch37","Null","0","1","19 April 2004"," I liked the separation of one movie
","I liked the ending of the first when bill said that her baby was still alive.  I think that Quentin Tarrintino is a genius when it comes to making movies.  I loved Kill Bill 1 and I loved Kill Bill 2, I know that they are the same movie, but he really did a good job in separating them.  The only thing that I can say that I didn't like is the fight with Bill at the end where Uma does the five pressure point exploding heart thing.  I also didn't like the training that she did with the chinese guy, it reminded me of that show on Comedy Central BONZAI when he kept on moving his beard.  With the whole effect.  But overall I still will probably go buy both volumes to add to my Tarrentino collection.  I think that people try to analyze things to much, it was a great movie, end of story.  If it wasn't so great and all the people making bad comments on it, then it wouldn't have a 8.5 only after being out for a week.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

","While this film is much different than the first part it resolves in great form. This second movement to Tarintino's opus is more plot driven than the first parts multiple fight scene, which in some cases last over twenty minutes. We learn the past of the bride and more about the circumstances of her apparent 'death'. This second part really shines in its story telling ability, the actors are faithfully able to show us the extent of their emotions without saying a word. This is by far one of Tarintino's best, while it is not 'Pulp Fiction' the quality of the acting and the quality of the script are all there. While this movie will most likely be snubbed at the Oscars because of its release date, I truly hope voters will look at this film as one of the 'truest' movie of 2004."

","Alright, I admit, this review may be a little biased, because I love the man Quentin Tarantino as much as one man can love another without stepping over the boundaries of heterosexuality...however, this film is incredible. I was all set to call Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind the best film of the year, and then here comes Volume 2, and it just knocks me flat on my ass. Anybody that complained about Volume 1's graphic violence will be happy to note that the violence has been toned down, and anybody that loved the graphic violence shall be happy to note that there is still some scenes of pretty nasty stuff. I havent smiled this much at a movie since the first time I saw Pulp Fiction. The best part is, you can watch the film for entertainment, or you can watch it to find all the other film references QT has thrown in there. It's brilliant. Quentin's trademark dialogue is back in full force, and he still has an incredible ability to shock you while at the same exact time making you laugh your head off. Just wait until you see the scene in Budd's trailer with Elle. Pai Mei is a hoot. Probably the best part of the film. The cinematography by Robert Richardson is once again superb, my personal favorite being the black and white in !!!SPOILER!!!! the scene where The Bride is buried alive..END SPOILER... The film is a great deal more emotional than Volume 1. Whereas Vol. 1 was just a fun time watching blood and limbs fly, Vol. 2 is rather elegant and understated, if such a word can be used to describe a QT film. Beautiful music from some of the worlds best westerners, and a nice original score from Robert Rodriguez (who should stick to scoring films, and give making films a rest). All in all, go see this movie before I kick your ass! Just be ready to expect the unexpected."

If you can't stand the blood and vulgar language, move to a different country and sure as hell don't watch this movie, Ya P&$$%.<br/><br/>All actors were gargantuanly astonishing, but I ultimately enjoyed Sonny Chiba as Hattori Hanzo, Caitlin Keats as Janeen, Chiaki Kuriyama as Go Go Yubari, and Chia Hui Liu as Pai Mei.

"mlambboy","10","0","1","18 April 2004"," Separates the eye-candy moviegoer from the artistic moviegoer
","First off I'd like to say I thought this installment was by far the more creative, and more enjoyable. Many people have criticized it for having drug on to long, and too much acting and not enough action. Well this clearly has separated us as moviegoers from the first installment.<br/><br/>
In the first movie, QT fans, and a few people who just like to pick a random movie and watch it saw it first. They then reccomended it to all their friends, and before you knew it, everyone liked this movie, because it had something for everyone to like. For the action fan, it had plenty of that. For the art fan, scenes like the anime sequence, or the fight in the Japanese garden would more than pacify them. And for the fan of a great acting... I think refraining from talking about Uma's performance would be acceptable seeing as how not many people disagree when someone says that her acting in this was brilliant.<br/><br/>But the second movie was a little different. Sure it had all the above elements, but it was lacking a great deal more in the action/eyecandy department. This movie can be compared to Pink Floyd's album ""Wish You Were Here"" in that if you are the type of person that likes brilliant things, you can wait just a little bit longer for them to come out. They are both simply just a test of patience.<br/><br/>Volume 2 has many brilliant points in it, such as the Superman dialogue, and the scene at the church, but they slow down a lot at these points, and the average moviegoer just says ""oh come on already,"" but they dont really care about whats actually happening in these scenes, they care more about when the next time they are gonna see blood is. If you stop complaining and just open your ears, and eyes, you will see and hear some of the best acting and dialogue in a movie today.<br/><br/>""But Daniel, thats not what I saw in the first one. and thats not what I came to see in this one. So where's the blood?!?!""<br/><br/>My answer to you is, its all in the first one. If you are a Tarantino fan, or you are into a good movie, or if you care about what happens to the bride, then watch this one. But if all you care about is some blood and violence, then either rent Vol.1 again, or go pull one of the Halloween movies you have off the shelf and pop it in.<br/><br/>-Daniel"
"undeadboy","Null","0","1","18 April 2004"," woa
","i'm going to review both movies here. the first one was a very fun, almost cartoonish, romp of an action movie. the anime scenes were genius, and the music complimented the overall aesthetic very nicely. the second one completed the picture with a lot of character development, and even some tear jerking drama. the scenes that showed how the bride learned how to kick a** so well were amazing. the 70's kung fu film grain made my jaw drop. the overall camera work was incredible in the second one. the only thing that annoyed me was how he portrayed el paso. i don't know a single person who owns a stetson, and cirtainly no one who talks with a country accent. it would have been nice if he hadn't portrayed us as some hick, sh*t kicker town in the middle of no where, but it didn't really change my opinion of the overall masterpiece. this is definitely one to see."
"cGrantLimbo","10","0","1","18 April 2004"," In actuality, less is more
","Having seen part II of Kill Bill on opening night (just like I did with the first back in October), I couldn't help but expect the same amount of bloodshed and action that was so prominent in the first. Underneath it all though, I knew it was time for Tarantino to show us actual characters human sides, or it would just turn out to be two movies of nonstop, illiterate action that would remain derivative and not remain true to himself (Tarantino). The movie started a little slow, and you actually have to listen to the dialogue this time because it's important for things to come. Although, I liked the development and actually had only one eye open waiting in suspense in the opening scene (which is in the same setting as the part I took). I really had a sort of dislike for Tarantino before that I never told anyone, but this film (part I and II as a whole) changed my perspective (although fanboys really annoy me). My biggest surprise was that Daryll Hannah, who has been around forever, is finally showing us that she can act. Having NEVER liked her, I found her introduction in Part I to be stellar and the conclusion of her character Elle Driver even more-satisfying. Out of all of the Brides former cohorts, Elle Driver IMO was the only one that was never friends with her at any given time, as there is a perfect tension between Thurman and Hannah being displayed here. In volume one, Cottonmouth and the Bride finish each other's sentences, and after her demise, you see tears in the corner of the Brides eyes. Before Copperhead dies in the beginning of vol. 1, she asks the Bride if she still likes her coffee a certain way. You could see that at one time these characters actually cared for one another. Budd is questionable, although his feelings of slight disgust for the Bride come more from her earlier affair with Bill, his brother. Point being, Elle Driver was probably always viewed as the blacksheep of the group, with only Bill the Snake Charmer ever giving her a chance. ***SPOILER*******It's funny that the Bride spares her life, one she truly hated, and didn't to those she had once had feelings for in some way or another. Maybe this was her way of saying ""you deserve something worse than death"" and then leaving her with the snake. Driver (California Mtn. Snake) was indeed specialized in the way of poisening people to end their lives, so the Bride wanted her to feel as much of a slow, painful death as Driver gave to her victims.*******end Spoiler*******. Overall, I have to say I liked this movie better, if not necessarily enjoyed it more. Volume 1 was much more of a ""enjoy it for what it is"" type of movie, Volume 2 is an actual Tarantino film.<br/><br/>In short:Volume 1: **** Volume 2: ****1/2 both: ****1/2"
"tccandler","10","0","1","18 April 2004"," The Bride... aka Black Mamba... aka Beatrix Kiddo... aka Mommy.
","Watching both volumes of this wonderfully energetic epic, one is reminded how much Quentin Tarantino adores movies.  His enthusiasm in paying homage to the westerns, kung-fu flicks and gangster thrillers that have shaped his life is infectious and tremendously welcome considering the vast sea of banality churned out each year by studios who are more infatuated with the bottom line than with the artistic merit.<br/><br/>'Kill Bill: Volume 2' is a more talkative conclusion than one would expect after having seen 'Volume 1'.  Oh sure, it has tons of action sequences and tension filled scenes, but there are signature Tarantino conversations littered throughout.  This film gives more weight to the first, explaining and giving dimension to the characters and their actions.<br/><br/>The film picks up where the other left off, as The Bride (Thurman) is half way through her list of people to kill.  Budd (Madsen), Elle Driver (Hannah) and of course Bill (Carradine) are still to be found and disposed of in a gruesome manor.<br/><br/>What makes Tarantino so wonderful is his layering of plot threads.  He is able to intersperse sequences so that we are given vital information which we are not immediately aware that we will need later in the storyline.  He has such complete control of his timing and rhythm as a filmmaker, and keeps us unaware of that directorial manipulation by using humor and wit and intelligence amidst a blur of action and violence.  This talent makes watching a Tarantino film an event.  I am already looking forward to his next film.<br/><br/>The drudgery of having to slog through another special effects bonanza (yawn), or a teeny-bopper romance (puke), or an animated kiddie-flick (ugh), or a gross-out comedy (frown)... All of that nonsense is made tolerable by those dozen or so films each year that show some originality, flare, passion and brilliance.  It is almost guaranteed that a Tarantino film will possess those qualities and be one to remember.  That's why they already have courses at major universities devoted entirely to his small repertoire of films.<br/><br/>I only have two quibbles with the entirety of 'Kill Bill'.   The film should have been released as one long movie.  I don't mind the splice too much, except for the fact that Miramax charged me twice when they said it was not a decision based on financial gain.  But I feel the film will be a delight to watch as a whole when it is released as a special edition DVD sometime this Christmas.<br/><br/>I must also admit to being a tad underwhelmed by the final few minutes of the saga.  I like the fact that it ended in a manor that was completely unexpected... but... it almost ended with a whimper.  I am making a mountain out of a mole-hill here, but I think there is a better ending to be found deep the recesses of QT's mind.<br/><br/>I also want to send out my mocking laughs to those who left the moment the credits started to roll.  True film lovers never leave a film that they like the moment the writing hits the screen... I only do that to films I hate. It is disrespectful to the filmmaker and to the other members of the audience who don't want to peer around you and your tub-o-popcorn to see what they paid for.  Anyway, those who left missed two more sequences of film.  And I hope Tarantino doesn't include them on the DVD so that you'll never get a chance to see them.<br/><br/>As for the 'Kill Bill' legacy... I think it's a marvelous display of a genius filmmaker having delirious fun with all of his influences and showing off every ounce of talent that he can pour onto the screen.  Is it as earth-shattering as 'Pulp Fiction'?  No.  Is it as well written as 'Pulp' or 'Reservoir Dogs'?  No.  'Kill Bill' is not an example of masterpiece filmmaking.  It is too silly and over-the-top for that description.  But is an example of masterpiece moviemaking that very few people will ever be able to duplicate.  There is a big difference between filmmaking and moviemaking, and Tarantino is a master of both.  His gaggle of imitators should find their own paths otherwise they will languish in paled comparison to 'THE MAN'.<br/><br/>The full feature will be a joy to watch over the years.  It will hold up very well over time.  The first volume made my Top Ten List for 2003 and I have very little doubt that the second will make my 2004 list.  I hope it isn't 2010 before Tarantino makes one of my lists again.<br/><br/>Based on a character created by Q & U."

"magnoliafanboy","10","0","1","18 April 2004"," A masterpiece with eyeballs, trailers and soul
","(minor spoilers)<br/><br/>Kill Bill vol. 2 is a masterpiece.  It is the standard at what American Films should be measured on. Watching this one time you will begin to feel there is hope for us all that love cinema.<br/><br/>Where do I begin? Tarantino has gone the extra mile in every possible way. Some may say this surpasses Vol. 1, but that person must also consider the fact that this is just the second half of one great big film.  All the action and visual quickness of Vol.1 was just a bit of collateral that would get the viewer to invest in the remaining of the film where it does unfold into longer character sketches and digs deep into the psyche of Uma's THE Bride.<br/><br/>This is a film that like everything Tarantino does, pays homage and tips his funny little hat to everything he, and you and I, have seen and twists it perfectly into something purely original.<br/><br/>From the opening of Uma driving with the processed sound stage background that contains south of the border palm trees behind her reminded me a lot of Hitchcock's Notorious.  The image of the beautiful blonde driving is similar to Ingrid Bergman's beginning in that film.  This may be Quentin's way of saying this is his star, just like Hitchcock showcased his actress's in a timeless way.<br/><br/>There are images and situation galore that resonate all the films he loves(Master of the Flying Guillotine, Five Finger of Death and Bruce Lee's work) and the directors that Tarantino loves, like the Fulci inspired buried alive scene, the the ongoing Leone western motif and yes Quentin is still professing his love for Brian De Palma.  At first it seems to be the quick split screen that goes into effect as Uma and Darryl Hannah square off.  The last time you saw these two together in Vol.1 their was an ode to De Palma's Dressed to Kill and the echo is felt as the two women's brawl here. But it is more a gesture to Carrie, because in that film the split screen is thrown in just as all hell is about to break loose in the school gym- in Tarantino's universe it will be in the trailer somewhere tucked away in the San Fernando Valley. And we see as Uma raises from her burial a shot of a hand shooting out of the grave just like the end of Carrie.<br/><br/>What I liked most was the shot of the Bride standing on top of a hill looking down on Budd's trailer which reminded me of Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes.  It wasn't really a shot stolen from that film exactly, but it is framed similar to the artwork of that films poster, with the trailer sitting at the bottom of a small valley waiting as prey.  And in this film, Uma is the predator to those inside this trailer.  And I will go one step further, because in the scene that follows inside the trailer you see a poster of the Charles Bronson film  Mr. Majestyk .  With this in mind, please remember the scene in the Hills Have Eyes when all the terror of the canniball's attack is going on in the trailer and you see the poster of Jaws.  Rumor/ Legend has it that Craven placed that poster in the trailer as a statement:""you think that movie was scarry? This film(Hills) you are watching is much more terrifying"".  So with that, can we say that the Bronson poster is making a statement, not about the film itself, but about the persona of Uma Thurman's the Bride.  I think Quentin is saying, ""Chuck Bronson was one of cinema's all time bad asses, but you know what after this is all over, Uma is gonna be right up there with him"".  I might be wrong, but it's fair to say that I might not be too off.<br/><br/>And with all these homages Tarantino has his on style. If this film was in the hand of someone like Michael Bay, we would be shown ten minutes of unnecessay slow motion and bullet point of view action during the Chapel Massacre. But not here, instead we see almost ten minutes of dialogue preceding the Massacre and the pull away and out of the building as the chaos insues. Just like Reservior Dogs, it is not the heist that mattered- it is how those involved in the incident deal with it afterwards that creates the real drama.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman steals the whole show, because she runs the gammit of persona. We see her as a violent/vengful survivor,to an eager kung fu student and as puddy in Bill's hands when she is at the pinnacle of her love for him. This is so well written and the acting by everyone(Carridean, Hannah, Madsen) seals the deal.   The black comedy thrown in at the most perfect of moments sooth us from all the gore being handed our way.<br/><br/>Not to give anything away, but the ending will sqeeze you in every way. This is a film with more going than eyeballs popping out and white trash bitch fights.  It has a soul all its own.  Their is an abundance of  subtext here. Where does a girl become a woman?  In the most womanly of manner the expectancy of new life can make you change the way you live your life for a better tomorrow.  This film may have feminist joining Tarantino's side, but most of all those that cheer for most humane in all of us will love this movie.<br/><br/>This is a film that covers similar film avenues; revenge, killing, death and love.  But what sets it apart is its manner/how we are  shown and told about all these things we have seen before.  This is original and it is worthy of all the hype.  It is now in my top five of all time favorite films."

He knows how to play with the audience emotions, seeing as how he is a fan of all movies himself. Uma(The Bride), Caradine(Bill), Madsen(Budd), Hannah(Elle), Liu(Pai Mei), Parks(the old guy in the mexican whore house)and the brides daughter(very suhweet), has to be the perfect cast ever in a movie. Kill Bill vol 1 was one of my favorite movies of 2003. Yes i Liked Kill Bill vol 1 even more then i liked the last two Matrix Movies and i'm a HUGE Matrix Fan. and Kill Bill vol 2 is so far my favorite movie of 2004 far, and might be my favorite movie of 2004 seeing as there really isn't any other movie i'm looking forward to seeing this year.

","Kill Bill Vol. 2, whether viewed separately or as a whole `Kill Bill' experience, needs to be seen through the prism of experience to ultimately determine its place in the history of cinema. However, as is - in the authors opinion - Kill Bill Vol. 2 is one of the most entertaining and rewarding experiences that can be enjoyed in the theaters (for the next few weeks).<br/><br/>Like it or not, Quentin Tarantino is talented (albeit a talented horse's backside in the eyes of most people), but even if he made the same type of film over and over again, he would give it the much appreciated QT touch. In Kill Bill Vol. 2, he seems to have evolved as a filmmaker, not only populating his worlds with memorable characters and dialogue, but also justifying them in ways you wouldn't expect.<br/><br/>Also, Kill Bill Vol. 2 gives the same level of action and tension you would expect, although such instances are on a much smaller scale than Vol. 1, which in ways make them more brutal (a comparison of the violence from Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 would be like the difference between a movie like The Matrix and Se7en). The action complements the dialogue expertly and the payoff provides moments of euphoric weightlessness on the part of the viewer.<br/><br/>And hey, I might be wrong about all this, but I had a great time so I guess that's what counts, right?"
"charlesclover","8","0","1","18 April 2004"," Awesome movie, but not up to the level of the first one.
","To me it seemed that Kill Bill Vol. 1 explored some really unique techniques of film-making that the second seemed to ignore in favor of more common techniques. This is not to say that Kill bill Vol. 2 is unoriginal, just that it isn't on the same ground-breaking level as the first. Also, the corny one-liner gag is a little overdone in the second movie; eventually it becomes more annoying than humorous. The one major redeeming factor of this movie is The Bride's (Kiddo's) short tutelage under Pai Mae. He is a very interesting character, portrayed as just the perfect mix between strict taskmaster and rude brute. Several other points also seem to make the movie stand out, including the black and white shot of the wedding rehearsal and the short scene which introduces The Bride's name from an elementary school teacher calling names for attendance."

","I eagerly watched Kill Bill: Volume 2 this afternoon and when I left, I knew that Quentin never fails to please the audience. A continuation to the so-called ""pretty much all fighting yet great"" first volume, Volume 2 presents the elements of a true classic with the style of Quentin Tarantino. Characters, plot, conflict, and the seek for revenge build to remarkable levels. Although some people argue that the fight scenes are not as long or gory as Volume 1 presents them, they are just as great, if not better. What impressed me most was how Tarantino brought ideas given earlier on in the film BACK towards the deaths of specifically Elle and Bill (yeah, they die in case you didn't predict it by some chance). Tarantino brings his incredible characters to life. My favorites were Pai Mei, with his signature beard wave, and Elle Driver, who, with all other characters, did a fantastic job. My rating: 10/10"

This film was molded after asian films/serials.  That is how the film in Japan.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol.2 was full of Tarantino talk.  It was molded around old spaghetti westerns. It had the same flow as OLD American movies, slow cuts, no suspence. (Not saying this is necessarily a bad thing)  It's a style.<br/><br/>The reason it was done like this was because, the creative genious he is, Tarantino filmed with the style of where ever Uma's character was geographically.

","I have waited anxiously for this.  The previous two evenings I watched the newly released Volume 1 DVD just to be sure I had ""all"" (""some"" probably more accurate) of the nuances of Volume 1 before entering the theater for Volume 2.  Probably a good idea. There is some recapitulation but not enough to say that Volume 2 could possibly stand alone.<br/><br/>You have to understand that Quentin is a guy who never grew up and is still totally immersed in the magical world of Shaw Bothers movies.  That's all you really need to know to get started on any of his movies.  The fun is often in simply enjoying the details and then realizing that the big picture is a reflection of all those details, nothing more, not much less.<br/><br/>It is also important to sit in a Tarantino movie with your sensibilities switched down low.  He has the ability to shock and horrify the senses.  But this is not a problem if you continue to understand that (1) this is a movie and (2) if you are shocked there is nothing wrong with you.<br/><br/>Why pay to be shocked in this way - perhaps because we are indeed human, we all harbor the need to take revenge and we all enjoy talking about it as well as doing it.  It is the script which so often makes a Tarantino movie - the Pulp Fiction dialog about Big Macs in France serves my point.  This is the case more with Volume 2 than Volume 1 of KB. Mainly because there is more talk and slightly less violence - though the violence can be described as more intense if of shorter duration.  The squirmish will say that at least two scenes go over the top - you will have be your own persnal judge of that.<br/><br/>Volume 1 was a hard act to follow but Volume 2 succeeds and makes this a memorable event.  I shall enjoy watching the two DVDs back to back in a few months time."

","I believe that Tarantino probably has the greatest imagination in the history of film making.  Now some could argue that Spielberg and a few others are better directors(although not many), but no one could come close to creating the character development and bizarre stories that Quentin comes up with.  The cool thing is though, that he makes his bizarre and sometimes corny stories and details work with a mixed aspect of seriousness and timelessness that no one else can construct.  Kill Bill(1 and 2 together) is what I believe the greatest feat in film history.  This is because the movie has some of the funniest scenes ever, the coolest story, and the greatest action.  Despite their being few action scenes, the ones that he puts in the movie are by far the best I've seen.  The film is so great that it doesn't even have a true genre.  It is composed of everything: action, drama, comedy, suspense, thriller....  You name it, and he put it in there.  His films include sub-characters(GoGo,Mr.Blonde) that are remembered as much as some movies' lead roles, and the character of the Bride will probably be remembered years from now as well as Ripley from Aliens and Indiana Jones. This is also a credit to Uma.  So my hats off to Quentin Tarantino for achieving perfection.  Vol.1 didn't and Vol.2 probably won't take home the oscar, but it has to be the biggest cheat in movie history.<br/><br/>Kill Bill(1&2) 13/10"

","In order to fully criticize the second Kill Bill movie, one has to recognize the fact that these two films were originally conceived as one. Given this fact, an obvious expectation for ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" would be that it remain consistent with ""Vol. 1"".<br/><br/>This is not the case at all. Where as the first one was full of rough action, tough dialogue, and sleek style, the second half of Tarantino's opus is littered with poor, tedious dialogue and a complete absence of spectacle. One could even go as far as saying that ""Vol. 2"" trivializes the raw mysticism of ""Vol. 1"".<br/><br/>The ambiguity of The Bride is completely abandoned in favor of dreadful dialogue scenes that seem to go on for an eternity. These scenes are intended to flesh out the story and characters, but in doing so the audience is bored and irritated. ""Vol. 1"" had none of this and it worked as a cool, nostalgic Kung-Fu flick. ""Vol. 2"" on the other hand is a relationship drama with each ""Chapter"" of it disappointing fans exponentially.<br/><br/>
There's no memorable music cues, no anime sequence, hardly any fights, no cool story-structure, and the ending is so awful it is MST3K-worthy. I'm glad Tarantino decided to cut the whole film in half, though. At least we have a great film and a bad one, instead of a really long flick where the first half rocks and the second one sucks.

All the arm- chair directors out there will be scratching their heads wondering why they can't find anything wrong with the film, NOT A THING. The movie should satisfy all those that had reservations about Vol. 1. The basic story is the same but the characters are deeper, the emotions more palpable and the dialogue more QT-ish. The success of the film is that it's so much fun, and so exhilirating yet it still rings with emotional resonance. At the heart of the story is this simple fact ""The Bride will Kill Bill."" It's not about the story perse. It's about the little flourishes and footnotes. You gotta love Gordon Liu playing the wizened Kung-fu Master Paimei whose legend though at first seeming to be a string of bad cliches, you'll find yourself enthralled with anyway. You gotta love how seamlessly QT switches genre's and styles, and yet invests each switch and each new piece of the story with enough life to support a film of its own.

The movie had no sense of pacing. i kept waiting for it to get better. It dragged and sagged and then- just ended. to be sure, this volume is more character driven, and therefore, dialogue and not bloody beheadings by sword take center stage. but the dialogue is so clunky. the monologues are wordy, dull and ultimately interrupt the flow. at one point, during an extended scene of dialogue between bill and the bride, a guy in the theater shouted ""boring!""

","First, I must say that When Quentin Tarantino edits together the complete film, he will have a masterpiece.  However, in Kill Bill's current form, Vol. 1 feels more complete and is more entertaining then vol. 2 (which is ironic considering that Vol. 2 is really the conclusion to vol. 1).  What also doesnt help Vol. 2 is the drastic change of pace.  When the critics write that there is less action and more talking they ""ain't kidden"".  A good portion of the movie is pretty much all set up to what already has been set up in Vol. 1 which makes it somewhat repetative.  Even though it tevhincally goes into greater detail of what happened at the wedding chapel, you dont really feel it since when the killing begins you dont see any of it and it cuts away to a new chapter (which is why Vol. 1 is almost a prerequisite for Vol. 2 since it goes into greater detail of what exactly was done to the bride by the deadly vipers).  We also get to know Budd a little bit more, again all through talking and his life seems rather depressing and its hard to beleive that he was once a deadly assassin.<br/><br/>Although, the training scene with Pei Mei is entertaining and finally brings martial arts back into the film, the real action doesnt start until Elle arrives.  The bout between her and the Bride (SPOILER now Beatrix Kiddo) reminds us of why we wanted to see Kill Bill in the first place, the kick-ass fighting.  That being said, the fight scene was a bit overhyped and really is the only prolonged action scene in the movie (although I feel that the fight was at most only 4 minutes long but thats being generous and including the liuttle diologue they have that brings the fight to dead halt).  However, this fight has one of the best conclusions a fight scene will ever have. Considering that the Elle vs The Bride fight is the onyl real action scene, the movie relies heavily on its main villian, Bill, and he does not dissappoint.  David Carradine played the role perfectly.  Bill was always calm, never lost his cool, even when his emotions ran high.  When the Bride finally came face to face with him, is when more layers of their history are revealed which does kinda turn the tables around and make you question the Brides actions. Other than the Elle fight scene, my favorite scene in the movie has to be with Pei Mei.  Mainly becuase where Vol. 1 was pretty much all Japanese based (even Yuen Woo Ping did chorepgraph the Blue lleaves battle), this scene is all chinese in insperation.  The fighting that takes place is very reminiscent of the old chinese wuxia movies of the 70s.  UNfortunately the scene does not really go too much in depth and it appears that the only thing The Bride actually learned and utilized was the 3 inch punch (well she did utiloize another move thats wil ruin the movie if I tell you what it is).  It would have been nice to see the crane or eagle style present in the Elle Driver fight but, even though both were taught by Pei Mei, we dont see any of it.  I hope that it was originally alonger scene and he cut it dow fro some reason onyl he would understand. Again, what makes Vol. 2 good is Vol. 1.  As a whole movie it would have been magnificabt becuase the first half would be all about kicking ass and the second half would be taking a break and thinking about why she is kicking ass.  With the split, Vol. 2 starts off with us taking a break from the action but, unless you have seen Vol. 1 you dont know what we are taking a break from and if you have seen it, you took a big enough break to want more kicking ass whcih you dont get for what seems to be an enternity."

Yes, the film has it's share of cliches but they seem intentional, so I wasn't bothered. In Vol. 2 it takes more time to build up the story that Vol. 1 didn't completely cover. It shows you the sides of every persons story and develops the characters. It doesn't have the breath-taking fighting scenes the first one has, but as one movie, it has the best story development and action I've seen in a while.

For two people in this movie.  I think Bill's love for Bea is parallel to Bea's love for B.B.  While we all know these are two different types of love their stories are the same in this movie.  For a moment when Bea walks into that room and sees that little girl there is a glimmer of hope that maybe they can forgive and forget and be a family, but it is Bill's eyes that let us know it can't be.

I am a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino. I think he is the best thing that Hollywood has going for it right now. The first time I saw Pulp Fiction I was just amazed by it.  I also loved Jackie Brown and Resevior Dogs. Then Kill Bill Volume 1 came out, and I absolutely loved it. I could not wait to see Volume 2. After seeing Volume 2, I think that both Volumes together is now my favorite Tarantino movie. Uma Thurman's performance in my opinion, is the greatest performance that at least I have seen by an actress. Bill is one of my favorite villians ever. What a spectacular character. I could go on and on about all of the things I loved about this movie. When they come out with an unedited collector's edition DVD of both of them, it is going to be so amazing.

","As someone who has never really been a big Tarantino fan, I wasn't expecting to enjoy either volume of Kill Bill. However, the first defied my expectations and was one of my favourite films of last year, and Vol. 2 in my opinion betters it. If you're after more of what you saw in Vol. 1, this movie may not be for you, but if the characters piqued your interest then Vol. 2 should offer you plenty. QT cuts back on the violence to the extent that it simply serves to punctuate the chapters, but the brutality of the first is exceeded because this film is far more personal. The story of Bill and The Bride really is a tragic one (although the comic touches throughout keep the film from being depressing), and is definitely worth telling. Uma Thurman was made for this role and plays it to perfection, with the rest of the cast complementing her with excellent performances.<br/><br/>It's not as much fun as Vol. 1, that much is certain, but I believe that it stands up better on its own as well as providing a fantastic conclusion to the first volume."

","Kill Bill Volume 2 is utterly incredible.  It creates this perfectly balanced ""yin-yang"" effect with Volume 1. I would suggest buying into ""The Man's"" sleazy marketing scheme and renting and watching Kill Bill 1 before seeing Kill Bill 2 just so you can get the full effect.  While Volume 1 focuses almost entirely on the Bride's (AKA Beatrix Kiddo--""Silly rabbit TRIX are for KIDs"") invincible, natural born killer nature, Volume 2 tones it down a bit to show a much more human, survival-oriented, and even motherly side of her.  In fact, the only person she ends up killing in Volume 2 is Bill himself, and even that is a very emotional scene.  Volume 2 takes a look at how she got to be the world's deadliest woman, while simultaneously focusing on her following through to the end of her journey. As you might know if you paid attention to the end of Volume 1, her child is still alive, and that adds a whole new element to the story.  I found both volumes of Kill Bill to be tremendously engrossing and beautifully well done--I give Volume 2 a 10/10."

","For the people on this chat board who says that Vol. 2 was a bore and disappointment, listen up. I applaud the people for looking at the movie as a whole because that is the way it is supposed to be viewed. When a writer, and or director, make a movie that has to be split into two seperate movies because of the film academy, you are not looking at it through the creator's eyes. QT pictured these movies not as two, but as one movie that will stand the test of time. Those critisizing the second movie are actually just saying that half of the movie was boring. If you look at the movie as a whole, the first half is for the Grindhouse Kung-fu addicts, the second half is for western lovers and people who like a good story. See I'm doing it. THIS MOVIE, (KILL BILL 1 and 2) is a total package movie. It has a perfect blend of hatred, love, action, story telling, drama, suspense, thrill, and shocking events. Classic QT is the only description of all those rolled into one. For those of you who loved the first movie, if you only liked it for the action, you won't like the second, if you're going to see the end of a great narrative story, see it. Oh yeah, for those who liked the first, you will love Pei Mei. See the movie, think of it as a really long intermission between the beginning half and the ending half, and don't bitch about the second if you didn't like the first.

","I enjoyed this film much more than the needlessly gratuitous Vol 1.  While Vol 1 had some great scenes, in hindsight it only serves to create a motivational backstory for the anti-hero played by Thurman. One could spend a few sentences to summarize Vol 1 to a friend (who has not seen it) then direct them to Vol 2 to the same story told better.<br/><br/>
If Vol 1 had the too-narrow focus on bloody revenge, then Vol 2 is the belated payoff to QT's fans who hoped he would create a tale with more feeling, like he did with Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>I felt Vol 2 expertly drew me into the narrative through the same use of gritty visuals as Vol 1, but was more successful because it used suspense more than comically-graphic spurts of arterial blood.  Vol 2 played upon fears of the dark, closed spaces and helplessness, all while interjecting the humanity of family in the form of a wedding then later a mother's love for a child.  I was able to relate more to Vol 2 because it's satire content used family concepts that I am familiar with.<br/><br/>While Vol 1 was still fun ride that alternately caused me to grimace and gag, or blink in startled amusement, or chuckle with guilty pleasure at the violence, Vol 2 is the pay-off that removes the guilt and lays out a human story told in the wonderfully absurd Tarrentino tradition."

It's a great film that made me sit at the edge of my seat the whole time.  It wasn't supposed to be as bloody.  That was the point.  It was a more emotional view on the characters that effed Thurman over the worst.  Vernita and O-Ren were only the first and second. Budd, Elle, and Bill did her in the worst, so there was more depth, more emotion.  I think it worked.  And I have to disagree with the Bill's death and how some think it was ""stupid"".  Pei Mei obviously thought that Beatrix was worthy of knowing the five pressure point heart exploding trick, not Bill.  That says a lot, since Bill was Beatrix's master before Pei Mei. And I thought it was great that she killed him with a trick that ""Pei Mei never told anyone"".  It showed him!  It was also a dignified way to die, because Bill is a dignified man.  Or so he lets us on to believe.<br/><br/>Being a HUGE fan of Kill Bill Vol. 1, I was shocked by Vol. 2, but in a good way.

The piecing of ""The Brides"" past and present was the key to this film. The plot unfolds and the story is told. Unlike vol. 1, we actually feel for the bride and for bill.  We understand the story, and we understand the characters.  Tarantino has built some powerful players in this film.  This movie is better than vol. 1 in virtually every way, and will surely make my top 100 upon second viewing.

In a completely sold out cinema I was going to watch the sequel of what I thought to be one of the best movies ever. First Kill Bill Vol.1 was shown, then a break and finally it was midnight and Kill Bill Vol. 2 was about to be shown.<br/><br/>While the movie was playing, I didn't move. I didn't wink and I almost forgot to breath. I was so amazed. This was such an unique movie, and it was great on both a 'nice story'-level as an artistic level. When the credits came rolling, I was shaking and I was totally convinced: Kill Bill vol.2 is not only better than Vol. 1, it is one of the best movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>And that quite surprised me. After seeing Vol. 1 with ultra-cool Gogo Yubari and classy, stylish O-Ren I did not think that QT could ever surpass the quality and intensity of that movie. I did look forward to Vol. 2 but was afraid to be disappointed. I was so wrong. Not only do Budd and Elle Driver overdo the coolness of Vernita Green and O-Ren Ishii, they actually are able to be even cooler as Gogo Yubari.<br/><br/>Vol.2 is a lot less violent and it is one big pack of dialogue. But the dialogue is so stunning, that you're not even disappointed that there's not so much violence in it. The action that does appear in the movie is outrageous and just great. As an effect of all these dialogues, you get sympathy for The Bride and even for Bill. The dialogues are never too long or too complicated, because there is always some action intwined with it.<br/><br/>As The Bride comes closer and closer to the mindbreaking climax of the film, there are a couple of extraordinary scenes in the film. I will try not to spoil anything, but Pai Mei's training, the Paula Schultz thing and Budd and Elle in the trailer are certainly one of the best scenes there ever were in a movie (people who have already seen this movie know what I'm talking about).<br/><br/>I don't think that QT could ever have used a better cast for this film. Uma Thurman shows that she act everyone of the screen as she plays a mother, a killer, a revengeful Bride and a lover. On top of that, each different side of her character is so well worked out by Uma that I think there might be an Oscar for her. Not to forget David Carradine. He plays Bill as such a mindless killing machine with a heart, that you think he is playing a double role, but it's just a piece of excellent acting. Michael Madsen is Budd and I wonder if the role is written for him. If not, Madsen could also be in the running for some awards. I was never a fan of Daryl Hannah. I thought she was kind of annoying. But I have to admit that she was sexy as ever and a great actress for the role of Elle Driver. At least one award for her. Keep an eye out for double roles by Gordon Liu and Michael Parks cause they are great. I really need to see this movie one more time to discover every little hidden detail that were also in Vol. 1.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Fans of Kill Bill Vol. 1 are bound to go to this one, cause it's by far better than Vol. 1. If you found Vol. 1 a little over-the-top violent I suggest you just try out this one. You'll probably be amazed by the great storyline QT has written. The cast is great, the action is amazing and the storyline is stunning. I've got a A+ for Kill Bill: Vol. 2!"

","I have to admit, I was one of the few people that didn?t like Kill Bill Volume 1.  It was self-indulgent, superficial, soulless, and WAY overrated. Volume 2 takes a 180-degree turn and goes back to the Quentin Tarantino that we all know and love--great storytelling, great character development, wonderful dialog, and dark, wicked humor.<br/><br/>*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***<br/><br/>The Bride (Uma Thurman) continues her quest for revenge against Bill and the remaining two assassins that tried to kill her during her wedding rehearsal. After a failed attempt at taking out the washed-up Budd (Michael Madsen), the Bride is buried alive and left for dead?again.  In flashback, we learn that the Bride was trained by the legendary martial arts priest, Pai Mei (Gordon Liu in a scene-stealing performance as the bearded, bushy eye browed master).  Having practiced the three-inch punch repeatedly, the Bride manages to hit her way out of her claustrophobic, wooden coffin.<br/><br/>
Meanwhile, Budd agrees to sell the Bride?s Hatori Hanzo sword to Elle Driver (Darryl Hannah) for $1 million.  Bitter that a loser like Budd had the pleasure of killing the Bride instead of her, Elle double-crosses him by hiding a black mamba in the suitcase of cash.  With Budd out of the picture and the Hanzo sword in hand, Elle is about to leave Budd?s trailer when is she greeted by a drop kick from the Bride.  What follows is one the best and most brutal catfights ever captured on film.  I won?t spoil the fun with the details, but Elle?s painful demise is sweet poetic justice that only Tarantino could write.<br/><br/>All that?s left is Bill (David Carradine).  When the Bride finally tracks him down, she discovers that her daughter is still alive and that Bill has been raising her all this time.  In another flashback, we discover that Bride wanted to quit the business after finding out that she was pregnant. She disappears, and when Bill finally tracks her down, he finds her marrying a record store employee and automatically assumes that the groom is the father of the unborn baby.  Jealous, Bill ?overreacts? and sends in his henchmen to kill everyone in the chapel.  Ahhhh, it all makes sense now!<br/><br/>David Carradine delivers an amazing speech near the end of the film that rivals Samuel Jackson?s speech at the end of Pulp Fiction.  Comic book fans will geek out at the Spider-man and Superman references, while screenwriters will geek out at rich metaphors.  Following some more meaty verbal exchange, the Bride and Bill have their showdown, and she takes him out with a secret technique that Pai Mei taught her.<br/><br/>With her quest complete, the Bride claims her daughter, exits the world of assassins, and enters the world of motherhood.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

Once again, I ask the question, what was Tarantino thinking? It seems our beloved writer/director has sold us out, as we were looking forward to more of what we had in Volume 1.

What was even greater was the promise of more to come.<br/><br/>First, they sliced the movie in half. Then, they set the release date of Volume 2 in February, 4-5 months after the first. And then, again, the release date was moved to April. I just felt that all this hype and waiting was for naught.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill: Vol.2"" has redeeming aspects. There's the Texas funeral scene, the retelling of the incident in El Paso, and finally what happens to Budd. But overall this is an entirely different film; it's more gritty, more patient, and more sentimental. In other words, the coolness is gone. I don't know what's more interesting: the fact that Quentin Tarantino took a 180-degree change of pace, or that he had originally expected audiences to watch these halves together.<br/><br/>(I used the term ""sentimental"" rather than ""emotional"" because, in actuality, more emotion is shown in The Bride's waking up and discovering her baby missing than any other scene.)<br/><br/>And the music! What happened to the music? About the only cool piece is the one you hear already in the previews. The rest is cowboy folk, Spanish music, and a particularly sad trip-hopish song before the inevitable battle.<br/><br/>Really, I was disappointed. Perhaps I would've liked it more had it been a one-shot. My advice: those who loved Vol. 1 for its homage to animé, samurai films, and Japanese culture altogether, will more than likely not find what they're looking for in Vol. 2.<br/><br/>In regards to how I feel about Quentin Tarantino right now, I refer you to what Nancy Sinatra sang at the beginning of Vol. 1:<br/><br/>He shot me down.

Page was a great musician and Led Zeppelin made some great songs, but that doesn't mean I have to praise his 30 minute 'Dazed and Confused' guitar solo. In a similar vein, it is not an insult to Tarantino's skills to say that Kill Bill 2 is about 30 minutes too long. There is genius to be found, but unfortunately this is one of those 'Dazed and Confused' moments where QT's self indulgence is trying the patience of fans such as myself.<br/><br/>I could easily name 3-4 scenes that could be removed or shortened considerably -- scenes that added almost nothing to the story and served only to slow the pace of the film. The film itself might have been a dreadful bore if not for a sensationally choreographed showdown between Elle (Daryl Hannah) and the Bride (Uma). The scenes of Uma's kung-fu training were equally entertaining and were beautifully integrated into the story as a whole.<br/><br/>Too many times, though, we are forced to sit through another one of Tarantino's signature 'Royale with Cheese' moments: meandering conversations about trivialities that are meant to draw out the tension by delaying the action scenes. Well, the technique is starting to feel like a schtick and just doesn't work so easily for me anymore.<br/><br/>I am disappointed, because within 220 minutes that make up Kill Bill 1 & 2 are two sensational 88 minute films that coupled together would represent a great moment in stylish moviemaking.

Now before I go any further, the acting, character, and dialogue are on par, and in some cases better than Volume 1. This movie is very different from the last one though as it is hardly an action film.  There are 3 (I think) 1-on-1 fights, none of which last more than five minutes.  Plus, there is virtually no swordplay at all.  Now, for an over two hour long action film, that's not exactly what you'd expect. Now this is fine, because the drama in this film is incredible.  Great dialogue, deep characters, and pretty good acting is what makes it worth watching.  But here also inlies the movies main problem, vol 1 & 2 shouldn't be seperate films.  If you ask me, they should be combined into a 3 1/2 hour long epic.  While vol. 1 did pretty well on it's own as a stand alone movie, 2 doesn't.  The pacing is absolutely horrid and makes it kind of chop along from scene to scene.  I was actually frustrated by the end.

","Let's cut right to the chase: Kill Bill Vol. 2 effin' rocks so I suggest that you stop shooing the flies away from your greasy grand-pappy, get off of your ass and storm the local multiplex right now. This flick delivers the goods in spades and you won't find a more entertaining film out at the moment. So here come the spoilers, kiddies!<br/><br/>For those of you who may have missed the first film, the story involves the quest for vengeance by the Bride (Uma Thurman) against a group of international assassins - lead by the nefarious Bill (David Carradine) - who brutally murdered her entire wedding party yet failed to kill her knocked-up ass and ended up plunging her into a four-year coma. Upon waking, our heroine is understandably unamused by this turn of events and proceeds to get herself back into fighting shape, obtains a forged-by-a-master samurai sword that makes weapons aficionados go weak in the knees, and hands out bloody ass-whuppings like they were complementary after-dinner mints. During the course of the over-abundantly film-referenced bloodshed she dispatches two of the five scumbags who conspired to make her take the premature dirt nap (namely Viveca A. Fox and Lucy Liu) along with a small sword-wielding army of yakuza cannon fodder, and does this without much benefit from a plot - but what the hey; when you have such a surplus of bloodshed and action, to say nothing of appearances by beloved grindhouse stars from days gone by, you're bound to make all of the old-school exploitation/martial arts film junkies happy anyway. At the end of the first installment, the audience is let in on a vital piece of information that our blonde warrior doesn't have: her presumed-dead daughter is still alive.<br/><br/>When Vol. 2 starts off, the Bride is en route to stuff her trusty sword where the sun don't shine in Bill's alcoholic redneck loser of a brother, Budd (Michael Madsen), make monocular blonde bombshell Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) deader than Steven Seagal's career, and settle Bill's evil hash once and for all. Yet in a surprising turn of events, whereas one might have been lead to believe that this half of the film would be nothing more than another, non-stop stream of beheadings, limb-removals and whatnot, Quentin Tarantino returns to form not seen since the criminally-underrated Jackie Brown and provides us with a seriously character-driven story full of fascinating looks into the heads of the remaining players. To reveal more of the plot would be as criminal as Bill himself, so I'll leave you with a few thoughts:<br/><br/>-Uma Thurman's performance intensifies with each encounter, and the final half hour is enough to test even a badass like the Bride (who is finally called by name).<br/><br/>-Old-school Shaw Brothers kung fu movie addicts will be happier than Liza Minelli at singles night at the Stage Door Canteen when they witness `The Cruel Tutelage of Pai Mei.' I herewith beg Quentin to expand on his use of the legendary character of Pai Mei in a future film since Gordon Liu completely steals this sequence NOTE: if you are unfamiliar with Liu's impressive body of work in Shaw Brothers kung fu epics of the seventies and eighties allow me to recommend Shaolin Master Killer, Shaolin Challenges Ninja and The Pole Fighters. Winners all, and not hard to find at rental stores, although you may want to look them up on the IMDB since they go by a number of titles.<br/><br/>-Fair warning: claustrophobics beware!<br/><br/>-The battle between the Bride and Elle Driver (Darryl Hannah) is the most violent, jaw-droppingly ass-kicking throwdown I've seen in a long time and instantly joins the ranks of the best cat-fights in film history; it had an audience full of hardened New York City exploitation movie veterans jumping out of their seats, cringing from blows that you practically feel and shouting out every shocked expletive known to man.<br/><br/>-Bill may be a murdering son of a bitch, but he has his reasons for what he did to the Bride.<br/><br/>-Stay through the end credits for a little behind-the-scenes fun.<br/><br/>Whereas the first Kill Bill was Tarantino shamelessly shoving his world-class film geekery down our throats and basically indulging in what amounted to a cavalcade of directorial masturbation, Vol. 2 is a lot more sure of itself and stands as a solid piece of storytelling. The fact that Miramax saw fit to halve the film is proof that there are still occasional examples of sound thinking from a major film studio; if released as a whole work, Kill Bill would have clocked in at close to four-and-a-half hours and been examined to death with a probable diagnosis as a schizophrenic piece, unsure of whether it wanted to be a mindlessly violent thrill ride or a well-written action film with a lot more surprising depth than one would expect. Few directors can make such a lengthy film work, and Tarantino sure as hell is not Kurosawa, so as two volumes it works quite well, with Vol. 1 being the full-length setup and Vol. 2 serving as the extremely satisfying payoff to the origin of a character who may go on to become one of the defining female heroes in cinema. Well done, Q.T., and though the two films may be the most blatant love letter to a favorite leading lady (and her feet) ever released, your love for Uma sure as hell ain't sappy. Let's see what you've got for us next, you crescent-moon-faced lunatic!"

","I would give this film a 7.5 out of 10, Tarantino has done a great job of volume 2 it's better than the first. There's a good balance of action, comedy and love, the action is much more believable than the first. The love is not too cheesy, and the fight scenes you can't help but laugh and shout ouch!!<br/><br/>We learn the truth about the Bride, how she became so deadly, how she trained under Bill's Master Pai Mei (typical 70's kung fu grand master), I'd say is my favourite part of the film.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman shows great acting skills, from fear, sadness joy and just being plain normal. One scene where it seems our heroine has finally met her doom is particularly well acted out its pretty convincing. David Carradine character Bill you almost feel sorry for, I quite liked the guy especially for the ending.<br/><br/>Only two things I didn't like about the film, once she gets to Bill the movie does drag on a little, I think Tarantino saw this because he adds in a few surprises should u begin to fall asleep with all the talk. Samuel L Jackson's appearance is a black and white scene as the organ player for the wedding rehearsal, the room is quite dark and being black it is hard to see him, but saying that Tarantino doesn't concentrate much of Jackson's face during his conversations.<br/><br/>Funniest scene for me was Budd's calendar scene and Pai Mei laughter whilst beard stroking; think you'll like it too.<br/><br/>PS saw it yesterday as my brother works for a cinema company."

Vol. 1 was my favorite film of 2003, and I think that Vol. 2 compliments that film beautifully, while having the substance to be a stand-alone film.  The various forms of cinematography that Tarantino employs are just as fun and stunning as Vol. 1, but this time we have a fantastic and hilarious homage to kung fu films of the seventies during The Bride's flashback to her training with Pai Mei, her master.  The cinematography/photography was straight from the old Shaw Bros. films, and the slightest details show that QT is a huge fan, and knows some of the audience may be as well.  <br/><br/>I can't say I was less entertained during this film as I was during the first, but I was entertained in a different manner.  The non-stop action is not here, and the gore is significantly lowered, but the story is excellent and has a heart.  Uma Thurman is once again absolutely radiant in this role  the role of The Bride was written for her and partly by her, and she is incredible.  I've never been a fan of hers personally, but I really admired her work in this film.  <br/><br/>I gave Kill Bill Vol. 1 a `10' rating on IMDB, and I would give Vol. 2 a `9'.  And together, I would give them a 10.  This was QT's opus, and I'll deal with not having a movie from him for several years if this is the material he will be putting out.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

I also don't think that the way he died at all made sense to the rest of the movie and I found the manner of death and the fact that he died extraneous.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman is a bad ass as usual but her best scene was the scene where she rips out Elle's other eye and steps on it.  That scene *RULED* but the fact that you don't know what happens to her ultimately bothers me.  I did like the credits with the cross-out motif.  That was creative.<br/><br/>I think that David Carradine, the actor that played Bill, the title character, was boring.  I was expecting someone more interesting to play that character.  Someone more bad ass like Clint Eastwood or something.  I think his death was ironically non-violent and I liked it, it was appropriate.<br/><br/>
I rated this movie a 10 because I found it highly entertaining and compared to most other movies that've come out lately, it ROCKED."

","My summary says it all, the sequel to Kill Bill Vol 1 packs in more plot for the sake of the huge battles of the first one. Not to say there aren't great fight scenes in this one, but none are quite as enormous as the Crazy 88 fight. However that was what was holding back Kill Bill from being a real ""epic"" and just kept it in the realm of being a ""really awesome action flick,"" a lack of any plot or backstory or even real character development(except for O-Ren), however this picks it up and goes into tons of backstory and develops all the main characters to some extent. I feel that, while many may be disappointed at the lessening of action, many more will enjoy the fact that this is what makes Kill Bill a true epic, plot where it was needed."

","As the last chapter of The Bride's bloodthirsty saga concludes with the inevitable fade to black, Quentin Tarantino completes what is arguably the most beautiful and compelling work of his entire career thus far.  With no holds barred and expectations high, Kill Bill Volume 2 was more than just an added continuation of Volume 1.  It was something else entirely.<br/><br/>Sheathing her sword for the final act, we find The Bride (Uma Thurman) nearing the end of her ""roaring rampage of revenge""... taken from the beginning of the 'Two Pines Massacre' right into Bill's own back yard.  The intensity never let's up as we follow The Bride from the bottom of an empty grave to the hill tops of China, carrying the audience with her each and every exhilarating step of the way.  <br/><br/>Most will agree that Volume 2 is a far cry from Volume 1, given that it has an emotional depth and greater development of characters that the first is supposedly lacking.  The action, of course, is toned down to accommodate these changes in plot and storyline, which perhaps is the biggest difference between both Volume 1 and 2. But be that as it may, each film is as significant to the story as the other is.  Volume 1 and Volume 2 are separate parts of a perfect whole, much like the yin and yang.  As fantastic as they are when standing alone, the true beauty of 'Kill Bill' is in the combination of the two movies together.<br/><br/>The same can be said of Quentin and Uma.  <br/><br/>Tarantino and Thurman have a chemistry that is the equivalent of peanut butter and chocolate.  Though pleasing enough to the tastes when taken separately, they are at their most enjoyable when meshed together.  Uma portrays The Bride with a passion and emotional intensity that I never believed her capable of, which shows that Tarantino definitely has a way of bringing out the best in her.    <br/><br/>To say that the supporting performances are nothing short of excellent is an understatement.  David Carradine turns a terrific performance as Bill, (and more than justifies why he replaced Warren Beatty) while Michael Madsen and Darryl Hannah make each and every scene they're in stand out from the crowd. But it's Thurman who carries this movie to it's absolute excellence, proving that her lone place at top billing is 100% deserved.<br/><br/>With spectacular cinematography and Tarantino's usual blend of classic dialogue, 'Kill Bill Volume 2' is a must see for everyone by virtue of the fact that it's quite simply a great movie.  To appreciate it to it's fullest extent; however... I'd suggest taking a peek at Volume 1, because this is Tarantino at his absolute best.<br/><br/>Gets the clowns_n_cookies 10 out of 10.

","You may already have heard that ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" is talkier and more character-driven than the stylish, enigmatic ""Vol. 1"". Indeed, ""Vol. 2"" has moments of tenderness and heartbreak that its predecessor never came close to. We also learn more about the Bride (Uma Thurman), including her real name and her relationship with Bill (David Carradine), who makes his first on screen appearance. But while ""Vol. 2"" is not the gleeful blood flood that the first installment was, the action remains sharply paced, darkly comic, and consistently surprising.<br/><br/>The rogue's gallery of villains left standing when the lights came up on ""Vol. 1"" are appropriately fiendish here. Daryl Hannah gives Elle Driver's one eye a furious workout while Michael Madsen shines as the grinning, twisted cowboy Budd. Budd's attempt to dispose of the Bride is truly fraught with terror. Perhaps most importantly, Carradine does not disappoint as Bill, who proves that emotional ties can be more formidable than an army of Crazy 88s.<br/><br/>As for the Bride herself, Thurman's performance is unforgettable. The Bride's heroic stature grows with each frame, particularly when we see her struggle under the tutelage of the unrelenting Pai Mei (a terrific Gordon Liu) in flashback sequences.<br/><br/>Writer-director Quentin Tarantino delivers another gorgeous, wild ""Kill Bill"" movie, this one packing a fiercer emotional punch. Here is a movie that pulls the rug out from under its audience at every turn, never settling for less than brilliant. ""Kill Bill Vol.2"" is a wholly satisfying conclusion, a breathtaking new classic."

","After reading some of the strange reviews on this movie that've already come down, I'd have to discredit some of them, namely the person who called it a ""Violent Mess"" without knowing half the story. I wonder what they'd think of the first half. <br/><br/>When seeing this in the theater, you've got to remember this was originally slated, and is very much one full movie. If you put it into this context, you'll be able to follow everything much easier, as well as understand why the first was so violence driven, and the second half so much more over-the-top story driven. These are two very different halves, and in that sense, it makes for one great four to five hour film, but two very strange parts. <br/><br/>Though the first half hour seemed a little as if it was dragging, the dialogue and word play is definitive Tarantino.

","i was lucky enough to see a pre-release two days before opening night.<br/><br/>quentin tarantino is a hollywood phenomenon.  the amount of success he's had for the small quantity of work he has done draws suspicion of selling his soul to satan. as a virtual unknown he's butted heads with giant oliver stone (for butchering his screenplay to natural born killers, of which he had his name removed from), caused a frenzy with his directorial debut resivoir dogs (which was brilliantly ripped off from ringo lam's city on fire), and was hailed as a god with his sophmore effort pulp fiction - which made bruce willis and john travolta cool again, made neil diamond sound sexy, and had the mouths of america watering for a big kahuna burger.  his third release, jackie brown, was a masterpiece in terms of bringing it's charachters to life, but was almost too mature for it's own good, but not enough to make us lose our anticipation for #4- KILL BILL. KILL BILL is a simple tale of revenge.  a nameless bride who was once a deadly assassian leaves her organization to get married and have a baby, but the whole wedding party gets slaughtered, the bride gets a bullet through the noggin, but miraculously survives through a 4 year coma, wakes up, and wants to kill the man responsible- bill.  that is the plot in it's entirety... but in KILL BILL story is second,  style is everything, and this movie oozes style. KILL BILL is a tribute to the grindhouse films of the 1970's (for all you youngn's out there, grindhouse is a term for the theatres that played all of the low-budget action, B-movies(what they used to call independant films), exploitation films, kung-fu films, and samurai films in the days before the invention of the video-cassette) and is chock full of swordfights, fake blood, campy dialogue, cool cars, and evil villans.  tarantino even goes as far as using 70's cult legends like sonny chiba (the guy from the street fighter movies), gordon liu (the guy who plays the abbot in just about every kung-fu flick that has shaolin in it's title), and yuen wo ping (the dude who directed fist of legend).  there are no special effects that couldn't have been done in the 1970's, but the cinematography, direction, editing, and action choreography are exquisitely cutting edge. KILL BILL was never intended to be split into two volumes.  it was written and filmed as one long movie, but near it's completion the studio, being greedy, wanted it cut into two parts.  seeing as how this was a 4-hour long film told through individual, out-of-sequence chapters, a split was not unrealistic.  parts 1 and 2 were originally suppossed to be released 2 weeks apart, as tarantino wanted both in the same theatre at the same time, but again the studio changed that so part 2 would coincide with the dvd release of part 1- after all, if both films were released simotaniously, the public would expect 1 dvd with both parts- this way we'll have to buy part 1, then part 2, then the deluxe box set with both parts and a collector's pin. i'm assuming all of you have seen vol1 already.  if you havn't, then treat yourself to one of the modern masterpieces of american cinematography.  if you have, then going to see vol2 is a no-brainer, because you've only seen half a film.  vol2 is evry bit as good as vol1, though it is definitely different.  there are no over-the-top gorefests like with the crazy 88's, the action is much more subtle, but every bit as memorable.  the story really unfolds in vol2, and you learn everything you've ever wanted to know about bill, the DVAS, black mamba's real name, and why she was getting married to someone else while she was carrying bill's baby.  this film is a true work of art and should be cherished as such.  watching KILL BILL made me feel both privledged and enlightened.  tarantino struck gold by recycling his love for low-budget movies and reminding us what the art of filmmaking is all about- entertainment. america's greatest asset."

","I saw Kill Bill Vol 2 in a free screening and I don't believe it compares favorably with the first film.  Undoubtedly, you will envision a much different film before seeing it.  First off, there are long stretches of dialogue with ""uncomfortable silences"" that signify things in the end but while viewing them become tedious.  The famous ""death list"" does not make it on the screen and much is made of Bill's relationship with the Bride.  A great part of the first film is the story of O-Ren Ishii told through animation which gives you an understanding of the character. Unfortunately, no information is given about the other assassins except what they are doing now.  You hardly care about Michael Madsen or Daryl Hannah because you know very little about them, almost as if they are villains from central casting. The film goes on too long and you will be surprised to know that 75 minutes in, almost nothing has occurred.  In Vol 1, Bill is envisioned as a darker, shadowy figure, where in the second, he is almost playful and tends to wax poetic too often.  Uma Thurman carries the film and brings it all together, but it is hard to carry off with little support from the other actors. When the credits rolled and the characters are shown in snippets of film, the best response easily goes to those from the first film.  Also, the music which is usually memorable from Tarantino films is indistinguished.  It was, however, a good idea to break these into two films as they are completely different.  If you were to watch it all together, the buzz from the first film would definitely wear off during the second half.  Review: 6 out of 10"
"DannyBoy-17","Null","0","1","19 April 2004"," Having something to say
","In trying to figure out why Kill Bill Volume 2 lacked the punch of Volume 1, I am left with two possibilities: either, I am a bloodthirsty action-movie addict unsatisfied by the relative lack of limbs, or Tarantino's dialogue did not live up to my expectations. Fortunately, on Saturday night, I recalled the prophetic words of Ms. Mia Wallace who basically asked Vincent Vega one night at Jackrabbit Slims, ""Why do people feel the need to fill uncomfortable silence with B.S.?""  She then became quite lively when it turned out that Vincent actually had something on his mind, and it turned into a fun conversation.  From what I've seen in this movie, Mia Wallace would have walked out on a date with Bill. Here, the majority of the conversations are rather unnecessary.  From Budd and Elle discussing ""Which one are you filled with"" to Bill's long-winded discussions of life and death and superhero mythology, there is a sense of aimlessness to the monologues.  Compare ""Ezekiel 25:17,"" or Tim Roth's set-up to introduce himself to the gang in ""Reservoir Dogs.""  Bill is blowing hot air compared to any one of them.  (O-Ren Ishii came close to getting somewhere with her warning to the Yakuza.)     I seem to be in the minority opinion here, though about the quality of conversation.  Frankly, I preferred the silent treatment that O-Ren Ishii gave The Bride to Bill's death-by-monologue style.  Dialogue should be led by intention: Bill's questioning towards the end of the film seems to have absolutely no bearing on his ultimate wish to see The Bride dead.  So, it seems to be filler material.  By the way, (SPOILER) if there's anything to address in dialogue, why not address that The Bride's about to kill her daughter's father?  And why doesn't it bother the kid that Daddy's gone, after he's the only one she's seen for years? I suppose it was the climax of the film that disappointed me most: maybe it's just that the Tokyo showdown was so much more elegant and over-the-top that it feels like it should have ended the film rather than (SPOILER) a sitdown bit of swordplay in a backyard. In terms of cinematography and music, the film is also not quite up to the level that Kill Bill Volume 1 scored (b&w sequences, Zamfir music, anime, shadow swordfights.)  Fortunately, the Pai Mei sequence harkened back to the cinematic style that was all over Volume 1.  Ultimately, Kill Bill Volume 2 is an inferior but still worthwhile product.  The showdown with the Crazy 88 and O-Ren Ishii will be Kill Bill's image in popular memory for years to come.  VOLUME 1: ****.  VOLUME 2:***."

I was careful to watch KB Vol 1 on DVD three times (with subtitles to catch every word) prior watching KB Vol 2.  Like others that commented, I thought KB Vol 2 was slow off the start, which is not to imply err, when the ending is pulled together so tightly and so satisfyingly as it was.  I was simply euphoric by the movie's end and felt that way through the rest of the night, pondering and tingling from the satisfaction that the movie delivered.<br/><br/>In my view, the bloody fun that was KB Vol 1 is an 8, the satisfaction of KB Vol 2 is a 9 ... but as one movie, KB Vol 1-2 is a 10.<br/><br/>The Bride, Uma:  I bow humbly.

It's a familiar story--one that most all of us can relate to--only Bill and the Bride take it to the extreme ... Bill for his jealousy, the Bride for her revenge.  Finally, I thought the Bride's pleas of ""Thank-you"" at the end of the movie is a very moving moment--telling that there was a higher power that got her to the place she was and she knew it.  Her narrative in Vol 1 even mentions ""God justifies her revenge, even demands it"" (paraphrased). Pretty cool, eh?"
"BrianDanaCamp","Null","0","1","14 April 2004"," I loved VOL. 1, but I don't love VOL. 2...
","KILL BILL VOL. 2 is a very different film from VOL. 1. I don't consider it a continuation at all, but a completely separate film--in essence, ""The 5th Film by Quentin Tarantino."" In terms of characters, story structure, editing, film style, and even soundtrack choices, the two films are so completely unlike each other that I can't even imagine seeing them together. I simply can't see how VOL. 1 wouldn't be completely dragged down by VOL. 2. I honestly feel that those viewers who have not seen VOL. 1 and are not familiar with the various action genres that inspired Tarantino are in perhaps the best position to enjoy VOL. 2.<br/><br/>VOL. 2 is slower and more devoted to dialogue and character, a task made easier by the much smaller cast of characters (two major characters, four significant supporting ones). Which would be fine if the dialogue was clever or profound or had the black comic edge of the first film. Or if the characters were developed at all. I found the characters interesting (and wonderfully played by the cast) but I didn't learn enough about them. I never got drawn in or emotionally engaged the way I was with the first film. There's a lot of dialogue but not much information. We're asked to believe in a love story at the heart of it, between Bill and the Bride. I never bought it. So the emotional pay-off--when it came--meant nothing to me. I should have been in tears, but I didn't feel a thing. I felt cheated. If, as a viewer, you accept the love story then you'll have an easier time with this film than I did.<br/><br/>There isn't much action: two major fight scenes, neither of which is long enough; a kung fu training sequence; and one quick violent confrontation. The fight staging isn't nearly as clever or imaginative as it was in VOL. 1. The kung fu sequence--a flashback--belonged in VOL. 1. It's out of place here and is inserted smack dab in the middle of a suspenseful plot thread and so completely disrupts the rhythm of the piece that I was thrown off and never got back on track with the rest of the film.<br/><br/>If you're expecting the baroque cinematic flourishes of the first film, with its eye-catching color schemes, fluid tracking shots, spectacular action, diverse range of characters, anime sequence, and eclectic musical numbers, forget it. I didn't find anything comparable in VOL. 2, which is much more stripped down, with much of the action taking place in the desolate stretches around Barstow, California. The soundtrack consists almost entirely of snatches of Italian western music (mostly by Ennio Morricone) and Mexican-style numbers put together by Robert Rodriguez. While the musical choices on VOL. 1's soundtrack were consistently inspired, these seem kind of arbitrary and never adequately blend with the images.<br/><br/>
I was deeply disappointed by this film. I intend to see it again, though, to try to get over my initial resistance and perhaps find a way to appreciate what Tarantino was trying to do here. As a fan of his for twelve years now, I owe him that much. But the euphoria I experienced at each of four big-screen viewings of VOL. 1 never re-surfaced during my much-anticipated viewing of VOL. 2."

When Jackie Brown came out, some were disappointed, but not me.  I saw the clever dialogue, the play with structure and storytelling as it was.  Tarantino made the film he wanted to make.<br/><br/>Then when I saw Kill Bill: Volume 1 back in September of last year, three weeks before it opened at an advanced screening that I trekked all the way out of Secaucus, NJ to see, I was in awe for the entire film.  With Tarantino's highly stylized homage to Japanese Kung-fu films and Japanimation, Robert Richardson's amazing crisp cinematography, Sally Menke's skillful editing, and RZA's catchy score, Kill Bill: Volume 1 went on to be nominated for 11 Fidelio Film Awards, winning 6.<br/><br/>
Were expectations quite high for Kill Bill: Volume 2?  Of course they were. Were expectations high for Volume 1?  Probably even more so and they were met.  Unfortunately, Volume 2 misses a few beats in Tarantino's homage to the Sergio Leone western as he tries to merge both the western with Chinese martial arts films.<br/><br/>Volume 2 almost feels like The Matrix Revolutions compared to the first two. Volume 2 is different in tone, and lacks the style and action scenes of the first one.  And while the story is still interesting, I'm not quite sure the structure works as well as in the first one.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS BELOW**<br/><br/>Bill's fight scene with Michael Jai White as Alburt (Da Moe) was deleted. This is a scene which apparently would have shown Bill's kung-fu talent, and was needed.  As it stands now, Bill is just a legend.  We see him, but we don't see the tyrant that everyone describes.  We only know him through what he did to the Bride.  We needed to see him in action, to see how deadly he was and why he was so dreaded.  We got to see O-Ren in action, as well as Vernita Green and Elle Driver.  The only other one we didn't is Budd, but the point is he's a burnt out swordsman, who quit the business.  Bill is supposed to be as deadly as ever.<br/><br/>The whole film was like an anti-climax.  It worked in Pulp Fiction, in the diner scene at the end because it fit the style of the movie.  In Volume 1, it all led up to the House of Blue Leaves Showdown.  That was the climax. Here, we really don't get one, and this should be the ultimate one. Instead, Tarantino goes for a gimmick at the end.  And it was a predictable one at that.<br/><br/>The main problem with Volume 2 is that there is no consistent style or tone. Tarantino was trying to blend the Sergio Leone western with the Chinese martial arts fighting and because of this, there is no consistent style, like there was in Volume 1.<br/><br/>He makes fun of the old Jackie Chan like Chinese martial arts films throughout the Pei Mei scene, with the hazy old look and Pei Mei constantly stroking his beard.  And he pays homage to the Sergio Leone spaghetti western, specifically Once Upon a Time in the West. Bill plays a flute just as Harmonica (Charles Bronson), well, plays a harmonica in West, but it doesn't work as well as it did in West.  When we first meet Bill at the chapel, it's used to build tension in the scene and the problem is The Bride knows it's him, but we don't yet.  And this is another instance where structure doesn't work.<br/><br/>The thing that does work here, as the homage to the Leone western, is the maliciousness of Elle Driver, and her standoff with The Bride; in the standoff, Tarantino is able to build tension that Leone did so well.<br/><br/>Another thing that takes you out of the film is the scenes with the daughter that are overly sentimental, almost bordering on Kevin Smith Jersey Girl territory.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Tarantino's become a sell-out hack like Smith, it's just that something is off here, what he was trying to accomplish just doesn't work all the time.<br/><br/>There are still some good things though.  The Bride vs. Elle scene is great, especially the ending of that scene.  Some of the stuff with Pei Mei works, but then I thought it could have been more humorous.  There is another homage to Brian De Palma, specifically two scenes to Carrie:  Carrie's hand coming out of the grave at the end, and the close up of the blood-ridden Carrie.  I won't give away how they are used in the film, but they are there.<br/><br/>While Volume 2 isn't a terrible film by any means, this isn't the film that should have followed up the energy, style and charisma of Volume 1.  The clever Tarantino dialogue is supposed to hold this film together, and unfortunately, it falls short here.  Whether it's Bill making a Superman analogy to The Bride, or Budd getting reamed by his boss at the bar, it feels as though Tarantino rushed through writing the scenes; they are not as vibrant as in his previous scripts, or even in Volume 1.<br/><br/>
Tarantino has already said he's thinking about doing a Volume 3 where Nikki, Vernita Green's daughter, comes after The Bride for revenge.  He said he wants to make it in 15 years, but start filming part of it now while the actors are at this age.  Let's just hope he spends these 15 years making it as good as the first one."
"yak-yak","8","0","1","18 April 2004"," 8/10 New and improved! Contains only half the camp and all of the cinematic goodness of our regular Vol.1!
","Kill Bill Vol. 2 is just as good as Vol. 1, nay, better! That's very good indeed. The style is different, less camp, more cinema. Sometimes it's a bit slow, but QT seems to always work it around to the film's advantage. The dialog is pretty good, it contains some great stuff and some fumbles. If you saw Vol. 1 and you were not put off by the violence, then you'll have little problem with Vol. 2. Obviously, those who cannot tolerate depictions of violence, some foul language, and some ick should spend their valuable cinematic minutes elsewhere. Enjoy! It's a quality piece of work. 8/10"

","Here we are, rejoining The Bride's vengeful journey to take down all of her former colleagues who attempted to kill her at the wedding chapel in El Paso.  However, Kill Bill, Vol. 2 is a very different movie from Kill Bill, Vol. 1.  We are brought back into the story with The Bride (Uma Thurman) speaking directly to us as she is driving the final leg of her quest to Kill Bill, which she assures us is exactly what will happen when she gets there. Mr. Tarantino then takes us back to that fateful day at the wedding chapel that set all of this violence, vengeance and viciousness in motion.  We do not, however, re-live the actual massacre but, instead, are treated to a tense, frighteningly calm and also sweetly emotional exchange between The Bride and Bill before the other members of the Deadly Viper Assassin Squad stroll in and eliminate the entire wedding party.  This opening chapter and Tarantino's restraint show us one of the striking ways that this movie differs from the first Volume.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino has given us two very different movie-going experiences, yet they are very clearly telling different portions of the same story. Volume 1 gave us The Bride's initial sound and fury after waking from her coma, finding her baby lost and lighting out to exact her revenge on those responsible.  We were given a violent and over the top fight movie as she battles her way forward.  Volume 2 gives us the other side of Tarantino's storytelling.  This film is much more about emotion and character and dialogue.  One of the consistent elements that make Tarantino films more than just violent play toys is the dialogue that he writes.  Whether it is Steve Buscemi expounding on why he doesn't tip, John Travolta discussing the intimate nature of a foot massage, or Darryl Hannah discussing the abilities of a snake, Quentin always gives us dialogue that is fuller and contains more than a standard conversation would normally have and yet does not feel false or contrived.  It always fits naturally within the context of the scene and the characters.<br/><br/>Another of the elements that make Tarantino's films unique is the way that he films using different styles and formats within one film.  This not only pays homage to the styles of the past but also keeps the audience just a little off balance and thus the scenes have even more impact on nearly a subliminal level.  It makes you adjust and start paying attention again at each change, ensuring that each section of the film gets full attention. Not only does his filming style in this movie harken back to the Chinese Kung Fu movies of the past, but he also pays respect to them by having the fight scenes beautifully choreographed.  In Volume 2, he even keeps those scenes very short and intense, as opposed to the elaborate and lengthy fights that we witnessed in Volume 1.  In Vol. 2, the scenes are absolutely necessary but they are not central to the film.<br/><br/>Quentin has another hit on his hands and this time he should not have to suffer the critics that pull out their stock comments about too much violence, blood and foul language.  Hopefully, this time a reviewer or two will actually see the intricate film making, thoughtful dialogue and well developed characters that Quentin has created."

","*spoilers... ish*<br/><br/>sneak preview last night... and i'm all... huh? two completely different movies, and there is nothing grindhouse about volume two, i think KNB was only on set for a day in this one. decent drama, but this is a damn bloody kung fu tribute movie, not a lifetime movie, cut some more limbs off woman! this movie ends concieveably well, and realisticly, which is my biggest complaint, there is nothing over the top about it. however, the highly anticipated and much rumored superman monolouge is classic, and the even more highly anticipated and much rumored beach sequence got axed completely."
"jstu9","9","0","1","18 April 2004"," Another QT gem
","It took me a couple days to figure out where Vol 2 would rate in the Tarantino universe. I'd rate Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and both Kill Bill's as 10's on this site but... I would consider Kill Bill Vol 1 about the same in quality to Reservoir Dogs, whereas Vol 2 is similar to Pulp Fiction. Since I think Reservoir Dogs is better than Pulp Fiction, I then also think Vol 1 is better than Vol 2. But it is just fun to split hairs like this, since all 4 are great.<br/><br/>But Vol 2 is a splendid movie, completely different in style to Vol 1, but just as great. It was just one of those movies that I wished would never end. It is one of those few great movies where I didn't want each scene to end because it was so interesting and memorable.<br/><br/>It's just fun to see a director at the top of his game, and it is amazing how a director can make 5 movies (well 4 if you count Kill Bill as 1 movie) and have 4 of them be instant classics."
"Dr.Jolly","7","0","1","18 April 2004"," Good finish, should've been one movie
","While I've read that Tarantino had no intentions of breaking the movie into two at the start, I'm sure he's not too upset at the reward of being #1 in the box office twice for the same film.<br/><br/> The ending took where Volume 1 leaves off and runs with it. This film is not as action packed. Despite my love of Tarantino's work with dialogue, there are times when the talking seems to go on too long.<br/><br/>
 Nevertheless, excellent work from Thurman and Carradine. Daryl Hannah played a role I didn't think she had in her and Madsen delivers his typical performance. <br/><br/> This film is for Tarantino fans only. I fear those outside our group wont get it."
"Rick-34","Null","0","1","18 April 2004"," completion of Vol 1 is worth it
","I felt compelled to write something, as the comment on the main page at this moment is a negative review.  Now, I can understand negative reviews, but this reviewer preferred Vol. 1, and that's not a viewpoint I can understand.<br/><br/>In contrast to Vol. 1, Vol. 2 has a better storyline.  The characters are fleshed out a lot more, and the plot starts to make sense.  Important details missing from Vol. 1 appear and tie the entire story together. Whereas Vol. 1 got bogged down a bit in overlong sequences regarding O-Ren Ishii, the pacing in Vol. 2 is much better.  <br/><br/>Uma Thurman is really on the top of her game in the Kill Bill series.  She projects strength and intelligence that is often missing in female leads (I'm thinking, for example, of Kidman in Cold Mountain).  Michael Madsen, David Carradine, and Gordon Liu are terrific, and Darryl Hannah is simply dastardly.   Samuel L. Jackson has a cameo that is very difficult to spot! The action and dialogue are both terrific, as we've come to expect from a Tarantino movie.  A mixture of cinematographic techniques keeps the viewer on edge, and the background music harkens back to the tradition of melodramatic '70s TV (esp. the ""Ironsides"" music).  <br/><br/>On the whole, a very enjoyable film."

","(Contains Spoilers) Well, after waiting first till February, then March, and now mid-April to finally see how this revenge fantasy plays out, I finally saw it last night, and guess what? This blows away Vol 1. for me. The characters are more fleshed out, we finally understand the Bride (and Bill's) motives for revenge, and believe it or not, Tarantino ultimately delivers a love story (albeit a sick, twisted and massively dysfunctional one.) Michael Madsen was amazingly sympathetic as Budd, an ""alkie loser"" you feel sorry for because he realizes he deserves whatever he gets. I loved Daryl Hannah's evil Elle. I haven't liked her in a movie like this since, well, ever. The fight scenes are sparser than in Vol 1, but the Budd/Elle/Bride showdown is definitely worth the wait. (Don't open the suitcase!) Again, Tarantino pulls out his bag of cinema tricks- we get scenes with rear projection, shot in b/w, grainy color stock for the kung fu scenes, credit fonts from the thirties, etc. The final showdown is surprisingly brief, but still satisfying. Uma Thurman has never been lovelier, and the movie holds up well on its own as a separate piece from Vol. 1- amazing. This and the Dawn of the Dead remake are my favorites so far for 2004, but it's hard to see how anything could surpass this. 10/10."
"jotix100","10","0","1","18 April 2004"," Don't mess around with The Bride
","Quentin Tarantino's conclusion of the ""Kill Bill"" films is nothing short of brilliant. He makes it clear he is a master of this genre. In fact, this new film can stand on its own, as far as the story goes. It makes perfect sense in more ways than the first installment where there was more action, but perhaps the narrative is not as clear as in this one.<br/><br/>Mr. Tarantino is greatly helped by his choice of Uma Thurman to play his heroine. As with the other film, Ms Thurman demonstrates she is up to the task of battling whatever enemies who dare come her way.<br/><br/>The casting is excellent. David Carradine, Michael Parks, Michael Madsen, Darryl Hannah, Bo Svenson, Gordon Liu, and the rest of the crew play well under the guidance of Quentin Tarantino. <br/><br/>A satisfying time at the movies."
"archangelH8","10","0","1","18 April 2004"," As a whole, one of the best films I've witnessed
","After viewing Kill Bill: Vol. 2 this weekend, I've come to the strong conclusion that I need Quentin to release a special dvd edition as soon as possible with both films together as one.  The sooner the better because this film, Kill Bill, as a whole blows me away and I cannot wait for its release.  Volume 2 was just as good, maybe even better than the first, with its strong dialogue and flawless performances by Gordon Liu, Uma Thurman, and David Carradine.  Carradine truly delivers a great performance as Bill, no longer the evil man behind the sword but an actual sympathetic character. Granted, he ""overreacted"" but we finally get a chance to see who he was and the whole background to the Bride and Bill.  Overall, this film gives well needed closure to Uma Thurman's character and thus ends a great Tarantino tale."

","Greetings again from the darkness.  The most descriptive word I can come up with for Vol. 2 is DELICIOUS!  Although I am a big fan of Vol. 1, this one is far superior, stands on its own, and is mad creativity onscreen.  Vol. 2 provides us with much of the background and history of our key players, including their acceptance (or not) of spirituality.  What a pleasure to see David Carradine given such a wonderful role ... an evil role that reminds of his ""kung Fu"" days (with flute) - only this is Caine's gleefully monsterous twin brother!  Michael Madsen and Darryl Hannah offer nice supporting work and some very welcome humor.  The fight scene with Hannah and Uma in the trailer is incredible, given the limited space with which to work.  I would like to say that this scene proved the most claustrophobic for me, but it is not even close!  Despite the wonderful cast of characters, this is Uma's film all the way.  She delivers like no other female action star ever has. Humble, personal, beautiful and vicious.  Her physicality is remarkable and enthralling to watch.  Tarantino delivers again.  His creativity and love of film is beyond question.  I take this as much more of a tribute to the old chop-socky movies than a spoof.  He is the master at interjecting humor just when the audience needs it.  The use of music is pure genius and helps create this terrific masterpiece.  Thanks QT for casting Michael Parks in 2 roles - the sheriff in Vol. 1 and the old man at the whore house in Vol. 2. Nothing to say but tremendous filmmaking and a joy to watch."

","ahh,kill bill 2,what can you say about such a ""masterpiece"" In my comment about the first volume,I said that it was reminiscent of an Ed Wood jr. film. which true film connoisseurs can explain to you that his movies were so bad that they went full circle and returned to the opposite side of the good rating.but sadly comparing this movie to a Ed Wood jr.classic would be and injustice to the late Ed Wood jr. himself.Image if you were to watch every bad film ever made,summarize it down into two 2 hour volumes,add cliches,bad,old and hasbeen actors and actresses,terrible direction,cheesey dialog,poor script,throw in some bad chop-socky from kung fu films of the 70's,gratuitous violence and blood for todays culture stricken youth and you have this monsterpiece kill bill. 1/10"
"Deckard-16","Null","0","1","17 April 2004"," Buzzkill
","This is the 1st big dissappointment of the year. #1: I am not a Tarantino fan (I hated Pulp Fiction, but loved Resevoir Dogs)and #2 KBV1 was probably my favorite movie of '03 (although 21 Grams and Spellbound were really excellent too). What happened? This film is pretentious (whereas V1 was fun and was a MOVIE and not a FILM). This film is a western (whereas V1 was a kung fu movie). This film has a lot to say and little of it is very interesting (whereas V1 had very little to say and most of it was interesting). Much talk, little action. This film is being praised for not being drenched in blood, but it is much uglier (just one turn of a hooker's face or a few closeups of a striking snake will be enough to sell you on that). The red excess in V1 was a marvel to behold. It was Wile E. Coyote violence choreographed to its breezy extreme. The violence in V2 is not fun. And if you are claustrophobic (like me) AVOID this film (Q succeeds all too well in this category in one extended scene -- I couldn't watch it).. The good stuff: David Carradine almost steals this film from Uma (who owned the V1). Darryl Hannah is (like the V1) is fun to watch. Robert Richardson's photography is incredible (like V1). The scenes between Uma and Carradine are intense. Other than that the more I think about about this film the more I dislike it. What a buzzkill."

","Where the first was over-the-top with the humor and gore, the second is more somber in tone, the emphasis on dialogue and character building. I really enjoyed it.  I disliked the first one.  <br/><br/>There's much much less action in this film, but what there is is quite intense.   He really hits for the fences with different techniques. One that caught my eye was his use of different film stocks.  I enjoyed it and would recommend it. <br/><br/>This is more like a Tarrantino movie than Vol. 1, although the dialogue was better in the movies where Roger Avary was his writing partner, but still there are plenty of gems here to be heard. 9/10."
"jwworth","Null","0","1","11 April 2004"," 'Bill' thrills with stunning finale
","The relentlessly action-driven elements of Kill Bill: Volume One may have drawn some amount of disapproval from viewing audiences, but Volume Two returns to balance the artistic and stylistic elements of Volume One while keeping the thrill level high.<br/><br/>The comic-book style plot remains, this time stylistically shifting from a Kung Fu approach with a hint of Spaghetti westernism to the other way around.  From the first moments of the film, however, it becomes clear that this half of the story is much more concerned with the finer points of The Bride's quest for revenge, highlighting more details of her psychological and physical struggle overall rather than concentrating on the fact that the only way she can progress is to leave hundreds of dead bodies in her wake.<br/><br/>The famous slaughterfest of Volume One may be over, but don't expect not to be on the edge of your seat.  Tarantino is up to his old tricks as well as ever, for example, switching the order of the plot presentation to enhance the drama (the incredible tension in the first sequence is created based on the fact that the viewer already knows the outcome, but has not met all of the characters involved or even seen the outcome itself unfold - indeed an impressive storytelling feat).  It is easy to imagine many of the predicaments The Bride finds herself in to be treated poorly by other directors - they are sometimes predictable and even a little cliche, but Tarantino's incredible style makes for a completely fresh and powerful viewpoint that makes these plot elements seem all but bran new.  I saw this movie at a special screening on a university campus, and rest assured that there was no shortage of intense audience participation through the entire film, complete with outbreaks of laughter, shouting and cheering.<br/><br/>Tarantino's ever-present element in Volume Two makes him seem as much a screen star of the feature as the actors.  The direction itself is expertly executed, with incredible performances elicited from all the principals. Uma Thurman (The Bride) and David Carradine (Bill) are the most memorable, and when they are on screen together there is an unlikely chemistry created which is almost more powerful than either of them inividually.<br/><br/>As a standalone film, Volume Two is better than Volume One.  It has a clearer sense of direction, more crystallized and lucid development, and, of course, it has the advantage of being able to provide a conclusion (an element by necessity lacking in Volume One).  For this particular reason, I have to say it is almost unfair to judge either film individually, especially now when most of the entire moviegoing world is waiting to see how the saga ends.  I saw Volume Two screened directly following Volume One in the same session, and I would deem this the ideal viewing situation.<br/><br/>Overall, Kill Bill gets very good marks, and comes highly recommended from this reviewer.  Anyone at all who enjoys a good thrill will not be disappointed from the latest release from one of the premier contemporary American directors."
"numbersix_99","6","0","1","7 April 2004"," Finally, she will kill bill
","I had the honour of seeing an advanced screening of this wonderful movie. However, at this stage I confess I prefer part one a little more.<br/><br/>Part two is different, quite different. It slows down a lot, it hangs on the characters. A great idea in theory, but not in delivery. Tarantino seems a little too much in love with himself and his characters, so he lingers on them a fraction too long for comfort. when the actions comes (the Elle Driver fight scene), boy does it come.<br/><br/>Those expecting more of what volume one promised may be disappointed, and most will find the dialogue a little nerdy and uninteresting, but nevertheless it's a very strong movie, and without doubt worth repeated viewings."
"mcnooj82","Null","0","1","5 April 2004"," Bloody Satisfaction!
","She roared...<br/><br/>And she rampaged...<br/><br/>I got bloody satisfaction, and Uma Thurman is now the coolest woman of our time!<br/><br/>KILL BILL Vol.2 was the film that I had been most excited about for 2004. Either that, or I just can't remember what else comes out this year. Let's see... Spider-man 2, Troy, Collateral, and Garfield... Nope! With the disappointing The Passion of the Christ more than a month past, Quentin Tarantino's 5th film (though that label is easily debatable...) was numero uno on my 'To Watch' List of 2004.<br/><br/>Because as many flaws I felt KILL BILL Vol.1 had, I loved it. It was by no means my favorite film of 2003 (the obvious choice being The Return of the King), but I had a great time. Cool actors having fun, so many great moments, unforgettable music (I bought the soundtrack before it came out), and a brilliant feeling of Asian pastiche I'd never felt in a Hollywood production before.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the first and have managed to stay away from an early draft of the screenplay that has been online for a while and want to go in fresh, here is what I think of Vol. 2 in a nutshell :<br/><br/>Upon immediate viewing, I can tell you with no ego that Vol.2 works better as a full film than Vol.1 did. If you should encounter God and show him this film, God will say, ""Cool!"", because this film is better paced, better acted, and more satisfying (which it should, since it has the advantage of concluding the story). For its lack of on-screen violence compared to the Grindhouse Gore of the first, it is much more affecting and personal a violence that makes you squirm and gasp instead of smirk and laugh. (There are still some audience pleasing moments of gore though... one in particular featuring an eyeball!)<br/><br/>You won't see Sonny Chiba as Hattori Hanzo again this time, which is a shame, but you will get Gordon Liu come back as the cruel Pai Mei and he is a great substitute. The Bride's training sequence with him will be the favorite sequence of many people.<br/><br/>While Vol.1 leaned more towards the Asian influences with the fine anime sequence, the House of Blue Leaves sequence, and the presence of Hattori Hanzo, Vol.2 is almost pure spaghetti western in tone. The way the showdown between Elle Driver and The Bride is edited and scored got my heart thumping and actually made me shout in delight, which I don't think I'd ever done before.<br/><br/>Those who love Tarantino's Asian film references, take heart. In no way has he abandoned the Hattori Hanzo swords. And of course you have The Cruel Tutelage of Pai Mei, possibly the greatest chapter in Vol.2 for Gordon Liu and the many, many Shaw Bros Smash Zooms alone.<br/><br/>Tarantino's choice in music for the film continues to be perfect as I will most definately purchase the soundtrack for Vol.2.<br/><br/>And the final bit I have to go into for the moment is why I think Uma Thurman is now the coolest woman alive for the way she brings The Bride to life. I can't help but think that the role Q&U have brought to the screen is the greatest female role I have yet to see (of course, this says something about the roles available to women, but it's not about that). She was cool in Vol.1, but in Vol.2, she takes what she did before and continues to amp it up in all respects. It makes me think about Sigourney Weaver's role in James Cameron's Aliens, except not as constant because of all the genres KILL BILL emcompasses. And since Weaver received an Oscar nod for that role, I'd really love to see Thurman get nominated for Vol.2. Deadly and vulnurable.<br/><br/>I hope this gets you interested in Vol.2 if you didn't care for Vol.1. This time, there is less campiness and action and more dialogue and characterization.<br/><br/>For those who loved Vol.1 because of the campy action, don't worry. What campiness and action is there is still funny and exciting. I had a genuine feeling of, ""Oh no! How's she gonna get out of this mess!?"" which is a hard thing to do in Hollywood these days.<br/><br/>PS: I know some people may not believe that I actually saw the film and could think that I am merely a QT fanboy who read the online script as anyone could and started gushing BS about something I knew nothing about.<br/><br/>I guess the only thing I can use to convince you is to tell you to stay after the end credits to see a little blooper/easter egg (unless it's been subsequently deleted). If you want to know, it is Uma Thurman poking an eye out of one of the Crazy 88s but ending up with only fake blood on her fingers. I think someone yells CUT! to which she says, ""Oh, come on!""<br/><br/>
I was kidding about Garfield, by the way."
