"MR_Heraclius","7","44","48","23 February 2020"," Good
","It may be unfair to say, but its easily admitted that the most interesting ploy this film can rely on was the media storm surrounding ""THE affair"" that led to ""THE Hollywood couple to be"" Brangelina. As a matter of fact, the film is actually rather good and the playful yet genuine chemistry berween Pitt and Jolie excuses the ludicrous plot and reliance on marketing gimmicks. The film really isn't a serious one, but it is a sexy one."

","This is a very funny movie. Brad Pitt is excellent as the frustrated Spy/Husband. Angelina Jolie is as beautiful as she can be and plays the role wonderfully. All very tongue in cheek and enjoyable to watch."
"carljessieson","9","91","124","6 September 2010"," Entertaining as Hell!
","This is a daaaamn fun movie! Heh. To all the critics, yes, there are a lot of explosions, gunfire, unrealistic battles, plenty of times where you think ""they MUST have been hit by a bullet by now..there is noo effin way..."", and over-dramatized violence, but there's plenty of good stuff too that should not be ignored.<br/><br/>Probably the best part about this movie is the couple. I know it's been said before, but it's so true that I'm gonna repeat: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have incredible chemistry. It's no wonder they're still together today. Even when the movie couple, John and Jane Smith, where in their ""off period"" of marriage, you could feel something between the two. They are an amazing screen couple, they work incredibly well together. Their dialogue is just right...when one says something to the other, it's smooth and real. And of course, Pitt and Jolie are both extremely attractive, so they're fun to watch. Haha.<br/><br/>The plot is all right..nothing extraordinary. It's a typical action movie plot, simple enough to leave plenty of room for the battle shots and violence. Nothing special. The dialogue wasn't bad, it wasn't lame action movie words. No stupid puns or anything. There was really nice cinematography, some shots that really were stunning. Usually the emotional aspect of action movies is dense and easy, cliché and boring, but I liked it in this movie. You could tell that they really loved each other, yet at the same time were committed to their jobs. You could feel the conflict.<br/><br/>I own this movie and I'm glad I do. It's a good time. I recommend it."
"Sparrowhisperer","7","34","45","21 September 2009"," Energetic action flick, somewhat wonky near the end
","Since going through most recent action movies is like chewing through cardboard, Mr. and Mrs. Smith is pleasantly energetic for an action flick. Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith is good fun, and does a decent job of satisfying the occasional need for summer-movies.<br/><br/>The effectiveness of the film lies in the exploration of what happens to a failing marriage when the couple are at their wits end ... and ... for the first time, come to realize that the other is a professional assassin ... and ... subsequently push the ceiling on what is termed 'spousal abuse' ... and ... of course, get to play with guns.<br/><br/>The success of the film, however, lies in how Jolie and Pitt actually bother to exercise some of their acting talent. They look like they are having fun, and genuinely enjoy the other (surprise! surprise!). The chemistry is good, and the actors are super sexy, which is always a plus for any film.<br/><br/>The movie fails, naturally, when the ending summarily degenerates into what is expected of action-fare, the shootouts, gun battles, and kisses. Enjoyable, nonetheless, even on its final wonky legs.<br/><br/>(Note: it is also a shame that in a film with so much shooting that no one gets to shoot Mr. Vince Vaughn. My, is that guy a terrible actor who can't resist hiding himself.)"
"tvgirljen","7","406","650","25 May 2005"," Nice Surprise!
","I saw an advance screening of this movie tonight, and I must say it far exceeded my expectations! Of course, due to the stars involved I knew there'd be sex appeal. And due to the advertising I knew there'd be plenty of stuff ""gettin' blowed up real good."" But what I wasn't expecting was the tongue in cheek jokes, dark humor, and respectable plot twist! Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie will only fuel rumors of their relationship with their performances - their chemistry on screen is scintillating, to say the least. The allure of each actor as an individual is undeniable, but when they're together, whether getting busy or getting pummeled, the screen fairly sizzles. It's a popcorn, Hollywood movie, of course, and you'll have to get past the fact that the two leads are the only two among many professional killers who seem to be decent shots! But the action is kickin, the acting well above par, the leads luminous, the plot is lots of fun, and the laughs are plenty. Enjoy! I sure did..."

","I find it quite hard to..i don't know..analyse this movie.<br/><br/>On one hand this could be a masterpiece, with the swirling clever cinematography and the obvious chemistry between Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt (as they hitched up in real life during the filming). But, on the other hand, this is a stupid film, just an action flick, trying to be emotional and meaningful but turned out trying to be a blockbuster.<br/><br/>I hope you see what i mean. I have rated this film 7, because of the reasons above, as the clever cinematography mixed with some good fun comedy and watchable action can't be that harmless can it. Can it? See for yourself."

","My God, is everyone who reviews this movie here brain damaged? This movie's plot crosses the believability line halfway through the feature and never returns.

"powerfull_jedi","1","134","217","15 May 2006"," Possibly the one of the worst action movies of the decade
","Where do I start? It looked promising, it had Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt co-starring in this picture: what could do wrong? Praised as one of 2005 sleeper hits, I never got the chance to see this movie at the cinema, but last month I managed to rent a copy of this movie on DVD. I like action movies(especially the late 80's/early 90's movies), so naturally I was excited, 2 hours later I was sitting on my chair wandering what happened and thinking: were they talking about another movie? Did I see a different movie? For those who don't know, Mr and Mrs Smith is about a married couple whom both are hit men working for different hit men companies without suspecting each other's secret lives. The premise alone sounds far-fetched, but the start is bad we are «introduced» to the characters who are comfortably sitting on couches both talking to the therapist about their ever decreasing romance,I sensed that something was terribly wrong when by the end of that extended scene I was feeling sleepy and clueless. I had no idea who were these characters, nor did I care for them. Eventually after they find out about their secret lives after a failed hit, they try to take each other out, only in the end to find out that by telling the truth it makes their marriage jolt back. It's so sweet when they settle their differences that you almost forget they are both hit men and that they don't seemed troubled by the mere though that they both killed for a living, but yeah, their marriage was going down the drain so t doesn't matter if they kill for a living(I'm being sarcastic). Even with all the action I was bored out of my skull nor did I find any of the gags funny. And wow, the way Columbia is portrayed in the movie is an example of scriptwriters being dumb as heck, why didn't Angelina Jolie say anything about this, after she works for the UN and all? The major insult was after they made up, their companies put a bounty on them and decided to track them down and take them out, it's just too bad their aiming and their larger numbers couldn't compare to Brad and Angelina's super-human speed,resistance,agility and superior marksmanship. Did I mention I had no idea whom were they exactly figthing against? We never know who they work for nor who employed them? They just randomly pop out to fight them. Oh and don't get me started on the characters, watching Brad Pitt and Angelina on this movie is painful, they have no chemistry whatsoever, Brad mumbles all his lines and Angelina is a predictable tomboy stereotype and one-trick pony. Vince Vaughn's jokes all fall flat, and why is that actor called The Tank? I've seen pizza delivery boys with a scarier look.To call these characters ""comic book characters"", is an insult to them. But why Brad? Why Angelina? Arnold Scharznegger(who can't act) and Jamie Lee Curtis(who's hardly a sex symbol)did so much better in True Lies. In the end, the movie is boring, childish, unfunny and a waste of time, being nothing more then tabloid fodder for two over-hyped actors. Ranks as one of the worst actions movies out there, and I've seen xXx 2: State of the Union and Alone in the Dark. The rental cost me 1.5 and I would have felt cheated even if it was for free."
"dr_shred","10","114","192","23 June 2008"," Should have payed attention
","Movies, like books, can't be judged by the packaging. When it came out in '05, the reviews were above average, but didn't appear to ring everybody's chimes so I avoided seeing it.<br/><br/>Buying the DVD seemed like a safe bet when it came out. It had lots of action and two marquee stars. But having been burned buying movies I hadn't seen - Sideways, Lost In Translation (O.K., not burned but a bit disappointed) - I passed. I'd wait till it dropped below $10.<br/><br/>Time passed and now it's on T.V. I happened to be flipping channels when I stumbled on its opening scene at the marriage councilor. Right away I was hooked. It had the marriage milieu nailed in a few minutes, like Orson Welles in Citizen Kane: the awkward questions and answers, the poorly disguised discomfort, the seething resentment.<br/><br/>It got even better with the banality of home life: the glaring silences, the perfunctory politeness, the stilted discourse, the hidden frustration, ennui, equivocation, avoidance, and interior decorating conflicts. Maybe you actually have to be married to appreciate how true the representation was.<br/><br/>Then the plot twists that accentuated the facade. More twists. Don't let your guard down for an instant, or you may get killed! The subtle, pleading moments. Like when Jane hangs up on him in the car. Additional twists and action all the way into a grand finale with scads of bullets, bombs, etc.<br/><br/>Is the true love of shared experience beyond the banality of everyday life realized? Well, you have to see the movie.<br/><br/>Yes, the plot is complicated, and sometimes doesn't make sense, like marriage, but on closer inspection reveals hidden reservoirs of true feeling and connection.<br/><br/>I guess I had overlooked a great film, just like John and Jane had overlooked each other."
"bwilkus","4","116","196","17 June 2005"," Complete Hollywood Rubbish
","Cheesy story, boring as-if action that's been done a million times, what else can I say, just lame Hollywood garbage at its finest. I'm glad I got to see this for free, because it was really a waste of time. There is only one good part, and that is when Mr. Smith hits a guy in the head with a golf club. Other than than the movie does not offer anything more than a few shots of Lip Lady (Jolie) in fish nets for all the guys who think she is hot (c'mon, she really is just plain freakish with all that plastic surgery) and some shots of Brad Pitt with his shirt off for all the 14 year old girls who will probably go see this movie for that reason alone. This movie would have been better if they would have actually killed each other, and thus, brought the film to an end after about 40 minutes. I gave Mr. & Mrs. Smith a 4/10 because at least it was produced well and had some decent stunts and special fx, but other than that, I would say it is almost as bad the The Matrix 2 and 3."
"gavin6942","8","52","83","17 December 2006"," So Much Better Than The Previews Would Have You Believe
","John Smith and Jane Smith has the perfect marriage. Well, not quite so perfect. And they've been keeping secrets from each other. They work for rival firms that do outsourcing work for the CIA. (Sadly, this would be better if viewers didn't know this for the first twenty minutes of the film, but the previews already gave it away.) <br/><br/>Based on the preview, I thought this would be a Pitt-Jolie lovefest. I have enjoyed many of Pitt's films but not so many of Jolie's. And together, it was like a showcase of perfection for the American masses. Do I need to be reminded I'll never be handsome or rich? (Some will say movies help us escape this, and maybe it does, but still...) <br/><br/>My concerns were unfounded. This movie is well-acted, well-directed and well-written. The story is layered and brilliant, as well as quite funny. The direction fits well. The acting is superb, some of the best from Brad Pitt yet. And the explosions and gunfire and things breaking and high-tech gadgets? Very nice - someone put a lot into this film and/or has some natural talent I hope we see more of in Hollywood.<br/><br/>I don't know if this film is PG-13 or R. I heard it was PG-13 because a sex scene was cut. Well, let me say: you should have kept the scene and kept the R. With all the excessive violence (really over the top) and the cussing, a little smut isn't going to make much difference. I mean, as an action film, I expect a solid R rating (look at Bruce Willis and ""Die Hard"" or ""Hostage"").<br/><br/>No real complaints about this movie. I really want to say something bad, but I cannot. I was entertained the whole time and found the film very persuasively believable. I don't know who wrote or directed this (I guess I could check, but I didn't) but they just scored points in my book. Unless it was Michael Bay, but I'm pretty sure he had nothing to do with this."
"A_Different_Drummer","10","19","27","30 August 2015"," The trick to this review -- it is a TIME CAPSULE not just a movie
","If you look at this film as merely another glitzy Hollywood spy thriller/spoof -- in the grand tradition of say OUR MAN FLINT or KINGSMAN -- then it is merely an ""8"". As in great writing, acting, direction, casting and generally a lot of fun.<br/><br/>So far, so good.<br/><br/>Here is the trick -- for viewers of the future, when we mere mortals have come and gone, but the IMDb lives on, this is better viewed as a time capsule.<br/><br/>The two stars were, to under-state it -- at the peak of their fame and charisma. I recall from the time a survey which conclusively showed, for example, that Angelina was not merely the hottest woman in show business but possibly (these surveys tend to over-state) the hottest woman on the planet.<br/><br/>(To be fair, they only surveyed living men. If the dead had also been allowed to vote, who knows, maybe Helen of Troy would have won?) And the Bradster was also at his peak.<br/><br/>Once you understood the hidden and secret dynamic of the film, it becomes both iconic and classic, and will be entertaining viewers for a very very long time.<br/><br/>(PS == watch Vince Vaughn before TRUE DETECTIVE, also of historical interest)"
"gdshrout","3","123","212","13 June 2005"," Excessive and gratuitous
","The film was a big disappointment. The actors and actresses did their jobs well - and they certainly are 'beautiful people' for the screen. But the screenplay was weak. The dialog was limited. The two main characters didn't have much to say to each other except ""I'd rather be nowhere else, but right here with you."" <br/><br/>The film relied on the action/comedy formula of explosions, guns, and fast cars, with an occasional nifty quip, like ""Those extra side doors (on a mini-van) really are handy.""<br/><br/>The screenplay does a poor job explaining the situations in which we find the characters. Why would two lovers try to kill each other? Any sane person would have tried to talk over the issues - but no - they try to kill each other and destroy their house while they are at it. This scene was excessive and went on for what seemed to be a protracted amount of time. <br/><br/>Then they fall back in love and proceed to wipe out 52 black clad ninja assassins armed only with MP5 sub-machine guns and bullet-proof Kevlar vests. This was the other excessive and gratuitous scene that went on for a long time. There was also a car chase scene that was good - if you haven't already seen a movie with a car chase scene in it.<br/><br/>There were a few comedic moments and the movie was two hours of entertainment - which is why I gave it three stars.<br/><br/>But the screenplay has so many holes it leaks like a sieve. We are left with too many unanswered questions, e.g., what did Vince Vaughn's character decide to do at the end? Not kill his friend? Hire killers? Who do the Smiths work for? Why can't their agencies have them married and working together?<br/><br/>On the plus side - Angelina fans almost get to see a nip - and there are plenty of gratuitous bust and leg shots. The S&M queen scene is 'bound' to please fans also. <br/><br/>I'm glad the kids weren't with us. For excessive violence and adult situations the film should have been rated 'R'."
"Rooster99","2","92","156","12 May 2006"," Boring, dumbed down, vastly improbable, but worst of all, smarmy.
","What a terrible movie. It reminded me a lot of ""America's Sweethearts"" because that starred A-list Hollywood actors trying to be funny in completely predictable and ridiculous situations. This movie is exactly the same, it has nothing new to offer. It is very standard formulaic fare, a popcorn movie of the worst sort, which is not even in the least bit amusing. Yes, both Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are attractive actors, but that is about it. The rest of the movie is a waste and makes no sense at all.<br/><br/>Their agencies send them on a hit to take each other out because they are married to each other?????? Did they not think that perhaps one MIGHT see the other and MIGHT not shoot them because they were MARRIED? Gee, that sounds like a solid plot. Or how about Jolie jumping off the roof while holding her handbag with one arm? I can take incredulous stunts, but not when they make fun of the audience. That was as bad as many of the ridiculous stunts in Charlie's Angels 2. And as many reviewers pointed out, they are apparently the only people their agencies employ who can shoot straight (didn't Schwartzenegger already do that to death in Commando?).<br/><br/>And what about the bit when she said her ""Temps"" did all the cooking? So are we supposed to believe the temps had been living in their basement for 6 years delivering food via the magic elevator oven but Brad Pitt never noticed? What happened to his honed hit-man senses? And she has made 312 hits in the past and he never once wondered where she might be? Presumably if she dresses as a hooker for her MO, she would probably be better off whacking guys at night, but I guess old Brad is a sound sleeper. And why pick 312 anyway? That is an impossibly high number which equates to 1 a week for 6 years. Guess no one else ever figured out someone was offing people..... I know, I know, it was just a summer popcorn movie, but how about a little effort on the script? I mean the Jackal spent months, if not years, setting up his one single hit! I actually laughed out loud when she said 312, having just predicted the entire conversation.<br/><br/>And I won't even start about the 97 guys dressed in black they whack, fortunately only Pitt and Jolie were smart enough to wear bulletproof vests whereas the trained assassins, (who had planned the raid), arrived wearing apparently bullet-seeking outfits, have never heard of cover, and whose strategy appears to be running into an endless spray of bullets. The entire movie was fantastically frustrating. There was no attempt to make any sense at all of the plot, even the beginning was ridiculous. The Columbian police were looking for a lone assassin, therefore because Jolie joins Pitt at the bar, it can't be her???? Come on, how about a little effort?!! There was not even any good humour, it was all the one-liner obvious put-down type.<br/><br/>Just terrible. It's drivel, tripe, brutal. They made them out to be too cool, too tough, and too perfect, and all they ended up being was moronic, sickening, and smarmy.<br/><br/>Sigh."
"BigHardcoreRed","Null","168","302","11 June 2005"," The Smiths Have A Little Something For Everyone.
","Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a story of a husband and wife who are working as assassins, unbeknownst to each other, and not surprisingly, are in therapy to save their marriage. Ironically, they both believe their lives together are too boring.<br/><br/>John Smith (Brad Pitt) meets Jane (Angelina Jolie) while both are in danger of being exposed in a foreign country, while working. They are both experienced assassins at the time and go with the flow, and eventually falling for each other. Neither tells the other what they actually do for a living.<br/><br/>Needless to say, they find each other out and both agencies who they work for, give the order to kill the other within 48 hours. Thus, the hijinx ensue. Both are vying for control and to discover how much the other actually knows. Upon finding that they both know everything, a full on mini-war begins.<br/><br/>This movie has a little bit of everything. The Smiths are not without their humorous sides, especially Brad Pitt. Also, there are a few good fight scenes, between The Smiths along with some others. There are a few nice weapons to be admired here, as well as some very nice eye candy (I am talking about Miss Jolie, but I hear the ladies are fond of Brad, also). Also, I would like to give an honorable mention to Vince Vaughn as Eddie. I feel his performance was funny, but too small for this movie.<br/><br/>This movie is a fun little romp through the house with some nice action scenes. Recommended if you would like a somewhat toned down True Lies. 8/10"

","Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie play husband and wife ""John and Jane Smith"", a seemingly ordinary couple living in the suburbs, who each have a secret that they keep from each other: they're assassins for competing organizations. Their marriage is put to the test when they're assigned to kill each other, adding even more excitement to their romance.<br/><br/>Mr. and Mrs. Smith isn't the best film of the summer but if you're looking for some mindless fun then this movie should fit the bill. It offers enough explosions and romance to engage the viewer and the film hardly ever gets boring. The script is the only thing that keeps the movie back from truly succeeding. It is riddled with holes and some large ones as well. Of course, they didn't even occur to me until the movie had finished. This shows that the film is quite engaging if it can take your mind off the problems with the story. The screenplay was written by Simon Kinberg and he was behind Elektra and XXX 2. So, it's no surprise the script is weak since he probably only focuses on the action sequences and not the actual plot and character development.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good and the actors make up for the weak script. Angelina Jolie offers a very good performances and she looks amazing on screen. Her co-star also gives a good and funny performance. Together, Pitt and Jolie have more than enough chemistry to carry the movie and the film works so well because of them. Vince Vaughn is the highlight of the supporting cast and his performance is pretty funny. His role may not be very big but every time he appears on screen, he manages to keep the audience laughing. Adam Brody gives a terrible performance and he isn't funny at all. Luckily, his role is small so he doesn't hurt the film too much.<br/><br/>Doug Liman does a decent job behind the camera but I was expecting a little more since he also directed The Bourne Identity. He does a nice job with the action sequences and the film has a very nice style to it. However, the movie still felt a little ordinary and I don't think he really took full advantage of this interesting premise. If you do give the film a shot, keep in mind that this is a summer blockbuster and not an Oscar quality movie. It entertains the eyes and it won't make you think. In the end, Mr. and Mrs. Smith is worth checking out in theaters. Rating 7.3/10"

","This is one of the movies that makes me want to move to Paris learn french and forget all about the idea of ""Hollywood"". I went to this film because i was forced, i tried to fight but it was no good and thought to myself ""ok i'll give in it can't be that bad maybe the action will be good"" - WRONG.<br/><br/>The film revolves around two assassins who don't know they are married, god knows how anyone thought that was a good idea but you i just like to think they were very drunk or stoned.<br/><br/>The story is diabolical and the acting is some of the worst i have seen since Vin Diesel made his debut. The whole idea of assassins is quite a dark one which has been dealt with, seriously - Leon, comically - Point Blank, by many of films greatest talents. The only time it is discussed in the movie both characters say they never feel guilty this shows the kind of macho American attitude which has ruined Hollywood.<br/><br/>I walked out of the cinema with a tear in my eye, no wonder Bush won the election with Hollywood displaying such Jung ignorance. I made a mental note of the director, Doug Liman planning to avoid all further outings of this buffoon.<br/><br/>To calm my nerves i went home to watch my favourite film in this genre, The Bourne Identity,when the credits rolled my nerves were calmed ""Hollywood can make good films"" i thought, and then i saw it: DIRECTED BY DOUG LIMAN My head span: how could this be? the same man behind the beautifully satisfying motion picture i had just watched was behind the travesty i had witnessed earlier at my local multiplex? And then i came to a satisfying conclusion - it was Hollywood as i knew there was a strong European presence on the Bourne Identity. With this in mind i slept tight content in the fact that i am English and have no problems, unlike many Americans, with European and french cinema.<br/><br/>My advice: DO NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!"

","In the end of the day, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is a classic Hollywood production: big guns, fast paced action sequences, lots of punch lines that'll thrill the audience, and two stunningly beautiful lead actors (who somehow remain beautiful, despite all the mass destruction going around them throughout the second half of the film). The pre-release buzz regarding the dynamic duo's on screen chemistry is absolutely true: as a pair, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are even more sparkling and charismatic then when they are apart (on screen wise, I mean; don't know what's happening off-screen). As a matter of fact, I could have sworn I actually saw them shining during several parts of the film. Add that to director Doug Liman's unique, if controversial, directing techniques (with many of the stylistic action scenes followed by melodramatic music and sharp camera movements) - and you've got yourself a certified crowd pleaser, and the best action film to come on screen... well, since Liman's ""The Bourne Identity"" three years ago.<br/><br/>The plot, for those of you who haven't already read about it in almost every form of magazine or internet site, revolves around a seemingly normal married couple: John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) Smith. The Smith's have been married for several years now, but apparently lost their initial passion to each other, replacing it with what seems to be chronicle marriage fatigue. What they don't know, is that underneath their upper-class and dull daily routine of troubled marriage, lies a secret waiting to explode: both of them are highly skilled deadly assassins, working for rival agencies. Of course, neither of them knows what the other's occupation really is, what only widens the gaps threatening to destroy their relationship. A mission gone wrong on both sides leads them to discover they are not working alone... and that their component, whom they now have to eliminate, has been sleeping beside them for the past five, maybe six, years! <br/><br/>From here on out, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" turns into an intense, action-packed, cat and mouse chase, as the prince and princess of modern-day Hollywood turn their guns (hidden in extremely nonchalant hideouts inside their house) - at each other. The last half hour offers the viewer some of the most stunning examples of why I love Hollywood so much, as pure mayhem conquers the screen, with bigger than-life action fragments (the best i've seen since the original ""Matrix"" back in '99), catchy one-liners thrown to the air, waiting to be quoted by movie buffs who'll come in droves to watch this, and intriguing (yet somewhat predictable) plot twists lurking at each turn of the script. It's hard to go into details without spoiling the film for those who are intending to watch it, but I can easily say that I, for one, was very pleased with the final result. Liman directs this summer fare with heart and style, always a lethal combination. Although many will claim it is an emotionally drained vehicle, only good for it's large-scale destruction sequences, one can easily relate to the marriage crisis the heroes are handling, proving that (as Liman said in an interview I read) you can fight off villains and pull international operations off your sleeve; until you handle the risks of married life, you ain't seen nothing yet! <br/><br/>Clocking in at nearly 120 minutes, there are some obvious ""dead moments"" throughout the film, especially after the excellent beginning and somewhere towards the middle (before all cinematic hell breaks loose). What saves these moments from crucially sabotaging the film's experience is the numerous cynical remarks the Mr. & Mrs. keep throwing at each other. At times, they are so cute, you just want to pause the film, cross the screen into the movie, and give them both a big hug. This is, by far, one of the best on screen pairings I have ever seen; where the relationship part of the film feels a lot like the 1979 classic ""War of the Roses"", and the action will even make the almighty Jerry Bruckheimer gaze at the screen with envious eyes. Another positive angle in the film is Vince Vaughn's character, Eddie, the comic relief of the film, who plays Pitt's long time business buddy and best friend, in a parodic appearance that sheds new light on Vaughn's portrayal of Norman Bates in the 1998 remake of ""Psycho"".<br/><br/>All in all, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is made up of all the right ingredients to turn it into a classic action piece, one that could be watched over and over again throughout the years, and yet stay fresh and entertaining as it is today. True, this isn't the most intelligent or thought-provoking movie I have ever seen, but it sticks to what it's good that, and for that i'm happy.<br/><br/>I gave it a strong 4 out of 5 stars, and a 9/10 IMDb rating."

","The film starts with Brad & Angie in couples therapy, a bit like the therapist bits in the Thomas Crown affair, with an unseen questioner. Vey funny responses, and then we're straight into the story of how they met, followed by the two of them in suburban hell - exchanging wary disagreements about dinner and the decor, while presenting 'the perfect couple' to their neighbours. At the same time, they're both sneaking around performing 'hits' and trying to be back in time for dinner, in a house that James Bond would be proud of.<br/><br/>Inevitably they realise who they both are, it turns into naked animosity, and we get a great build up to a surprisingly rough, no-holds barred gunfight (and hand-to-hand). It's not spoiling it for anyone to reveal that they suddenly realise they do love each other, and then spend the rest of the film bickering over the lies they've told each other through the years, during a pretty cool car chase, and extended gunfights. Back with the therapist for the final shot, which is guaranteed to leave you laughing.<br/><br/>Brad and Angelina are both fine actors in their own right, with some superb films behind them. The humour - from start to finish - is both visually broad and verbally sharp. Brilliant support from Vince Vaughn, who gets to steal a scene or two. The action is top-notch, with a higher body-count than most action films, hard-hitting fight scenes, and some nice high-tech espionage too. Special mention must go to the script, which could have been so OBVIOUS and tired - but instead was sharp, very witty, fresh, not dragged down by exposition, and consistently brilliant. When I did notice the soundtrack, it too was just right - original music, and a few cool/jazzy tunes (again, a la the Thomas Crown remake).<br/><br/>The audience agreed - all 2,000 of us laughed at every joke, and ""oooh'ed"" at every punch landed. There's just something very funny about a domestic in the middle of a firefight (when the filmmakers get it right), and the verbal sparring which comes from being a fairly repressed married couple.<br/><br/>A superb film on all counts, and way above what I expected."

","When you think of a movie like Mr. and Mrs. Smith, you probably imagine brainless bloodshed and empty plot; but thats not what you'll get in this film. In a subject that has been seemingly overdone, this movie explores more than emotionless assassins and the crazy situations they get themselves into. It gets more personal than that, and takes on another level. I saw a metaphor for marriage itself, with the couple's problems manifested in guns and bombs. This is by no means a realistic movie, but it seems to know that and doesn't take itself too seriously, which is also part of its charm. I laughed, cried, and suspensed my way through the twists and dialogue. The trailer doesn't do this movie justice, so if you are expecting predictable male violence, you'll be happily surprised. This could finally be the perfect date movie: fun action for the guys, deep heart for the gals, and romance for all."

It is the most depressing experience I've had in a theater in a long, long time. Remember how good Brad Pitt was in ""Thelma and Louise"" or ""12 Monkeys""? Now is some kind of thing, he's being thingified with his consent I'm sure. Angelina is working her way down as an actress and building her virtual state as a star in a world where Scott Petersen and/or Paris Hilton can become a star. How sad! As far as I'm concerned the movie has no redeeming features. I felt so cheated that I had to run and rent ""Prizzi's Honor"" as an antidote.

It opens this Friday and I will be standing in line with my friends waiting to see it again. The trailers mislead you a bit. You are certain that the movie will be a hot sex romp filled with explosions and bullets flying everywhere. What it doesn't tell you is that this movie is a huge comedy. Anyone who has been in a long term relationship will find themselves laughing the whole time at the sharp tongue-in-cheek stabs they inflict on each other. Brad has never been more likable in a movie. I've never thought of him as a comedic actor before, but comedy is his calling. Angelina... my God that women is incredibly gorgeous. After watching her for over an hour and a half, women will go out to their cars, look in the rear view mirror, and sigh because no reflection could compared to hers. Their chemistry together is so electric that you don't want them to be apart. Besides Catherine Zeta Jones, I can't imagine any other actress playing her part. She is strong and takes the lead quickly. Bottom line is when the movie was over there was major clapping in the audience. It is a must see. The only reason I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 is the lack of naked sex. Dropping this movie down to a PG-13 was cruel. Let's hope the DVD will be the unrated version."

"nskripchenkov","1","40","74","6 July 2005"," Hollywood tripe at its peak.
","OK, here is the deal. I know that a lot of films today are directed by terrible directors(Douglas Liman) with no sense of vision and/or talent, and scripts for those films are written by hapless dingbats(Simon Kinberg) who lack any spark or, once again, talent, even though they speak the Queen's English. Today such collaborations are the norm and most times they are praised by gullible audiences but Mr & Mrs Smith has managed to ""raise"" the bar slightly, setting the new standard for future films to ""reach"". No doubt the aforementioned audiences will love this film, despite the fact the movie is terrible in all ways imaginable.<br/><br/>Aimed clearly at the American market it tells a story of two hit men/secret agents or whatever the hell they are supposed to be, who are married to each other yet don't realise their true identities until they are both hired to take out the same target. They mess it up and then they find out about each other, try to hunt one another down, explosions, gunfights, blah, blah, blah....<br/><br/>The cast then, what can be said? Beautiful people as far as they eye can see, most of whom can't act to save their lives. Adam Brody is my particular favourite....aka THE TANK!!! Yeah! He certainly has a built to play someone called THE TANK! The man is a machine, 3 meters tall with arms the size of tree trunks and the ""I want to obliterate everyone who stands in my way"" look on his face! THE TANK! The unstoppable killing machine! Hell yeah!!! Seriously though, he is the worst cast ever. That skinny, scrawny 12 year-old with no facial hair, ""How did he manage to get into this film and play a character called TANK?"", one might ask. Simple. The director of Mr & Mrs Smith has produced THE O.C., as well as Bourne Identity/Supremacy and is busy in production of Bourne Ultimatum. In my opinion that is a pretty awful track record, especially the Bourne trilogy that seems to do everything possible to avoid, defile and ruin the original and superior stories of the books but that is a whole different matter entirely....<br/><br/>The rest of the cast are nothing special. There is no chemistry between Brad and Angelina, they just amble through the film somehow, waiting to get their fat paycheques. And why shouldn't they? There is enough in this movie to keep your Average Joe entertained. There are bombs going off, things going ""BOOM!"" and stuff being set on fire, all the things that would have George W. Bush raving Red Terror Alert. There are people firing guns at each other, very original stuff. In one scene Angelina and Brad unload the whole nine yards at each other yet fail to get a single shot on target. Aren't they supposed to be trained killers? Or are they good enough to dodge bullets? What else is there.....oh yeah, the car chase. Great stuff once again. Brad and Angelina are being chased by some bad people. ""The windows are bulletproof."" says Angelina as Brad tries and fails to shoot the driver of one of the vehicles. And about 30 seconds later Mr Smith fires few rounds at the body of the car that must have been made out of foil because bullets go right through and thus blowing the car up. Its all very consistent.<br/><br/>The script is another troubling factor in this mind-crippling equation. As mentioned before, it is written by Simon Kinberg, of XXX2 fame. Great stuff, very inspiring. As expected, the dialogue is clumsy, dull and painful to listen to. Not as bad as ""Revenge of the Sith"" but nowhere near anything that can be passed as ""average"". In other words, it sucks. And the story sucks too. Hollywood tripe at its peak with plot holes, stupid situations and no substance. I don't really know what happened in the end of the film as I had to leave the cinema to go and watch the paint dry but I doubt there was any sort of a twist or anything that would have made me sit up and get gripped by awe and astonishment.<br/><br/>I don't know, its possible I am being too picky about these things. After all , it is just a stupid little movie with a stupid little storyline and stupid laughs, maybe its not worth taking seriously. Then again, it is 2 hours of your life that you will never get back and when the crunch time comes with Grim Ripper knocking on your door you'll be cursing yourself for wasting those precious 2 hours on watching Mr & Mrs Smith instead of........"

","""Bourne Identity' was a great film because it tried to keep you anchored in the real world. ""Swingers"" was great because it knew where to draw the line at 'over the top'. This movie tries to have it both ways. How can 'over the top' action scenes be taken seriously? Evidently, we are supposed to take this film's premise very lightly. But yet, there is some hardcore violence and death of a lot of good guys. How can we have any empathy for a loving couple that are being hunted, when they survive thousands of bullets with nary a scratch? M&MS does not know when to draw that line. I am reminded of moments in the series ""The Sopranos"", which also juxtaposes violence with humour. You can only allow so much humour before you start to lose interest, and you can only take so much violence before you lose your taste for the story.<br/><br/>The screenplay shines when it examines secrecy between married couples, and lets the characters work it out for themselves. But the third act of the film disposes a great deal of character development for standard Hollywood Action scenes. The action scenes, while technically well executed, become tedious. I was rooting for this film, because it started off as a fun and smart film. I lost it when it stretched the material and launched into cookie cutter cliché action scenes. ""Bourne Identity"" had action scenes that represented real peril to the lead characters, but M&MS has action scenes that make it obvious that the lead characters are more like cartoons.<br/><br/>By the third act, my enthusiasm waned. I was surprised when I walked out to find the movie was only 2 hours long, because the way the second half of this film dragged made it feel more like 2 and ½ hours. I wouldn't say I felt duped, thinking the gimmick of this film would've been handled in a smarter fashion. It's just that the number implausibilities caught up with me to the point that I had to reject the entire film. Wait for the DVD."

","MR. AND MRS. SMITH begins like a Woody Allen movie. John and Jane Smith sit looking at the camera, talking to the disembodied voice of a marriage counselor, revealing bits of their marital woes through awkward attempts at casual humor. It is a nice beginning, but totally misleading. What seems to be developing into a clever, bittersweet, sophisticated drama about a failing marriage evolves into a tiresomely violent and overwrought video game tale of suburban warfare.<br/><br/>The twist, which the film treats as a surprise even though it is made apparent in all the advance advertising, is that John and Jane are paid assassins working for two rival, unidentified government agencies. They marry not knowing each other's little secret, which should indicate just how incompetent they are at their jobs. Then for reasons that are never made clear, they are assigned to kill each other. The result is the battle of the sexes as an extreme sport.<br/><br/>It is an insipid idea for a movie, yet nonetheless intriguing: taking domestic violence out of the hands of amateurs and leaving it to the professionals. And as long as the cat and mouse bloodlust between John and Jane remains personal, the film has a sharp satirical edge. The battle of the sexes becomes more than a just an ironic metaphor. The problem is that the film doesn't know where to stop and a screenplay that wants to become more and more outrageous ends up just getting more and more stupid. It is alleged that the screenplay went through fifty drafts and presumably each successive screenwriter added a ""wouldn't it be cool if ..."" moment that prompted them to exaggerate everything. When it takes on dimensions that would even be embarrassingly unbelievable in a James Bond movie, the result is like THE WAR OF THE ROSES on LSD: coyly malevolent but utterly incoherent.<br/><br/>As the Smiths, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have a fair amount of chemistry, most apparent in a dinner sequence where paranoia and cunning are served up along with tainted roast beef and extremely sharp carving knives. But as they tango through scenes of bickering sarcasm their witty banter literally gets drowned out by explosions, gunfire and squealing automobile tires. Then, even though it rushes to resolve the conflict between the Smiths, the film drags on for another ultra-violent thirty minutes designed to -- but totally failing at -- explaining the plot's myriad loopholes. The film ends with a smug happily-ever-after in which nothing has been resolved.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the film has no real point. As it systematically destroys all the symbols of middle-American bliss -- marriage, suburban home, mini-van, etc. -- one suspects that the original screenplay for MR. AND MRS. SMITH hoped to join the ranks of THE WAR OF THE ROSES; DIVORCE, AMERlCAN STYLE and even WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLFE? as a brittle commentary on the decline of the American family. But the right to even be compared to such films apparently was written out of the story during all those revisions, with any sharp insights gunned down by all the high-tech pyrotechnics. A film focusing on adult themes sells out totally to juvenile comic book mayhem."

"tabuno","8","4","5","23 January 2019"," The Intelligent Romantic Comedy of the Year
","11 June 2005. Mr. and Mrs. Smith is an intelligent romantic comedy that ups the bar for using action-adventure as a way to highlight marital discord and resolution. Unlike the trailers, this comedy isn't really about tapping into the adolescent male need for speed and violence, in fact one of the primary scenes that includes action feels off balance in the movie. The movie begins as a romantic comedy with Mr. and Mrs. Smith in a marital counseling session (while the movie credits are being shown!) and the first third of the movie is actually way slow for an action-adventure movie, thus expectations are challenged as to the pacing of this movie if one was expecting one type of movie and ended up with another.<br/><br/>The delicious interplay between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie is backed up by good cinematography, a sensitivity to acting and expression (not only dialogue), and so good relational, emotional punch lines that become available under this ridiculous scenario of two assassins being married to each other. The underlying theme of marital relationships within such a conflicted profession allows the screenplay to delve into the nature of marriage further than is possible in reality. It allows the audience to be exposed to an alternative reality, that tests certain truths about men and women in relationships where one has to decide between life and death of the self and the life and death of the relationship that are not ordinarily available in normal circumstances. Thus film can take us places we cannot go in reality, and explore certain concepts in an entertaining manner.<br/><br/>While not perfect, this movie goes into comedy romance in an area that is tapped for its gems. The plot has some holes in regards to plausibility (much like Lara Croft movies), but it is the comic approach to revealing more about marriage than about feasibility and realism that counts here (see Indiana Jones, Star Wars), that is a stake. The pacing and the tone of the film undergo stresses by this bold attempt to manage a script that jumps into murky waters of romantic comedy and deciding to go for the feels good, instead of the dark, black comedy approach of ""The War of the Roses"" (1989) with Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner that could be better described as a comedy-drama.

","A wife (Angelina Jolie) and husband (Brad Pitt), both with secret identities as hit-men, are given contracts to kill each other. This movie has some genuine laughs, but just does not work. It is incredibly implausible and silly. While this is not normally a problem (I thrive on silly movies) the movie ultimately fails when it tries to up the drama factor. How can this be taken seriously? Two people, one named Jane Doe, the other John Smith, marry each other spontaneously while not being the least bit suspicious of each other's backgrounds? Even if I wasn't a trained assassin, I would be suspicious. Stu-pid. And it takes them 5-6 years to figure this out? Stu-pider. The acting is fine. Brad plays Brad (and he's done it well over the years) Angelina plays herself. There are a few funny moments supplied mostly by Vince Vaughn, and when Brad and Angeline are trying to conceal their secret identities and later when they try to kill each other (spousal abuse is funny!), but eventually it reclines back into every unmemorable action movie you've ever seen. The bullets become ignorable because there's no way the stars'll die (Even the Terminator was more destructible). You know how the plot ends. Bor-ing. This gets a C"
"roehlbriones","4","28","56","12 June 2005"," As generic as the surname
","No offense against Smiths (my brother-in-law is one!) But this is said to be the most common surname in the US. And this is about as typical a US action flick as it gets.<br/><br/>Wait - perhaps that is overstated. It is a tad duller than your average Hollywood action-comedy flick. It goes well in the first 45 minutes or so. It takes its own good time for the two to finally try to finish each other off. Then it takes an unbelievable turn with the two kidnapping an earlier target of their former employers. Then it tacks on a royally protracted ending where the two finish off the hundred-odd goofballs who commit suicide by making themselves target practice to the dance-shooting couple.<br/><br/>In short, this movie could have benefited vastly from better editing. Total screen time was two hours, when it could have been done far better with a little over an hour. Take out the whole shebang about trying to survive the onslaughts of the two erstwhile rival companies. End it right where the two get together after having some fantastic shoot-ups and fight scenes. Maybe put a hint of fighting it out side-by-side, but leave it all open-ended rather than see the boring thing through. Of course that means half the budget go to waste, but no point throwing away your good money after their bad, right?"

","How can anyone enjoy such a cliché-ridden mass of unconvincing drivel that was Mr and Mrs Smith? I should have known by the implausible premise of the movie that everyone knew about before seeing this rubbish. The initial scene rang alarm bells loud and clear. The lack of chemistry between these so-called stars was evident when they were at the marriage guidance in the first scene. The characters had not been established in the viewer's mind so it just looked like Pitt and Jollie familiar from gossip magazine covers. It did not look like two characters in a story. Right from the start it was Brad and Angeline. (Hey guys you are supposed to be taking the part of the characters, not acting as yourselves.)They looked uncomfortable and unconvincing. I knew within 30 seconds that it was trashy tabloid stuff. The attempts at humour were laughable rather than funny. I was laughing at the movie right away and not with the movie. Seeing Brad urinate was absolutely unfunny and gross. Who wants to see the splashes on his shoe? How does that entertain? The reliance on flash gadgets in the movie added to the general atmosphere of trashiness. The sadomasochism when Angeline got dressed up in whips and stockings was clumsy, gross, unconvincing and about as sexy as a constipated bodily function.Add that to the quips trotted out when people got killed in the plot and you have a movie that is seriously z-grade There was no plausibility in the plot whatsoever! Even in a light comedy it should be convincing and plausible. Batman was far more convincing and plausible even though we know from the start he is a comic book character. There is no excuse for the unforgivable implausibility of Mr and Mrs Smith. I am just amazed that anyone could actually assert that this is a good movie. My wife agreed and three quarters of the way through we could not stand it any longer and walked out of the cinema, sickened by the people in the theatre giggling mindlessly at every pathetic joke (just like they were supposed to) on cue like gullible automatons."

"Tino85","6","30","61","18 June 2005"," Great Idea, Poor implementation
","This movie starts powerful, but unfortunately, as the plot develops, the anticipation decreases. At the end the viewer is bored with 'brainless' action, that we have been seeing since the second Rambo movie (the first didn't have so much shooting).<br/><br/>The cast is good, Pitt and Jolie give life to their characters, but it takes much more than two good actors to create a good film.<br/><br/>The final shooting scene kept me asking, is there a gunfight, or am I watching someone playing Half-Life 2 with god mode on? This movie lacks balance. The bad guys look pathetic, they look as if they haven't held a gun before, much less used it. It's just the late Hollywood tendency, not to care about plausibility, but just brainless action, and the more, the better.<br/><br/>Bottom line : Mr. and Mrs. Smith is an entertaining movie. It has several ingenious moments, a good idea, great effects, nice camera-work, but come on, the bad guys are supposed to be pros :) . But don't expect to see something like ""Face/Off"", simply because you won't."
"StopBenAffleck_Com","1","29","59","14 July 2005"," Mr & Mrs Sh**, more like
","Truly, truly awful and offensive in every way possible. Let's diagnose why this stupendously awful movie managed to dribble from a studio with two supposedly really good actors and a need to have a box office hit at some point in the next year or so.<br/><br/>1. The 'thrilling' Pitt/Jolie off-screen romance has somehow been Lost In Translation and we're left with an Act One that assumes you know the characters already. Jolie's character is totally unlikeable and there's no chemistry between the actors whatsoever.<br/><br/>2. The film manages to steal substantially from True Lies and Grosse Pointe Blank, taking the husband/wife secret life story from the former and the face off of two professional killers from the latter. Shame it didn't take the wit and action from the first and the humor from the second.<br/><br/>3. The special effects sequences are too loud, noisy, confusing and ultimately uninvolving. There's a point where two cars flip after being shot at, which was the sort of the bizarre special effect that I thought we'd left in the 1970s. The end scene is really dumb, too: it's worth seeing (on DVD) just to see how badly it fails.<br/><br/>I'm going to slam this on the IMDb as soon as I get over the annoyance of having lost $20 to watch this. If the Cinderella Man Money-Back Guarantee had been in place, I would have been screaming to the manager but alas too much cinema is caveat emptor.<br/><br/>By the way, while I respect most comments from IMDb members, I urge those who liked this film to give it a second reviewing and reconsider."
"psi_fla","6","40","86","11 June 2005"," A wasted opportunity
","No relation to the 1940's Alfred Hitchcock comedy of the same name, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is an actioner/comedy/thriller that manages to entertain in spite of some serious limitations.<br/><br/>John Smith (Brad Pitt) and Jane Smith (Angelina Jolie) are not your typical married couple. (Yeah, I know, we've heard stories like this before, but this film's hardly original). They both live a seemingly normal life together, in a nice house in a nice neighbourhood. Both are trained assassins, but they don't even know the truth about one another. That is, until they are dispatched to kill the same target.<br/><br/>Shades of Alias, The Incredibles and True Lies consistently surface, from the deceptions to the violence to the thrills. What differentiates Mr. & Mrs. Smith from those other works is its sense of fun.<br/><br/>Director Doug Liman showed with The Bourne Identity that he is adept with action, and films such as Go have shown his skill with plotting and character. Unfortunately the film's plot is all over the place, even when the film is at its most entertaining, and the character moments are rather ordinary.<br/><br/>It is saved mostly due to the sparring between the two leads. When Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are on screen together, competing with one another either verbally or physically, this film really soars. (Jolie has more than just atoned for her performance in Alexander here; for the first time in a long while, I found her tolerable.) This, in addition to some inventive set design and cool gadgets, is what effectively constitutes half, it not more, of the film. At one point I was convinced that this would be my first truly unqualified recommendation of the summer.<br/><br/>Alas, not long after John and Jane find each other out, the fun, laughs and excitement give way to a succession of eventually tedious chases and shoot-outs. After being very entertaining for long periods, the film begins to outstay its welcome very quickly. There are still some enjoyably quirky moments hidden in there, but I doubt that most viewers will still be as attentive by this point.<br/><br/>I would have appreciated Mr. & Mrs. Smith more if it had maintained the tone that came before the generic action scenes throughout the entire film. Then again, that probably wouldn't have filled up the two hour running length, would it? Mr. & Mrs. Smith is entertaining enough, I suppose, but in my opinion it's a wasted opportunity. And that's not the first of those I've come across this season.<br/><br/>Rating: 6/10"

","What a waste of my time and money it was to see this flic. Absolutely the only - and I mean only - redeeming feature of this film is that it did provide a period of employment for the participants, i.e., carpenters, costumers, drivers, et al. Whatever the actors and director were paid was far too much. Apparently Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie think that they have such great name recognition that they can afford to appear in whatever garbage will give them the biggest paycheck. I hope they're right, because this poor excuse for a movie could be a career-ender. Subtract the explosions, noise and pyrotechnics from this movie and there is nothing left but really stupid dialog between two people who apparently think they're God's gift to the 15-year old set.

"tcar12","1","36","77","8 June 2005"," terrible movie
","This is a terrible movie that glorifies domestic violence in the guise of a comedy which makes it even worse. Both actors, who showed such great promise early in their career, seem to be reduced to making One-dimensional comic book movies that have no substance but a big paycheck.<br/><br/>The movie self-destructs because of it going from being a look at a marriage that has lost that spark and both people are bored (sounds a lot like True Lies) to an action, shoot-em-up, guns that don't need re-loading and two stars that engage in all this and yet don't seem to even mess up their hair. At least True Lies had the stars looking dirty when it was called for and a good supporting cast. Neither Ms. Jolie or Brad Pitt seems able to carry the movie by themselves. Also, True Lies had comedy that wasn't built around domestic violence and was a movie that work not because of the sexual excitement people feel (which is a poor excuse for a movie) but because of the chemistry and good natured aspects. In True Lies (I'm not saying this was a great movie but a lot better than this one), when the terrorist slaps one of the female actors, the audience responds to this. In this movie, The violence is within the marriage and setting aside the comedy should make people feel uncomfortable.<br/><br/>A film needs more than sexual chemistry between the leading actors. It needs a good script, a good director that knows where to draw the lines and a good supporting crew. This movie has none of this. I'm not against sexual chemistry but if that's all the movie offers then just rent some porn and given some of the comments made by posts here that's what I would recommend. At least it would be cheaper for you. A good movie also needs more than things being blown up and people shooting one another. If you compare it to Prizzi's Honor, Prizzi's Honor had a great cast, good script, great supporting cast and an ending that makes you feel a sense of sadness in the main character. Nicholson conveyed a sense, at the end, that he may not have taken the action he did and you come away with a sense of sadness from him that he got sucked into an action and the aftermath that he didn't really want.<br/><br/>If you compare it to War of the Roses, War had a great cast, good script, strong supporting cast and was filmed as a dark comedy that really, in the end, didn't make light of domestic violence, whether it's from the husband, wife or both. The movie ends with DeVito telling the couple to go home and stay together. Also, the movie ends with the knowledge that DeVito is married and happy.<br/><br/>Of course it would be nice, given what both have said, if they would take those big paychecks and, instead of spending them on 5-7 million dollar houses, private jets, and 3 million for diamond earrings...etc... and donate some it to the causes they supposedly support. Hypocrisy (in their personal life) and terrible movie choices (in their professional life) will lead these stars down the has-been track. After all, age takes it toll and their good looks without any show of acting ability will cause them to end up in the same dustbin as Sharon Stone and others.<br/><br/>One finally note on the movie: don't get caught up in the glamor of the stars (whether this movie or others), boycott the movie and send a message to Hollywood stars that we demand more of them the drivel they produce.<br/><br/>Asidenote on June12- box office receipts were very good for this movie but with the other one dimensional comic book movies coming in the next 2 weeks, it probably won't last. It's to bad that all this money is spent on this film when there are many more great films out there. Hollywood knows that the summer for these types of movies and waits until the fall to put out the better ones. I just hate to see so much talent being wasted on a throw-away movie like this one."

The picture started production in early 2004, then stopped production, and a completion bond company had to step in to make funds for the completion of the picture. this usually tells you that even with a eight month delay the actors do not seem to look exactly the same in each scene.Too bad as Pitt needs a hit and so does Angelina."

"TheMovieDiorama","6","2","2","12 November 2019"," Mr. & Mrs. Smith explodes with flaming chemistry but assassinated its own script.
","""Brangelina"". Without Liman's standard action comedy, we wouldn't have had the power couple that dominated the tabloids. Several children wouldn't have been adopted and brought up in a completely different, yet financially stable, environment. Jolie wouldn't have been the charitable humanitarian she is now. And Shiloh's first baby photograph wouldn't have amassed over ten million dollars worldwide. Wow! Suffice to say, the two most beautiful humans in Hollywood have a substantial amount of gratitude to show Liman for his efforts in pairing them. If only his energetic vibrancy was enough to power the lacklustre screenplay, the balance of action and comedy could've been a landmark within the sub-genre. A bored upper middle class married couple are astonished to learn that they work for differing assassination organisations, soon to be assigned to kill each other.<br/><br/>It's your standard marriage. Winning a teddy bear at a carnival, falling in love whilst buying the most expensive mansion on the street, succumbing to the same mundane daily routine, destroying the house with an almighty shootout followed by a gas explosion, participating in the feistiest erotic love-making scene ever and naturally ending in marriage counselling. A cruel irony for ""Brangelina"", maybe they should've watched the film they made together? Cynicism aside, what truly elevates the memorability of this feature is the onscreen (and offscreen, bow chicka wow wow...) chemistry of its leading stars. Jolie and Pitt are exceptionally effortless with their comedic timing, dramatic endeavours and high-octane action. The lightning-fast wit that they inject into Kinberg's less than impressive script is nothing short of, well, impressive. They make the film. They are the film. And they certainly have solid taste in curtains.<br/><br/>Liman maintains a light tone throughout, never dabbling into the cracks of the marriage which is vital for retaining a fun buoyancy. This isn't an analysis on marital breakdown. It's just a tongue in cheek slice of entertainment.<br/><br/>Having said that, despite the tantalising chemistry of its leads, you never quite feel that they are truly in love. Unfortunately, Kinberg's script is so vacuous in emotional conviction, that both Smiths resemble roommates than a married couple. Understandably the marriage is stale as they conform to their upper middle class lifestyle, but even when they fight and makeup, there's no real connection. I yearn to see Jolie and Pitt lust over each other. The momentum essentially grinds to a halt after their house explodes, with Kinberg's script focussing on a central plot point involving ""The Tank"" and an onslaught of heavily armed operatives raiding a department store. Attention for the splendid couple instantly dissipated with a third act that seemingly refused to end, ultimately losing the acute fun that preceded the underwhelming conclusion. The whole ""keeping up appearances"" act was tossed out of the smashed window, and that was the sole element that made the film incredibly fun.<br/><br/>Mr. & Mrs. Smith doesn't conclude with a divorce, as it is sensible light entertainment for the vast majority of its runtime, yet the concluding act and poor screenplay prevent the marriage from flourishing fully. Angelina Jolie man! I would abandon my homosexuality for her..."

","This film falls into that category where you wonder if you're falling asleep every two or three minutes. It seems little else could explain why you cannot follow the plot or make sense of most of what's going on. Was there maybe a manual you should have read before watching?<br/><br/>Relax. Your marbles are fine, and you aren't experiencing the early stages of narcolepsy either, but this film does have the capability to force normal people into a form of hypnotic sleep, much like driving on an empty motorway for ten hours without stopping. The intended plot is as useful for the film as a home-knitted woolly sock is in protecting the family car from the elements. It's one of those movies where, if you're a great fan of the lead actors, you'll drown yourself in their never-ending, cutesy tete-a-tetes and conclude it was a phenomenal film. If you're not, reach for the remote before the next onslaught of forcibly induced sleep."
"Nozze-Musica","Null","14","27","12 June 2005"," Style Over Substance
","This movie is a classic example of style over substance. The wardrobe of the two lackluster leads is very expensive, tight-fitting, and very appealing to some. The house that the two live in is very expensive, something most people watching it could never afford, and a few may not even want it. This is an example of bad writing, the jokes are recycled, but just because the jokes are used doesn't mean the movie couldn't be funny, unfortunately the two leads are so horribly inept at performing comedy they waste what could have been a perfectly good movie. Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt largely are two people that are nice to look at, nothing more, for them to do comedy is too much, it is something they just can't do.<br/><br/>There have been some horrible movies lately, while this one is formulaic and predictable it is not as bad as let's say Kicking and Screaming. The movies only good point is Vince Vaughn, a proved comedic actor who makes otherwise predictable material much funnier, his frantic pace makes his character about the best in the movie. You can appreciate Vaughn because in this movie, which almost has no unattractive or perfectly dressed people he is the only one that does not look plastic. And it was amazing to me to see no average looking people in this movie, sad to say a lot of movies suffer from that, people not as skinny as a pole, with all the curves, or with all of the perfect muscle definition, and it hurts a comedy, which is what this movie is supposed to be, but perfect people rarely are funny.<br/><br/>The plot is the kind of over everyones head fare that you got to great success from Ghostbusters, and to solid effect from Men in Black, where everyone is just acting so crazy, doing almost impossible tasks. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are two assassins working for different agencies suddenly assigned to kill each other. The humor is supposedly suppose to come from the one-liners and the situations that arise from their strained marriage, and the awkward circumstances that come from their hits. Little of it provokes any laughter, but occasionally it would provoke a raised eyebrow, as some of the situations were just strange. One of the supposedly very funny running gags was Brad Pitt's inability to remember it the couple had been married 5 or 6 years and this was supposed to be funny.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are not exactly brilliant thespians either, so they really can't act their way out of a movie like this. As these two often do, they look so bland and uninspired, but that's the way they always are, they're not actors they are nice to look at, and there is no better example than this movie that movie rely only on sex appeal, and no plot, writing and especially acting. And of course you have the mandatory dress up the lady in something sexy, in this case it was a dominatrix's outfit. But the sexy leads don't cut it. This movie could have been done better with better casting. Instead of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, cast Ben Stiller and Janeane Garofalo, two comedians that can make movies work.<br/><br/>By the time the finals came around I was disinterested in this movie, I had gotten to the point where I realized the purpose of this movie was to have you look at the two sexy leads. The jokes were sometimes painful, but you can't really blame the writer, since his jokes and his screenplay were made so horrible by the performances. I just saw this movie because there wasn't anything else to see. So I guess it was a good way to waste two hours, or two hours were wasted for no good reason I can't figure it out."
"DiaryofaMadWoman","Null","21","44","17 June 2005"," Two hours of butt-numbing stupidity.
","I didn't really like the movie, because it took two hours to explain a whole lot of nothing. It seemed pointless to watch, because its a typical Hollywood spy-flick cliché. Two people fall in love, are found out, and ordered to kill each other. I think it was a horrible movie, and could have been better. And they could have had better actors for the main roles, too. It was rather lame, seeing as they focused mostly on keeping their careers secret. If it had a bit less guns, and more swordsmanship, it may have been a bit better. My friend and I sat in the theater for two hours, laughing only at the parts that everyone else laughed at. It was pretty stupid, especially after they stole some Batman moves."

","The action photography was horrible! If you like watching the camera bounce all over the screen during the action sequences then you'll love this movie. When are the directors going to stop handing over the camera to their 8 year old kid's to shoot the action sequences anymore. It's like they do not want us to actually see whats going on during these scenes. It makes me dizzy to try and watch them. I don't know if it was just me, but I could not make out a lot of what Pitt was saying either. Another thing, call me old fashioned, but I like it when the guy saves the girl. I really don't think she could have held her own in a fist fight against Pitt."

It is a film based purely on style over content and fails miserably to pull that off. I actually felt a bit sorry for Pitt and Jolie having to carry a film with no discernible script. As for the failed marriage metaphors throughout the film, they only managed to make a bad film even worse.<br/><br/>If anyone can reasonably explain to me why this film has received 6.6 on this site I would be delighted to be enlightened.

First of all, there was no chemistry between Pitt and Jolie (hopefully Brad didn't leave Jenn for Angelina). Second, the movie was mostly boring and almost a comedy; just very disappointing. If you really want to see this movie, wait until it comes out on video, don't waste your 8-10.00. In this movie, the very beautiful Jolie does great acting but it just doesn't make the cut. It doesn't make a difference. The storyline itself is just pretty lame (if you can even call it a storyline)."

","I don't typically enjoy big budget Hollywood films but after hearing that this film is about Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie trying to kill each other, I thought it might be an entertaining offbeat popcorn flick. It just sucks. Essentially you have two alcoholic (watch closely, if you must watch at all) assassins who are married and work for these corporations killing lots of people. Neither one knows what the other one does. They're each assigned the same particular job and they ""spot"" each other and it's the rule that after being spotted one must kill the spotter. After trying to kill each, they fall in love again and must defeat a new enemy in order to survive. The film is just terrible. It has no charm and it's morally empty. I repeatedly found myself wishing that one of the thousands of bullets that Mr. And Mrs. Smith dodge would actually hit them and put an end to these white-bread murderers lives that I'm supposed to empathize with. Vince Vaughn's character is funny and the cinematography is nice but that doesn't even come close to saving this two hour turd."

"jmj021963","2","14","28","26 June 2005"," Mr and Mrs Smith is just plain, boring, unrealistic and stupid
","I went to this movie because the wife and kids wanted to see it and all four of us wished he had seen something else instead. The first thing I noted was that rather than PG-13, this piece of trash should be rated R for violence (Unneccesary I might add), sexual situations and sexual innuendo. I don't have a problem with R or even X rated movies, I go see R all the time but I don't take 10 year olds and the theater was full of 8-12 year olds who were all obviously bored and bewildered. Want to see a movie along these lines worth watching? Rent ""War of the Roses"" because this is nothing more than a take on that movie and a poor take at that. The premise is ridiculous as two people who have been married 6 years do not know that each is a hit person (professional killer) for the others enemy. The characters are never developed, its just ""This is what you get, wam bam"". ALL of the characters in this movie are one dimensional. No depth whatsoever. Ninety percent of this movie looks like its filmed with a blue filter. The camera movement is extremely shaky and too close up most of the time. The acting can only be described with one word ""ATROCIOUS"". Brad Pitt must have gone to the Kevin Costner school of acting because once again he plays..now get this...BRAD PITT! Angelina Jolie is her usual self, lips and expressions, the acting's all the same. Vince Vaughn brings a refreshing...ummm..nope sorry, his acting sucks as well. There is scene after scene of Pitt and Jolie fighting off ""Someone"", I say someone because we never find out what organizations they work for. Only that they have offices in New York and apparently don't have names and work against the FBI or some such nonsense. Anyway, they are fighting all these enemy Ninja looking fighters and AMAZINGLY the bullet proof vests they are wearing get hit dozens of times but the unexposed parts like arms, legs, heads, shoulders, hands, necks etc do not get a scratch. (OK, they do get a scratch but thats it). HOWEVER, using their great skill with small arms, they kill many of the ""enemy"" whatever they are. Some of the scenes are so unrealistic as to make you wonder if someone actually had a vision for this movie or they just made it up as they went along. For example, there is a chase scene near the end, 3 bulletproof BMW's are chasing them in a stolen minivan (A Dodge Caravan I think) and Pitt spends 15 minutes trying to take out the bad guys while Jolie drives, he isn't having a whole lot of luck and near the end of their conversations (They are divulging their secrets to one another throughout the chase) Jolie slings the minivan around and with a few shots from her handy dandy pistol causes both remaining BMW's to blow up and do flips all over the highway. The best I can do to sum this movie up would be STOOOOOOOOOOOPID! The final action scene is taken DIRECTLY from the final scene of ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" but rather than being shot up, Pitt and Jolie massacre the guys who are after them killing EVERY SINGLE ONE of maybe a dozen guys in the most idiotic slow motion action sequence in the history of the movies. Other words to describe would be boring, unrealistic, unbelievable (Hell even Batman was believable), poorly shot, poorly directed, no vision, poor continuity, poor everything. I recommend saving the money and waiting until this comes out on video, then when it does, wait and see if you can find it at a dollar store or flea market for a dollar or two. Recommendation: Don't waste your time or your money. Pure garbage."

When Brad and Angelina are not trying to kill each other, many others are trying to kill them. Superman could never survive this continuous onslaught; I leave it to your imagination if Brad and Angelina do or don't. This movie is the movie equivalent of Jay Leno's ""Jay Walking.""

","The only thing that saves this movie from being a complete disaster (in my mind) is that there are a few laughs throughout the film.

So if you're a horny schoolboy or schoolgirl, please disregard my comment.<br/><br/>Did anyone notice the absurd number of plot holes and other things that just didn't make sense? Did the two rival companies that Mr. and Mrs. Smith worked for suddenly collaborate to plan a very elaborate death for these two assassins? Didn't Austin Powers teach us anything? Just shoot them! Don't place them in an easily escapable and overly complicated situation.<br/><br/>Why is Mr. Smith able to throw a bomb into a mailbox in front of a police officer and get away? How, exactly, did this movie end? Did they kill everyone in both companies and are now living happily ever after? I don't understand why the movie ended when it did. Furthermore, I don't understand why anyone in the movie theater clapped when it did end.<br/><br/>Let's not forget how underdeveloped the entire story was to make way for explosions and car chases. They never, for example, explained who the two leaders of the company were, and why they wanted certain people killed. There was a lot of missed potential there.<br/><br/>On many occasions, I'm willing to let a minimum number of holes in the story slide, but the movie should still make some sense.

If I loved the scene between Tom Cruise & Thandie Newton right at the start of MI II, then the Pitt/Jolie flashback scene was equally riveting.<br/><br/>So far so good. The movie was totally not what I expected. It's not a movie version of the ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" TV Show - which I naively thought it was (wake up Melody!). There were even a couple of laughs & nice gadgets, which lulled me into thinking I was right to think this was the movie of the year And then came the post-break.<br/><br/>Apparently Angelina cannot stray too far from Lara Croft and silly comic book action stuff. The writers of the movie obviously put so much effort into creating just the perfect equation between Mr. & Mrs. Smith (& I do agree, they achieved perfection there) that they forgot that the rest of the movie must have a plot! Common sense was thrown out of the window while hopelessly trying to ape James Bond (failing miserably).

But the worthless, pointless, unreal characters on display here are mind-blowing.

But then, if Liman and writer Simon Kinberg had acknowledged any of this, there would have been no movie. Know what?

I guess they looked great, but chemistry? It's all superficial and forced. <br/><br/>The script is a mess. You never get a sense of who these two people or their motivations are. We never get to know them, so when the story gets going and people start trying to kill each other, it feels pointless. I like violence when it's properly motivated, but because the story is so badly laid out, the violence here feels superfluous and ugly. The film is smug and thinks it's really funny to have the characters make jokes as they kill people, as if it's some kind of clever action comedy. These lame comedy moments make the film feel worse than empty: it feels evil. There is a truly disgusting moment of violence between Pitt and Jolie as they beat each other up.<br/><br/>The only thing I liked was Vince Vaughn, who was hilarious in a supporting role.

This movie has the moral core of a New York pimp.

","I am not a particularly huge fan of Angelina Jolie  I believe she is somewhat typecast as a female ""Rambo"" although that may not be entirely her decision. This movie bothered me chiefly because of its implied message: that married couples have the right to beat the crap out of each other. It is violent, disrespectful to the sanctity of marriage, and predictable, I yawned throughout the movie. I wonder if it would ever be possible for two big ""stars"" to make a movie about a relationship that is based on honesty, forgiveness, tolerance, and integrity. That might be asking for too much since both of these actors have little knowledge (IMHO) of how to form a trusting healthy relationship. PerhAps they were the right individuals to be in a movie like this after all."
"camansega","1","15","32","17 July 2005"," Again another movie with a great content of bias, racism without any logic reason
","Certainly this movie has a lot of action content, good action sequences, mystery, deception and other good qualities other IMDb critics may say about it. However, the director apparently has never seen a picture of Santa Fe De Bogotá and clearly has no interest whatsoever in showing to his audience the real city or even a replica of it. He is perhaps so ignorant, he does not even have a clue where it is actually located.<br/><br/>I am Colombian and it is still unbelievable that in the 21st century US-movie directors not only shoot movie scenes in places which largely differ from the real ones but also have the guts to deceive the public in an endless effort to discriminate, lower, and have the guts to show no respect whatsoever to a foreign and democratic society. Bogota is an 8-million people city as large as the Washington D.C. area; and does not look like anywhere close to a 5000-inhabitant Mexican town full of ugly folks, has many tall corporate buildings, as well as french, Japanese and American brand cars on its highways and avenues (never with bullet holes), there is no lousy army patrolling it but it is actually home to the best US and Colombian agencies and training centers against terrorism. Finally, people do not get drunk all God damn day and do not listen to silly US-composed ranch era songs whose purpose is only to lower foreign countries such as Mexico and Colombia.<br/><br/>I encourage the US-movie industry in Hollywood to never allow such attitudes from its producers and directors. They must also be careful against the bad consequences it may bring to us such as driving away foreign investment. I can't recall, even for a single time, that the Bogota city hall has turned down any official request for shooting movie scenes on it. Movies should be shot at real places, similar ones or at least studio replicas; the story only being a fiction...Movies are art.. entertainment, fun and joy, not bigotry and racism."
"acorral-1","1","15","32","23 June 2005"," Another typical movie.
","I'm not sure if producers and directors (with some notable exceptions) in US think on a good movie as a big budget, a lot of special effects, super stars in leading roles and stupid, forced and unbelievable situations. If the answer is yes, well this could be a good movie, but reality is beyond this ideas. Black humor in this film is absolutely pathetic. Directors must have seen Tarantino or Cohen brother's films first to understand what US black humor is all about. Who can believe that Angelina Jolie is falling down from the top of a skyscraper with nothing but a rope? Or Brad Pit receiving gun shots, stabs, hits of all kind and he remains with enough energy to make jokes and discuss his marital problems? Or the final shooting scene where the two of them kill and defeat dozens of well trained and better armed mercenaries? Those are only a few samples of stupid scenes during the movie. Besides that, what about the acting performances? Totally ridiculous and exaggerated. The typical tough guy and the sex symbol, nothing more. You don't need deep dialogues or strong performances, because there are a lot of weapons, explosions and dead people. Even the extreme violence is not justified.<br/><br/>Nothing new but a big budget film. If you want to see the typical predictable and stupid action movie, well this is your option. If you are fan of Pit and Angelina, believe me on this, there are better movies to see them, well, probably not; I'm not sure at this time. Anyhow, if you have better things to do, avoid it."
"BirdmanT7","Null","8","15","5 July 2005"," Mr. and Mrs. ALIAS
","I heard so much about this film prior to its release and after I saw it I think its probably one of the dumbest movies I have seen this year. This is pretty much like the show ""Alias"" but doesn't even have supporting cast to rescue it from the disaster that it really is. From the very opening scene where Pitt and Jolie are getting marriage counselling I felt they are just going through the lines like they are reading of some cards; you felt it was like fake acting and their whole interaction just got to be worse through out the whole movie; they just had no depth that would translate to some kind of chemistry. Most audiences are sold on the idea that just because these two stars have huge sex appeal,hence, that equals to screen chemistry and I am sorry to say that Ms. Jolie doesn't have any kind appeal even in a dumb movie like this. <br/><br/>Pitt on the other hand is an actor who's game is raised by what others bring to the table; when he feels he is challenged his acting becomes better; even in a film like Ocean's 12 where he is having an affair with a cop ""Catherine Zeta-Jones"" and those few scenes had much more chemistry than all the scenes in this movie; and that was a pure pop-corn movie yet it had many great moments. Again in an older film like Seven there was a great chemistry between Pitt and ""Gwyneth Paltrow"" given that they were dating but they didn't even have to talk to each other on the screen; the same in ""Spy Game"" with ""Catherine McCormack"" the chemistry was in their interaction and by far richer than Ms. Jolie whom we are sold on this idea that she is this hot sexy thing that sizzles on the screen.<br/><br/>I read some of the other reviews here and I feel I watched a whole other movie?. First the story of two people who meet in a hotel in south America both standing behind the door scared and not either suspecting the other as to why? then jump cut to married several years later and you have not even shown a series of shots of how those few years were like, their missions, or any clue as to one even suspecting another. You just are given these superficial scenes with Joile trying to do her best to convince you that she can act. I hate to compare but if you watch ""Alias"" you can see ""Jennifer Garner"" along with the whole cast really do their best in that one hour to bring depth no matter how bizarre the plot is; its her interactions with the rest of the cast that makes her believable, she can be tough and Daddy's little girl at the same time, she makes the character human and her face can take up the whole screen and you can read a lot in her expressions and I think she would have done a much better job in this film than Ms. Jolie. <br/><br/>This is the same director who did ""Bourne Identity"" which was a terrific film; the whole chemistry between Jason and Marie was developed so beautifully slowly but it was believable; I felt with all the action the interaction between them stood out and that's what made it ""Bourne a great action film. In Mr. and Mrs. Smith you don't even care to like the characters; this movie had potential to become much better film; there was so many scenes that could have been slowed down and more about the problems of two people in a marriage and yes at the same time being funny and a action film but its became one big joke and even when you see Joile shed a tear in a restaurant thinking she killed Pitt its quickly ruined by Pitt's surprise arrival and their brutal tango throwing knives across tables and not even one person noticing it?<br/><br/>Lets face it this was just an idea of putting two box office stars together to make an action film with any script; because there is no story here that you care to even understand, it has no direction even as a comedy; I find the TV show ""Alias"" more enjoyable and even more interesting than this stupid movie."

"bob the moo","Null","16","36","17 July 2005"," Really dumb and silly but quite breezy fun if you are in the mood for it
","John and Jane have been married for five or six years and pretty much have the American ideal; they live in a big home in a nicely white and middle-class suburb, they both drive nice cars and both have very good careers. Sure they have problems in their marriage but outwardly they look great and they are getting counselling for the lack of spark anyway. The real problems probably come from the fact that, unbeknownst to one another, he is not really a building contractor and she is not really a computer expert, really they are both professional killers working for different companies. This is all well and good until they both get sent to do the same job and narrowly miss killing one another. Discovering the other's secret identity, they both assume that the other is only in the marriage to get information and mark the other so neither has a choice but to try and kill the other first.<br/><br/>From the plot summary alone you've probably got the idea that this is not the film to come for if you are in a cerebral mood. The plot is rather silly to say the least, the action OTT and the whole thing is utterly unconvincing and unengaging. However it is all rather fun and entertaining in a big, dumb, noisy summer blockbuster sort of a way. On this level it is possible to just take it as it comes, ignore the lack of substance and be taken in by the slick style with which it is all carried off. It helps that all those involved know to deliver it with their tongues in their cheeks, so it never looks stupid, it knows it is silly but it also knows that it is entertaining and, in the summer market, that is all it is required to be doing. The result is that it all moves forward quickly and constantly with an air of slick confidence that produces funny lines and plenty of big noisy action.<br/><br/>Of course it is not the film to bring your brain to, because if you think about it you have lost the point and will no enjoy it. I found myself thinking once or twice and forced myself to just get lost in the film as a product that than a story. I thought about how the characters were more about the celebrities than the writing, but this didn't matter because that was part if the appeal of the film. I thought about how the action lacked any tension or anything to really hook me in, but that was mainly because the film and characters had no substance below the slick exterior, so the action matched that approach. I also found some of the scenes of violence a bit hard to take - was I the only one who watched this married couple punching and shooting each other and thought how the real sufferers of domestic violence would not appreciate such a sensual and funny look at the subject? Like I said though, I nipped these thoughts in the bud because the film is not about the detail, it is about the glossy finish - the engine of this car might have been a couple of badgers on a treadmill, but the bodywork had definitely been ""pimped""!<br/><br/>With such a glossy vehicle, it was important to have a couple of really sexy stars who have chemistry to carry off the silly nonsense. Fortunately the stars are textbook for that type of stuff. Pitt has been slickly moving through Ocean's 11/12 and Jolie is sexy/sassy personified. Individually they keep the quips coming, never take it seriously at any point and manage to make knife wounds, bruises and wounds sexy and cool. Together they both seem to get the joke and their slick deliveries go really well together; I could not care less about the whole ""are they/aren't they"" gossip column nonsense but they really did make this product work by turning up the ""slick"" quotient to 11. For me personally though I felt that Vaughn stole the show by doing his usual stuff - he is consistently funny and his rougher character made for a really nice contrast to the endlessly slick delivery in every other section.<br/><br/>It is all nonsense of course and I had started to forget it the moment I left the cinema, but it does what it sets out to do pretty well; not to make you think, not to provide realism, not to be tense, not to engage your emotions but simply to provide a slick, funny film that lives entirely on the surface and never stops moving in case you notice this. This it all does well and, for all the problems with it, it is indeed sexy, smart, funny, noisy and enjoyable. Not great by any means but will certainly keep the target audience happy."
"moonspinner55","5","11","23","1 February 2007"," Flying bullets...and wisecracks
","Slick like a magazine ad (and sometimes just as crass), this commercial hybrid of ""Prizzi's Honor"" and ""Mission: Impossible"" is too high-tech for its own good--the movie's real assets get swallowed up by the monstrous over-production. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have been married six years, but neither knows the other is a hired assassin; once their secrets are revealed, they consider killing each other. The cute, likable characters and canny marriage-humor nearly get lost once the picture becomes little more than car crashes and a barrage of gunfire. Still, though the midsection does plod, the finale is well-crafted and the chemistry between Pitt and Jolie is almost enough to compensate for the heavy overall feeling of action-flick redux. ** from ****"

","Went to see this movie last night and was left wondering a) what is the point of this film and b)whilst Pitt and Jolie are both good actors, why do they get involved in high budget, low brow seat fillers like this one? I suppose with the type of money that is on offer with these productions, how can they refuse? Disappointed, not only about the movie but also for the cast, although Vince Vaughn continues to give a strong performance. Despite his role in the film being minimal, when he is on screen he lights it up and provided the main laugh out loud moments of the film. Small consolation for spending a couple of hours with nothing to show for it though.<br/><br/>In conclusion, more money should have been spent on a stronger supporting cast and the script with less emphasis on explosions. Pitt and Jolie can't carry this movie themselves and it suffers for it."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","11","23","9 June 2005"," A situation drama about marriage
","This is probably an alternate view on the movie. As in the quantum theory, the event changes with the observer. This observer does not see Mr and Mrs Smith so much as an action thriller as a situation drama/comedy about marriage.<br/><br/>Pay attention first to the title. ""Mr and Mrs"" is meant to really say something. If you don't want to take it too seriously, look at it as a parody of any serious literary work (including movies) on the subject of marriage that you have come across before. Unlike the conventional start of Hollywood action thrillers i.e. a cliff-hanger (which may of may not have anything to do with the rest of the movie), ""Smith"" starts with a POV sequence from the marriage counsellor, with some pretty witty lines from both of the clients. The next 30 minutes (a full quarter of the movie) is devoted to showing the strange and strained relationship of the couple who had been married for ""5 or 6 years"". Indeed there are two sequences showing them separately ""at work"" but the fact that they are first rate assassins is almost incidental. They could have easily been in other lines of business that they want equally to keep secret from each other. This first quarter of the movie unfolds more like a situation comedy than an action thriller.<br/><br/>The middle portion of the movie takes a turn, into something that many people compare to ""The war of the Roses"". They can't be more wrong. The comparison is totally superficial, in that the couples in the movies want literally to kill each other. ""Roses"", however, is filled with a mean spirit that led to loud criticism and protest at the time when it was released, during the Christmas season. The earnest effort of the couple in ""Smith"" in their attempts to kill each other, on the other hand, is just manifestation of professional excellence, without malice. <br/><br/>The movie finally comes to its own when John and Jane Smith, after a long sequence of mutual attempts of annihilation (from employment of heavy arsenal to gritty melee) come to the realisation that even when their marriage had apparently been a charade, there was something in it that this ""close encounter"" finally brings out. Instead of taking each other as a convenient cover for their true identity, they proceed, for the very first time, to discover each other as individuals. <br/><br/>As if to keep the audience still guessing even though the suspense is all gone, the movie makers give the last part of the movie a little bit of a ""Bonnie and Clyde"" flavour. There is clearly a lack of a real climax normally expected of an action thriller. The villains are faceless, not to make them mysterious, but because they are unimportant. The final shootout more than likely will have you sagging in you seat rather than hanging at its edge. Even the high-speed car chase on the freeway does not generate much excitement (at least not for those who have see Matrix II). I have a feeling that this is all intentional as the focus, even in the middle of all the action, is continuously shifting back towards the relationship between Mr and Mrs, culminating in the full circle of the opening marriage counselling scene.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are two of the most stylish, cool, sexy stars in Hollywood today and far too much have already been said about their off-screen relationship. They carry the whole show, needless to say. Of their respective sidekicks, Vince Vaughn (Norman Bates in the ""Psycho"" remake!) has a little screen time and a few funny lines but Kerry Washington (wife Della Bea in ""Ray"") is all but noticeable."

The only peeve was the underutilisation of Vince Vaughn. He could have been in more scenes with more things to do instead of just having him talk your ears off.

","I recently rented this movie on DVD and watched it with someone else. We watched the movie ALMOST entirely, because about three quarters of the way through the movie we got so bored that we decided to skip to the end.<br/><br/>I decided to rent this movie after the guy at the video store told me that Mr. & Mrs. Smith was a romantic comedy with an actiony twist. I just thought ""sounds good"", and I decided to rent it with relatively high expectations, thinking that this wasn't some typical boring romantic comedy. Well, I was certainly right about that, but to be honest I actually found it even more boring than the average romantic comedy.<br/><br/>To be fair, the movie was quite funny at times, and the ""fight scene"" between the Smiths during the second part of the movie was gold. Apart from that, though, both my friend and I found it extremely dull. The only thing that kept me going through most of the movie was the sight of Brad Pitt's sexy face and bod, but even that failed to stop us from abruptly skipping to the end of the movie.<br/><br/>In short, it has a couple of cheap laughs and some very tasty eye candy, but that's all there is to it - no matter how hot you think Brad (or Angie) are, it is not worth watching this movie. It's one of those movies that are so dull that you can feel your brain eroding.<br/><br/>By the way, I'm extremely surprised (in a bad way) by the overall IMDb rating for this movie - personally I think it deserves to be a 4.8/10 at best, but even that may seem too unrealistically high."

","Full of actors pretending to be assassins pretending to be boring suburbanites, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" never convinces that it's anything more than famous people surrounded by shiny things, and doesn't seem to be trying too hard to do so. It's as if the film is so proud of having people as pretty as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie together on screen that it figures any characters they create couldn't possibly be as interesting as, well, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" feels entitled to pile contrivance upon contrivance, at times undermining its own logic, to allow Mr. and Mrs. Pitt-Jolie to slap and tickle their way through all manner of gun play and combustion.<br/><br/>John and Jane Smith, a couple of happily hired killers who ice skels before heading to the neighbors' cocktail party, have managed ""five or six"" years of marriage without realizing the truth about each other. Well, at least one of them has. After their respective Murder, Inc's send them to the same hit, they ID one another and are each given 48 hours to eliminate the other. This is unfortunate, not least because it requires them to turn their sprawling faux colonial into bullet casserole. As far as I could tell, the only reason either heads home is to participate in a lengthy shootout in which exploding drywall serves as an aphrodisiac. It's one of many sequences in ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" that exists only for its own sake. There's a set up and a double cross that eventually lead the pair to shoot at things other than each other, and to realize that, dammit, a relationship between merciless, competing guns-for-hire CAN succeed in spite of the odds.<br/><br/>""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" affects a forced whimsy that signals it's not to be taken seriously, but even so, virtually nothing that takes place in the film is at all necessary. One would think Charlie's Angels-type professional hit squads would be able to handle their own internal issues without conspiring with their competitors in an elaborate scheme to wipe out one of their own. Likewise, having been assigned to the relationship as a cover, it seems odd that one of the two would then be marked for death for being in that very relationship. But to heed such nitpicking would leave little cause for mayhem, and would expose the near total lack of chemistry between what admittedly must be one of the most beautiful couples ever to grace the screen. Without the able support of Vince Vaugh, here as so often the best thing in the film, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" would be virtually humorless. It wants the taste of Brad and Angelina it dishes to us to be enough, an appalling display of laziness and condescension. If that's all you're looking for, any recent issue of People magazine can give you the same punch far less expensively."

Now put these two together in an action flick and you have something that people want to see--no matter how unrealistic or dull it is. This had a pretty good plot and it could have been taken further, but as I said, the two main actors were more concentrated on. I did not feel them as assassins. I did not feel them as married. I did not get much from this movie. It was all right until the end of the middle, and then from there it got dull and I was hoping for it to end soon. I just did not care about what happened to these two. But I'll stop saying the negatives about this and go on to the positives. There were some funny parts like the battles that Mr. and Mrs. Smith have. I like how they are married without knowing who each other really is and that their marriage is falling apart particularly because of that.

","Does this version of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (I say version because to call it any kind of 'remake' of the Alfred Hitchcock film, with no similar plot at all, would be an insult to the master) have its occasional moments of entertainment? I suppose so, but for me that cannot constitute a good movie. A lot of the comments I have read or heard about the film from critics and others who have seen it have all said this, whether they liked it or not- 'Brad and Angelina have such chemistry, they work together so well, they're so good together, etc, etc.' I wish I could say that could make a film a success, but I get frustrated with this kind of blockbuster mentality- if the film has a story, and then it has chemistry, then it will work a lot better than without it. Mr & Mrs. Smith seems to start off with a story, about an un-happy married couple who deceive each other as each being undercover agents, soon assigned to kill one another. Or rather, this is really a premise, a set-up for what should be a better story coming along. When first hearing this, it sounded amusing, a kind of riff on the 'True Lies' scenario for two other stars, Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis. But while for that film James Cameron gave them a good story to work with, after about an hour into Mr. & Mrs. Smith, there was no story I could logistically follow, or at least have an interest in following. Although Jolie and Pitt look like they're having a good time throughout, they never seem like they're taking it farther than that. It is a thriller of the most 'popcorn' dimensions, but of actors who have brought much to other roles, I expected a little more. Also, throwing in Vince Vaughn as good measure to get laughs doesn't help matters either.<br/><br/>It might be worth watching one night on cable, or even local TV, but I wouldn't recommend Mr. & Mrs. Smith to see in the theaters- it's a film that starts of with earnest to entertain, and descends into non-sense (and not the good, laughable kind). Not a total dud, but it is one of the disappointments for me of the 2005 summer movie season."

SUCH IS NOT THE CASE WITH this waste of money called ""ms & Mrs smith"". she has talent as does Pitt. however, whoever wrote the script does NOT have talent. as a writer, i know i could have done better 15 years ago! therefore, this film is NOTHING BUT EYE CANDY for straights, gays and anyone in between. Jolie and Pitt are indeed sex symbols and rightly so--they're both hot. not only are they smart, eloquent and seem to hone their craft with every movie but they look good on camera and fantastic on the big screen. so this film i recommend for total eye candy value, so if you crave light, fluffy cotton candy rather than a cinematic snack of substance, then this film is for you. otherwise, go rent ""amelie"" or ""iris"", two fantastic foreign films of depth."

","Mr and Mrs Smith is a decent action film from director Doug Liman the man behind films like The Bourne Identity, Jumper, and Go. The film is worth seeing because of the impressive performances by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie as the title characters. The supporting cast are good in their roles including Adam Brody, Kerry Washington, Keith David, and Michelle Monaghan but they aren't given much to do and lack screen time. Vince Vaughn shows up for a small supporting role as Pitt's friend and fellow agent who does his usual thing playing a guy still living with his mother the only woman he trusts bringing some much needed comic relief to the movie. The action sequences are well executed with some going over the top but for the most part it's still an entertaining movie. The pacing may be a bit slow at times but overall Mr and Mrs Smith is a good enough action movie with solid performances by the lead actors that make it somewhat enjoyable."
"Rcwilkinson123","5","6","12","17 February 2008"," Pretty ridiculous
","While Angelina Jolie is smokin' hot, and Brad Pitt may be the same, putting two good-looking actors onto the screen with guns and telling them to shot people without looking at them doesn't exactly translate into a good movie.<br/><br/>This is where things go wrong for 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith,' whose relationship is strained by secrets. This secret? Both are secret agents, whose spouses assume they hold an entirely different and not-as-cool job.<br/><br/>Once each discover who the other really is, it's up to husband and wife to figure out if they'd rather love the other or kill the other. The banter between the two when they initially try to kill one another is the best parts of the film, and are parts that truly are enjoyable. However, it's when the two decide they'd rather fight together against an undefined and easily-defeated villain that things get messy.<br/><br/>The villain is no threat, apparently, to this super-smokin married duo who seem to be playing in a romantic comedy with lots of shooting than anything else. What's more, is the audience never really knows who the villain is or why they are a threat to Mr. and Mrs. Smith; we're just supposed to all assume that they for no explained reason want to kill the couple and Pitt, with his 50 or 60 career kills, and Jolie, with her 312, will take them out without hardly a scratch. (This includes the ""climactic"" scene where it's about 2-on-30 but they take out the baddies without a problem).<br/><br/>Unexplained, undefined, and beyond ridiculous once the actual fun of the couple's banter is over with, 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' is not, and shouldn't be, Doug Liman's crowning achievement as a director. 'Bourne Identity' and even the decent 'Jumper' can easily take that title away from this romantic/action comedy. 2 stars/4"

Yeah,3 bmws that are bulletproof cant beat a van. uh-huh. sure. not to mention they have automatics to brads/angelinas handgun. Angelina doesn't play a very good part in this movie - it feels like she forced herself too much. For example , when they are in the kitchen with guns pointed at each other , the expression on her face is just plain retarded , and its supposed to be one of anger - she looks like shes going to crack up any second.<br/><br/>Nobody should condone movies like this , these are the reason there's no creativity anymore - big bucks , big guns , bad story and a stupid premise. They should of shot brad or angelina in the first 10 mins after they found out who each other were (which shouldve obviously happened a long time ago if they're so smart). i cant say anything about the end because i got angry and turned this movie off , the only other movie I've ever done that while watching was the village. don't waste your time on this , unless you enjoy meaningless , over-the-top ,unfunny irony.1/10."

","I went to see this movie with my wife. I thought the basic premise of the movie was good, and though I got a slight tickle from one or two of the lines, for the most part I endured the show. There was plenty of action scenes for those who enjoy Hollywood pyrotechnics etc., but other than that it was complete drivel. But for my wife I would have went home half way through.<br/><br/>The plot started slowly, so I was bored for the first fifteen minutes to begin with. When we finally got to the action it was monotonous. The dialogue was hardly riveting, although there was the odd funny line. Brad Pitt looked throughout like the whole thing was an exercise in self indulgence. Jolie, less so. <br/><br/>To me this was the Warof the Roses with explosives, although I much preferred the War of the Roses to this. If you must see this film hire it on DVD - it is not worth the trip to the cinema. In a word - ""awful""."
"Baloo2","2","6","12","24 June 2005"," What a waste of a really exciting idea
","If you enjoy watching a two hour long trailer for an upcoming attraction, this is the movie for you. Like in a trailer, there's absolutely no logic, thought or attempt to explain any of the scenes, just an endless sequence of action scenes.<br/><br/>If you, on the other hand, want some comedy on the Mr & Mrs Secret Agent theme, go rent Undercover Blues or True Lies.<br/><br/>What a waste of resources this was. The basic idea is great, but I think the producers should have left out a big load of ammo and spent the then saved money on at least having someone proof read the script. Somehow I get the feeling I'd rather read the book, then at least I could expect to get all of the logical flaws of the story explained -- but unfortunately there is no such book.<br/><br/>This is truly Hollywood at it's worst, with absolutely no respect for the movie audience, only for their dollar bills. But then again, reading some of the comments here, maybe the average movie public is just as easily seduced as the industry thinks it is...?"
"dumassays","4","6","12","20 June 2005"," Mr and Mrs Smith - Awkward Couple
","'Awkward' is probably the best word I could use to describe the on screen chemistry between this supposedly married couple of 5 or 6 years. While Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are fine actors respectively, together they just didn't sell it. Another viewer I overheard as we were making our way out of the theatre commented that they had a ""totally unrealistic relationship"", which I have to agree with. For two supposed spies/hit men to not realize that they are each living a fictitious life with one another is somewhat ridiculous. Where did they park their instincts? The worst of the unrealistic points of this movie has to be when Mr. and Mrs. Smith face off. There is just something disturbing about a husband smashing his wife up against the wall and repeated blows to her abdomen. But I don't want to spoil all of the fun here, let's just say that there are two saving graces in this film, Jolie's ass whooping fight scenes and Vince Vaughan's character is a hoot! I wouldn't have thought that he could shine any brighter than he did in Be Cool, but once again Vaughan has captured my heart as the whacked out underdog in this role.<br/><br/>I think that this movie is somewhat ill-suited for the kiddies, the violence and the occasional profanity is really driven more towards the teenagers and up crowd.<br/><br/>reel2reel.blogspot.com"
"squishyjelly","6","6","12","12 June 2005"," Meh...
","The only weak aspects of this film are the cheesy dialog and somewhat overkilled action sequences. Lines like, ""There's no place I'd rather be than right here with you,"" and, when Mrs. Smith finds out about a past romance involving Mr. Smith and another woman before the couple met: <br/><br/>MRS. SMITH: What's her name and social security number? MR. SMITH: No,honey, you're not going to kill her.<br/><br/>Eh, we've heard stuff like that before. Mind you, Pitt and Jolie are no rookies, they have the ability to take this dry dialog and give it somewhat of a sub-textual backbone. I will say, however, that the counseling sequences are done very well and utilize awkwardness in a wonderfully comedic style, I enjoyed that very much.<br/><br/>As far as the action sequences go, one can pretty much predict the direction of the scenes. These predictable sequences, however, are preceded by one extremely definitive scene after Mr. and Mrs. Smith find out that they are each other's targets. This scene, my favorite from the film, could be defined as action although there is no action during this scene. Both characters know that their job is to kill one another, but they have a hard time with such an awkward situation, even for assassins like themselves.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a decent flick, but it's just that, a flick, not a work of art or the action adventure of the year. If you get a chance, see it. If you don't get the chance, that's okay too."

"hellraiser7","9","4","7","24 June 2014"," Spy vs. Spy
","Couples to me are never really entertaining to me without friction. It's hard to say why, may'be it's because though friction both are able to exercise certain emotions and feelings they never can never express to other or themselves.<br/><br/>This is an action film that I think is just a bit under the radar. OK not exactly but as time went on it has became a bit forgotten, which is a strange thing to say.<br/><br/>I really love the concept which I think is colorful idea for an espionage story but also a romance story if you can believe that. Yeah I know it seems like a bit coincidental a one in a million shot that two superspys or assassins would meet and fall in love. But cmon this is a movie, and hey like all coincidences whose to say it can't happen.<br/><br/>I really like the fact that this is an espionage/hit-man movie that is actually fun and personally their the kind I like because they make the intrigue move a lot faster and have more creative freedom, the only other film I can think of is ""Grose Point Blank"" another under the radar gem. I also like the fact that is one of those romance film to me that work because this is a could that are adults and are in a long time relationship.<br/><br/>This film is pretty much almost a live action version of Mad Magazine's Spy vs. Spy which was simply about one trying to kill the other in different colorful clever ways, which is something both of them are doing throughout most of the film.<br/><br/>I really like the dialog and the dry witty humor and there is a lot of it. Like in a neighborhood party sequence I can't help but chuckle a little as we see both are kinda board which just shows how the suburban existence doesn't' really suit both of them, their both out of place which is a feeling I can emphasize with it make no sense doing what you don't want to do. Or even my favorite which is the dinner between both John and Jane as it's really a game of psych out, trying to draw out But I just love the chemistry between both John and Jane, both of course played well by Brad Pitt and Angeline Jolie both one of my favorite actors, having both of them together was at the time something I never thought would happen (I said at the time)so this was kinda a dream come true for me.<br/><br/>It's true we don't truly know both John and Jane fully, but that's the point. Both are spys/assassins after all, hence their first names. But I also think that's what makes both their characters all the more interesting, knowing too much about a character to me makes the well of interest run dry. The reason both are on the rocks are the fact that both haven't been 100% honest with one another, simple misunderstandings, but also that they've forgotten those feelings from the past.<br/><br/>It's kinda funny and suspenseful as we see both are just clashing once the cat is out of the bag on who they both really are. You could say in a way it's a blackly humorous metaphor on how couples work out their problems with one another (well sort of); both John and Jane really take it to the next level in this film. But despite the conflict there feelings for each other are reigniting making both their feelings and the conflict even more hotter. Despite how hard both are fighting they don't hate each other, heck in each snafu they devised after another on each other they couldn't kill each other that should say something to both of them.<br/><br/>And both we can see are the same, I like how we see a parallel contrast between them as we get a glimpse at both their secret agencies which in a way are sort of two schools of espionage. John's is pretty much more low key sort of looks like an old detective agency like you'd see in the noirs or the old spy novels, while Jane's is more high tech and up to date like CTU in the TV show ""24"". It's also kinda funny how Jane's agency consists only of women but no men which is kinda strange but also a homage joke to the TV show ""Charlies Angels"" they also have a unseen boss whom is only a voice on a phone (cameo voiced by Keith David whom is another favorite actor of mine). But this also makes the conflict sort of a clash of the sexes and two schools of espionage action.<br/><br/>The action sequences I think are great and memorable. From the fight at some Wal-Mart like store which is one of my favorite battles, I always love battles that take place in those areas because their colorful, have all kinds of places to hide but also any items you need.<br/><br/>However the most memorable battle and to me personally is one of my favorite one on one battles is of course seeing both Jane and John shoot it out and duke it out in their own home. I really like how the gunfight and even the fistfight is choreographed in that sequence because it takes place in a condensed space, though it doesn't look too fancily choreography which makes it almost a bit realistic mainly the fist fight if you can believe that. It's also a bit suspenseful because it really feels like a 50 50 battle it could be anyones game.<br/><br/>It is said friction is what creates fire. And these two have made a forest fire.<br/><br/>Rating: 3 and a half stars"

","Given the plot, two people are married, they just both happen to be spies, they are then both told to go and kill each other, you would think that this would be a pretty cheesy comedy film with a little bit of action blended in. Well, to say the least, this film is to action packed for its own good. There is just little dabs of dry humor placed threw out. Nothing to special. Something to make you chuckle a bit. Sadly this small chuckle is the highlight of the film. The action out weighs the comedy by leaps and bounds, and like most action films these days, it just keeps on going and going, and doesn't know when to stop until the whole film ends up dragging. The real kicker is the one spy is a clear Charlie's Angles knock off. From the scantly clad cloths, to the unknown man giving off orders to the army of women spies. This is so painfully cheesy that you would think it would have to be funny, but surprisingly they never bring up the fact that it's a joke and just kind of treat it seriously. When you have a cheesy element you should treat it as such, or else everyone is just going to see it as some kind of cliché.<br/><br/>Oh, and here's the best part. Right here. Spoilers! The two heroes somehow topple the entire government/spy system that is after them. This is just to painful to believe. In other films like, The Bourne Identity the government covered up what had happened and cut their losses and then let Bourne live. Bourne didn't actually beat them. You can't beat them! Their the government! They control everything in these spy films! They can shove endless amounts of men down your throat. The idea of someone beating them is just so painfully dumb that it boggles the mind. This is the first ever film that I've seen to pull such a bad idea. Hopefully it will be the last.<br/><br/>So, this film was a joke, and should have been treated that way.<br/><br/>4 out of 10 Go see True Lies instead"

Or how can you believe them that they are real (so you can connect with a character in drama)? It's a pity that chemistry which is glowing and obvious between this fine actors was not being covered with a story and directing better. So either director should stick to ""try lies"" type and forget about drama or vise versa. At the end when you going out of cinema a bitter bit stops in your throat that this could be better. Someone should write a nice script for this Brad/Angelina duo and directed Academy Award performance which they could obviously give. Some English drama or love story but with real characters in which we could believe and not this summer hit killing everyone around kind of thing. To conclude kids will probably love the action, fans of Brad/Angelina would probably wait for DVD with more nude scenes and some of us will hope that they will match up again in a real movie."

Have you read the most excellent ""World's Most Dangerous Places""? Where Robert Young Pelton talks about how a Pakistani bus crash is like taking a coffee can full of mice and metal shards and shaking violently and dumping it on the ground? Well this movie is the film-making equivalent of a Pakistani bus crash. It is like they took various action movie memes and put them in a coffee can. Car chases, explosions, shootings, sex, and jumping off buildings. Then they added the metal shards. Then they shook the can really really hard* and spilled the contents out on two hours of celluloid. Only a college kid could think that shooting guns was about loud noises and pretty flashes and not some lethal experience. The soundtrack was a cross between the Pink Panther and a Daffy Duck cartoon, only clumsier. Putting the R&B great ""Express Yourself"" behind a domestic battery scene was so clumsy as to be criminal. What glib vacuous crap-- marital chit chat and banter during shootouts? Like I said, the infants that wrote, directed, and produced this movie have never ever been in any violent situation, not even a street mugging. I've been in rooms where guns are drawn in wrath and believe me, it is nothing like this tripe. The only thing that rings true in the movie is the marriage counseling, surely because all the self-absorbed people that made the movie had plenty of real-world experience in that. The movie has snail pacing at the start-- 16 minutes in and I was cleaning my nails. Then the implausibility starts. Then the flat-out absurdity. Fifty rewrites and it shows. Want a good rewrite? Vince Vaughn goes to the gyyyrll power agency where Jolie works, and one at a time asks each over-breasted airhead where Jolie is. Just as they start to answer Vince shoots them in the head. One after another. Then he goes to Brad's work and shoots that secretary and all his co-workers in the head. Then then he looks into the camera, says ""One day you'll thank me for this"" and shoots himself in the head. Then 113 minutes of stills with Brad and Angela naked. Roll credits and take the awards at Cannes. <br/><br/>Oh Christ mother of Mary, I just got to the part when she throws a knife in his leg.

When space aliens come to visit our planet they will observe this and mark the human species for extermination. OK, there are a few good things about the movie. The director took the advice of the women who commented about his Bourne movies, ""Get a tripod and some lights."" There was some steady-cam and they had to shake the frame a bit since imitation gate weave*** is more interesting than the story. At least it did not jump around in time. When the smash-cut between Bradster and Angie-Angie-pretty-Angie they at least were staying in real time. But grossing half a billion dollars? I am ashamed to share DNA with a species that finds this film entertaining. Its like people would pay 9 bucks to have those Japanese seizure-inducing anime scenes flashed in their eyes for two hours. Folks, a hit of acid is a lot cheaper and you will leave the experience far more fulfilled then when you walk out of the theatre after this stinker.<br/><br/>*Gratuitous Tropic Thunder reference. **Gratuitous Swimming With Sharks reference. ***gate weave is the tiny movements of the frame due to the imprecise repetition of the metal gate in old movie cameras and projectors."

Bogota is in fact one of the most modern, beautiful and safest metropolis in Latin America with nothing to envy to Chicago, Berlin or Buenos Aires, a murder rate lower than Washington D.C., and a springtime, somewhat cold weather. Director Doug Liman either is too disrespectful or never made any research for his film, at least on the wikipedia website.

"kwongers","9","5","10","11 June 2005"," V. entertaining  great chemistry between the leads; funny one-liners; best when it tends more toward comedy than action
","I went into this movie expecting to be entertained, and I was  very much so. ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" works very well because of the amazing chemistry between the two leads, the ridiculously good-looking Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. The film opens with John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) Smith in marriage counseling, and apparently, the magic has gone out of their marriage, probably because they can't speak truthfully about their jobs. They don't know that they are both skilled assassins, but when they are hired to do a hit on each other, the truth unravels. The plot is rather brainless, but I realized about ten minutes into the movie that I really didn't care.<br/><br/>The first part of the film is more enjoyable and successful than the second part, mainly because it's fun to watch the Smiths not realize the truth about each other and then dance on eggshells around each other when they think they know the truth. The dialogue is witty, and filled with great one-liners and double entendres. Take, for example, when John and Jane return home for dinner after trying to kill each other, and John says, in response to Jane's question of why he has returned early from his so-called business trip, ""I missed you."" She replies, matter-of-factly, ""I missed you, too."" The movie is often very funny, although most laughs come from when they're doing generic couple stuff (like seeing a counselor, eating dinner at home, brushing their teeth, etc.).<br/><br/>""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" relies mostly on the chemistry between Pitt and Jolie, and they have that in spades. The sex appeal literally explodes off the screen, and I wish the film spent more time laboring over the couple-stuff they do and not so much the explosions and action. Jolie has never looked better or more hypnotically beautiful than in this movie, and it's pretty obvious why Pitt's character falls for her almost instantly. I also thought that Jolie was great at making her Jane Smith character a real person; she brings a quiet poignancy to the role. As John Smith, Pitt is wickedly funny and excellent. He gets all the best lines. In the hands of a lesser actor, his lines would sometimes seem corny, but Pitt makes his character believable and extremely likable. The supporting characters (played by Adam Brody, Kerry Washington, and Vince Vaughn) seem a bit wasted, but this is, after all, the Brad and Angelina show.<br/><br/>My main problem with the film is the excessive (and often plodding) action scenes. While it is fun to watch Pitt and Jolie look sexy while doing cool stunts, it gets tiring pretty quickly. This is the primary reason that the last thirty minutes or so of the film aren't as witty or entertaining as the earlier moments in the film. I think the movie could have been improved if there were less physical explosions and mindless action and more of the explosive chemistry in the quieter scenes between Pitt and Jolie.<br/><br/>Despite its flaws, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is a wonderful way to spend two hours at the theatre. I plan on seeing in again at the theatres. Not a movie for anyone demanding a real plot or serious depth, but a must-see for everyone else! 8.5/10."

","Mr. & Mrs. Smith is set in New York where married couple John (Brad Pitt) & Jane Smith (Angelina Jolie) live out an unhappy existence together, what they don't know however is that they are both top secret highly trained assassins who work for different shadowy organisations. Unfortunately their respective employers discover they are married & send them both on the same mission in an attempt to have them both kill each other, the plan fails & Mr. & Mrs. Smith team up to take on their employers who want them dead at all costs...<br/><br/>Directed by Doug Liman this has to be one of the very worst big budget overblown Hollywood action adventure films ever made, I personally hated it. The script by Simon Kinberg apparently went through over fifty drafts with at least nine writers working on it during it's production & one has to say it's sort of noticeable since it's a mess. I found it impossible to relate to anyone or anything in Mr. & Mrs. Smith, the fact they two leads are ruthless assassins who seem to make a sh*t load of money & somehow are oblivious to what the other does (for five or six years) is so far fetched & fanciful they might as well have been aliens from Mars for all the reality on show here. Then there's the fact I just didn't like either character at all, the secondary character's are given absolutely nothing to do & various character's were actually cut from the film completely including the final showdown with Mr. & Mrs. Smith's bosses. I also found it lacking in decent action scenes, there's a few explosions & some really dull shoot-outs where the predictably invincible Mr. & Mrs. Smith shoot & kill all the bad guy's without getting so much as a scratch on themselves despite having rocket launchers fired at them, explosions going off around them & being significantly out numbered. Also, when they do get shot repeatedly it's revealed they both have bullet proof vests on which is fine but why didn't the otherwise heavily armed bad guy's wear bullet proof vests as well? This is just a lame, boring, silly, dull, stupid & utterly predictable waste of $110,000,000. As an action film it doesn't satisfy, as a comedy film it's not funny, as a romance it fails & as a drama it's so far removed from reality they might as well have cast two Teletubbies in the leading roles!<br/><br/>Director Liman had a huge budget at his disposable so how he managed to turn in such an unexciting film as this is beyond me. Seriously everything was here for a cracking action adventure, the huge budget, the A-list Hollywood stars, the backing of a major studio & a potentially fun story but nothing works in my opinion. There's a mildly entertaining car chase which dwells more on a domestic argument between Mr. & Mrs. Smith than actual vehicular mayhem & an OK CGI computer effect of the Smith's house blowing up (yes, despite being only a few feet away they get up & walk away without so much as a bruise) but surprisingly very little else to get the blood pumping. Maybe I'm expecting too much but a pointlessly one sided shoot-out in a superstore at the end just isn't enough to get me excited. A mixture of real stunts & CGI computer effects you can tell the difference & the scene when the women slide across New York skyscrapers on wires is just ridiculous. Probably the most memorable part of Mr. & Mrs. Smith is Angelina Jolie as a dominatrix which is shown in all the trailers, unfortunately the scene in question in reality lasts for all of 30 seconds. In fact I'd say Mr. & Mrs. Smith is one of those films which makes for a brilliant trailer, the sort of film which give publicists wet dreams as there are lots of great looking moments to edit into a three minute trailer but when you watch the finished film those are the only good bits in it!<br/><br/>With an obscene budget of about $110,000,000 I can't really see where the money went although Jolie & Pitt didn't exactly come cheap, the action really isn't that good & there's not that much of it either. Nicole Kidman was originally cast as Mrs. Smith but dropped out while Gwen Stefani, Catherine Zeta-Jones & Cate Blanchett were also considered before the terrible Jolie got the part & was reportedly paid an absolutely criminal $20,000,000 for a truly awful performance. Meanwhile Johnny Depp was cast as Mr. Smith but later turned it down & Will Smith was also considered before Pitt got the part & was also paid an extortionate $20,000,000 for turning in a terrible performance. Nice work if you can get it I suppose. The rest of the cast barely figure & have nothing to do at all.<br/><br/>Mr. & Mrs. Smith could have been brilliant, in the hands of a decent action director I'm sure the $110,000,000 could have been put to good use to make an exciting & fun James Bond type action adventure, as it is were left with this boring family friendly crap mixture of action, romance & comedy. So much potential yet so much disappointment."

","I have said that I've fallen asleep during action sequences in movies; and it happened in ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"". The noise, the energy, the adrenaline are all stuff that should easily keep me awake, or wake me up if I sleep. But it is impossible, even more when they're pointless, like in this movie. As an action film, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" sucks.<br/><br/>Now you're wondering if it works as the other things it seems to be trying to achieve. The answer is that it could, but lacks the potential in few but important details. It is not a terrible movie, no, but it has its things. Whoever wants to accept those things, because of reasons I'll explain now, there they go; but I can't.<br/><br/>""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is the typical summer film that arrives at the time of the year where the audience wants to have fun. The package of its type includes two hot and well known stars playing the lead roles, an attempt for chemistry and fun and stuff blowing up everywhere, generally (""Bad Boys II"").<br/><br/>All those are nice elements, and even if they work well or not, the package comes with a mix of genres that confuse the ones who look for something more than amusement. It's not that I'm always looking something more than having fun, but when the fun comes from nowhere, I can't laugh. Simon Kinberg's script is a union of unfinished ideas put into paper, including confusing time fixation, incoherent scene connections and very (really) very little plot substance whatsoever. The rest of the team, very familiar to these types of film, makes its best to get the visuals correctly and not to screw up, which turns impossible because of the script and Doug Liman's direction that tends to mock his own style and film. The man has done interesting films; I don't know who dragged him into this.<br/><br/>The thing is that it happens to me with these movies, where I am never satisfied. I couldn't explain what a movie needs to satisfy me right now, but it's never enough. I compare this film with ""Hollywood Homicide""; it could have been so much better. There you had Josh Hartnett and Harrison Ford having fun in a stupid story that lasted for two hours. Here, the theme is similar, although ironically opposite (you'll understand if you saw the latter one), and you have the ""hot as hell"" Angelina Jolie playing Mrs. Smith and the ""sex symbol"" Brad Pitt playing her husband. We also get well known directors in small roles, the authentic Vince Vaughn (Eddie), who's always nice to see, as Pitt's ally, and my man from ""The O.C""; Adam Brody (Benjamin Diaz). He is not given much to do, but for a start he shows his comedic talent in every one of his words. I don't want to say much more, but I find the boy a very promising actor; great things are ahead of him.<br/><br/>The package, as what it tends to achieve, it's perfect. There's an excellent chemistry between the two leads, who besides being hot and well known, are good actors. The best scenes of the piece, where they show their comedic timing, are developed in a marriage consultancy office; you can tell they're both having fun. And the people, yes; they'll attend. There'll be money butWhere's the movie?"

But he has understood how to engineer layers and he might have led the charge, or perhaps been chosen by some savvy producer because he knew what he was doing.<br/><br/>In any case, the layers here are three, but they are in tones of reality rather than in story lines, overlapping motives, time slices, or so-called plot ""twists.""<br/><br/>You have the layer of reality that only two people inhabit. That's a world unto itself. Then you have a background world of comings and goings, of hits and threats, of nefarious motivations and all. This is derived from the old world of noir.<br/><br/>The noir influence is that people don't matter. People die, innocents die, the world plays with fate for its own amusement. The inadequacy of the story supports this: the two work for two independent agencies so it makes sense that each of them (neither one of which is an official agency) would want them dead if ""exposed."" But it hardly makes sense that the CIA (that's the CIA building in the beginning) wants to arrange to have them exposed. It only makes sense if it is a noir world, the world of ""The Big Clock.""<br/><br/>There's a third layer on top, a setup of chairs in a marriage counselor's office. This ""world"" annotates the one that the two inhabit as assassins, and that sits above the background noir world.<br/><br/>Each of these has a different cinematography, literally a different lens. Each has a different art design, a different approach to costumes and most importantly a different approach to acting. The office has the two acting to us, building a bridge to the audience; the second has them acting to each other, with the effect of apparent sexual chemistry. The third acting style is the Bruckheimer/Harlan interaction-by-destruction stuff.<br/><br/>Each of these affects the other to some amazingly small degree, even to the point of ambiguity about what happens at the end. Do they die in a Butch and Sundance manner and we see a ""Taxi Driver"" afterdeath memory? No, all is deliberately vague, past vagueness into nonsense.<br/><br/>Because that notion of different sense allows the script to have layers without us working at it.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

However, the film loses its course when fulfilling the action obligation of the genre. The action scenes are loud and filmed with a trembling hand by director Doug Liman (Go, The Bourne Identity). Further, the unnamed foe is altogether disinteresting: all the baddies are 'jobbers'; not one is a 'real' character in the film (heck, we don't even see their faces!).<br/><br/>Thankfully, the comedy half is much better.

"oshram-3","3","7","16","11 June 2005"," Other than the stars a waste of your time
","The film's concept is a derivative of the wildly uneven True Lies, only this time both husband and wife lead a boring double life instead of just one partner. And that's about as deep as we get. We've got Brad! We've got Angelina! Who needs anything else? Okay, so the film isn't the disgusting train wreck that Bewitched probably will be (notice the strong shift in the ad campaign, anyone?), but it's a long, long way from what it could have been. True Lies worked because Arnie played the role to perfection, the division between his real life and his work life was well done, and, frankly, Tom Arnold gave his best performance ever.<br/><br/>Here, we don't have the skill that movie took to make. Of course, while I'm no huge James Cameron fan, he at least knows how to direct. The same cannot be said of indie fave Doug Liman (Go and Swingers, two utterly reprehensible films), whom you'd think would have learned something about spy flicks from working on TWO Bourne movies, but no. Care to make it worse? The screenwriter (and that term is used in a very loose sense), Simon Kinberg, was the 'script doctor' for Elektra and Charlie's Angels 2. In any country where I made the laws, they could put you to death for such gross incompetent mangling of the English language (those movies had script doctors? Hollywood really is in an advanced state of decline).<br/><br/>Smith tries to balance the line between action film and comedy and fails at both. The lines aren't funny (there's a very few chuckles) and the action is all rote, things blowing up and tons of bad guys flying through the air. At least John and Jane (no kidding, those are the character's names) get a little bloody, but not much. Can't distract people from that glamour make-up and lighting.<br/><br/>Which is too bad, because Pitt and Jolie are two of the most likable stars on the screen these days, and their pairing should have set off sparks (it does occasionally, but with much less wattage than you would expect). A potentially hilarious scene after they learn the truth of each other's identities and set about exposing all the lies they've told is bungled by having it take place in the middle of an extended and uninteresting car chase. Much like action, dialogue requires a certain rhythm to work at its best; but why should the man who 'script doctored' Elektra know anything about writing? In the end Smith is mere Hollywood pap; show the flyovers some pretty faces, blow some stuff up, make them laugh a little bit, give them a few sexy scenes to fantasize about. Smith isn't a reprehensible film  the mere presence of Pitt and Jolie pretty much negates that possibility  but it is shockingly hollow given what it could have been. Even these two stars can't elevate this film to much more than watchable, sadly enough. With the right (or any) writing, directing, and editing, this could have been a fun movie. Pity it's not."

I cannot imagine any other acting duo pulling off this complicated and very physical movie plot with as much style and energy as Pitt and Jolie as Mr. and Mrs. ""Bored by this marriage"" Smith. A good Saturday night movie with just the right amount of date night ""chick flick"" attraction and lots of testosterone to share. I love it when Pitt (Mr. Smith) tells Jolie (Mrs. Smith), ""Your new curtains are hideous,"" just as she's about to evaporate him with a computer bomb. It's no wonder she flips out at him when he complains relentlessly about her cooking. But Pitt is always on the James Stewart high road when his nemesis Jolie plays entirely hard to get - and gets even at every turn. This film is plain fun to watch. I'd even watch it again."

","I had previously decided to avoid this movie at the cinemas and when I actually watched it on TV, it confirmed my suspicions. Poor acting, predictable story-line. Trying to kill each other followed by love making doesn't digest easily. We've all grown up concerning cheesy action films. It was OK in the 80's with movies such as Commando, but come on, 2 people against 15 to 20 assassins armed to the teeth. The smiths standing in the middle of the room, every shot whistling by them whilst they shoot every bad guy down. Sure it's the movies, but at least try to make it somewhat believable.

It contains so little humor, so little wit, and so little irony, I got the feeling that the film could have been better as a short. <br/><br/>Without the big star names, the film would have died at the box office. It could have starred Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam -- two characters that were always at each others throats. At least Bugs and Yosemite were funny. Pitt and Jolie are not. <br/><br/>Rated PG13, this movie is unsuitable for audiences of any age. It has no value for tweens, teens, or adults. It is definitely juvenile, but unsuitable for kids. That is the most irony that you'll find in this film.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint is that these two hit-men shoulda shot me half-way through the movie to put me out of my misery!

","If you like typical Hollywood formulaic garbage then this ""film"" is for you. The computer generated FX will excite your tractable senses at just the right and regular moments, and the synthesized music will lead your emotions with crescendos and decrescendos of sounds that elicit proper responses from you without having to do much thinking. The poor directors and producers that had to watch the dailies without the quizzical music score must have found the dialogues between Pitt and Jolie the perfect sedative. The watchdog groups who count shots-fired from guns will never keep up, and of course, the two pretty actors never get a scratch amidst constant bullet storms. In fact, they can carry on a glib and ""clever"" 90 minute running ""humorous"" marital snit while engaging in withering firefights, as if their insipid dialogue is more salient than fighting for their lives. It is too bad that Pitt is only in it for the money these days, and that A River Runs Through It was his only good acting challenge, albeit stroked and coaxed by Redford; and Jolie's lips need a bit more collagen to keep them poofy and vulva-like. The foley artists must have been exhausted trying to cram in the ""Most Sound FX of any Motion Picture"" for the Academy snobs.

","A pretty entertaining film featuring two mega-wat stars in what could have been a major disaster. John and Jane Smith (Anjelina Jolie and Brad Pitt) play an unhappily married couple that lead separate and very secret lives as paid assassins working for different agencies. When they inadvertently get assigned the same target, they must off each other because they need to eliminate the competition. I guess it's bad for husband and wife to be competing assassins. I don't know, for about 45 minutes they spend a lot of time shooting up the house and throwing knives at one another. That stuff is actually a lot of fun.<br/><br/>This is a pretty witty film as well as a pretty violent one minus a lot of gore and bloodshed. The plot is muddled, which is a big weakness, but Pitt and Jolie seem to be having so much fun trying to out do each other and the chemistry is terrific between the two of them. The stunts are very well choreographed and the action scenes work.<br/><br/>This isn't a great film, but it's a fun movie that will soak up two hours and you'll enjoy it. (***)"

Angelina, you're a great gal, but your acting skills - well, to quote the film ""Who's Your Daddy Now""..... Jon Voight, honey, and he could teach you a lot, Angie. The Soundtrack was excellent - and the climatic fist fight between the two protagonist was wonderfully choreographed. But, I have to admit it, that knowing that these two Beautiful People were falling madly in lust and love with each other during the making of the film made it a very interesting viewing experiences......were they acting or not in that sexy dance scene? Was he thrilled that the film allowed such physical interaction between him and Ms. Jolie? Was she anxious that she'd betray she desired him when they were ""acting""?

Scenes reminiscent of the Matrix: 6/10 If you tried hard, some scenes could remind you of the Matrix (1 and 2)--the slow motion shooting scenes, some of the highway chase scenes. I give this category a high score because it proved to be helpful in surviving this, the Longest Evening of My Life.<br/><br/>7.

The movie features several minutes of hardcore bashing, stomping, kicking, bottle braking on head, gouging and unloading of firearms toward husband and wife. I timed the action and I am pleased to tell you that each party played offense for exactly the same amount of time.

"zetes","6","5","11","23 June 2005"," Uneven action comedy starring two of Hollywood's biggest and most attractive stars
","When it's good, it's good, but it takes way too long to establish the premise. Two rival spies with licenses to kill get married, but they don't know each other's secret. Five or six years into the marriage, they find out and are each ordered to kill the other. That's fine with them, as their marriage is kind of fizzling. It's a golden concept, but the trailers and commercials have already informed 99.99% of the audience of it. We really don't need 40 minutes of Pitt and Jolie acting like a stereotypical cold married couple. Plus, the movie starts with a flashback to when the two met in Bogota, Columbia. Neither seems to wonder at all why the other was in such a turbulent part of the world in the first place. After about 40 minutes, during which I was concentrating on Angelina Jolie's outrageously sexy body and face lest I fall asleep, after the two have found out about each other, it begins to pick up with some very entertaining action sequences. I love how the movie plays the generic problems of married couples against the background of espionage and professional killing. The movie is going along very well for most of its remainder, but, unfortunately, it doesn't end well. They seem to be going for a Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid ending, but, of course, in a summer blockbuster, that ain't gonna cut it. Vince Vaughn co-stars. I don't know about him. He always seems to be just on the verge of being funny, but he never quite makes it there. Adam Brody, the nerd/hunk second banana from Fox's The O.C., also has a nice little role. He has a couple of the film's funniest lines. The body count of this movie has to be at least at 50, and guns are a'blazin' constantly. The film was rated PG-13 by the MPAA  but only after a sex scene was cut out. You've got to love the MPAA!"
"tfrizzell","Null","5","11","22 June 2005"," Red Alert in the Chemistry Lab.
","Pre-release rumors of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie being romantically linked in real life become a distraction that was not needed in this brain-dead demolition derby that is full of incoherent elements. Pitt and Jolie are an unhappily married couple who are both really government assassins who have hidden their true lives from one another. Amazing to me that these two experts could not know the real truth about their marriage. Either these are the two sneakiest spies in the history of film or two of the dumbest (I side with the latter). Anyway the secrets hit the fan, chaos strikes and the chemistry between our two leads hits a fevered pitch that makes you ignore the stupid story all together. Comic relief from scene stealers Vince Vaughn (as Pitt's most trusted ally) and enigmatic wise-crack Adam Brody (of ""The O.C."" fame) become two more unnecessary distractions that ultimately lead nowhere. Brody gets immersed in the middle of the entire dizzying exercise as finding him becomes a top priority for the star duo. ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is like being in a high school and watching the senior quarterback and head cheerleader date. At times their routine may be cute or endearing and at other times you want to strangle them both because of their sickening relationship together. To say that Pitt and Jolie do not have a heated chemistry on the screen would be an outright lie, but honestly this is nothing but a whole lot of noise that represents a bare minimum of cinematic thought. Kind of like a science lab exploding and no one really caring. 2.5 out of 5 stars."

","John and Jane Smith have been married for five or six years and there marriage is going through a bit of a rough patch the events that follow will either bring them back together or kill them! Each of them thinks the other has an ordinary job but in fact they each work as assassins for rival organisations; when they get sent after the same target there is bound to be trouble. They end up shooting at each other and the target gets away; believing they could be identified each is given forty eight hours to kill the other. At this point they don't realise who the rival assassin was but when they find out they quickly stop trusting each other and start trying to shoot each other! After shooting up the house they realise that they genuinely love each other; the problem is now both their organisations are using all their resources to eliminate Mr and Mrs Smith!.<br/><br/>While this isn't a classic film it is rather fun in a very silly way. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie do well in the leading roles even though they have both been better in other films. The story is of course preposterous but if you can suspend your disbelief and but your brain in neutral it is worth watching. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments and the action is fairly intense without any gore or real unpleasantness the final shoot out manages to be action packed and hilarious at the same time! Over all I'd say this is definitely worth watching if it is on television or if the DVD is in the bargain bin."

","In addition to being the film which turned out to be the genesis for the greatest media circus since OJ, MR. & MRS. SMITH is one of the most richly entertaining, though highly improbable, action adventure yarns to come down the pike in quite a while and was responsible for creating a media firestorm which has come to be known as ""Brangelina."" Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star as John and Jane Smith, married assassins who have somehow been able to keep their occupations from each other for five (or six) years of marriage because they work for different organizations. Things heat up when they are both assigned to the same case in an effort by their respective agencies to take each other out and that's where the fun begins. If you don't think about it at all and just let the story flow over you, fun can be had here. The film boasts energetic direction, a surprisingly deft screenplay, a superb musical score, enough technical gadgetry to make James Bond proud and yes, the on screen chemistry between the leads is positively kinetic...it just about burns a hole in the screen. Brangelina make a white hot team and if you keep an open mind, this a richly entertaining fantasy-action-adventure that is an entertaining roller coaster ride right to the end credits."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","7","2","3","6 August 2006"," Pleasantly playful little Hollywood romp
","John and Jane Smith are an ordinary married suburban couple, with ordinary and fairly monotonous lives and a marriage that is devoid of any passion or romance. What they don't know about each other is that they both work as contract-killers - for competitive firms. Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) is enticing entertainment at a high level, teasing you almost every step of the way. <br/><br/>The controversy surrounding Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's relationship certainly boosted and propelled the film when it was released - so was it all a publicity hoax? Only time will tell. In any case, Pitt and Jolie are sexy, dynamic, flirtatious and and playful as the married leads, thereby giving the film that little extra spark in the eye. Even when they are just sitting by the dinner table together, exchanging suspicious looks, the film plays on their sexual chemistry. Funnyman Vince Vaugh adds a subtle comedic edge in the role of Mr. Smith's assassin-colleague.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the novelty of this sexual chemistry wears off sometime in Mr. & Mrs. Smith and this is a fatal failure for the whole film as it relies to heavily on this magnetism. It thereby becomes a bit too long and the plot is paper-thin, so that aspect can impossibly help carry the film once Pitt and Jolie's attraction is no longer a useful device. Nevertheless, I think everyone can find _something_ they like in Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), because it really is quite a bit of fun. <br/><br/>7/10"
"jantoniou","7","2","3","5 June 2006"," Thoroughly enjoyable, if conventional popcorn flick...
","This is a hard movie to not enjoy. Yes, a true afternoon popcorn pleaser, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" takes off in flight early and never fails to keep your attention.<br/><br/>The plot is solid, enjoyable, and not too twisty. It keeps you interested all the way through. There aren't many moments to sit on your laurels and rest a bit--the director keeps the gas on the floor throughout.<br/><br/>Is the Brad-and-Angelina chemistry Hepburn-and-Tracy chemistry? Well, perhaps not, but really awfully close. Brad and Angelina bounce off each other kinetically and beautifully. I used to despise Brad's vague surfer-esquire Keanu-like delivery, but I'm starting to really like him as an actor, albeit his ""range"" will never win him an Oscar (unlike Tracy).<br/><br/>Angelina melts the camera lens every time. Not much more to say other than she's simply spectacular. As long as her cheekbones, skin, and lips hold up--another 10-15 years you think?--she's got a long career ahead of her if she chooses it. Hard to believe she was the techie vixen in ""Hackers."" This is a movie that centers ENTIRELY on Brad and Angelina, with the exception of Vince Vaughn playing his usual hungover ADD rapid-fire stereotype that remains virtually changed since ""Swingers"" came out 10 years ago. Like Ben Stiller, his delivery and style never changes from one movie to the next, but that's why I like him (unlike Stiller, who comes across flat across all his movies).<br/><br/>The action sequences also double effectively as interludes for a kind of romantic comedy. There's some genuinely hilarious one-liners throughout. I give the director (and editor, most likely) credit for integrating these neatly into the film.<br/><br/>Many of the action sequences, especially the final one, are completely unbelievable. I found myself laughing when they are SURROUNDED by 15 special ops guys with Uzis who can't seem to hit the broad side of a barn. But that's Hollywood for you, isn't it?<br/><br/>This would have been a lot more fun to watch in a theater, but, alas, unless I get a 60"" HDTV deposited on my door step today, I'll have to enjoy it in all its squished analog 480p glory.<br/><br/>In short: Completely worth a watch."
"mark2005-1","4","2","3","20 January 2006"," Let's put this in perspective
","I did not enjoy this movie, despite giving it 60 minutes to capture my attention. My wife is a fan of Brad Pitt (looks over talent, to which she'll agree) and I rented the movie as a surprise for her. My choice in films usually tends to the more serious; I guess this is a reflection of my age (32) and the reasons I watch them, which include a desire to be immersed in another reality, like fiction, but with characters or situations I can identify with. However, if I cannot directly identify with the plot I am open to learning more about myself through characterisation and the themes of the writer and director.<br/><br/>This week I also saw 'Batman Begins', and I found this to be dark, engaging, and well worth the rental price. 'Mr & Mrs Smith' was more like an extended music video, or trailer, and I could not continue watching after an hour. My wife soldiered on, but even she was disappointed. Having two attractive actors does not make a film! I found the discussion on other posts distracting when they became immersed in whether one can state ""This movie is really bad"" or likewise. Surely the point of this forums is to provoke debate about the merits of each film? Many people read these before spending money on seeing a film, and I am happy to put my opinion across in a constructive manner to allow them to make informed choices.<br/><br/>I fear that Brad's best days are behind him (12 Monkeys) and he is content to be a major box office draw who performs in below-average films (see Oceans Twelve - an unmitigated disaster). Compare Clooney's ouevre with Pitt's for an idea of a man who is both handsome and talented.<br/><br/>Lecture over.

"mentalcritic","5","2","3","22 June 2005"," Underwhelming
","Mr. and Mrs. Smith had just about everything one could ask for. Two actors who, when cast correctly, could excel. If you dispute that, you obviously haven't seen Fight Club or Girl, Interrupted. A premise that, if executed properly, could translate into an awesome story. A budget that, if utilised properly, could fund a no-holds-barred, knuckle-down action sequence or four. You may have noticed by now that I am qualifying every one of those statements. The reason I did so is because the people responsible for this film did none of these things. The actors, while doing a credible job, get to capitalise on few, if any, of their strengths. Jolie does a great job of acting out the conflict she feels at her assignment, but Pitt is not even able to play to the sick sense of humour that he showed he had down to an art in Fight Club (which is somewhat amusingly referenced late in this film).<br/><br/>The story is as deep as a puddle, which is the first strike against the film. Two mercenaries meet while on assignment in a South American country where the police have the power to detain anyone they feel looks suspicious. Two mercenaries get married. Two mercenaries live together for six years without any idea of what the other's real profession is. Fast forward six years, and both mercenaries are seeing a marriage counselor because they are starting to tire of their union. Then they both find themselves on the same assignment. Once they learn the truth behind one another's cover stories, all hell breaks loose, and both of their agencies decide they are a liability. Cue some Rambo-esquire scenes where both professionals hit their enemy with two or three out of four shots, while the enemy cannot hit the sidewalk with a can of paint. Admittedly, one of these sequences where four cars are progressively destroyed was a clever idea, but the lack of any depth to any of the characters leaves one checking their watch as the frames roll by.<br/><br/>The second problem, which merely serves to compound the first, is that the director seems to have a major problem with letting the audience see what is happening during his action sequences. The camera weaves about in so many directions during the climactic battle that one cannot help but think the director was drunk. I've heard the defence used for this technique so many times that it is meant to place the viewer in the action. It does nothing of the kind. Fortunately, it only gave me headaches this time, but as one popular critic puts it, the first rule of any action scene should be that the audience gets to see the action. The second rule of any action scene should be that ***the audience gets to see the action***. How many times do we have to point this out before Hollywood gets the message and realised that replacing the current MPAA with one whose colons aren't able to produce diamonds is the answer, not producing films these morons consider ""safe"" by shaking the hell out of the camera?<br/><br/>Apart from the shaky-cam, which has caused me to bite chunks out of my tongue in some films, Mr. and Mrs. Smith also suffers from a distinct lack of structuring. It is almost as if Simon Kinberg decided we would automatically care about his married heroes, and decided they did not need any background. You know about as much about them when the film ends as you do when the opening credits roll. Compare this with Grosse Pointe Blank, where John Cusack's character starts out as your everyday man in a job he is bored with, reunites with an old girlfriend, starts comparing his past with a number of more domestic possible futures, and discovers he is wanted to hit a target that makes him have a crisis of conscience. I doubt that the people who put Mr. and Mrs. Smith together would even be able to spell the phrase ""crisis of conscience"". Neither of these assassins even indicate that they know what a crisis or a conscience is. When both actors do scenes in which they indicate they feel their marriage is boring and formulaic, their body language suggests that they believe this of the film. The audience certainly will about fifty-five minutes in.<br/><br/>There are films that are so good they achieve immortality, both for themselves and the people who made them. There are some films that are so stupid they are brilliant, or so bad they are excellent. Mr. and Mrs. Smith fits into neither of these categories. It is not even good enough to pass for a mildly distracting action film. Nor is it good enough to pass for a saleable Mills & Boon. By failing to fall into any of these applicable categories, it falls into No Man's Land. See it if you can get in cheaply, but otherwise, it is not worth the effort."

","I know Hollywoods propensity for retreading or rehashing earlier films - it's so much easier than thinking - but hasn't anyone noticed that the 'plot' is a complete rip-off of the 1985 film 'Prizzi's Honour' made with Kathleen Turner and Jack Nicholson, which was in turn taken from the novel by the brilliant, late, writer Richard Condon. At least the remake of his novel 'The Manchurian Candidate' last year gave some acknowledgement even though it was probably far inferior to the Harvey/Sinatra film of 1959.<br/><br/>I'll probably go to see this but I doubt if it will be a patch on the Turner/Nicholson film."

Sub-plots begun and left hanging, only one twist introduced with some difficulty, and too many contradictions and gaps left unresolved. Overall, pretty big disappointment.<br/><br/>On the bright side, great action scenes, innovative fight sequences and unbelievable chemistry between the two stars.

","Mr. And Mrs. Smith might be the textbook definition of Hollywood entertainment: two beautiful movie stars, whose on-screen chemistry can only be overshadowed by their possible off-screen romance, starring in a spyesque action flick from a director whose definite sense of style underscores the film nicely, without ever making it about him. It may not be Macbeth, but this steak has sizzle.<br/><br/>However, it's not this steak's obvious sizzle, but the unexpected meat on its bones that turns the film into a real delight. The seemingly simple premise about two assassins that get married without ever revealing their real day jobs to each other is just the vehicle that writer Simon Kinberg and director Doug Liman use to delve into a more complex subject, a stale marriage.<br/><br/>John Smith (Brad Pitt) and Jane Smith (Angelina Jolie) meet, while on separate assignments in Bogota, Columbia. There's an immediate spark between these beautiful strangers, and it's not long before marriage bells ring. Five or six years later, depending on which Smith you ask, the spark is gone, and while each on enjoys his/her own success in the exciting world of contract killing, the marriage is failing and they resort to counseling in an attempt to save their boring, suburban union.<br/><br/>Failed marriages is a topic so many Americans are familiar with, and one of the film's strengths is that it spends plenty of time chronicling there lifestyle. We watch the Smiths go through their daily routine; they argue over new curtains, attend a neighborhood party, and definitely do not have sex Fate steps in when Jane and John are assigned to off the same person. Out in the field they each interfere with their spouse's plan of action and end up trying to kill each other. Using evidence taken from the scene of the attempted crimes, the two identify each other as competing agents before rushing home and expressing how they missed each other over dinner.<br/><br/>This is where the real fun begins as all the frustration built up over six years of marriage is let out in a barrage of humor and violence. Jolie and Pitt trade barbs and gunfire before realizing they cannot kill each other. Instead they team up to fight off their respective agencies, who now want them both dead, all the while revealing the secrets that have been swept under the carpet all these years.<br/><br/>Doug Liman, whose impressive resume includes Swingers and The Bourne Identity, keeps the story grounded in the characters, who deliver more wit and humor then can be found in most mainstream comedies. The action sequences are directed with a John Wu like grace and do not invigorate so much as provide moments for the characters to entertain. Anyone who has ever had a long term relationship can empathize with the Smiths as they duke out their frustrations.<br/><br/>It's hard to imagine a hotter couple, either on or off-screen, than Pitt and Jolie. Luckily this film is not satisfied with simply presenting us with this eye candy. Instead a clever script, deft direction, and two fine performances create two hours of classic entertainment."

The only good thing about this movie was Ms. Jolie who is excellent in anything she appears in. Take my advice on this weak weak story and pass by any of the versions of this, whether on the big screen, or on DVD's. Save yourself some money on this bomb and bypass it where ever it is showing."

","With the tremendous success of ""The Bourne Identity"" 2002 and ""The Bourne Supremacy"" 2004, director/producer Doug Liman is established as a filmmaker who truly understands what makes an action/suspense movie work. This summer's ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" with the pairing of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie once again firms up Liman's credibility and peerless delivery of a blockbuster supreme.<br/><br/>""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is sheer fun and chemistry. Definitely Hollywood packaged, valued entertainment product. If you want star power - sure got it with Pitt and Jolie. If you want fun and action (over the top explosive effects) - 'tis solidly included even with dashes of romantic notions for the taking. Yes, the beginning scene (in front of therapist/counselor) seems to be a departure/side-stepping scene, reminded me of ""When Harry Met Sally"" - the talk/exchange about marriage has its subtle stabs at humor. It's a slick, stylish, hi-tech bullet-flying movie, literally about a couple of assassins. Thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining. (Of course you're not supposed to take any of the plot seriously. Sheer amusement.) <br/><br/>The title is reminiscent of Hitchcock's only comedy, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" 1941, with screwball comedy queen, Carole Lombard opposite Robert Montgomery. In a way, I felt Liman has injected some of the principles of screwball comedy into his ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith,"" and he knows where to draw the line and keeps the action sequences exciting and effectively congruent with the 'quieter' segments - not letting go of the suspense thread loosely.<br/><br/>For this movie experience, I felt the music by John Powell played an important part in complementing the action sequences and repartees between the two leads. Kudos to Liman's direction and vision, tight and enjoyable plots kept well in rein. Of course, Pitt and Jolie delivered charming performances to no end, even 'simply' doing action stunts."

","Mr. and Mrs. Smith (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie) are unhappily married to each other. They think the other has a quiet respectable job...but they are actually hired assassins for opposing companies. Then they each get a job...to kill the other one. Did I mention this is supposed to be a comedy?<br/><br/>The premise is a good one and it's played (relatively) straight...but this doesn't work completely. As an action movies it does succeed--there are tons of gunfights, some really incredible stunts and multiple explosions--typical turn off your mind summer movie fun. But as a comedy it doesn't work at all. For starters the lines just aren't that funny. It's also hard to laugh in a movie where at least a hundred people are shot to death or knifed (but there's no blood so I guess that makes it OK). The casual violence in this is STRONG and there's a fight between Pitt and Jolie that I found way too violent to be amusing. There is one funny bit--when a prisoner is being questioned he's wearing a ""Fight Club"" T shirt.<br/><br/>On the plus side Pitt and Jolie are just great. Who knew they could do comedy so well? The lines are lousy but they give them their all. Also they work VERY well together and there's a great chemistry between them. Also they're both very physically attractive. They make to movie bearable. Vince Vaughn and Adam Brody are in supporting roles but given nothing to do.<br/><br/>So I'd love to see Pitt and Jolie together again--in a better movie. I give this a 7--mostly for them."
"jon.h.ochiai","9","4","9","14 June 2005"," The Smiths Rock
","The term ""chemistry"" is often used to describe that ethereal quality in movies, and rarely is it used accurately or precisely. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie absolutely have ""it"". Consequently, Director Doug Liman's ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is one of the most enjoyable movies in recent memory. When Pitt and Jolie are on screen, they could be in an elevator baring automatic weapons, not saying a word (which actually happens), and be simply captivating. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are the screen's most stunning couple. Granted they are both simply beautiful, and charismatic presences. Though when they are on the screen together it is pure chemistry. Acknowledge Liman for keeping the romance in the foreground, in a well orchestrated action movie-- so to speak. This is no small accomplishment.<br/><br/>Simon Kinberg wrote the screenplay for ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" 5 years ago as his Master's Thesis. I had read that his screenplay evolved through numerous rewrites. Kinberg's story has a novel premise. John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) Smith have been married for 5 or 6 years (depending on whose account), and their marriage has gone stagnant. John is a successful contractor. Jane is the CEO of an Internet company. They live in a comfortable home in an up scale neighborhood. We are introduced to the Smiths in their marriage counseling session, where John asks for clarification in rating their sex life-- he wants to know if 10 or 1 represents the highest. This is an example of the wonderful touches Kinberg provides. Turns out that John and Jane are expert professional assassins working for rival companies-- unbeknown-st to each other. The story seems to imply that both rival companies are contracted to ""The Company"", though this is inherently vague. Pretty much it seems that John and Jane's targets are ""bad guys"". When an FBI hostage, Adam Brody (Benjamin Diaz), is independently identified as their next job, their secrets are invariably revealed. Note this comes as no surprise, being this is the what the movie is advertised as. Predictably John and Jane become each other's next job. Now the fun really begins.<br/><br/>Pitt and Jolie are really deft and skilled performers. They play their roles straight-- there is no winking at the camera. This is the real charm of ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"". You have smart and charming actors playing smart and charming characters in a preposterous situation. The sense of humor derives from the situations. Pitt as John is so at ease and natural, and proves he has a talent for comedy, because he is not trying to be funny. Pitt also gives John an underlying strength. Jolie as Jane has this amazing cool and composure that is completely charming. Jolie is also brilliant at providing Jane a hint of vulnerability. Pitt and Jolie can also crank up the intensity on a dime. One can tell that both are having fun making ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"". There is a hilarious and vicious fight scene where both are attempting to kill each other. In the cut away scene John is soccer kicking Jane, until she strategically kicks him. Liman then expertly tailors this to a character arc between John and Jane. Pitt and Jolie are amazing in this narrative and character shift. Ultimately, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is about the power of love and the value of relationships. This sets a touching carve-out in what is an exquisitely orchestrated action thriller. The movie also never takes itself seriously-- very smart.<br/><br/>The Smiths may have gotten married as the perfect cover. Recalling how both met, their smoldering affair, and their present state of marriage, John and Jane must choose whether it is worth fighting for. There is some twisted humor in depicting a marriage where both partners are literally out to kill each other. Liman and Kinberg set up the joke and know that there is catharsis in the resolution. The bottom line is that love and honor are always worth fighting for. Always. So do Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are awesome in Doug Liman's very fun and captivating ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"". I truly would love see ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith II"". Really."

","Can you imagine having a job that has to be kept a secret from your significant other? Well that is what the movie Mr. and Mrs. Smith is all about! Everyday they go to work. Both of them keep their jobs confidential until they are on the same case in order for them to go after one another. What happens when they find out they are in a marriage full of lies? Will they stay together or will one of them die?<br/><br/>The characters and setting of this movie are very important. There are two main characters that the movie refers to, John and Jane, who are really Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolene. Eddie is also another character that is seen frequently and he is really known as Vince Vaughn. John and Jane say they have been married for six years in their counseling session. The main settings of this movie include: The Smith's home, Jane's work in New York, and John's work office. There are many more scenes that this movie takes place at like the desert, the car they drove together when they are being chased and many more. Now what exactly happens in the movie? <br/><br/>The movie dates back to six years ago when Jane meets John at a hotel for the first time. They spend that night together and during the day they go to a fair. At one of her counseling sessions, Jane tells the counselor that some things are not spoken of and that they have secrets. They both go off to work events the same night and return but neither says much about their work events. At work the next day, John hears about his next job. Jane appears at her work, where she too is assigned her next job. Little do they know they both were purposely assigned to the same case. She is waiting for the suspect in a desert area. Jane then sees a civilian and shoots, which really is John, so then he shoots off a big missile and she leaves. John then tells Eddie that he got his ""ass handed by some girl"". John then goes to her work and sees Jane's name on a tag. At the same time she is watching the video and realizes the civilian is her husband.<br/><br/>During dinner that night they are catching onto one another. Once they drop a bottle of wine, they both disappear. Jane leaves the house and John grabs a gun. He runs after her in the car and shoots at the car and they continue to fight down the street. The next day John ends up showing up at her work and tells her she needs to disappear, but she says no. In the next scene he is at Eddie's again where he says, "" You mean you had a shot at her and you didn't take it"". When John shows up at her work again Jane blows up the elevator. She then goes to look to see if he is really dead. That night John shows up to dinner to find Jane by herself. When she goes to the bathroom, something explodes and she disappears as everyone else is exiting the building.<br/><br/>They both are racing home while talking on the phone to each other. Jane and John race around the outside and inside of the house. When they both are inside they are again running through the house firing at each other. Then Jane and John start physically fighting one another. This is when they aim guns at each other and John says he can't shoot her. After he says that they make out. While this is happening, Eddie then sees a note on his phone that both John and Jane Smith are wanted for 400,000 dollars each. They are wanted because they live together and are both undercover agents. Back at their house, a mailman then gets out of the vehicle with a gun and throws a bomb in the house. Another bomb is thrown into the garage and they make an escape to one of their cars. This scene is when they start to make many confessions to one another. The truth finally comes out when they realize their lives are in jeopardy. Watch Mr. & Mrs. Smith to find out the ending!!"

","Now I am sure there has to be at least a thousand people living middle class suburbia lives who are really high tech assassins. And with all of them out there, it stands to reason two of them might actually meet, fall in love, and continue to do what they do without ever telling the other. Not buying it? Me either, but who says a movie has to have a plot to be entertaining? Jurrasic Park pulled it off three times. I think the appeal here lies in pretty people (Bradjolina) and marriage counseling taken to the extreme. Vince Vaughn, a tremendous talent, provides the perfect foil for Brad, and adds tremendously to the film. Angelina's staff of beauties looks like something out of early Bond or In Like Flint, but they add to the artistic merit of the film (okay, they are great looking women worth looking at), and the special effects and photography is wonderful. PG-13 is about right, language is pretty restrained, so its the violence you have to watch out for. Not particularly collectible, but highly entertaining, especially if you and your spouse have been married for about five (or six) years."
"kevin-miller447","10","3","6","6 August 2011"," Espionage for two
","Doug Liman, the director of Swingers and The Bourne Identity to name a few brings us a pitch perfect action, romantic comedy about lies and deception in a marriage based around two spies working for different agencies that send them to kill one another. The idea while simple is executed brilliantly and this movie is fun from start to finish. The movie is like a cat and mouse game between Jolie and Pitt as they both discover slowly throughout the course of the first half of the movie who the other one is.The script is extremely hilarious and brings out the best and worst in any marriage. The chemistry is striking between the two actors who are as convincing as any couple who are faking their marriage one day at a time. While not every married couple can relate to the whole spy and espionage business, one cannot deny how dead on the two act as a married couple and the things they argue and agree on. Bringing Hollywood's best and brightest might have been a stretch for another film trying to get people to see a movie that 95% of all major studios said no to, but the brilliance behind this movie is how well the two work together and the dynamic scenes they create with energy and enthusiasm of that of professional actors. I have see a lot of movies with both of these actors and I honestly think that this film is the best movie either one has been in simply because it is a simple role but still requires skill to pull off which these two certainly do. There are some great action set pieces that will shock and awe as well as a heart pounding car cash that's better than most in film like this. Never dull with strong writing and one amazing scene after another Mr. and Mrs. Smith is one movie that all can enjoy and a majority of people (married) can relate to (in some respects)."
"barnabyrudge","4","3","6","23 January 2008"," Plot less, over-stylised action-comedy that relies too heavily on its star duo.
","You'd expect more from a film directed by Doug Liman than the meagre fare offered in ""Mr And Mrs Smith"". Liman was the director behind strongly characterised movies like ""Swingers"" and ""Go"". But in ""Mr And Mrs Smith"", there is precious little story and everything depends on the sex appeal generated by the film's two stars. A genuine case of style over substance. The problem is that sexual chemistry on its own  with no discernible plot to back it up  cannot sustain a film over a two hour running time. As gorgeous as Brad and Angelina might be to their respective army of fans, they are badly let down in this film by Simon Kinberg's threadbare script.<br/><br/>During some kind of military crisis in Colombia, American man John Smith (Brad Pitt) meets an American girl named Jane (Angelina Jolie). Since all lone Americans are being thoroughly checked out by the Colombian authorities, the pair of them hook up to draw attention away from themselves. Five or six years later, we catch up with the couple again and discover that in the interim they have got married. Now an unhappily married couple with a glamorous house, glamorous cars but no connection between them, the Smiths' relationship is hanging by a thread. It turns out, however, that each has been deceiving the other about what they really do for a living. John is an assassin working for a secret undercover organisation; Jane is also an assassin working for a rival company. Neither of them has the faintest inkling of how the other earns a living. John and Jane are assigned by their respective bosses to carry out a hit on the same target in the desert near the Mexican border. Upon arriving at the scene, they get in each other's way and foul-up the assignment. Worse still, they begin a no-holds-barred campaign to kill each other in order to restore their reputation within their departments. But it slowly becomes clear that the trigger-happy couple are actually perfectly suited for each other, especially now that their dark secrets are out. Will they kill each other, or combine their talents to fight back against the organisations that have made them into what they are? <br/><br/>The premise is reasonable enough, though wholly unlikely. And the film gets off to a breezy start as the truth about John and Jane is slowly revealed to the audience. Things take a rapid downward turn once the couple learn the truth about each other. At this point, all semblance of credibility is tossed aside and the film goes into comedy-action overdrive. The deadly lovers try various methods of eliminating each other in increasingly stylised set pieces; the narrative collapses and becomes an over-the-top parade of one-upmanship. Pitt and Jolie convey an effective mix of tension and desire between each other, but by this stage the story has abandoned them and the entire film is running solely on their personalities. They try gamely  but it's ultimately a losing battle. Each shootout becomes more contrived and stylised than the last, culminating in a staggeringly dumb department store gunfight. ""Mr and Mrs Smith"" makes no pretences of reality, and is intentionally tongue-in-cheek, but somewhere along the line the non-stop banter and killing cease to be amusing and the film becomes something of a bore."

It is a tongue in cheek look at two people who didn't really give a whole lot of thought to why they got together but they were so into each other they just did it - they got married - and promptly went about ruining it by acting like a typical married couple following their idea of what married people are like. They lied to each other about their real lives and acted domestic. It is revealed fairly quickly that they are both hitters and they go about the process of discovering whether their relationship is based on something real, while at the same time thinking about whether or not to kill each other as their ""bosses"" demand that they do.<br/><br/>Good acting, obvious chemistry, sexy and humorous fun.

","I just watched Mr and Mrs Smith with my husband and we both found it to be a fun and action filled film worth seeing, but more importantly worth seeing together. We were obviously both happy to go and see the film for the big name and obviously attractive stars, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. We figured we would both have something to look at and to boot there would likely be some romance and a lot of action as well to feed both our appetites. We were right on this count but we weren't expecting the message underneath the obvious premise of the story. While everyone knows this is a story about two assassins who are married to each other and don't know the other is in the same business. One begins by thinking, ""Come on, how could you not know, this is unbelievable!"" and a lot of the scenes are quite unbelievable in the way the two always come out on top in every situation. But as you sit there watching the movie as a person in a marriage you begin to realize that this movie is not just about two assassins but it is about marriage. It is about marriage in its extremes of feeling and extremes of fighting not just with each other but against the whole world. It is about how to work things out and how extreme it can become as you do so. With that in mind, we thought it was an excellent film that really hit the nail on the head and it left us going home hand in hand ready to beat down another day in our own marriage. Well done."

","I quite enjoyed this movie. ^_^ Generally the plot involves a married couple, played by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, who both happen to have secret jobs as professional assassins on the side without each other knowing (in fact, they each work for each other's rival companies). When they find out they've been deceiving each other, their loyalties are tested, and bunch of stuff blows up as they proceed to kill each other.<br/><br/>In a way, it's an interesting, symbolic way of portraying the love/hate tumultuous aspects of marriage relationships. Eventually, they will have to work out their differences and go after a common enemy (or will they?), which is also, by the way, the same plot-line of John Woo's movie The Killer (which had two mortal enemies, cop and hit-man, with a common goal). There's definitely very good chemistry between the attractive leads (Jolie and Pitt) and the way they play off each other (as ridiculous it may be) is playful and endearing. While there are plenty romantic elements, ultimately, it's a movie for action fans, much like True Lies (which also played with domestic humor vs. spy action flick) and there are certainly multiple aspects from movies like War of the Roses (dark humor about marriage gone awry) and John Woo-influenced action spectacles. Doug Liman (who directed Bourne Identity) does a great job of portraying the characters with style, as well as beautifully shot action scenes (complete with an obvious John Woo's ""The Killer"" homage/inside-joke near the end of the movie, with the couple, now reunited, storming their way out in visceral, explosive form).

"dennisayers","9","4","10","13 June 2005"," The Pitt and the Pendulous
","I really thought this one was going to be a stinker. Pitt has made some awful choices before (Meet Joe Black, Troy) and I just didn't see how you could make a serious movie out of married assassins trying to kill one another. The only way I thought you could make it work was as a broad comedy. In which case, hire Mike Myers and turn it into an Austin Powers movie.<br/><br/>But I liked Doug Liman's Swingers and Go, and I think Angelina Jolie is not-of-this earth beautiful, so figured it was worth a matinée viewing.<br/><br/>I seriously underestimated this movie.<br/><br/>The story ""A"" which you are familiar with from the previews (why two assassins married without knowing the other's identity and are eventually tasked with killing one another) is indeed preposterous and sorta lame at the same time, but they found a way to make it work. Except for a few stylish set pieces with big guns and various spy toys, the director wisely chooses to barely sketch that plot in. Instead, he focuses on the more interesting story ""B"" -- which is a close examination of marriage itself. The plus to this approach is that Pitt and Jolie are on the screen verbally and physically sparring with one another for almost every frame. There is definitely chemistry between the two and that helps to make the physical fights between them (gut-punching, drop kicking, stabbing, etc.) almost sexy. It also helps that you believe Angelina Jolie could actually kick Brad Pitt's ass. Thus, its a fair fight and not misogyny when he gets the occasional punch in. <br/><br/>The dialog was also excellent-- vastly wittier than the usual banter you would find in a typical romantic comedy. Maybe it had something to do with the reputed 100 re-writes and numerous writers this script went through, but my hat is off to whoever honed the dialog. <br/><br/>Even though the writing is great and the choices the director made were spot on, credit for this film's success is definitely with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. They are both frighteningly beautiful and completely assured in this movie. You can't take your eyes off them. For this film at least, they were definitely worth whatever millions they were paid."

","First off, I wasn't planning to see this film but one of my friends dragged me along, considering that we had nothing else to do on a Saturday night. The opening scene where Mr. and Mrs. Smith is in therapy was a a good set-up to what I believed to be an excellent mix, of action/adventure, romance, and a bit of comedy. As the movie progressed, I became more and more involved in the storyline. Excellent performances by Pitt and Jolie, and I was amazed at the on-screen chemistry they shared. I could definitely see why the tabloids are so involved in their ""relationship"". Perfect roles for both of them, especially Angelina because she just has the right on-screen charisma. I also felt that there was excellent comic timing between some of the scenes, especially the whole ""hidden identity"" concept and how the neighbors are unaware of what's going on.<br/><br/>In Conclusion: I won't tell you any more except: prepare to be impressed with great action scenes, top-notch performances, and highly original storyline."

","This is a question that could contribute to the trivia section if the answer is true. Is the house that is used in Mr. and Mrs. Smith that same house that was used in American Beauty? The interior looks a lot like the interior used in American Beauty. Other than that, fantastic movie with Jolie looking her most fabulous and at her most charming and Pitt at his comedic best. Although I would have liked to have scene less tedious action scenes and more scenes between the couple. THe original script, after all, was supposed to be a comedic metaphor for marriage right? It would have been more enjoyable to have seen more of that not crammed into the action scenes."
"DICK STEEL","9","5","14","8 June 2005"," A Nutshell Review: Mr and Mrs Smith
","Nevermind the tabloids, this show is a must watch to see exactly how sizzling the chemistry is between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. And it's no surprise that Hollywood's sexiest couple wraps the entire show in their sensuality.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is John Smith (a very generic name which was the highlight of a joke), construction foreman in the day, top killer at the side. Angelina Jolie is Jane Smith (again very generic), IT company CEO as a front, top assassin extraodinaire. Mr and Mrs Smith, living in suburbia New York, to everyone, a perfect marriage (and in my opinion, they do look good together) <br/><br/>This film takes a very successful and insightful look into relationships, courtship and marriage, albeit with a sprinkle of well timed humour. It's a joy to watch them showcase typical marriage problems (the film starts off with things not going too well after a very successful courtship) like the lack of communication, the petty arguments, the little deceitful secrets, and always, always accidents which somehow come across as deliberate actions. And when things get out of hand, who do they run off to for solace? Why, their best buddies of course! It's these situations that you can connect to in real life, that sets this show apart from your usual action flick.<br/><br/>They argue, they fight, especially when they find out that they work for rival assassin companies. From guns to knives to fist fights, the action is top class - always something different, always surprises around the corner. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, and each time Jolie hits the roof, she's never short of bringing down the house!<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn shines as Pitt's sidekick Eddie, with his off the cuff remarks. And the film takes a subtle dig at one of Vince's earlier film Psycho, with his character living in solitude with his mom, whom we never see on screen. Fans of the TV Series OC will probably celebrate at Adam Brody's short appearance.<br/><br/>Before you groan at the action pieces (too many guns, too many chases, etc), let me assure you it's refreshing - not only you get to see the very attractive leads in action (yes, Jolie did the leap-off-the-building stunt herself), but the marital / relationship bickering thrown in for good measure worked buckets. It is with this ingredient (heck, I'm getting all homely now) that makes the highway chase here a tad more entertaining than the one in The Matrix Reloaded. And the finale shootout will make even John Woo extremely proud - sweet poetry in motion.<br/><br/>Ah, and the trailers don't give away everything (or anything for that matter), so it's a joy to watch when your thoughts get pulled from under (say, didn't the trailer suggest this, or was it that?) Never mind the trailer, watch this movie for what it is - rip roaring action, identifiable life experiences, and the sexy Angelina Jolie!"

It's the most unrealistic film I ever watched. The shoot out in the house was ridiculous, two supposedly successful assassins couldn't manage to kill each other in their own house, and then when there's a later attempt on both of them in their own house, neither of them had discovered each others stash of weapons in unlocked boxes in their basement."

Not only is there no chemistry, in the entire running time they fail to give any reason why any person would like either star.<br/><br/>This movie isn't funny, so it can't be a comedy. Yet it is not in any plausible or possible, so it can't be a thriller or drama, either.<br/><br/>No, this is the sort of filmaking at which Hollywood succeeds, big budget, bankable stars, and sex/violence aimed at 14 year old boys, and containing not a wit of originality or interest.

When I first saw the trailer I was absolutely hot for it. I wanted to see it, the story seemed very nice and as a (not so) typical 'screaming girl' I expected a good movie, I thought with a cast like this one it couldn't be a failure. But yeah, it was absolutely disappointing. The conversations simply suck, there is no such thing as humor, proper action and a good end. The whole movie is made for the money and not for the entertainment. Thinking about the movie alone breaks my heart. I can't understand why people like the poor thing this movie is. Pure Hollywood simple cash making movie by getting some popular actors. The only reason women/girls watch it is Brad Pitt, the only reasons guys/boys watch this movie is Angelina Jolie.

","I urge you to watch this movie. It certainly made my day (NOT...)<br/><br/>(OR) <br/><br/>This is one of the worst movies that I've ever seen. Even though Brad Pitt is one of my favourite actors(Meet Joe Black, Fight Club), he does not seem to belong in this movie. Probably a ham actor like Ben Affleck would have done much better(or worse!).<br/><br/>The story is really silly. Both are professional killers and spies, yet they are unable to recognize each other's identity. Come on, surely a NORMAL sexy girl would not be able to shoot that accurately. Even a retard would be able to smell something fishy. I mean, the way they show off their skills, they seem to be screaming for attention.<br/><br/>The way their respective organizations plot together to eliminate the two is downright machiavellian(??). What a round-about way of killing them. Considering that a rocket launcher would be a smoother way of getting rid of them, especially when they don't suspect a thing. Hundreds of highly trained SWAT are swatted like the proverbial fly.<br/><br/>The ending is equally inane, and god knows how they manage to survive. Probably the sexy pout that Jolie gives, distracts all those hordes of killers, and the various postures in which she shoots, leaves one wondering... <br/><br/>However, one of the funniest scenes in the movie was when brad pitt kicks the hell out of Jolie. Rarely do you see such gratifying violence :-) This is one for the women's lib organizations. Equal Treatment at it's noblest.<br/><br/>I just reviewed the Director's list of movies on IMDb, and I can't understand how a director who's made ""Bourne Identity"" and Supremacy, can mess up so badly with this movie. Hope he comes up with something, which does not rely entirely on the sex appeal of Jolie/Pitt to impress."

No, its a summer movie, was it the most believable, no it's a summer movie. Was it the funnest I've seen this year (and I've seen quite a bit) the answer is definitely yes! Action sequences by Doug Liman are in top form (as good if not better than the Bourne Identity).<br/><br/>Two things in my humble opinion make this movie stand out.<br/><br/>1) The rebirth of the one liner! Throughout the movie, the script never faltered or got stale and repetitive. (yes we know the back and forth cat and mouse is repetitive) but the script didn't. The lines are delivered believably and seriously when need be. There weren't two stick figures trying to act out lines that have passion, hate, anger, humor behind them like another summer movie that is the end of a legacy ( you get the hint). <br/><br/>2) On screen chemistry makes it's return to the screen. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie appear to be perfectly suited to act opposite each other, their chemistry is that good.

","This is a really fun, entertaining & enjoyable movie if you know what to expect. The overall plot puts us in the mood of a classic noir-type spy romance (think Bogie-Bacall), but it's done with a modern, glossy look and over-the-top theatrics that instantly make you wonder ""WTF am I watching?"" The 2 heroes can defy gravity, accept it. Guns never run out of bullets, or if they do, there's always a fully loaded gun conveniently lying on the ground. Accept it. Entire armies of commandos appear out of nowhere to tear up a city block and there's no sight of a police officer anywhere. Accept it. Our heroes can take a beating better than Mike Tyson on crack, and they only get a tiny droplet of blood on their foreheads. Accept it.<br/><br/>If you can accept all that stuff, then you can sit back, relax & enjoy the show. The whole movie borders on the edge of campy, and I don't know about you, but I think that's how all action flicks should be because movie action IS campy! If you want a realistic spy thriller, watch ""The Day of the Jackal"" (1973) or ""The Spy Who Came In from the Cold"" (1965) which are both excellent films by the way. But if you want to be taken to a pseudo-fantasy world & entertained, then go for this.<br/><br/>The pacing is fast & the action is practically nonstop. But what made me really enjoy this film are the toned-down scenes between Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie. Now there's a textbook illustration of a passive-aggressive relationship. Their dialogue is so painfully awkward & strained (and hilarious) that it provides a perfect counterbalance to the blazing car chases & rains of bullets. A few of their lines will go into my vault of funniest movie lines ever, such as ""How often do you have sex? - I don't understand the question"", ""Mom, we are on high alert here! I almost killed you right then!"", ""Broken eye socket"" and ""I said I saw your dad on Fantasy Island!"" (They probably don't make much sense out of context, but watch the movie and maybe you'll die laughing too.) Also worth noting is the hilarious show-stealing performance by Vince Vaughn as Eddie, the crazy spy friend who lives with his mom. Be sure to watch the deleted scenes on the DVD for more of him (I can't understand why they would cut it).<br/><br/>This is a pure fun flick that's perfect for a date, with your family, or just by yourself after a long day. Other films with the same flair (quirky love-hate relationships) include the spy-rom-com ""Duplicity"" (2009), the fantasy-rom-com ""Camille"" (2008), and I'll throw in the classic Bogie/Hepburn film ""African Queen"" (1951) ...all of which are charming, refreshing & thoroughly entertaining from start to finish."

","Let's start with the positive. I liked the basic storyline. John and Jane are both assassins working for rival criminal organizations of some sort. They meet while on an assignment in Colombia and fall in love and get married, but neither knows what the other does for a living. Unfortunately, when their respective organizations discover that they're now a couple, they order them to kill each other, and when that doesn't happen they join forces to eliminate them both. That sounded creative and intriguing. I also liked both Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in the title roles. They worked pretty well together and they brought a lot of energy to their roles, as well as doing a good job of portraying the mix of emotions required: bored in their marriage after ""five or six years"" (John doesn't seem sure!), desperately trying to kill each other one minute after they find each other out, then desperately in love the next. The opening and closing scenes in the therapists' office (mostly the opening) were also quite humorous. For all those positives, though, there was a lot here that didn't work.<br/><br/>The pacing was off. The humour here seemed sporadic and inconsistent. Actually, aside from that opening scene there really wasn't that much that I found funny. This movie would have worked well as a comedy with some action thrown in; instead, it seemed to want to be an action movie with a bit of comedy every now and then. The action itself was restricted largely to the last third or so of the movie, and then consisted mostly of a gigantic shootout.

","I have no concrete information about the original story and the writers thoughts, but I realized a very different aspect of the story. As many other viewers (even may be to all) the movie is not just an action movie based on a couple whom are agents bla bla. The first scene gives clues about the original story. It is a different presentation of an ordinary American couple whom has very common relationship and engagement problems.<br/><br/>First consider the names and the case. An ordinary couple whom has very common communication and marriage problems. Even the names are very generic for an American couple, John & Jane Smith. They have different point of views on marriage and relationship, and common marriage objects like having a baby etc.<br/><br/>The movie exaggerates the feelings of each with action where majority of the scenes are figurative and fictitious based on this exaggeration. The scenes sometimes show real life but on the other times show the figurative exaggerated presentation of the feelings. I have noted many many couplings for these transitions. For general examples see below matchings...<br/><br/>The flurry and excitement of love initiating the engagement (first matching in a very authentic environment), As time passes by the polarization and being a side (symbolized as secret agents whom are serving to different sides) The baby issue, father first rejects and wants to get rid off it before birth ( the young guy whom is on target to be destroyed)<br/><br/>And specifically; at the and there were a devastating fight in between where guns and bombs were in action. But right after settlement no harms were in between (as a standard viewer) ... But it was just to show the though argument in between and the explosions and blasts were emotional frazzle (in real aspect).<br/><br/>This point of view may not present the actual approach but please consider viewing the movie once more from this aspect."

","Almost - but not quite - Bennifer.<br/><br/>Idiotically tagged ""Brangelina,"" the publicity-romance dream team of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie explode in popcorn bedlam in *Mr. and Mrs. Smith,* as married super spies who are unaware that each other is a spy.<br/><br/>...Real pros.<br/><br/>Ours is not to reason why, ours is but to popcorn and die  that's how stupid this movie treats us. Employ the two hottest people in the world and we'll just sit here and drool never mind that they each have secret compartments stashed around their house, concealing weapons and money and neither of these supposed super spies ever stumbles upon the other's stashes; never mind they hired actors on both sides for their wedding because they don't have family ties and that neither of them were canny enough to discern this; never mind that when they are contracted to rub out each other we are allowed to see the WOMAN doing far more damage to the man than the other way round  and that's meant to be ""funny"" Never mind all that: look at those abs!...look at those ta-tas! <br/><br/>When both their spy agencies contract each of them to coincidentally take out the same target, Mr. Smith (Pitt) steps on Mrs. Smith's (Jolie's) death trap, leading to both of them discovering each other's secret identity. Now the fun is supposed to begin. But it just gets annoying.<br/><br/>Both try to snuff each other while subsuming their wild sexual urges towards the other. Which leads them invariably to rough sex - in a house demolished by their feuding. The sex is so good (hey, it's Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie) they end up banding together against both their agencies. It is the annoying lopsided battle netween the two which gives this film away as the half-baked, politically-gutless, emasculating popcorn-pleaser it tries so hard to be. And succeeds at.<br/><br/>She rams the side of his car and keeps driving, uncaring of whether she has killed him  now think about how incongruous that would look if the MAN was the aggressor. In the house-battle, she carries a giant automatic rifle, he uses a handgun. When she brutally smacks him to the floor, she can ask, ""Who's your daddy now?""  yet how ""funny"" would that line be if the tables were turned? Even when he *does* beat her in a basic fist fight, it somehow feels ""wrong."" But in a society that applauds equality for women, why SHOULDN'T he be allowed to kick her ass with impunity? By putting herself on his level  an assassin aiming to kill him  she has no recourse to call foul on anything. Yet the film-makers very consciously and carefully never show the female being bested. And when bested, in a trite, unthreatening manner. Why is emasculating a man ""funny"" but derogating a woman politically incorrect? Because the asymmetry is so ingrained in our society that there would be an outcry if the female was topped in a ""masculine"" manner. I've said this many times: women don't want Equality  they want Superiority. Women seek to empower themselves at the EXPENSE of men, never to actually improve themselves on a truly ""equal"" level. And the only reason men ALLOW women to be portrayed as ""superior"" is because men want to curry favor TO GET INTO A WOMAN'S PANTS.<br/><br/>That may sound even smugger than Angelina Jolie and her magical dancing ta-tas, but you can't argue with Truth.<br/><br/>There are a few funny moments. Vince Vaughn, as Mr. Smith's assistant, does his Vince Vaughn, but most of the laughs are due to Pitt's impeccable comic timing; the incongruity of marital arguments while escaping for their lives - but again, the humor is in HIM being bested in myriad ways. She's a better driver, more tactically canny, he's cheerful instinct and she's anal planning (or should we just stop at anal  it is, after all Angelina Jolie? - after a job, he says, ""I improvised,"" she counters, ""You deviated from the plan!""); she even has more kills than him (312 to his ""60s"", in a scene that is analogous to a couple comparing past partners). So why is being more adept than him at everything considered ""funny""? You lost me at burning your bra.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, in their last Butch Cassidy & Sundance sequence, his bulletproof vest covers his whole torso, hers exposes her midriff. Reason? Dunno, maybe none of the MALE assassins would think to shoot at that smooth, flat-bellied section of her body where they fantasize plucking grapes from her bellybutton with their tongues roving wetly over the smooth hairless flesh.<br/><br/>Sexism? That's what funded this movie in the first place!!!"

","If ever a DVD deserved to be shredded, this is it. This film is garbage. The plot is thin, the acting is weak, the stunts and special effects are silly and the acting, with the exception of Vince Vaughn, is close to moronic. I'm not sure exactly when ""Brangelina"" became an item, but this film certainly has all the characteristics of an exploitation of the national obsession with these two ""beautiful people"". After watching this, I have to wonder how Angelina Jolie ever won an Oscar. Her performance lacked any sense of depth. It was as if she were just another attractive waitress going through the motions in a local high school production. Brad Pitt was equally disappointing, again, simply repeating his lines as if all he wanted was to get it over with. I'm sure this was hastily produced for an audience of ""People"" magazine subscribers.<br/><br/>The only bright light in the entire film was Vince Vaughn. He was funny, intense and even a little complex. His presence was the only reason that I watched this thing to the end."

","I don't normally watch films with ""power"" couples in them, e.g. ""Eyes Wide Shut"", ""Gigli"", ""Daredevil"", and others. Really I think movies with star couples in them use that as their main selling point. Everybody is so interested in the iconic male and female stars that no one ever stops to evaluate the type of movie or the movie content.<br/><br/>This movie wasn't bad though. There was some nice action; some nice edge of your seat moments. There was good dialogue and good humor at times. I think the eventual ""War of the Roses"" scenes are what piqued my interest the most. The movie wasn't complimented much by the supporting actors (most notably: Vince Vaughn). And I'm a bit tired of the clean, beautiful, intelligent super spies/assassins. I'll take ""The Professional"" type assassin any day of the week over the pristine and unflawed assassin. I think James Bonds image for spies and hit men has run its course."

"amiboshi07","9","2","4","18 December 2006"," though not Oscar worthy, come on guys, it was a very fun movie
","OK. This was a pretty entertaining dar n good movie. I'm NOT saying it's the best movie ever made in the history of all movies, BUT, it was pretty good nonetheless. Though from what I remember, it was advertised as an action movie, I think it is really a romantic comedy in disguise with a lot of action added in as a plus. The fact that the actors were Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie also was a plus. Now some previous reviews have said that the movie was awful because it totally destroys the marriage life and marital bliss idea but I think those people were taking things too seriously and literally in the movie. First of all, I don't think this takes place quite in our reality. There are many parts where Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's characters seem indestructible or perform amazingly pseudo-comic book moves. It's a kind of different heightened reality so don't go rolling your eyes discrediting those moments. I think the problems the characters face are like metaphors for problems in a relationship. It's basically like saying look, once two people get married it's not ""happily ever after"" there will be problems and you both have to work through these together if the relationship is going to last. It just so happens that the Smiths' problems are that they're assassins- a funny extreme, if you will. But this extreme enables some awesome unreal scenes and even small asides that are very much entertaining. The physical fighting at first might seem like battery but it's a fine line of, again, an extreme. Or s&m. But then again, that interpretation might be too literal. All in all, I'd watch it more than once. (I've watched it many more times than that.) More than twice, actually, since the second time around you know the ending and other asides pop up. It's a good watch, though maybe not so appropriate for the kiddies. After all, it is a PG-13. Listen to the rating, it's not for the tots."

I think that shows too much ignorance about other countries. You cannot speak of things that you don't know about. Nothing that I saw in this movie about Bogota it's true, neither the type of people who supposedly live in Bogota nor the way that Bogota looks. It is so so distant from the reality. Bogota is not as violent as they portrayed it. I think they (the directors o whoever thinks that Bogota is like that) chose the easy way, they only put something in that movie based on things that they have heard, but didn't even investigated. I don't think they ever visited Bogota. The only thing that these type of films does It's to degrade the image of a country that it has changed considerably to good."

"EUyeshima","4","2","4","11 August 2006"," Supremely Attractive Leads on a Crash-and-Burn Marital Obstacle Course
","This clanging, crashing 2005 superstar coupling seems to aspire to be a new millennium retake on John Huston's ""Prizzi's Honor"" and Danny DeVito's ""War of the Roses"", but it turns out to be a gadget-oriented action flick with grand pretensions about how a seemingly ideal couple handle marital discord. It certainly helps that director Doug Liman (who did a superb job on the underrated ""Go"" in 1999) has cast two ludicrously attractive leads whose intertwining personal lives would eventually overshadow their on screen shenanigans. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star in the title roles, John and Jane Smith, and things start promisingly with Simon Kinberg's scattershot screenplay setting them up as typically upscale married suburbanites who both try to manage professional demands in light of a sagging marriage.<br/><br/>As it turns out, they are both highly paid assassins who of course, are hired to rub the other out. This revelation is hardly surprising, but I didn't know it would signal a significant decrease in creativity for the rest of the film even as the fireworks get more explosive. The special effects and swift gunplay can be dazzling but are left on overkill mode, but by far, the worst scene is an overextended fight scene between the two that eschews its black comedy elements in favor of a commercial for domestic violence. But even this would be forgivable if Liman and Kinberg could figure out how to end the story. It seems to breathe on high-octane but strangely remains devoid of any real suspense and then abruptly stops with no real denouement.<br/><br/>Pacing is a major problem with the movie as it feels like it goes on for far too long. Luckily, the stars have enough charisma to maintain some interest throughout. Both often lend a nice comic spark to their performances, though neither knows how to convey irony without an irritating wink-wink manner. As Eddie, Mr. Smith's cohort, Vince Vaughan seems to be the only one who seems completely adept at black comedy. Kerry Washington, on the other hand, makes virtually no impression as Mrs. Smith's task force colleague. Even though he shows off an impressive set of six-pack abs, Pitt seems particularly lost at times, but Jolie manages to dominate the pairing with her stunning beauty and take-no-prisoners attitude. It's too bad the story serves merely as a vehicle for their mutual posturing."

Not all places in Latin America are like that, in fact Bogota its not one of them.

"Pavel-8","5","2","4","1 November 2005"," Mindless entertainment packed with It.
","Sometimes you're just in the mood for an escapist movie. Nothing too intelligent; nothing too twisting or unpredictable; just good-looking people living their ridiculously interesting lives. For women, this form of entertainment usually comes in the form of anything starring Julia Roberts or Hilary Duff, for the younger crowd. Guys usually go for almost anything featuring Tom Cruise. Although those names are absent, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" combines a bit of both types, fitting the mindless entertainment mold perfectly.<br/><br/>If you saw a trailer for ""Smith"", then you know the gist of the picture. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are married. But the implausibilities don't stop there. Unbeknownst to each other, both are guns-for-hire who assassinate VIPs for unseen higher powers. Eventually of course, the cover-ups must stop, and that's what the movie is about. A simple enough premise that follows a simple enough path, which is fine, because watching Smith is like attending a Kansas City Royals baseball game. You know what you're getting when you buy the ticket. You know you'll have a good time at the game, and you won't be shocked if the product is mediocre to bad, which is precisely where this film ends up.<br/><br/>Even though, or perhaps because the entire story is inevitable, the plot still dragged at times, simply taking too long to set the scenes and then deliver the promised goods of shootouts, both martial and marital. Once there, the action scenes are good not great, and the miscommunicative banter between Pitt and Jolie as they rediscover each other provides the funny moments, which are the highlight of the film. Married or not, anyone can relate to their problems, which are magnified by the absurdity of their situation. Quality relational humor is as funny as anything, and there are some good jabs sprinkled throughout this movie, although still nothing particularly memorable.<br/><br/>Also forgettable is the entire cast outside of Pitt and Jolie. The villains are scarcely given a face; Vince Vaughn is occasionally amusing in an over-the-top way; Adam Brody (""The O.C."") is pointless; and frankly no one else matters. Seriously, if all faces except the leads had been no names or even blurred out, the movie would not have suffered, because good versus evil is hardly the point of the flick. The point is see beautiful people fight with words and guns.<br/><br/>Therefore the onus of the movie falls on the magnetism of Pitt and Jolie, which is fortunately palpable. Both are clearly sexy, beautiful people, and their chemistry is undeniable. The sensuality erupts off the screen more than even the explosions because they both possess It, that mysteriously inexplicable combination of looks, swagger, demeanor, sexuality, and accessibility. Whatever It is, they both own It, and thus glue eyes to the screen regardless of what they're doing, whether it be carrying a bazooka or a fork. Doesn't matter. You want to watch. From beginning to end, their allure and physical presences carry the movie. Without it, the product is something like ""Ballistic: Ecks versus Sever"", which had more to work with, but whose leads (Banderas and Liu) lacked the charisma of Pitt and Jolie, resulting in a more interesting story that was less watchable.<br/><br/>Looking for something profound in this movie is like hoping Britney Spears brings down the house with a Verdi aria. It's just not going to happen. If you anticipate such, then you deserve to be disappointed. But like ""2 Fast 2 Furious"", ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" can fill two hours with mild entertainment if you have reasonable expectations.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: A decent popcorn movie. Nothing more. 5 of 10."

But then they learn that they are both, well, secret agents and that their next assignments is to, well, kill each other. Cue complications and comedic capers from there...<br/><br/>Nothing gets a bad film rolling quite like publicity. Especially when that publicity becomes bigger than the actual film itself. The publicity in this case being the supposed 'Brad and Angelina' romance that sparked up on the set of Mr & Mrs Smith, rumoured to being behind the big tabloidy break-up of Hollywood golden couple Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. No doubt Mr & Mrs Smith has raked in considerable takings at the box office as a result. And it seems all the bad reviews and the actual poor quality of the film can't change that...<br/><br/>I'm not sure if it was aware of it or not, but the whole thing just seems like some big spin on Schwarzenegger's 1994 hit True Lies. But nowhere near the quality. As events roll on, the absurdity of the plot just gets at you so much, you really know this is a part-comedic film with it's tongue in it's cheek, but the stupidity of it all reeks just the same. The action itself is a collection of the usual loud bangs and thuds that we've been seeing in movies lately. Interspersed in one of these scenes is a supposedly 'comedic' bit, where Pitt and Jolie engage in some hand-to-hand combat in their home, where you can't help but think of the growing amount of domestic abuse cases in the country and how some weak-minded individual may see that and be tempted to go home one night and re-enact some of that on their spouse. There is a disturbingly casual attitude to violence and aggression hinted at throughout the entire film, but that is the one that stuck in my mind the hardest.<br/><br/>Performances wise, Pitt is his usual wooden self and Vince Vaughn is incredibly irritating as his on-screen buddy. Adam Brody is an impressively sarcastic villain and Jolie has an incredibly sultry, sexy presence to her (as usual), but doesn't really rise to any great heights in her role.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a daft, unfunny and pretty unsuccessful film that, for the most part, just fails miserably to do anything right and has only done as well as it has by falling on the band-wagon of all the superfluous off-screen publicity it's two leading stars have generated between them. **"

","Sometimes my taste in movies is as shallow as a puddle. 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' is proof because, man, I love that poster. When you've got beauty like THAT to market your film, to hell with a plot. With Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie looking their spectacular best in this action-romance flick, I was too hypnotized by the beautiful people to be upset about the flimsy story. If you want an assassin story directed by Doug Liman with depth...well, go rent 'The Bourne Identity'. His latest picture might be vapid, but he lets his stars gloss over most of the plot holes.<br/><br/>Pitt & Jolie play John & Jane Smith. Neither spouse knows that the other has a secret life as a ""hitter"" for an underground government agency. Their day-to-day lives are a crashing bore because they've got to pretend to be white-collar drones who make scads of money. Then they're assigned to rub each other out and life is no longer such a yawn for the Smiths. That's the story and it takes about 2 hours to tell it. Even with such an over-long running time, there's no real ending. It just sort of...ends.<br/><br/>The biggest brain-turned-on complaint is this---for people who kill for a living, they're both remarkably bland about it. In fairness, though, the movie is saucy and sexy. They've got chemistry and they exchange some nifty banter. I liked how Jane is better at the job than John, partly because Jolie is more believable than Pitt as an ruthless killer. At least he puts his usual goofy spin on the character. When Pitt gets to relax, he has more fun than most Hollywood heartthrobs get to. So take a date and see 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' make love and murder. They're pretty good at both."

It reminds me a little of Die Hard - full of explosions and shootings, but also hilarious at times due to its witty lines and great banter from the two leads.<br/><br/>The story, which I'm sure everyone knows by now, is about a married couple who are getting bored with their relationship, little realising that they are both professional assassins working for different companies, and when they find out the sparks really fly.<br/><br/>If I had to criticise, I would say that the beginning of the film is really slow and it takes a while for the real action to kick off. But when that beginning has Angelina Jolie in a hot dominatrix outfit it totally makes up for it and I can't complain that much. Jolie and Pitt are great together, which means that the media will probably say that they definitely are together. I especially liked Brad Pitt's character, he plays the laid back, charming guy brilliantly and it's hard not to like him. Angelina is is hot as ever and the role hardly requires her to stretch her acting limits, but then that was never the point. Vince Vaughn is also great putting in an appearance as a hit-man who lives with his mother, because that's ""the only women he's ever trusted"".<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot and I would recommend it to anyone who likes their action/action-comedies. 4 out of 5"
"Aaron1375","8","2","4","22 June 2005"," A bit of comedy, action, and romance all in one movie.
","This movie stars Brad Pitt and Anjelina Jolie. It also has Vince Vaughn in it. Other than them, you won't really remember to many other people in this flick, but that is okay. It works and makes for a fun experience at the theater. The movie is about two contract killers who are married and neither knows what the other does for a living. The spark is gone out of their married lives, but once they find out what they do and end up targeting each other it adds a little spice to their lives. The comedy is funny, the action is great (particularly the car chase scene) and there is a dash of romance added as well. The three actors listed above all do a great job. Pitt is the more funny one, but Jolie plays her role as the slightly more professional hit-man great too. And of course Vaughn is funny in his role as well. The movie is not perfect however, as I found it sort of ran a little to long in the end and also the ending leaves one wondering just how they escaped their little predicament. Other than that, however, it was an enjoyable and funny movie."

","The random humor...everything from ""Oh, come on honey, it was just a little bomb"" to ""Come to daddy..."" ""Who's your daddy now?"" was quick-witted and planned perfectly. I was almost afraid to see this movie after hearing the bad reviews. Let me tell you...I could not stop laughing.<br/><br/>From the beginning moment in therapy to the end which I won't describe, I was laughing. Brad Pitt gives an amazing performance and Angeline Jolie stands her own as a stubborn, independent housewife/assassin. And for all it's quiet quirk, it never rested on a boring moment, it never was too much action and the romance (chemistry, blah blah blah) was believable and unbelievable at the same time. Unbelievable being a good thing.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn never fails to disappoint me and though there were times when I wanted to smack his character across the face, the fact is that Vince is underused as a sidekick and needs to portray a leading man.<br/><br/>Doug Linman...never really cared for him. I have since changed my opinion. He needs to keep turning out movies like this with on-screen AND off-screen drama.<br/><br/>Favorite line, when Jane is talking to John about the new green curtains. ""Honey, if you don't like them, we can take them back."" ""Okay, I don't like them."" ""You'll get used to them."" Simple one-liners and conversations between this EXTREMELY sexy duo made the movie as adorable and entertaining as it was. I highly approve."

But after that, there was very little to keep us interested.<br/><br/>In fact, this is one of the very few movies that we actually considered walking out of after only 45 minutes.<br/><br/>This movie does have some funny spots, and a couple of good action sequences.

","John and Jane Smith are elite and deadly assassins working for separate agencies. As irony would have it, they are a bit too good at concealing their true selves, and neither knows that the other is their biggest rival. However this clever set-up, which could serve for a truly entertaining spoof on not just spy films, but a whole host of things simply loses it's footing and not only bites off more than it can chew, it doesn't even bite the right thing.<br/><br/>From a brilliantly funny first part is quickly ruined by largely pathetic emotion scenes which are sorely out of place here. If it is a goofy escapist action comedy, fine, nothing wrong with that, but KEEP IT THAT WAY! Also many of the scenes are very poorly made and given the production values and talent involved this is yet another $100 million dollar lesson that Hollywood is so bad at learning: firepower, financial power, and star-power will not get you a good movie. They may be initial steps for a movie, especially escapist entertainment like this, but more is needed.<br/><br/>Doug Liman, director of the gritty and good ""The Bourne Identity"" may simply be not familiar with the brainless action movie formula and this film shows that well. Things constantly change just so that scenes can end and they go into more, sometimes even more pointless, scenes. Take the car chase - it starts with bullet-proof BMWs attacking our heroes on the road. Yet, the scene ends with Mrs. Smith - shooting a pistol! - literally tearing them to pieces with bullets. The problems don't stop there. Liman's choreographed ballet/shootout climax has our heroes jumping out into a hail of bullets and in a swirling dance take out all their attackers. Maybe Liman was very unhappy with the ending to ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" but this is just poor and a very rushed and not thought out way to end a scene. It almost seems that during production they got bored on a daily basis and decided to wrap things up in time to watch The Simpsons.<br/><br/>So, in the end, all you have is cotton candy - looks yummy, but dissolves into nothing special all too soon. 4/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13: violence and intense action"

","This movie has good acting and good action scenes but there's something it is missing... An actual plot. It ends very quickly and feels unfinished. Most good action movies have a central villain, sometimes several. This really had none at all. Just a bunch of guys in ski masks. None of them have any lines at all, so it's not like you can take them as a character... Just an extra to get shot or blown up. The movie ends very abruptly, it basically consists of about a dozen of the generic ""ski mask guys"" getting shot, then cuts to them talking to the marriage counselor. Another movie falls fate to the ""we've taken too much time so let's finish this off right now"".

","Mr and Mrs Smith is not a bad movie, nor is it a good movie. Neither top biller (Angelina Jolie or Brad Pitt) have really been known for making superior films throughout their careers. With all the tabloid news and all the media hype about the Jolie-Pitt relationship, you think that maybe there would be a flame upon the screen. Especially since this is the supposed film that jump started their relationship. I am thinking Bogart-Bacall or Tracy-Hepburn type chemistry after reading all the media hype, but alas the chemistry is warm to moderate. It looks as if the stars are trying harder to act like they are not interested in each other than to act like the couple the script calls for. Mr and Mrs Smith is a typical low brow action movie. The kind where hundreds of enemy personal shoot at them and never hit, but they kill everyone without a scratch (maybe one scratch). The action is boring. The dialog is boring. The only saving grace would have been for Jolie and Pitt to let their real life desire flow into the movie. I rate this a 5. It is alright, but it is not good."

","If you are looking to watch assassins in action, this could not the one we are talking about. The movie opens little unconventional luring you to check out what had happened before. But what unfolds only makes the life uninteresting. The life of couple and their secret intentions is portrayed in a somewhat interesting manner. However, I guess the means of assassinations at different locations is not as impressive. May be some different plots could have been shown to explain their assassinating styles!! The couple's discussion at home is interesting and their expressions although not charming enough, does help them keep the movie running along the tracks. The highlight of the movie is the plot itself which is sort of a little complicated puzzle. The smith's unveiling each other's identity is a treat to look out for. The face off between assassins at home gives a smile to people when they are supposed to be nail biting!! The final fighting sequence has been just placed as if to show that this movie is somewhat about action and thriller?? Not good. The background music, one should say the scorer, is very disappointing. Even in the fighting sequences, the trance nature of the music does not pump your adrenaline. The movie is an outcome of an confused plots about which the crew , I guess, must have had sleepless nights. Overall, the movie is fun to watch but logic, excuse me !"

","I guess I was expecting too much of this film. After all, it was directed by Doug Liman, whose THE BOURNE IDENTITY was an excellent movie, and as a leading lady Angelina Jolie is easy on the eye. But in the end this is another lightweight Hollywood comedy with zero substance and outlandish, unbelievable action sequences in which special effects count for everything. One of the main problems the film has is the lazy performance from Brad Pitt, on sleepwalking mode throughout, although Angelina Jolie shines opposite him. The main story about a bored suburban couple having secret lives is familiar – see TRUE LIES, for instance – and this doesn't add anything new to the concept, apart from increasingly crazy action scenes that remain cartoonish and detached even if the special effects do look nice.<br/><br/>I normally don't care for Vince Vaughn as an actor, but he's the best thing in this film – genuinely funny in all his dialogue bits, a real scene stealer. I admit, some of the comedy isn't bad either. But at two hours this is an overlong film with lots of meandering and repetitive bits. The two stars scrub up well but the cinematography is such that it appears they're vainly posing for the whole running time. The ending's also a cop out. I wanted to like this film, I really did, but in the end the main effect of MR. & MRS. SMITH on me was to send me to sleep."

","What a sickening example of bad values, and what a stinker of a movie!!<br/><br/>Sure, it was memorable when Angelina escaped by rope down the side of a building wearing a black corset, after a murder she did for hire, but come on... who wrote this absurd screen play? It was nothing but a series of shoot-em-up special effects, explosions and car chases, laced with gratuitous violence, including that telling moment when ""Mr. Smith"" kicked someone who was already down.<br/><br/>No wonder the kids get guns and go to school and shoot people? The two protagonists have no hesitation to blast and harm other people, including their spouses, and we're made to think it's clever that the Angelina character got the Brad character in a falling elevator full of explosives, or stuck a bomb in his pocket.<br/><br/>It must have been a male who wrote this--someone who thinks we like to see people destroy the interiors of houses, he obviously watches too many violent video games and thinks a game of spy versus spy, with real bullets would lead a couple to a passionate romp? Violence is rarely sexy to women.<br/><br/>On a lesser note, whoever made this is insulting the audience by suggesting that two people married for six years would not know the other's workplace and job? And you want us to buy the idea that married people with a happiness rating of 8 out of 10 are going to kill a spouse because the agency thinks it needs to be done? Many of us would lay down our lives to save each other. <br/><br/>To me this presents some of the ""cancers"" in our society rolled up into one slick package: lawless violence for profit, a sociopaths lack of regard for the suffering or welfare of others,as well as pervasive materialism leading to violence and deceit. Mr. and Mrs. S. clearly sold their souls to the devil.<br/><br/>Think of the teens who admire these actors who will see this movie and think being a hired killer is a viable job. Speaking of greed... Shame on the two of them for doing this. Wonder how their kids are going to think when they grow up and watch?

"Fifi","9","3","8","16 June 2005"," A Future Classic With A Classic Pairing
","I loved, loved, LOVED this film. It was fun, witty, exciting and oh, so sexy! Director Liman delivered a fast-paced entertainment that had me grinning and laughing scene after scene. One of the things I love most about it is that it doesn't take itself seriously, so the viewer shouldn't, either. I was so surprised to see others commenting about how unbelievable it is, how implausible. Of course, it's unbelievable. But isn't that part of the ""over-the-top"" point of the film? From what I can tell, the film delivered almost all it promised along with a lot of surprises along the way. I also think it's a hilarious commentary on marriage and partnership and how hard it can be to lay yourself bare and share yourself and your life with another person totally. The message is delivered in an utterly outrageous way, but it's still there.<br/><br/>The Smiths entered their marriage for myriad reasons, primary perhaps for both in their minds being that they needed covers for their secret careers as assassins. Deep down, though, you could tell they really loved each other. When they find out that they've been living a lie for the past 5 (or 6) years, they are both hurt that they placed their trust in the other person and that trust was betrayed (ironic considering that they've both been doing an awful lot of lying) and to top it off, they've been ordered to kill each other by their agencies. They react to the hurt and betrayal (while carrying out their assignments) in the only way two volatile people with weapons training can. The result is the most beautiful demolition of a mini mansion ever conceived. I mean, really. The person that you are closest to can evoke the most passionate feelings in you that run the spectrum from deepest tenderness to flat out homicide. As much as you've wanted to hug and cuddle them, how many times have you also wanted to grab your significant other and choke him/her? This film takes it there and beyond. I think my favorite scene in the film was when the Smiths tossed away their firearms and went at it mano a mano and tried with all that was in them to stomp each other into the ground. I loved that! Mrs. Smith gives as good as she gets and I just cannot stretch my brain to fit Nicole Kidman (original Mrs. Smith) in this role that seemed to require so much physicality and attitude.<br/><br/>As to my feeling that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are a classic pairing, I don't think Mr. Pitt has burned up the screen this thoroughly with anyone besides George Clooney . . . and certainly not to this degree. Before this film, I wasn't what could be called a mad fan of either of them, but I liked them both. I am now ready to declare them the ultimate match of all the contemporary Hollywood stable has to offer. Not only are they both gorgeous, they're perfectly-matched in talent. I mean, you can toss two beautiful people together in a film and your results can vary (see Pitt and Julia Roberts in The Mexican), but this pairing was downright combustible. The script was good, but I think the film coasts by primarily because of the two leads. I really don't think it would have been this entertaining with Kidman. My first love will always be classic films and I'm so blown away by the pairing of Pitt and Jolie, I'm likening them in my mind to other classic pairings like Hayworth and Ford, Bogart and Bacall, Ladd and Lake, Hepburn and Tracy (okay, and Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas because I love them so much I just can't leave them out) - so natural, it just doesn't get any better. Pairings you will still be talking about for years to come.<br/><br/>Yes, there were holes in the story - it wasn't perfect. It would have been nice to have had the heads of both agencies revealed in the end for a face-to-face showdown and I personally found the way Mrs. Smith found out about Mr. Smith's day job to be a bit vague, but to me this is forgivable. It's not meant to be Hitchcock. I went with escapism and a bit of fun in mind and the film delivered that and more, so I'm happy. My personal definition of a ""classic"" is a film you can watch over and over again and never tire of the magic you get from it. I'll most likely see it one more time before it leaves the theatres and I'll be among the first in line when this DVD comes out just so that I can have it at home to watch over and over again."

The scene at the dinner table was a classic. Both were suspicious of each other, and how Brad said, ""You did something different?"" -he thought the dinner was poisoned or something! I also liked how their gadgets and guns were hidden all around the house, that was pretty awesome. What I liked most about the characters was that they were believable.

","This is a killer -excuse the pun- movie! This movie is a great twist to the kind of romance that we typically call a chick flick. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star as a married couple who live like ships passing in the night. I love the scene in the beginning where they are getting ready for work. They wake up in the same bed, get dressed in the same closet, and all the while they say about ten words to each other. To finish the scene, they drive out of the same garage but turn opposite directions out of the driveway. How much more disconnected can a married couple get? Anyway, this movie is definitely a guy's romance.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes may be a bit flaky at times but the plot is well thought out and keeps your attention. The ending leaves a bit to be desired and critics may count this as a flaw to the film, but I think it serves as a good cliffhanger.<br/><br/>I also would like to vent my frustrations toward critics. The fact is they are just that - CRITICs. Their job is to tell us what sucks about a movie and how the production crew could have done a better job. If a critic's job involves telling us why decent movies suck, then why do we regard them as movie gods? It seems a little hypocritical to think that they can tell us how a movie could be better when most critics have never even been involved in the production of a major motion picture. Have you ever noticed a theme among movies that critics give good ratings? A ""good"" film is almost never a comedy, action, horror, or kid's film. ""Good"" movies are almost exclusively sappy dramas that are hardly entertaining to many moviegoers. I may be a bit critical of critics, but the point is that YOU know what kind of movies YOU like so use your own judgment before you let some guy in the newspaper tell you what movie to see."

","A horrible movie , glorifying violence and all that is wrong with Hollywierd today....I was not expecting much , but this is so bad on so many levels . War of the Roses it wasn't. An ethical and socially responsible couple that Brangelina are , should have had the smarts to not have anything to do with a script like this... But I am sure there were about 20 million mitigating factors. If you have an I.Q. of 60 or more , spare yourself...it's a painful display ! The people that ""flocked "" to see this are young and impressionable and the message of glorified violence that really does little harm is what they leave with. Simply a shame that this allows so many to get rich. What happened to the stars that can be role models for their on screen work ?"
"umlandr","10","3","9","16 June 2005"," Pitt and Jolie compliment one another perfectly in MR. AND MRS. SMith
","MR. AND MRS. SMITH (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie) meet in Colombia amidst a social upheaval, enjoy a whirlwind romance, and marry rather impulsively, settling into a suburban life. Both hold lucrative but apparently banal jobs, although this is just a veneer for their true careers as professional assassins, which each hides from the other. MR. AND MRS. SMITH (Jane Smith and John Smith) seem to be the perfect couple. Eventually, this secrecy backfires, and they find themselves pitted against each other, despite their attraction. They must decide whether to eliminate each other or team up to defeat their common enemy, apparently their one-time mutual employer. This film might have used the vacuous television formula of espousal teams , such as MACMILLAN AND WIFE, but it manages to dodge that bullet. The acting styles of Pitt and Jolie compliment one another surprisingly well. Neither actor strives to upstage the other; Jolie's vitality and no nonsense persona and Pitt's penchant for quiet understatement make a perfect combination, in scenes of apparent harmony and those of enmity. The pace is very good, too, weaving deftly suspense and humor, much of which is provided by the intermittent frames with a marriage counselor. MR. AND MRS. SMITH also features a great supporting cast, but it does so without cluttering its story unnecessarily. Its soundtrack, especially ""Mondo Bongo,"" performed by the late Joe Strummer (formerly of The Clash) is also a winner, lending alternately energy, poignancy, and ironic humor. The film's only discernible flaw (a minor caveat) is that it slights its explanation of the sinister organization (the villain) for whom the two work."

That is crazy to think because Angelina and Brad's chemistry throughout the film is right on target. She plays the beautiful, but sneaky, bad girl.

","This movie follows a well-trodden path i'm afraid. All the elements required are here: Certainly enough money has been tossed at it. There are 2 ""stars"". Locations are quite appealing, and the cinematography is richer than life. The base elements of the story line are good enough to make something of. Why then, is it so dismal? Because even when using the best materials, laziness can deliver a repetitive, banal product. I think laziness kicks in because film production companies have learned that audiences will buy almost any boring pap if there are ""stars"" to watch. So why work harder than need be? In this case even Brad and Angelina cannot overcome the storyline, which after a promising start, reverts to shoot shoot shoot - any movie in which the 2 heroes can be unscathed after a shootout in which they kill maybe 50 or 60 SWAT-type adversaries bodes ill for the viewer, especially when there isn't any real humour in the scene. Do yourself a favour, go for a walk in the park instead."

","This is a really fun movie. Funny, too, but also FUN. I had a great time watching this, and unlike many other drama / comedies, at every point where it could have easily become a tear-jerker, the writers broke it up with some comedy. They pull it off well, and the entire movie comes together very smoothly. And in addition to a great story, the chemistry between Jolie and Pitt is absolutely evident ~ a perfect way to add fire to an already great story. If you like love stories but frequently find them too sappy, or if you like action flicks but frequently get bored by gratuitous violence, you'll probably like this movie, which strikes a nice balance between both. Pitt hasn't exactly been praised to the podium in his decade of performances, but personally I love his dry sense of humor in every role he does. He is very smooth, and has an endearing smirk throughout this movie towards her which drives her nuts. Both stars cut it up, with Angelie playing her vintage hard body beeotch like she always does. She really helps my reflexes when it comes to finding the mute button. This makes for a great date flick for many reasons. One obvious reason is you both have something to look at, but it does entertain, and is almost Roger Moore cheesy funny Bondish in a good way."

","This movie is a classic example of how bad Hollywood movies can be. It falls into same category as 8 mm starring Nicholas Cage (predicatable storyline) or an attempt to cash in the celebrity status of the on-screen duo (Gigli).<br/><br/>*****************Spoiler***************************************** The only interesting portion of this movie is the opening sequence involving dialogues between the marriage counselor and the couple. The movie then shows the boring live of a suburban couple which serves as a camouflage for actual identity of the couple. Surprisingly enough, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie lives in a mansion that could give event the wealthiest suburbanites a severe inferiority complex. They drive the most expensive cars and still Angelina Jolie cooks the dinner (a gardener to cut the lawn but no house maid/butler to cook and serve the food and do the dishes) - although an explanation is given for the absence of cook in late part of the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is more suited to 70s Bollywood with Amitabh playing the role of Brad Pitt and Zeenat Aman playing the role of Angelina Jolie. Sadly, Brad is no Amitabh. He tries hard to play the role of a spy performing daredevil stunt, but there too, lacks the charm of Pierce Brosnan.<br/><br/>The movie has no solid storyline to write about. It becomes as predictable as it can get. The chicks, who serves as sidekick to Angelina Jolie looks ridiculous in their black outfits, mouthing dialogues full of technical jargon. Vince Vaughn as Brad's buddy, is totally wasted in an inconsequential role.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time and money on this movie if you want to see a good thriller movie. You can re-rent ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Reservoir Dogs"" instead. This movie can only be watched with your friends on an evening, when there is nothing else to do and you want to spend some fun time together."

It started average and seemed to go downhill from there, & the only reason I stayed with it was to see what the finale might be & what happened to them. I needn't had bothered as the last 30 minutes were complete nonsense, with the Smith's taking on and killing the worst bunch of assassins in the history of film, making Stallone & Arnie completely vulnerable in comparison. And I still didn't find out who they were talking too, as the stupid rubbish just ended.<br/><br/>The plot was incoherent, the acting poor, with Jolie & Pitt particularly poor. I can't say I have ever taken to Angelina Jolie, with her big lips & scrawny body, but here she is terrible, like a petulant child who has had her toys taken away from her, & I was hoping throughout that someone would throttle her.<br/><br/>So anyone wanting to see a movie with plot, good acting, comic moments, excitement, look elsewhere, as you most certainly wont get it here, as this surely is another nail in the coffin for star led movies."

","Mr. & Mrs. Smith was everything!!!! Comedy, Romance, and a lot of other stuff. Da good stuff. Angelina Jolie did an amazing job as Jane Smith and I really couldn't picture anyone else in the role. Also considering the relationship Brad and Angie have right now. The movie went more as Brad having the smarts and low tech. While Angelina was more go with a plan that involves as much high tech gear that we have a possible. Both were evenly matched and I think the best scene was when they were fighting in the Coleman's van against the bullet-proof BMW's. That's when all of there lies spill out. But the fighting scene in the house was also very well done. Very tricky and amazing how assassins act so fast. Very few people can secretly do what they do.

","There was one glaring omission to this otherwise decent action yarn, and that was in the area of film dialogue.<br/><br/>On the surface, the film provided a good story in the cat-and-mouse game between the two mercenaries played by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. The two characters rode the roller coaster of partners-in-crime, lovers, friends, spouses, and rivals. But because the dialogue was so insipid, it would have been possible to turn off the sound and simply watch the story unfold visually without missing a beat.<br/><br/>What this film needed was snappy banter and witty one-upsmanship between the two leads. In those scenes when the couple faced the camera and opened up to the therapist, the bottom dropped out of this film.<br/><br/>Let's hope that the real-life relationship of Brad and Angelina is livelier and includes more interesting conversation than was apparent in the subpar ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith."""

"hall895","4","2","5","12 April 2006"," Yawn-inducing ""action"" movie
","So if you're going to make an action movie shouldn't there be some, you know, action? Mr. & Mrs. Smith doesn't have nearly enough action and what little action we have is either completely unoriginal or completely laughable. Let's throw in a car chase because Lord knows that hasn't been done to death in approximately 7,643,286 other movies before this one. Let's have our two ""heroes"" (and I use that term very loosely) survive what in any movie with half a brain would be completely unsurvivable situations. Whatever intelligence you have, this movie will insult it.<br/><br/>Anyhow the plot, such as it is, revolves around John and Jane Smith, a not so happily married couple who unbeknownst to one another are both professional assassins. They work for different people, these people find out their assassins are married to one another and assign them to kill each other. And there the fun begins. Well, actually no it doesn't. There is no fun. Ever. The film begins by straining to show you just how boring and mundane the Smiths' lives seemingly are. All these scenes, which go on for forever and a day, serve to do is put you to sleep. The Smiths are boring and so is this movie. Once the ""action"" begins a bunch of things get blown up real nice but that's about it. You never feel anything for the characters, there's no emotion at all, and the movie just sits there until the next utterly ridiculous action sequence comes along. After that the characters, and the audience, can go back to sleep.<br/><br/>The only thing that makes this movie even remotely noteworthy is the fact that the Smiths are played by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, whom you may have read a thing or two about in the papers. Suffice to say I hope the couple has more chemistry in real life than they do on the screen because there is absolutely zero sizzle between these two in this movie. Pitt at least seems to be trying and has a few good comic moments. Jolie on the other hand is as wooden, dull and lifeless as a beautiful woman stuffed into a series of skimpy outfits can possibly be. She seems incredibly bored. Given the script she has to work with I really can't blame her. By far the best performance comes from Vince Vaughn as another assassin who shows up for all-too-brief moments of comic relief. But whenever Vaughn's scenes are done it's back to Pitt and Jolie, and back to sleep. Speaking of Vince Vaughn, I'll bet this is probably not one of Jennifer Aniston's favorite movies. It won't be one of yours either."

Additional backstory for the two leads would have been nice but ultimately was unnecessary and the movie ends at the high point without a long superfluous falling action and the Pitt - Jolie dynamic was both believable and filled with understated comedy.

","I think many married couples would appreciate an angle at which long-term relationships are shown in this movie -- spouses as hidden assassins who do not know much about each other is an interesting analogy. This movie is a great entertainment, although has weaknesses -- some scenes are too protracted. As some reviewers noted, the plot is not always believable -- nothing is wrong about it! Most of Hollywood movies are fairy tales by nature, just expressed in modern language and making use of modern technology. But the essence and purpose of a fairy tale has not changed over centuries. Nobody would expect a fairy tale to be exactly realistic, so why take comedy plot twists too explicitly? The analogy can be extended -- the characters are somewhat simplified, so the actors play more types than persons, the situation as a whole is implausible, etc. But the film has a very strong drive, Pitt and Jolie are a perfect duet, the humor is sharp and the tale has its moral. I believe this film would both entertain and make you think for a minute (or more) how strange are manifestations of life."
"RebelChaos","9","2","5","30 July 2005"," Freakin' awesome
","Unfortunately I might be bit of biased with commenting this film, 'cause I'm a huge admirer of Angelina Jolie, but please try to live with it. First of all, this movie is quite TRUE. Mr. and Mrs. Smith met pretty exciting circumstances. They met, they fell in love to each other, and then they got married, which was obviously mistake. Marriage is the most certain killer of the passion, at least in movies. And then they found something new, something exciting, like, you know, parachute dropping or something. But NO, it was killing! And that, what something, is exciting. And from that we're going to get my other point, imagination of the movie. It's pretty remarkable. And then they found out that they still loved each other, and that's was so totally beautiful. Besides, I truly love themes where hate and love are mixed together. <br/><br/>Jolie's and Pitt's chemistry in the movie was just great. I don't really know, did they went together before or after filming the movie (or ARE they even together, I'm kind of out of these pictures), but maybe it doesn't even matter. The point is, that you can see how great they fit together... or I can, at least.<br/><br/>And please don't hang me for this, but the sex scenes were truly enjoyable. Nothing too pervert, and still not too ordinary, with a little violent in it. And the pleasure is best when you add a little pain to it. The end was happy and still sad, I practically cried out very loud. I really thought they died. And you can imagine my relief when I saw they didn't. The end was, I can say, perfect, and oh man that music.<br/><br/>So, I really have to say that my pleasure level was quite high in this movie, and I recommend it to everyone who likes even a BIT of great action, black humour or bare romanticism. Or, even just Angelina Jolie."
"diand_","6","2","5","29 July 2005"," The battle of the sexes, again
","The first surprise in Mr. & Mrs. Smith is the beginning: As the couple is interviewed by their marriage counselor we get scenes derived from the world of Woody Allen. It sets the tone for things to come: We see the couple in suburbia with their mechanical, uninteresting life (peas, please). The whole action part of the movie is set up parallel to the marriage crisis unfolding. First they have minor quarrels, the relationship explodes when finding out their true identities and war is upon them. Only by working together against the outside world and destroying their suburban home along the way, true happiness sets in. So, the action is interwoven with the marriage crisis and the comedy, but there's another level in the story: They frequently comment the whole story (""Happy endings are just stories that haven't finished"").<br/><br/>The suburbia-theme can be found throughout the whole movie. The end scenes first start off with a family car where several features of it are used to fight their adversaries; then we end up in a kind of Home Depot-store, just the kind of battleground they usually go for shopping and feel right at home to battle their enemies.<br/><br/>The names Jane and John Smith already suggest their anonymous, uninteresting lives. Also take a look at the agencies / companies they work for: Jane's company is up-to-date, but only inhabited by women, John's is old-fashioned and looks redundant in the modern world.<br/><br/>Simon Kinberg did a good job here. See the memorable quotes-section for some nice examples of how clever this is written on a basic level. You start wondering if the script of xXx: State of the Union was wasted, because it had more potential. I am curious what he makes of X-Men 3. Doug 'Bourne Identity' Liman's fast-paced, fluent and light directorial style fits in well. He adds some jokes to the already many side-jokes and in-jokes in the script (at least I lost count; Benjamin wearing a Fight Club T-shirt, in most scenes there are jokes in the background visible). But it is overlong like most movies these days so cutting it by about 20 minutes would have made a better movie. And why do they keep showing previews where they already show the whole movie (De Palma's Femme Fatale-preview once contained literally the whole movie, showed 100 times faster).<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie you forget about 15 minutes after leaving the theater, but it is worth a look because few blockbuster movies succeed in integrating action and comedy properly."

"naberry44","8","2","5","20 July 2005"," Mr. and Mrs. Smith
","There's just something too cool about spending two hours or so just looking at Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Talk about a Barbie and Ken couple!!! Whoever had the idea of putting the two of them together in what constitutes a loose and naughty remake of 1989's Kathleen Turner/Michael Douglass outing in ""War of the Roses"" must be basking in the glow of a brilliant idea. The classic ""husband and wife bantering repartee'"" movie is in the house once again. Directed by Doug Limon, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" (2004) and ""Swingers"" (1996), ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is a delightful albeit darkly ironic allegory of the modern marriage.<br/><br/>Beginning and ending in the therapist's office, this film comes full circle in its panoramic treatment of married life in the twentieth century. In the beginning, the couple is obviously going through relatively normal relationship growing pains. Having been married for six years, they seem to be experiencing what most married couples experience (remember ""The Seven Year Itch?). It quickly becomes apparent that their problems are far from normal and their ""growing pains"" far from traditional. Like most couples, each of these two individuals is keeping some secrets from the other one. Unlike most couples, their respective secrets are far more serious than the average ""cookie jar theft"", or ""lust in my heart"" type of omissions. They are both secretly hired assassins. Yes killers, snipers, hit-men/women!! They met during a hit, fell in love, and simply avoided showing one another their true colors by slipping into a boring off to work in the morning/home for dinner in the evening routine. Now after six years of marriage, they are bored with each other because they obviously can share so little of their ""real"" life with their mate. All this makes for a great dilemma. Don't misunderstand, this movie is far from perfect, but what it is is entertaining and really pretty to look at.<br/><br/>Now, back to the stars. Both of these ""mega stars"" had great notices in small parts at the start of their careers. Pitt's memorable turn in ""Thelma and Louise"" and Jolie's performance in ""Hackers"" are the kind of unforgettable little parts that one doesn't easily forget and that set one up for success. Both have gone on to become big stars with bigger expectations. Both actors are ""supposed"" to make their movies make money. Unfortunately they have both had their share of questionable vehicles, but that goes with the territory. Both are well established and incontrovertibly talented actors. It truly gives one pause to wonder just how well the chemistry so fondly bandied about Hollywood circles will gel between these two strong personalities. Well.suffice it to say, the fireworks abound. Throughout this movie, these two click on all cylinders. In the indomitable style of Tracy and Hepburn, Pitt and Jolie intellectually and physically spar from beginning to end making for a raucous and undeniably satisfying jaunt through the intricacies of their erstwhile complicated lives. The plot is relatively simple - with a twist. Their chosen occupations are exposed to one another when they are sent on the same job. Because of the interference of the other ""half"", they are equally unsuccessful in their assassination attempt and are therefore tasked with the unpleasant job of ""taking care of"" the renegade intruder in their respective operations. Of course, it is soon revealed that their nemeses are indeed themselves. In order to not give away a couple of cute little twists, no more will be revealed here. The important thing is that the movie is two hours of grand fun. Never taking itself too seriously, this vehicle is a kaleidoscope of enchanting little surprises. Smooth and non-interfering direction combined with seamless and skilled acting make for an enjoyable and entertaining respite from the hustle and bustle of life. To be able to immerse oneself in the altogether more complicated existence of these two characters makes the moviegoer wont for more. The success or failure of this type of movie rests on the ability of the film to leave the viewer breathless. In that respect they succeed. Rampant with lots of action, chases, and cool stunts, ""Smith"" is engaging entertaining.<br/><br/>Bottom line, the chemistry is there, the action is there, and fine direction is there. As in his previous outings, Limon is able to carry the characters through the action sequences without sacrificing depth of character in any way. This is as much as testament to the acting ability of his stars as to his directorial prowess, but the amalgamation of the two makes for a very likable film. If you haven't seen it yet, go see it."

","""Bourne Identity' was a great film because it tried to keep you anchored in the real world. ""Swingers"" was great because it knew where to draw the line at 'over the top'. This movie tries to have it both ways. How can 'over the top' action scenes be taken seriously? Evidently, we are supposed to take this film's premise very lightly. But yet, there is some hardcore violence and death of a lot of good guys. How can we have any empathy for a loving couple that are being hunted, when they survive thousands of bullets with nary a scratch? M&MS does not know when to draw that line. I am reminded of moments in the series ""The Sopranos"", which also juxtaposes violence with humor. You can only allow so much humor before you start to lose interest, and you can only take so much violence before you lose your taste for the story.<br/><br/>The screenplay shines when it examines secrecy between married couples, and lets the characters work it out for themselves. But the third act of the film disposes a great deal of character development for standard Hollywood Action scenes. The action scenes, while technically well executed, become tedious. I was rooting for this film, because it started off as a fun and smart film. I lost it when it stretched the material and launched into cookie cutter cliché action scenes. ""Bourne Identity"" had action scenes that represented real peril to the lead characters, but M&MS has action scenes that make it obvious that the lead characters are more like cartoons.<br/><br/>By the third act, my enthusiasm waned. I was surprised when I walked out to find the movie was only 2 hours long, because the way the second half of this film dragged made it feel more like 2 and ½ hours. I wouldn't say I felt duped, thinking the gimmick of this film would've been handled in a smarter fashion. It's just that the number implausibilities caught up with me to the point that I had to reject the entire film. Wait for the DVD."

","It takes awhile for the plot to get into high gear. To put it into retrospect, this is a film for gun nuts. Smith's secluded arsenal has more firepower than the Cleveland Swat Team. Automatic assault rifles, RPG, 9mm handguns, they got it all. During the cat and mouse foray in their grandiose house, some rounds fired by John hit the kitchen gas range and start it on fire. There's a brief silence then John says ""Are you okay, Sweetheart""? I was so flabbergasted at that point I almost choked on my popcorn. Upon hearing the noise caused by the Smith's quarrel-turned-rumpus, a few neighbors came to the door asking ""Is everything okay? We heard noises coming from your house"". But near the end of the film when the house explodes into smithereens (pun), do the neighbors assemble in the street to watch? Nope. Maybe they all went to the country club for cocktails. After the smoke cleared, there was still one ponder able enigma to be resolved...where the hell was Chuck Norris? The scene where John fakes intoxication and starts kibitzing and ultimately gets a seat in a high-stakes, covert poker game was pretty clever I thought. Jane now, who has much clout and eminence at her detective agency, acts so nonchalant in the face of the formidable task she has undertaken- in contrast to the female adversaries in James Bond 007 films, who show more aggressiveness. In summary, if you like lots of surprises, Mr. & Mrs. Smith will make your cup runneth over. If you delight in the eloquent mannerisms of good thespians, go see another film."

","Mr. and Mrs. Smith have been married for five or six years and have lived a seemingly mundane lifestyle. Their personal relationship is sinking and their sex life is down the hole (mind the pun.) However, what they are soon to find out is that they are in fact both contract killers and their next mission is to kill each other.<br/><br/>I was instantly intrigued by this movie, it had huge potential  such an original idea with a good director and actors should have been a great movie. But wasn't, so what went wrong?<br/><br/>No it wasn't the actors, nor the writing or producing. The main problem was that the story wasn't explored to its full capabilities. The synopsis that we read is only a small part of the movie and the rest seems to have been thought up on the spot to try and make the movie longer. There were so many aspects that could have been explored in this movie that were hardly touched on. For example: The psychological side of the story was hardly explored. Instead of letting the characters run with the idea of them each knowing their true identities and having a bit of fun, making it more entertaining and fun for the audience, it falls into the Hollywood blockbuster trap and they break out shooting at each other. This, to me, seems like a cop out by Mr. Liman, who proved to us he knows perfectly well how to make a good psychological action thriller in The Bourne Identity. I guess it is easier as a director of an action film to throw in a whole lot of explosions and CGI to try and impress your audience than to have a bit more of a think about your actual story and try to leave your audience entertained and left thinking after the movie.<br/><br/>This movie wasn't all bad though. The performances were quite good for what they were; Brad Pitt an Angelina Jolie did have good on screen chemistry (a little too good if you ask Jen) and did seem like a believable couple. Vince Vaughn was quite good as far as his acting capabilities go and Adam Brodie played a similar role to his in The O.C, a sarcastic rich teenager which is always fun Looking out the window of his limousine ""Hey look, more desert!"" Odd moments like this kept me going throughout the movie. And without giving away anything, I have to say I did like the ending.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was a silly little Friday night movie and didn't do any harm to watch. 6 and a half stars out of ten."

","What do you get when you cross a Tomb Raider with a Troy? Another Spy Game and even better! Mr. and Mrs. Smith is one of the best movies ever made about the subject of espionage. In addition, Angelina Jolie is an amazing actor and one of the most gorgeous women in the history of the world. Brad Pitt, equally, is one of the most talented and top fifteen, best actors of all time. There was no way this movie could lose. It won. Five stars. Hands downthe quintessential and unequivocal, ""spies next door"" movie. Perfectly scripted. Perfectly cast. Perfectly executed. Perfectly choreographed. Perfectly balanced. Perfect length. Perfect. Mr. and Mrs. Smith could not have been any better. Badass, kick ass fight scenes. Matrix style moves. As high tech as could possibly be. Truly intriguing. The cinematography is brilliantcrisp and rich. Sharp. Greatly defined. Bold. Daring. Extraordinarily textured. Breathtaking. Heart racing. Pulse-pounding. Suspenseful. Explosive! Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a movie that's so good, so remarkable, so incredibly exciting, that even if you're law abiding and non-violent, you want to hurt someone who says something bad about it. It's that darn good. Jolie and Pitt, two marvelous, thoroughbred, top ranked, world-class pros, blaze the silver screen with their prowess and leave all opposition and would-be haters in the dust. Their characters, coined some of the most deadliest operatives on the planet, are no laughing matter despite a hearty menu of well timed and interlaced jokes. The rocket scientists (Simon Kinberg and Doug Liman, et. al) who developed the formula, which powers this wonder, deserve a medal. The chemistry is unparalleled. The recipe must not be destroyed and must be protected as a matter of national securityand of course, audience morale. Such ought to be an executive, presidential directive. The movie leaves you wanting and craving more actionmore adrenalinemore scenes. And to think, that somewhere, there are in fact, people who really do the kind of work that these characters do in Mr. and Mrs. Smith is nuts. But I guess, as some experts have said, if someone really wants to be a spy, that person has to be ""spy crazy."" I've seen a lot of spy flicks and Mr. and Mrs. Smith is as crazy as it gets. An instant spy classic.<br/><br/>Mr. and Mrs. Smith, one of the top five spy movies of all time. Bottom line."
"RolloTomasi","9","2","5","8 July 2005"," My favorite film of 2005 (the first half, anyway)
","Doug Liman's short directing career is remarkable. Look at his track record. An instant classic in ""Swingers,"" then two movies later an unexpected blockbuster ""Bourne Identity"" due in no small part to his guidance, and now another overachiever, ""Mr. And Mrs. Smith."" I have to say I wasn't overly impressed with the trailers i had seen for this. But with Liman's name on it and an interesting premise, and because my girlfriend and I missed ""Cinderella Man"" by five minutes, there we were watching it.<br/><br/>From the beginning I had a feeling I was going to like it. Its humor seemed to hit the mark and it had just the right tone. It starts out appropriately enough with the couple (who unfortunately we know from the trailers are both assassins) in marriage counseling. Both actors seem fully invested in their characters. A strong start.<br/><br/>Sure there's a lot of killing and the film seems to sort of make light of it. But this is just a big fantasy, a huge stretch of reality as any good action/adventure film should be. It's a study in the marriage relationship and reminds those so wed of how they just want to wring each other's necks sometimes, even thought they love each other deeply. Why? Communication. Turns out real problem with the Smith marriage is that they're hiding the biggest side of their lives from each other. They're the only ones each other has to talk to about assassination-related issues buy they can't (how frustrating is that?) Then once their occupations are discovered and their pitted against each other, the film slides toward the couple's reconciliation--or rather, will they or won't they? If they do, will it stick? Will one kill the other before they give it a fair shot? There's a lot of possibilities during this section of the film, a great luxury for a film to have.<br/><br/>This achieves for ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" one of the most important elements of a good film story most these films days are lacking: a true sense of jeopardy for any main character. At any point during this film I thought it was possible for either of these characters to get bumped off. Somehow, it would've made thematic sense for it to happen to either of them. What's more, you give a damn! This suspense lasts to nearly the end of the film until the satisfying conclusion is reached. <br/><br/>""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is my favorite film of the year so far and one of only a few I actually want to see again (a definite DVD purchase)."

","To me, I was excited through the entire movie. I saw it with my mom and even she, as critical of movies as she is, loved it. I enjoyed the overall plot and i believe Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt were a good choice for the main actor and actress in this movie. Sure their lives don't seem much like a hit-man's...and how they meet is a bit awkward, those is the only weird parts to me but it did not prevent me from enjoying the movie. I would suggest seeing it while it is still in theaters (it adds to the excitement).

"Sfpsycho415","8","2","5","27 June 2005"," A funny and action-packed good time----8/10
","Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a refreshing alternative to to the kiddie CG flicks and stale comedies that have filled the multiplexes recently (and the only other movie i wanted to see this summer besides Star Wars). It's a classic action-comedy that pits two big stars against each other and about a thousand baddies, bickering all the while. Though usually action-comedy means cops, Smith adds a twist and makes it a pair of married assassins, played by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. The chemistry between the two stars is why Smith is so entertaining. Not only do they look good, but they seem to know the married life well, and deliver their sharp lines with hilarious punch. If you don't acknowledge the existence of idiotic tabloids, you will enjoy this chemistry a lot more.<br/><br/>The actions scenes are good for being PG-13, (though an R rating would have given us some gratuitous Jolie skin shots) and with this kind of movie you don't really need blood, though it wouldn't hurt. The fight in the Smith house is my favorite scene because it is funny and has them beating the crap out of each other. Same with the freeway chase. <br/><br/>While the movie is a lot of fun, the plot is paper thin and predictable (mostly because of the film's trailer) and ends kind of abruptly. Still, this is what an action comedy should be like; plenty of bullets, great chemistry between the stars, and hilarious dialogue. Mr. and Mrs. Smith is one of the best movies of the year.---8/10"

","Mr. & Mrs. Smith the most average name for a most average summer movie. Just because it's summer, moviegoers shouldn't have to settle for less which is what this movie is. The plot itself is filled with holes making its shallowness irrelevant. For eye candy to munch on there's Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, yet viewers are left with a bitter taste because lack of chemistry between the two. Good acting or casting isn't what's missing, but rather what was needed was an engaging and dynamic dialogue, not lame one-liners that all revolve around the same punch line. While it seems cute at first it quickly wears thin. The movie's only saving grace was the interspersed antics of Vince Vaughn. Also wearing thin by the end of this film are the sub-par action sequences, recycled chase scenes, and meaningless body count. Slow motion and slow explosions serve as poor substitutes for the Matrix patented 'bullet time'. As far as hand to hand combat is concerned, it's as clumsy and unconvincing as the dialogue. <br/><br/>Final Thought: Wait till you can rent this one, or see it on a plane, or better yet just wait for something better to come out next week. <br/><br/>Final Grades: (Eye Candy = A-) (Acting = C) (Action = C-) (Plot = D+) (Entertainment = C-)"

My only complaint is that the sex is merely implied. But still; Jolie is too damn good looking for words. And who ever thought of Pitt as a smooth talking comedian? Also in the cast are: Vince Vaughn, Kerry Washington and Stephanie March. The action is blatant, tense and loud. I can't imagine anyone wanting their money back. Jolie and Pitt are always ready for their ""close ups""...and some how you really don't mind."
"misterembryo","8","2","5","13 June 2005"," He will love it. She will love it. Jen will despise it.
","As an action movie, Mr. and Mrs. Smith is explosive with trigger happy gun brawls. As a romantic comedy this movie is as charming and as funny as any Meg Ryan Tom Hanks collaboration. This movie has the ability to meet the needs of all types of moviegoers, but be advised to leave the kids at home.<br/><br/>The movie opens with our couple at a marriage counseling session that updates with the progression of the movie and the status of their relationship, which turn out to be some of the most hilarious parts of the movie. Mr. and Mrs. Smith like any marriage, has its secrets. But to Mr John Smith and Mrs Jane Smith, these secrets can be deadly. At home they lead the normal lives as all couples do: agree with or disregard his sense of interior decoration, like or pretend to like her homemade cooking. At the office they lead, not just secret lives, but top secret lives as Mr and Mrs Smith both turn out to be top hit men (or woman) at two different organizations. However, after getting assigned the same mark, they get involved in each other's business and soon after get their new assignments: each other... developing into a dangerous, and hilarious relationship.<br/><br/>The premise may seem like True Lies without the Austrian Accent. True Lies also showcased a superspy whose secret life intertwined with his personal life. What sets Mr and Mrs Smith apart is less focus on their missions and more focus on their interaction and the suspense and hilarity of their relationship's development.<br/><br/>Doug Liman has definitely come a long way since the independent days of Swingers. However, even with his move from Swingers and Go to his bigger scale movies of Bourne Identity and Mr and Mrs Smith, he maintains his keen ability to connect with the audience. In other words, despite the bright lights and razzle dazzle, for lack of a better term, necessary in an action flick, he finds room for the audience to get engaged into the characters and what will come of their relationship... of its continuity or its termination.<br/><br/>One person who wouldn't bear to watch a single minute of this is poor Jen Aniston. Publicity stunt or not, all the tabloid gossip about Mr and Mrs Smith off camera has definitely helped it in the box office. But more importantly the chemistry between Pitt and Jolie on screen set the foundation for the movie, and without that chemistry the movie wouldn't have worked. Both actors have proved to be tremendously talented actors (See Fight Club and Girl Interrupted) not to mention eye candy... I'd sell my soul for one night with Angelina and I'm not afraid to admit that anyone would kill to have abs like Brad.<br/><br/>Their chemistry, acting ability, and sexual appeal were all necessary for this movie to work. Imagine if instead they clashed like Mr Smith played by Tom Cruise and Mrs Smith played by, I don't know Katie Holmes? Or if their acting needed polishing like Hayden Christensen alongside Paris Hilton. And not to say anything about their sex lives, but what if they had the sex appeal of Horatio Sanz with Chyna. No nothing else seems to work. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were made for this movie.<br/><br/>With a duo of that magnitude, this movie was certain to be a hit. It was refreshing to find that it wasn't misleading and that Mr and Mrs Smith delivered a package that was able to charm you, hold you in suspense, make you laugh hysterically, and make you want to wet your pants and make out with the girl next to you.<br/><br/>I can't think of anything wrong about this movie. Whether your fix is gunfire and cracking necks or if its enchanted moments and steamy sex appeal, you will be satisfied. To top it off Doug Liman reached back into the vault of the legendary Swingers world and resurrected good old T money Trent. Not only should you see it but see it again. Bring a date or two, and then tell your friends and family. This movie is classic."

","I caught the 6:25 and 7:20 shows at a local suburban multiplex. It was showing on two screens and they were packed. The audience applauded at the end. Personally I thoroughly enjoyed everything about the movie. First, who can complain about well shot close-ups of two such charming and physically appealing stars? Second, the riffs on marital verbal and non-verbal repartee were hilarious and on the nose. Take for example the passionate love-making post house-busting shoot-out. A little over the top, perhaps, but who hasn't felt that overheated hormone rush following a physical altercation with one's lover? Best sex ever, right? And in this case the scene even made literary sense -- one could see the original spark re-ignite the Smith's dormant passion for each other. It plays to the main themes of the movie -- why does marriage fail, and how to jump-start a stale one. ""War of the Roses"" was not so insightful. Third, the action was well choreographed, especially the Smith's pas de deux with guns during a shoot out in the final 10 minutes. This film has nothing to do with the other couple failures (Ben and Jen in ""Gigli;"" ""Kidman and Cruise in ""Eyes Wide Shut"") which were flawed films, plain and simple. ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is a genuinely entertaining action flick with smart writing, superb cinematography and editing, and two talented stars who know their material and can communicate the emotional nuances of love with sarcasm, irony, and humor. Not to mention the splendid chemistry between them. Brad and Angelina seemed to genuinely at least like each other. This film has nothing to do with what's wrong with Hollywood and the current box office slump. A film or two like the Smith's might in fact, be Hollywood's salvation."

I had no idea Brad Pitt could be so funny. <br/><br/>The director knew exactly how to deal with both Angelina and Brad's reputations and acting styles so that it came off subtle and smooth. Keep an eye out for the homage to Fight Club. <br/><br/>For all the feminists out there, Angelina Jolie pulls off a great addition to female action star role call. She kicks butt as much or more than Brad does in the film, (and the film even has a subtle take on Brad's character dealing with that).<br/><br/>There are even some great in-jokes about Brad and Angelina, as well as suburban life and the traditional roles of married couples. (It is even funnier than the bits in The Incredibles when they have to deal with normal life) and is just enough to support the character driven base of the plot without being boring.<br/><br/>Much better than expected.

The on screen chemistry was definitely visible between Angelina and Brad due to the recent speculations, this should grab a lot more viewers as it is evident in their performances! I think that this film is very entertaining with fresh witty comedy and great action sequences!

Vince Vaughn is funny, but underused. It's never revealed how John's and Jane's respective employers didn't know their stars were married for ""5 or 6 years"", but it must be a horrible violation if two competing assassination ""companies"" are willing to join forces to kill them. If only we knew the details of why. Prizzi's Honour this ain't, but it doesn't really try to be. Unfortunately, all the cool, slick fun of the first 75 minutes, and even the first few minutes of the confrontation with the ninjas, degrades in the final shootout: as others have said, the ninjas with machine guns shoot like storm troopers, while John and Jane perform their ballistic ballet. My biggest complaint about the movie is the end: are we to believe that, despite the fact that two assassination organisations merged for the express purpose of destroying John and Jane, now that they've killed all the ninjas, the kill order has been lifted and they're safe? I mean, it's not like they ran away; they even continued going to the same marriage counsellor. The end feels as if that's where the story should be starting.

Doug Liman's action film regards ordinary people hiding extraordinary secrets. If they are involved in a film this stupid then secrets are understandable. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie play John and Jane Smith whose marriage hides the fact that they are both agents. Setup is rushed with their meeting and marriage because the whole point of the movie is to get them to the action and where they beat the sh*t out of each other. Best aspect regards their discovering the secret and baiting each other with extreme tension but this eventually becomes an excuse for mindless violence and complete idiocy. Third act is all action and destruction with great slow motion shots by Liman who previously made a much better film called Go. Pitt and Jolie create the kind of relationship that would have Dr. Phil running for the hills. Their relationship is sidetracked with the action. Vince Vaughn as Pitt's contact living with his mother could have been much more than it was. Adam Brody also makes an appearance as if it matters.

They have a nice dinner with wine and bread (Coinsidence?), while being more than careless with the knives. They eat breakfast, but with shattered glasses and whatever wasn't destroyed from gunfire. They have their fair share of fights, that just involves guns and more knives and fists and nut-shots.<br/><br/>I'm one who likes a good fire fight and fancy smancy words that ""Secret...Agent Man"" uses, but I honestly watch this movie to watch the movie because of humor. At times they do act lovingly to each other, when one isn't trying to shoot the other. You can just feel the fun that these two are having.

","I heartily agree with most of those who were scathing about this film. Although I don't like too many action/adventure films released over the last decade, those with a sense of realism, well directed and acted can be very good. The Bourne Identity is a case in point, but not so much the sequels.<br/><br/>This car-crash of a movie however is in my top ten worst films of all time. It isn't just the absurd plot which defies the slightest scrap of credibility. The movie exhibits everything that is wrong with many Hollywood films today, typically relying heavily on explosions, gunfire, wooden characters and abysmal dialogue, which is supposed to be funny, but just isn't amusing in the slightest. Why do so many film producers these days have to treat the public like dorks?<br/><br/>Age also comes into it. Immature teenagers might enjoy this trash, but anyone who looks for any intelligent side to a film is going to be very pushed to find anything entertaining or remotely gripping about it. It just adds up to a violent, borefest where the mind soon becomes desensitized to it all.. <br/><br/>And the inclusion of Brad Pitt and his wife as the co-stars is there as a gimmick purely to bolster any interest, initially, but ultimately the film still fails to deliver on all fronts in spite of them. Neither of them needed to get involved with this so why did they? They were hardly short of a few bob. If they hadn't bothered in all likelihood this film would have sunk without trace from the moment of its release, and no one would have known or cared.<br/><br/>Sad, awful film"
"JamesHitchcock","4","2","6","21 November 2007"," Sexual chemistry is no substitute for anything
","Despite the title, this ""Mr and Mrs Smith"" has no connection with the Alfred Hitchcock film of the same name. It is essentially a black comedy/romantic comedy hybrid based around a single joke. John and Jane Smith are a suburban New York yuppie couple whose marriage is fast running out of steam. The single joke is that both of them are professional assassins, working for rival assassination agencies, and both are blissfully unaware of what their partner does for a living, despite the fact that they have been married for six years. In an obvious plot twist they find out that they have been hired to kill one another. Can John and Jane save their marriage? Can they do so without anyone getting hurt? And can Brad and Jennifer save theirs? <br/><br/>The script for the film is said to have been produced as a thesis for the writer's Masters degree in fine arts. Despite this academic pedigree, it does not show much in the way of intellectual qualities, or indeed in the way of originality, owing a huge debt to ""Prizzi's Honor"". (Plagiarism is generally frowned upon in academia, but positively encouraged in Hollywood). For much of the film, especially in the second half, there isn't much plot to speak of, just a long succession of action sequences consisting mainly of gunfire and explosions. For a film that is ostensibly a comedy, there is little wit or humour on display.<br/><br/>""Mr and Mrs Smith"" was obviously made on the assumption that any pairing of two stars as desirable as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie will generate so much sexual chemistry that the resulting film will automatically be a good one, or at least a profitable one. It must have been a godsend to the film-makers when rumours started to circulate that the two stars were more than just good friends in real life. Although suggestions were made in some quarters that these rumours were palpably false and had been deliberately spread in order to boost interest in the film, there was an even greater godsend when it was announced, a few months before the film opened, that Brad had left his wife Jennifer Aniston for his co-star.<br/><br/>I have to admit that the lovely Angelina looks extremely desirable in this film, and am reliably informed (by those who differ from myself either in gender or in orientation) that Brad does too. If, therefore, sexual chemistry can be defined as ""beautiful girl plus handsome guy"", ""Mr and Mrs Smith"" has that quality in spades. Unfortunately, contrary to what the film-makers seemed to think, good looks alone cannot guarantee a successful film. Sexual chemistry is no substitute for meaningful plot, intelligent dialogue or humour beyond one single joke. John and Jane might be fully paid up members of the Beautiful People, but it is hard to warm to characters whose profession is murder and who in the real world would probably end up on Death Row. Brad and Angie's off-screen antics may have made them the most talked-about couple in Hollywood. About their on-screen antics, the less said the better. 4/10"
"j30bell","7","2","6","4 July 2006"," Hard not to like
","Mr & Mrs Smith fails to work  or, in fact, add up  on so many levels. Probably the most trying suspension of disbelief required is the notion that two chronically paranoid assassins take a whole 5 or 6 years to figure out that they're sleeping under the same roof. Or, from a crude perspective, that it takes Brad 4 or 5 years to put Angelina's lips to work on anything more saucy than a peck on the cheek. Yeah right! <br/><br/>But none of that matters. No, really, listen to me, it doesn't. Because dwelling on such trivial matters as plot flaws, character inconsistencies, continuity problems and the like, you might fail to appreciate the majestic, hilarious nonsense of it all. Which would be a shame, really, as that's the whole point.<br/><br/>Think of it this way: Mr & Mrs Smith is Day of the Jackal meets Pirates of the Caribbean. It's bonkers (it would appear this is both literally and figuratively true). Leave all cerebral engagement, rumination and cogitation for later (it will only get in the way); lie back and think of Angelina - or Brad  or both - depending on your proclivity and/or stamina.<br/><br/>Mr & Mrs Smith is saved from the Chris de Burg Award for Hollywood Mediocrity by two critical factors, neither of which alone would have been enough to save it.<br/><br/>The first is the extraordinary chemistry between two fine actors. There is a point early in the film where Angelina, who is wrapped in a sheet with a flower in her hair, approaches Brad after a night of well, you get the idea. Brad looks at her with what one might generously describe as raw, naked lust. It was a look that could have impregnated the unprotected from 30 paces. Someone really needs to bottle that and give it to Orlando Bloom. Anyway, I digress. What this does for the film is help you overlook some of the knottier problems with the characterisation  like that fact that these two are, presumably, not very nice: y'know, the whole assassin, killing-people-for-money thing. To take another example, the whole Brad-cheerfully-and-repeatedly-kicking-his-wife-in-the-stomach (albeit off camera) thing.<br/><br/>The second saving grace is the dialogue. Fractious couples have been done comedically before, of course. But the counterpoint of marital strife and cold-blooded psychopathy has probably never been so funny. Think of the car chase in the Terminator, then think of it being used to relay two back stories not one. Then imagine it being played for laughs. It works, it really does. It's a skill.<br/><br/>There are some really deft touches too. Watch out for the lift sequence, and following dinner engagement. Watch out, also for the nice little reference to Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid at the end. It's worth remembering that the director was also responsible for a real spy movie  The Bourne Identity, so he knows what he's doing on that score. And definitely watch out for an hilarious turn from Vince Vaughan  now there's a man who knows how to spot an opening! Is this film high art? Erm no. Is it extremely difficult not to like? Yes it is. It's genuinely entertaining, and there has to be a place in cinema for that."

First of all, I am an avid Jennifer Aniston fan and believed that Brad Pitt (John) was scum for cheating on her and Angelina Jolie (Jane) was trash for going so as well. Now that that is out of the way, onward to my comments.<br/><br/>It starts with a couple whose relationship firstly began with passion, though after five, or six, years it was all but lost. They have normal relationship issues excluding one. Oops, they're spies and they find that they're next assignment is each other. I saw it a few weeks after it opened and already the details are escaping me.<br/><br/>John and Jane both have their own insecurities, wondering whether or not the other just married them to make an easier kill. The sparks are genuine, I'm afraid, and the acting is not the problem. I enjoyed this movie somewhat though I can remember what I ate at the theater better than all of the witty banter. It's strictly a popcorn movie with no other value, no undermining lesson except 'be honest, for all you know your spouse could be a hit (wo)man.'<br/><br/>Some of the issues of the movie were the fact that the 'surprise' of the film were shown in the commercials (unavoidable, but...) and the 'twists' are not surprising and you can see them coming from a mile away. Despite the fact that I dislike Jolie and Pitt personally (well, from what I know of them) it is undoubtable that they did a fine job in this movie and the acting was above par. Don't go into this too eagerly, it's not worth that, but, considering it all, it's not a bad movie.<br/><br/>6/10 stars"

If, however you don't find yourself enjoying unrealistic movies, than you probably won't enjoy this, as the movie stretches beyond what could really happen in several occasions.

","This movie is bada$$. Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have incredible chemistry on the screen. There is so much action and great comedy it's tough to type about it. This movie is a must see and by far the best movie of 2005.<br/><br/>I heard Nicole Kidman was first cast as Mrs. Smith I'm glad she wasn't. No disrespect to Ms. Kidman but she could not have pulled this role off, Angelina was the perfect choice and as beautiful as I've seen her. She was also very funny and showed she could handle the firepower necessary for this film.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt in my opinion this is his best role. Now I haven't seen the highly praised Fight Club but I doubt he was as good in that movie as this. He was even funnier than Jolie and that's saying something as I don't associate Pitt with comedy. He was definitely cool in this one and also handle the firepower as expected.<br/><br/>There's great action sequences throughout the movie and I highly recommend this movie. Not only is it a great summer blockbuster but I think if it were released at any time it would be just as great!"

","From the first scene of the movie you can tell that Mr and Mrs Smith is going to be a fun ride - and it is, but the fun was slightly ruined by just pushing it 15-20 minutes too far. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie prove that they are absolute geniuses at making a film interesting and fun with their roles as Mr and Mrs Smith. Their obvious actual connection and witty lines make this movie what it is. Scenes such as the one where Jolie bends down on her knees and Pitt smiles to the camera get the director a great mark from me because he obviously realized what this movie needed to be - fun (and yes I know I'm sounding like a stuck record).<br/><br/>In all seriousness Mr and Mrs Smith was well done on everyone's part, not just Jolie and Pitt's and there is not possibly a type of person out there that could honestly say they didn't enjoy this movie at least a little bit after they watched it. So watch it!"
"Sweet_Ophelia","9","2","6","12 June 2005"," Kick-Ass Action + Bullet-Proof Comedy
","Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's new action/comedy/romance had quite a lot to live up to. Especially since it was (supposedly) on the set of this film that Pitt and Jolie mixed business with pleasure, resulting in Pitt's marriage breakdown (supposedly) and a hectic media-frenzy (definitely). Media speculation aside, 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' could stand on its own two feet, even if it weren't for the storm surrounding it. <br/><br/>Written by Simon Kinberg (also penning 'X-men 3') and directed by Doug Liman ('Go' and 'Bourne Identity') 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' is a film about two married spies who are currently in a 6-year rut and don't know each other's true identities. Having met while in Columbia, using one another as a cover from the local police, John and Jane Smith were married 6 weeks later; and now 6 years later they find themselves in marriage counseling because as Jane describes; ""there's this huge spaceand it just keeps filling up with everything that we don't say to each other"". Their already fraying marriage (a concept which stings a little in light of Pitt's divorce) is really put to the test when both John and Jane are sent after the same target, Benjamin Diaz aka 'The Tank' (Adam Brody  bringing his OC Seth Cohen to the big screen, quite a feat!)  The Smith's identify each other and suddenly all bets are off as they both race to eliminate each other for their respective, independent agencies. Dazzling car chases and magnificent gun-fights and explosions ensue, guaranteeing constant thrills and entertainment. <br/><br/>Pitt and Jolie are perfectly cast. It helps that both are delicious to look at, so much so that during the times they both share a shot, it's hard to decide where to direct your eyes! Nicole Kidman was originally cast for the role of Jane; and personally, I don't think the film would have been even half as good as it was if she had remained. The very nerves of Jolie's body are constantly smoldering; she has just the right combination of seductiveness, illusiveness and bravado which Kidman, I think, would have surely lacked. Pitt is perfectly cast as the other half of the Smith duo; his athleticism gives him credibility, and his gifted comedic talents are surprising but much needed in this film which could have gotten lost in the gun-fights and marriage angst if it hadn't have been for the black humor provided by Jolie and especially Pitt. The two definitely have chemistry; which I know is so far the understatement of 2005 and has already been said to death by many other critics. But it's true. A very short and tame sex scene which I predict was cut-back following the rumors of an affair, if lengthened and elaborated I think would have really given the game away about their feelings towards one another; because even the short, repressed scene we are left with hints at a definite sizzle! Vince Vaughn plays Pitt's handler, and while he is yet again playing the sporadic, unkempt funny-guy, he does it so well that you can't help laughing. Adam Brody has a very minor role, which is probably a good thing, because if I wanted to see him play Seth Cohen, I don't need to pay $13, I can just watch him on the OC. <br/><br/>All in all 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' is one kick-ass film. All the violence may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I liked it. Pitt and Jolie are freakin gorgeous and perfectly cast. And the elevating dark humor is well-timed and perfectly slotted in amongst the fist and gun fights, and explosions. 9/10"
"Maira","9","2","6","12 June 2005"," war of the roses meets true lies
","For what it is, this is a great summer action flick with heart. Charming, cheeky, and poking fun at itself, the movie also actually follows an underlying plot line that questions modern male/female, wife/husband, and female/society issues, and it handles everything in a light but touching way that includes lots of butt-kicking and big-hearted ego.<br/><br/>We see Jane Smith chafe at the bit of male assumptions of female strength and capability, and John struggle to prove he's not an idiot and can be counted on to do something right (for once). Domestic bliss gets a twentieth century wake-up call as an independent woman struggles to be the perfect wife while really wanting to prove she can also be the perfect husband. We get to see a husband and wife really kick each other's butts (which, realistically, most partners aren't legally or physically capable of doing) and learn some hard lessons about themselves and each other by the time everything is over. For something people in long term relationships can't do, it sure is fun to watch. :)<br/><br/>A fun cast (Vince Vaughn is the bomb as always), some unrealistic details (don't look too closely at the ending or it'll break), and some bad mumbling on Brad Pitt's part. They could have given more depth to Angelina's character - they sum her up as a Type A, bitchy, anal-retentive personality, which conflicts unreasonably with the woman John Smith fell in love with in the first place.<br/><br/>Good summer fun, and, you get to bring your kids cuz, sadly, they cut out the steamy stuff. Maybe the DVD will add it back in ..."

"dglink","7","1","2","10 January 2015"," Frothy Action Comedy for Brangelina Fans
","Most two-career marriages have their share of problems, but John and Jane Smith have a unique set. Seated before an unseen marriage counselor at the film's opening, John and Jane appear relatively normal, although for two young attractive people, their sex life is non-existent, and they seem somewhat cool and distant. Can this marriage be saved? At their lavish home, Jane fusses about the new green drapes, John hates the color green; despite his aversion, Jane serves him green beans and peas. An evening out at a party emphasizes that the misfit couple is equally ill at ease among their neighbors; despite lengthy protests, Jane takes a baby onto her lap, and each looks at the other like an alien close encounter.<br/><br/>The Smith's underlying problems surface when a seemingly inebriated John breaks into a poker game, and, separately, a leather-clad Jane strides into a hotel room and whips a kneeling handcuffed masochist. Unbeknownst to each other, the two married professionals are both highly successful dispatchers of unwanted people; a hit man and a hit woman. Famous as the film that spawned wall-to-wall Brangelina tabloid reporting, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" stars Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, as though anyone within range of the Internet or cable news is not already well aware.<br/><br/>The film starts off well and, for at least the first half hour, is breezy amusing entertainment. Pitt especially seems to be enjoying himself; perhaps Angelina had already bewitched him. Unfortunately, the plot thickens and becomes confusing, violent action overwhelms the personal chemistry, and gimmicky gadgets stretch credibility. The film goes on far too long, and the joke eventually wears thin. However, Doug Liman's direction keeps the pace brisk, and the two leads play well together, although nothing on screen is remotely believable, and the story is already familiar from other movies. For most viewers, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" will provide frothy fun that will evaporate like soap suds before the credits roll. However, for die-hard Brangelina fans, this, their first co-starring epic, the movie that started it all, is a must-see."
"shellyjean2008","Null","1","2","31 July 2011"," The theme of Mr. and Mrs. Smith is that pretending to be someone else only causes problems, while being one's self allows one to experience true happiness.
","Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a film about a married couple, John (Brad Pitt) and Jane (Angelina Jolie), who have grown bored with their seemingly normal lives. The reality is that they both have very exciting lives due to their profession, but they hide it from their spouse which is causing problems. John and Jane are assassins and their next target is each other. John is sent on a mission to find Benjamin Danz (Adam Brody). While Jane is also sent after Benjamin ""The Tank"" Danz, they do not know that the other is there. This is really a ploy to get them to go after one another. Once they realize who their real target is, the fun really begins. They are very dedicated to their profession and so they begin fighting. They destroy their house in the process, but soon realize the reason that they were married five (or six) years ago. Once John and Jane know that they are both assassins, their lives change. They are no longer bored with their married lives because they are no longer hiding behind fake personas.<br/><br/>The theme of Mr. and Mrs. Smith seems to be that pretending to be someone else only causes problems, while being one's self allows one to experience true happiness. The theme is reflected throughout the Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Once John and Jane know that they are rival assassins they are able to be themselves. They learn much more about the other and are able to become happy with their lives rather than bored. Throughout the movie there are times when it cuts to John and Jane talking with their marriage counselor. As the story progresses, viewers can really see the change in John and Jane's demeanor as they open up as much as they can without revealing everything. The difference between their first and their last session is incredible and paves the way for a promising future. Similar in theme to this film is The Whole Nine Yards, which is another great film.<br/><br/>The angle and lighting used throughout the film creates the feeling of being in the scene with the characters. It also allows viewers to really focus on what is happening in each scene. For example, during the fight between John and Jane at their home, viewers can see from the perspective of John at some points and from Jane at others. When they actually face each other there is a whole new element to the way the camera is angled. Also, when John and Jane are looking for the convoy with Benjamin Danz, the angle that is used allows viewers to focus in on certain aspects of the scene, such as both John and Jane, the scenery, and the convoy. As far as lighting, this film uses it to focus on specific characters or objects throughout the film and to create certain feelings. For example, when John and Jane are fighting at their home, it is dark outside and all of the focus is on what the two characters are doing and how they are using their skill and tactics to attempt to kill the other because of the concentration of the lighting on them. When John and Jane are fighting, viewers can see that although they are assassins they still care about their spouse. If they had shared their secrets earlier, then they would not have been tricked into trying to eliminate each other."

She is a really good actress and the problems with Brad and his marriage hurt this movie in the long run.<br/><br/>I would have gladly watched it when it previewed if it had not led to the violation of marriage vows when it was first released.

Its only when both of them are given same mission then they realize each other's identity. The film was somewhat entertaining because of Pitt and Jolie chemistry. The popular , good-looking , extremely talented actors carried this movie on their shoulders. Not thy acted their part very well they all went on to prove that more than their good looks they can act very well. Direction was poor.

Action parts are the only worthy parts,Thriller is basically something that thrills you,but it didn't even shake me for one second.<br/><br/>What to say about performances? A)Brad Pitt as cool Johnny is bulls**t.he is not able to transfer the chemistry of their relationship.unable to show himself the cool killer.<br/><br/>B)Angelina Jolie is what she always is.Sexy,aberrantly heroine,live sex symbol though dangerous.enjoyable?thrilling?astonishing?<br/><br/>to be honest Naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.<br/><br/>whats happened to the director of((The Bourne Identity)),this is a really backward move for a talented director like him.<br/><br/>summery:Wooooo,How Rubbish!!!!!!"

","This is one of those movies that seems like the perfect storm: two gorgeous actors (Jolie and Pit), a funny sidekick (Vaughn), the cross-over TV actor (March), pretty faces (Huntley, Monaghan), a crazy plot, and just enough special effects to make it work. Unfortunately, with all these bricks, it sinks under its own weight. The plot is too detailed to let go and instead gets in our way. Pit and Jolie, as a bored married couple trying to hide each other's identities as competing assassins, is novel, but wears thin once they discover each other and start the death match. There's little suspense, and this is probably one to blame on the director or editor. Vaughn, as always, steals the show and is the main reason the film maintains any sense of stability."

","""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is a fast-paced comedy about a husband and wife who live secret lives. John and Jane Smith are assassins working for different companies, and their world is flipped upside down when they learn of each other's double lives. This film is very enjoyable on a number of levels - humanitarian, comedic, and action-oriented. The director, Doug Liman, shows how these two characters struggle to not only save their own lives, but save their marriage as well. In a Hitchcockian fashion, the humor is based around the idea that the audience knows something the protagonists do not. When the discovery of each other's true identity is made, classic Hitchcockian suspense is used in a number of interesting sequences. The action in the film is not only entertaining, but smart. I am reminded of the Gene Kelly dance sequences at the end of the 50's Big Band musicals because the action is passionate and reveals the characters' emotions. The stylized choreography is visually pleasing and clever. In conclusion, this film has a solid script and cast, and reveals the ups and downs of marriage in a modern and fun way. If you like ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""The Matrix,"" or even ""Singin' in the Rain,"" then I highly recommend this film. Enjoy!"

Then gets to be a hit! I liked the wit, the action and yes the emotion. Both spouses and friends will like it. Even seeing it together have something to enjoy. There is something for both male and female alike to keep them watching. It is not a ""chick flick"" yet, not quite a guys ""war movie of the week"". The fast pace, and mix of comedy and well paced chase scenes make this a bonus must see!! My husband and I rarely agree on films we both want to purchase. This was one without doubt.

","Well I can't understand the ""great"" reviews I have read on here regarding Mr. and Mrs. Smith. The two attractive leads, Jolie and Pitt, could not save this movie. But I do agree, the chemistry between them is UNDENIABLE. The first hour or so was hard to sit through and I was tempted to turn off the DVD. With very little plot, very little background on the two main characters, the director just used a lot of explosions and gun-fights to make up from where the story lags. This was a watered-down effort with not enough substance to entertain an audience for almost 2 hours. There were some humorous parts and cute quips, but other than that, I am glad I waited for DVD to see this one. Not a movie I would torture myself by sitting though a second time."
"bob-rutzel","9","1","2","1 December 2005"," Very Entertaining
","Two top assassins (Pitt and Jolie) meet, fall in love, and stay married for 5-6 years without either one telling the other what he/she really does. Of course they each had cover jobs each knew about. Then one day each is assigned to take the other one out. Oh, oh, this can't be good.<br/><br/>Pitt and Jolie bring their A games to this exciting and very entertaining movie. We are not talking Oscars here, but a very good movie, even paced and with humor too. If you had the brass contract for this movie you would be quite wealthy by now. Yes, there is a lot of shooting, and explosions, special effects stunts(very spectacular), and car chases (Whoa!) and well, everything you want in a good spy movie. It's all here. Every bit as good as the Bourne Identity, but a little more on the lighter side, perhaps. You like these characters and hope they work things out. I was somewhat reminded of the War of the Roses, and although this movie really goes for the jugular, it's light-hearted enough not to be scary or gory.<br/><br/>One of the things I liked best about this movie is when the characters went after each other, there was no malice and in some ways it was quite comical and still very serious. I am dying to say more, but I will yell those comments into a pillow to get them out of my system.<br/><br/>Very entertaining and I didn't want it to end and I still have questions regarding the ending. You might too."

","I really liked this movie. It started a little slow to me but then it got better. It was a good action movie much in the vein like Tomb Raider. If you like to see Angelina in those types of movies than this is for you. I thought the quips were funny and Angelina and Brad were great together. I rate movies by would I buy this if it came out on DVD and the answer is yes. It touched on the boredom married folks feel when they have been together for a couple of years. I don't suggest doing what this movie did but it's great entertainment. If you like your movies with a little romance this movie has that to. All in all it was a great movie. I recommend it. This is a great compromise movie for the woman who likes romance and the guy who likes action."
"Rob_Taylor","5","1","2","5 September 2005"," Terrible brainless drivel about two expressionless idiots.
","I suspect I'm the only one who found this movie unintentionally offensive due to the nature of it's two stars and certain off-set antics between them leading to the demise of Mr Pitt's relationship with a certain Ms. Aniston. That Pitt's first movie since the ""breakup"" would be about a couple who don't know what each other get up to behind their partner's backs is one of those dreadfully ironic twists of fate that could only occur in Hollywood.<br/><br/>So it was that I was predisposed to dislike both Pitt and Jolie in this film. Luckily, they both have such mahogany-like acting abilities that I don't need to use the aforementioned dislike as an excuse to slate the movie. They are so unbelievable in the roles of husband and wife that it is physically painful to watch them on-screen. I have yet to see ""Gigli"" which is reputed to have even less chemistry between its stars, but I can't see how it could get much worse than this.<br/><br/>As for the plot......sheeesh! Two rival hit agencies don't apparently know that their respective top agents are married to each other? Good grief it's just lamentably awful. We won't go into the rest of the ""plot"". Suffice to say that this film is suitable for IQ's below 100 and let's leave it there.<br/><br/>Not much depth, some action, no plot, actors that need a good wood stain to bring out their grain.<br/><br/>Not recommended."

Sure there were some cool gadgets and a cool car chase. And sure there were a couple of good one liners. But that's it. Other than that it was kinda boring/mediocre.

There were only a handful of mild universal chuckles during the movie, my personal way of rating this obviously is not a comedy, if it is they missed.<br/><br/>It may have been an off day for me, but the whole movie seemed flat, forced, and slow. I have to admit that I have had movies strike me this way and then after watching them several times on Cable or DVD I can come around to them, but that is not what you need when you see it in the theater.<br/><br/>Just my opinion, I may be wrong!"
"Elori","4","1","2","2 July 2005"," An action movie without the action
","Mr & Mrs Smith is one those tricks Hollywood plays up on you - giving you commercials of an action-packed movie, setting up a delicious scene in the first minutes of the movie - and then delivering almost none of it. Mr & Mrs Smith tries to be a different action movie by completely doing away with genre norms and taking heavy dives into drama. Unfortunately, with the actors chosen, the effect is completely lost. Brad Pitt is bearable, but Angelina Jolie simply screams ""Tomb Raider"" throughout the movie. Perhaps it is a sign of the weak market of female action stars, with Jolie being the best of the poor, but the movie falls as much on her account as it does on the script. Do you really want to be using your entertainment minutes on watching everyday trudgery, albeit with an unusual hook? It's like The Incredibles with real actors - super-people having to do with everyday life. Unlike The Incredibles, though, the movie has no red line to carry it through, and drags on all over the big screen. There's likely a sequel coming - there better be, with all the setup this movie squanders its screen time on."
"anhedonia","6","1","2","1 July 2005"," Coasting on star power
","Take a generous helping of ""True Lies"" (1994), add a hint of ""The Thin Man"" (1934) and toss in a dash of ""Prizzi's Honor"" (1985) for good measure and what have you got? Why, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith,"" of course.<br/><br/>I can't remember the last time I saw a film that depended so completely on its stars' charisma to carry it. Luckily for director Doug Liman and screenwriter Simon Kinberg, they have Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, both of whom have undeniable screen presence. But as well as they click, even Pitt and Jolie have to overcome a script that loses its way in the third act and a story with enough holes to drive through several convoys of trucks.<br/><br/>One critic said this film contains a level of sophistication, a la ""The Thin Man"" films. The Smiths are no Nick and Nora Charles. Make no mistake about it. The banter between Pitt and Jolie doesn't even come close replicating the Charleses' repartee. ""Come to daddy,"" Mr. Smith says during a fight. She decks him and replies, ""Who's your daddy, now?"" Simon Kinberg's script really doesn't go beyond this level. You want sophisticated comedy? Watch an Ernst Lubitsch movie.<br/><br/>All that being said, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" still remains enjoyable for the most part. Much of the enjoyment comes from watching Pitt and Jolie play off each other. There's undeniable chemistry between these two stars and they know how to use it. They make their dialogue - however preposterous it may seem - to sound natural. You get the feeling these are two people awfully comfortable in each other's space and that helps a great deal.<br/><br/>Director Doug Liman knows how to shoot action sequences. He's proved it before. Here, again, the action scenes are exciting, pounding and fast-moving. But where the film comes apart is when, for some inexplicable reason, Liman and Kinberg abandon their characters and turn ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" into an excuse to blow things up and nothing else.<br/><br/>True, this is a leave-your-brain-at-the-door film. There's no doubt about that. But the story had potential and the film gets off to a terrific start. But it really gets too caught up in the action and forgets about its two very interesting protagonists.<br/><br/>On ""Inside the Actor's Studio,"" Jolie said that the film's stunt coordinator looked at the script and added plenty of action, turning essentially a half-page of action into several weeks of shooting. And that very well could've been the problem.<br/><br/>The film gets more ridiculous as it goes along, culminating in an outrageous shoot-out that defies belief even for a film of this nature. The sequence also isn't done that well, either. For a good example of how to make such moments taut, tense and thrilling, watch the Italian film, ""The Nest"" (2002), which essentially takes place inside a warehouse.<br/><br/>""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" ultimately has more bluster than it ought to. There are two tremendously talented stars and one awfully capable director. But somehow they get so wrapped up in the film's cacophonous action that they ignore this story's most important aspect  its charming characters."

Their banter and one-liners are hysterical! It was the type of movie you go see to ""get away from it all"" and escape for a few hours in a theater. A fun summer popcorn flick! Pitt shows some real charisma here, and is SO funny especially the scene where Jolie checks him for weapons and gets to his crotch and he says ""That's all John, baby""!!

","I saw this movie today and right from the opening scene knew it was my type of film. The critics and the trailers seemed to indicate that it wasn't that good a movie, but fortunately I went with the fact that I like both main actors and the premise. It has both action and a love story (not soppy), as well as humour. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie really bring across the idea of the married coupled (like any other) going through a rough patch - but with their own unique quirks.I especially liked Jolie's acting. Some critic said that they don't gel, but I found they work excellently together. The action is smart and well shown and rather spectacular at times. I like the way they managed to put humour, love and action all into one scene - without making it confusing or sacrificing one for the other. The story is told compellingly and holds up fairly well to inspection, with good plot twists. This is not some drama or a thriller, neither is it camp comedy, so don't watch it expecting to see those. What you can expect is good acting, good action, fine bods with good humour and a touching love story."

","This movie let me down big time. I knew it would be action filled, not a real drama or anything of the sorts, but what I did not expect was a lackadaisically acted film with horrible direction. The plot is a husband and a wife who are both hired hit men, but don't know it. Brad Pitt plays his ONLY role of the dude who eats and beats people up (I know he is supposed to have great jawbones, but enough eating already), and Jolie plays Laura Croft again. Roger Ebort said that this movie worked because of the chemistry between the two, but I missed it. As for the directing, there is no artistic impact in the movie at all. The camera reminded me of the O.C. and the special effects were horribly done. I gave it a four because Jole is still beautiful."

I definitely give this a 10 out of 10. The movie starts out with a Psyciatrist talking to Mr. and Mrs. Smith about their marriage, and the first couple of lines are pretty good such as, ""How often do you have sex?"" Mrs. Smith replies with ""I don't understand the question."" Hardly any drugs, some violence more along the lines of physical comedy, such as John kicking his wife as hard as he can...

Sure, the leads are impossibly good looking and the story line is completely ridiculous, but we always knew it wasn't a documentary. It really is a wild ride, very glamorous and violent, with witty lines and gorgeous wardrobes. Angelina Jolie does a great job of being very cool, with a warmth and unexpected vulnerability bubbling just below the surface. Brad tends to be guilty of wooden acting in some films, but not this time. He also plays his part with warmth and an endearing eccentricity that he can do so well. These two certainly compliment each other, and there is no denying that the on-screen chemistry is just about the best I've seen in a very long time. The support acting is good, especially Vince Vaughn, but the show belongs to Angelina and Brad, and rightly so. Great fun, great lines, great cheekbones."

The movie was just visually appealing to watch with its action packed scenes with some comedic and some-what romantic moments sprinkled over the whole thing. The movie's biggest let down was the plot. There was no explanation for either of the people either Mr or Mrs smith are working for. I also felt that at the end the pair didn't really love each other and that it was still all a lie that they both were playing into.

My real problem is the movie takes its time to really get going and then its over. Like a virgin fumbling through his first sexual experience, the movie is slow to start and all too happy to end all too quickly, and I'm unsatisfied.<br/><br/>The action is here and there, and there are two great pieces that I enjoyed.

","Now as for Sly and Willis they have wasted a lot of their career doing action movies because it doesn't stretch them as actors. They are good actors given good roles, people forget Stallone got an Oscar nomination. The Rock is more like Arnold. He's limited in his acting chops but has a charm and likability and a good presence and we can expect no more from him than simple roles, where his prerequisite is simply to cause carnage and emote on the odd occasion. I am glad we could see a reinvention of 80's action movies, Jackie Chan breathed new life ot the martial arts genre throughout the late 90's and the first years of this decade, but they seem to be wearing thin now so it seems some good old fashioned superhuman carnage could be on the cards, there's even the possibility of a new Die Hard, Rambo, True Lies and some new films like Spy Hunter. Even Van Damme and co in DTV land are going back to basics and not trying to test their acting, because truth be told for 99% percent of these action stars it's a test where failure is inevitable and it's not what their fans really want. <br/><br/>The Rundown is simplistic stuff. You have a simple premise and a setting that is prepped and ready to be blown up. You have a strange mix of central characters, with The Rock and Sean William Scott. Meaning there will be plenty of fast jive talking and one liners. You have your thespian in their as the bad guy. Christopher Walken in this case and your ready, you have the basis for a good fun action movie. This is great fun. Arnold and Sly would be proud to have this on their CV. In fact it is on Arnies CV because he has a cameo at the start which is effectively him passing the torch on to the Rock. There are no twists and turns of any really note but the important thing is that it is nicely paced it has a nice glossy sheen to the cinematography. There are few hints at them aiming for a particularly young and hip-hop or Nu Metal demographic like Fast And Furious or Jet Li's films have done, thankfully. It's cool without going over the top and blowing it's wad. I like the fact this isn't made for pimply teenagers first and foremost. It's made for action lovers, it's a loving and subtle gift to young adults, 20 something's who watched the action films in the 80's and early 90's when they were undemanding, untainted fun and far form the marketed tripe we get now."

Action, comedy and a high pace with some nice pauses, with great timing. A lot of shooting, a lot of explosions and some fighting, but never so much you think they go overboard. Add a real witty dialog (and no dubbing or subtitles can ever be as good as the original lines), some real situation based comedy and a great performance by the actors in the lead roles. Face it, it doesn't get much better than this. I especially loved the dance scene. Good lines, good acting. Humor and suspense mixed up and I really never knew in which direction it would go. I just felt that it would be spectacular. And it was. The ending was little other than I expected, but actually was pretty good.<br/><br/>Great as this was, I hope they don't do a sequel. A lot of the chemistry in the movie was the discovery, and then the resolve of Jane and John finding out the other was a professional hit-man. Now that they know, I don't think another go at the story would be as good. But this was great, a must see! 10/10"
"Boggman","10","2","7","20 June 2005"," ""Baby......you still alive""????
","""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is a very fun, extremely well written and well acted movie that delivers its audience one heck of as good time! We all know the plot line....two married assassins who do not know that their spouse is in the same line of work as they are; are hired to kill one another when a failed hit goes terribly wrong.<br/><br/>""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" has a lot going for it. Let's start with its two leads. Angelina and Brad do a fine job playing off one another. They definitely have on-screen chemistry. Brad Pitt turns in a excellent comedic performance, which slightly overshadows Angelina Jolie's; but not by much. Jolie herself is sleek and sexy the whole way through, and shows a knack for subtle comedy as well. The dialogue and banter between the two of them is sharp, honest, well written, and finely executed.<br/><br/>Mr. and Mrs. Smith has no shortage of action either, with some downright hilarious cat and mouse scenes as the Smiths' attempt to ""off"" each other at work, at home, and even while driving! The action is choreographed quite nicely in every scene.<br/><br/>Clocking in at about 2 hours, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is a comedic romp that's serves as a fun ride from start to finish.<br/><br/>Definitely worth the admission price and highly recommended! Excellent!!!!"

A friendly competition between them in their roles to ""best "" the other is totally believable. I liked the pacing from beginning to end, short cycles of background or build up to full rounds of action.

","Loved the movie. The chemistry between Brad Pitt and Angelina Joile is great--even when they're trying to kill each other. Doug Liman knows how to direct action films without the action sequences being too over the top. I would rank this up-there with Bourne Identity in that respect. Vince Vaughn is a scene stealing genius in this--probably his best work.<br/><br/>Hmm, that's not ten lines. Okay, the soundtrack was good. Whoever dressed Brad Pitt did an excellent job. Adam Brody was surprisingly good. Did I mention the chemistry? It is was palpable. Anyway, it's a commentary on marriage that even a single person can enjoy. Whether it got the top box office spot because of all the to-do in the papers over their off-screen lives doesn't really matter. To-do aside, it's a good summer romp (pun slightly intended) ."

","The characters of Mr. & Mrs. Smith very well performed by Mr. Pitt and Ms. Jolie. It is a very entertaining movie, never a dull second while watching it. The director of the movie surely pulled a fast one on this! Entertainment was capture to the tee! <br/><br/>The actors (Brad and Angelina) looked like getting off the screen with their chemistry toward each other. I fondly remember Richard Gere and Julia Roberts combination, except for the guns, bombs, and fire. What a treat of a movie! <br/><br/>The punch of showing Mr. Smith winking on the camera, to me is a way of drawing the audience to stay on and engage with them in their fun at the set. Mr. Smith is mischievous but with that sense of innocence that says ""we're all together playing this part;you stay tuned.""<br/><br/>If I were a film critic, I will give the movie 10 stars for Capital ""E"", to stand for entertainment. <br/><br/>In seeing movies, I belong to the genre of those that look for entertainment, including unrealistic plots, with actions, and lot of computer imaging and tricks. But of course, the basic human emotions (love, fear, anger, jealousy, good and evil) are articulated in the screenplay. <br/><br/>In my opinion, this is the reason why Star Wars, Star Trek, Animated, Indiana Jones movies stick very well with the audience. We need a break from those movies that keep us thinking even after we leave the movie house, depressed, and searching for answers. <br/><br/>It's surely a real treat to watch Mr. & Mrs. Smith!<br/><br/>Congratulations to you all!

","The new movie by Doug Liman (The Bourne Supremacy/Identity)Mr. and Mrs. Smith has less to do with the 1941 Hitchcock movie of the same name and more similarities to True Lies.<br/><br/>Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a fun action adventure/Romantic Comedy about two competing agents who after having been married for five or six years, decide to give their romantic engine a ""tune up"" and head off to counseling. Of course neither Mr. Smith (Brad Pitt) or Mrs. Smith (Angelina Jolie) know that the ""other"" person is a secret agent and blame the repetitiveness of suburban marriage on them.<br/><br/>Throughout the course of the hail of gun fire and flipping cars, the two fizzed-out lovers discover that they are on opposite sides and come to terms with a crisis of belief. ""Do I honor my job and my duty? Or do I honor my marriage?"" More guns erupt, more cars somersault and the movie takes hair pin turns to discover which is more important to the characters, love or loyalty.<br/><br/>I think this movie is fun. I barely noticed that this was a PG-13 rating. It had the flying bullets and freeway chases that I needed from a movie, and it had a fun romantic comedy aspect to it (peppered with HOT steamy moments) for my wife.<br/><br/>Sadly it did have some of that signature shaky camera footage that the director seems to love, but it was not as heavy as the Bourne movies. The movie was a great diversion from the daily grind and definitely has something for everyone, good show."

We smiled through the entire movie, laughed like crazy in some parts, and when it was all over, the entire audience burst into applause. It was thoroughly entertaining, delivering even more sexy action than the trailers and previews had promised. The story was not overly complex but still managed to be intelligent. The closest comparison that could be made to other films would be a fusion of War Of The Roses and Fight Club, but Mr. & Mrs. Smith is easily the most original flick I've seen in years.

","'Mr & Mrs Smith' is the funniest and sexiest action movie to come out in many years and just watching two very beautiful people on-screen is a delight in itself.<br/><br/>While definitely not destined for the Oscars or any other prestigious movie awards, the movie is entertaining with its dry humour, spectacular fight and gun scenes (the fight to the death between Pitt and Jolie in the house is an instant classic, especially to the beat of 'Express Yourself' and with a completely no holds barred attitude), and, of course, the sparkling chemistry between the two leads.<br/><br/>Pitt and Jolie have such a great chemistry on-screen that it completely overshadows any slow or dull moments in the movie (which was a little long for an action movie). It is not hard to see why there has been such a media interest in the Brad-Angelina 'relationship' off-screen when watching these two giving each other sultry glances and their charisma bouncing off the other. And of course there are the sexy scenes which makes one wonder how much these two got into their roles.<br/><br/>Despite whatever's been happening off-screen, it's refreshing to watch a movie where it's clear that the main cast had great fun making it. Angelina taps into her 'Lara Croft' persona quite a bit in this movie while Brad delves a little into his persona from 'Ocean's Eleven'. Most of the supporting cast also deserve some praise; Vince Vaughn was great in his role of a hit-man who still lives at home with his mum (the only woman he can trust), while it was fun to see Adam Brody of 'The OC' fame having a telephone smashed into his face by Angelina.<br/><br/>All in all, a fun movie and definitely a must-see for fans of Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie."

","This film was a joy to watch! Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's chemistry was magic. It was delightful to see them exercise their comedic skills.

I simply can't believe reviews I've read that state the film was ""unrealistic"" - what idiocy! I sincerely doubt anyone associated with the film was aiming for realism as they worked to shine a very bright light on the way men and women (and especially married couples) deal, or rather don't deal, with each other. The message is right on the money, and like any good farce, it is delivered in a heightened fantastical manner. We're allowed to laugh out loud at ourselves while watching some very attractive actors play out the oldest conflict in the world: the battle of the sexes.<br/><br/>Bravo to everyone associated with this production!

Well, the movie has a relationship element which my wife enjoys, and a comedy element I enjoyed. Mr and Mrs Smith starts out strong and keeps a solid pace. The music is great and suits the movie. The action and comedy is well directed. Vince Vhaughn is a strong supporting role. Vhaughn can be annoying and funny at the same time, a hard task. Pitt and a few others could pull of the lead role. Pitt was able to act serious, and silly. Jolie is a mystery for the viewer to understand, and Jolie fits the character's actions. A good drive-in movie. Two movies for $7.50 is a great deal, and Mr and Mrs Smith is a great headliner. 7 out of 10. A great date movie.

","When my friends and I decided to go to Mr. and Mrs. Smith, I went in not expecting much more than a typical action movie, but upon leaving the four of us were roaring with laughter.<br/><br/>As most people know, the movie is about two super spies who are married and unknowingly competing against one another. On one mission, they encounter one another and decide to eliminate one another. Brad Pitt gives the expected performance as a cocky, macho guy, but he pulls it off without a flaw. Angelina Jolie plays the ice cold wife. Her action scenes are fine as expected, but she pulls off the rest of the role without too many problems. As for Vince Vaughn, he plays the typical funny man. If you've seen any of his recent movies, you'll know what to expect.<br/><br/>As you can see from my rating, I was very pleased with this film.

I live in Colombia, Bogotá and we aren't a TOWN! we are a 8'000.000 people living in a BIG CITY and I know that my country lives in war, but the war is in the little towns far away from the BIG CITIES, so...for me (and people who I saw in the cinema) was so sad to see what people from north America ""imagine"" from my city. I think we (Colombians) and specially people who lives in Bogota, got an apology from them and I invite them to come to Bogota, if my city is like they imagine."

I knew from the trailers it would be fun, I just had no idea I would like it THIS much! The story line is very fun, interesting and the entire movie keeps you immersed, and again, their sex appeal is just out of this world.

"lifestandstillhere","10","2","9","10 June 2005"," the dance is all
","Until you become accustomed to the overweening beauty on screen, it's hard to watch Mr. and Mrs. Smith. With all of the teeth and pouty lips, the blue eyes and bravado, you don't know exactly where to rest your eyes. But the film soon takes care of that, sweeping you into the center of a cyclone that rages around this couple. Bullets and one-line zingers fly, and, before long, two competing agents are at odds--and each other's throats. Their violence would be offensive if it were not a metaphor for the slings and arrows of every relationship, and so we come to root for Jane and John--the perfect prototypes for those who ""deserve"" the American dream. In several scenes, the action takes a backseat to their bickering, reinforcing the notion that the Smiths aren't fighting against outside forces so much as they are the seemingly impenetrable walls they've built between them.<br/><br/>Jolie is the razor against which Pitt sharpens himself, proving to audiences that he can, in fact, act in the comedic vein (a side of him we happily glimpsed in his stint on Friends). The tension between them is increased, I think, because of the action sequences, and is at its height when they are in the still eye of the storm of firefight around them. It is here that both realize that they do love one another, that the only way back to one another is through learning to ""dance"" together again, though to a different tune.<br/><br/>In the film's final action sequence, as they ""dodge bullets"" once again, Liman plays the song from their first meeting. This last scene is shot in slow motion, and each balletic movement shows that in the center of the storm, the dance between two people who have finally found each other's rhythm again is all.<br/><br/>And so, at heart, this movie is a love story. But all around that love story swirls action, comedy, and, yes, the sexy sizzle we've been hearing about for months now.<br/><br/>In the final words of John Smith: this movie is a ""ten."""
"adamdonaghey","9","2","9","10 June 2005"," Style and Grace and Angelina Jolie has a Pretty Face!
","I spontaneously saw the new film by the director of The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy this afternoon. I haven't gone to a film on a whim in a very long time, but I'm glad I chose this one. I mean, not only does the film have the contract killa action that the Bourne films have, but the dialogue remains witty and clever without drowning out the primary theme of the film. And there's always the actors. I don't see how anything can go wrong with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie at the helm. I was watching ""Brad Pitt: The Interview"" the other night with Diane Sawyer, and I remember thinking to myself--as Pitt was discussing his divorce with Jennifer Aniston and the rumors swarming him and Jolie--""Wouldn't it be grand if these two beauties got together?"" The chemistry between these two is really phenomenal. I mean, this isn't a romantic comedy, this is an action flick; yet, you're really pushing for these two to make it out alive--and together. Where, generally speaking, the romance between two individuals in an action film just doesn't matter that much.<br/><br/>I came into the theater thinking, ""Okay, this'll be a clever reaction to The War of the Roses,"" but it really wasn't. It was something all its own, and it had a charm that Roses didn't have, that I found myself addicted to throughout the film. The charm was in the banter, the style, the believability of the whole thing. There was one scene that screamed Jerry Bruckenheimer, but other than that it convinced me. Oddly enough, however, it was the style that sutured me into the whole thing. The mentality and quips of the characters, the clothing they wore, the architecture of the scenes, the technology, the furniture--everything. I recommend the film, but I recommend you leave the credit cards at home or be ready for some strenuous self-discipline; you'll wanna go shopping afterward. That, or you might do some traffic weaving on the way home like I did."
"zazyzouza","8","2","9","9 June 2005"," A guaranteed smile for the summer
","After the multiple irrational rumors about Jolie and Pitt, I entered this movie yesterday with my fingers crossed...Yes, I was freaking out 'cause I didn't want this movie to suck. Not only did the media trash it, but it also brought a lot of indecency towards the two skilled actors... OK, on to the movie now: The movie is unbelievably funny and the action is amazing. The fights scenes are brilliantly made and you can see that Jolie and Pitt have done this before (for Pitt: Snatch, Fight Club, Ocean's 11 and 12, need I say more?? for Jolie: the 2 Tomb Raiders of course!) and the chemistry between them is pretty natural. Oh, they clearly know how to handle a gun! Liman was right, during the fight in the house -shown in the trailer- you are afraid for John from Jane's physical abilities! Every guy in the cinema was making these ""OUCH"" faces and couldn't believe this would happen to a professional assassin. Doug Liman has adopted a Soderbergh-method (not similar to the one in Ocean's Eleven nor Twelve but the one used in Traffic) this time, and it works for the fast-paced movements. It's like the camera is subjective and not a simple observer. Some zooms into the faces can change the whole perspective of the character, believe me! Angie is an excellent actress and the role fits her like a glove and if it were Kidman instead of her, it would've been a total disaster 'cause she's not cut out to do all these action scenes. In the end, you need someone with guts: Jolie is the one. Pitt is acting pretty naturally, and it's a pleasure to watch him. But I gave that movie an 8 'cause there are some things that appeared a little cliché but it's not something that ruined the movie... Oh the shrink scenes you've seen in the trailer are incredible!<br/><br/>This movie is something to savor and enjoy and before you get in to see it throw away all the obscenities written by the media on this movie. This movie's good and it deserves the credit."

","I love this movie with all its quirkiness comedy and action it's a fabulous gem! Angelina and Brad's chemistry really make the film they are so good together, the balance of action and comedy with funny little digs at each other it works so well. It portrays and captures the idea of everyday life and what a marriage would be like every ordinary day when it's been 5 or 6 years and maybe that everyone has a secret side to themselves that they don't share, I'm not saying to the extreme like John and Jane do but in some way big or small.<br/><br/>In saying this that I love this film which I do, in some parts it gets a little lame and possibly boring I think the main target ""The Tank"" was boring I reckon he could have been improved to make the challenge a little more exciting. I didn't like Vince Vaughn's character Eddy and his scenes, I like Vince Vaughn I think he is funny but in this film I don't like his humour and character I think they degrade the movie.
It's in scenes with ""The Tank"" and Eddy are the weakness of the movie, also some parts where it doesn't quite flow such as when John opens the shed door and he sees that Jane has found his bunker of guns and he goes ""Ohhhgg, Ohhhg"" and that's all he has to say, that's his line of shock I mean surely they could have come up with a better line than that! And when Jane leaves the room of her first onscreen job the man that she breaks his neck and she goes out the window and glides down from her handbag then lands effortlessly in front of a taxi and hops in, nobody saw her drop from a 30 story building? Holding nothing but what use to be a handbag, the street was busy, how did nobody see? When they were fighting each other in the house and they were shooting off hundreds of Bullets at each other and not one of them hit the other, these two are supposed to be the two best assassins with accurate shots and yet neither of them hit the other they suddenly had bad aim, same with the bad guys they can never shoot straight. Things like that make it a bit cheesy and lame but other than that I love it.
I love the therapist scenes and how they keep connecting with the rest of the film giving an opening insight into the lives of John and Jane straight away from the beginning of the film and how they then close the circle by showing the progress and the changes that have been made, opening with them talking and not really truely connections and then tying the knot with them at the end showing their new found connection ending the film perfectly. They added an extra aspect of originality that was funny and possibly relatable.
The quirkiness of the film gives it a little something different making it more enjoyable it's a good time blockbuster movie it's really funny and they portray a married couple so well!! I love this movie, I've seen it a million times and I still love it. I must say that I'm an Angelina Jolie fan and I am a Brad Pitt fan which may have helped me to enjoy the film further but Angelina and Brad make it work they do it so well that you can't see any other actors portraying the roles it was like it was made for them.
Watch this movie it's not perfect but nothing is, if your looking for a entertaining movie with action, comedy and fun all in one then watch Mr and Mrs Smith."

","Back when Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were getting more attention than any couple since Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton it seemed serendipitous that Mr.&Mrs. Smith arrived as a film vehicle to take advantage of all that publicity. It certainly features the sex appeal of both. With a lot of violence thrown in as well. In fact the violence is positively erotic at times.<br/><br/>Pitt and Jolie are a pair of hit people who work for different arms of the federal government and if you can believe it have no idea what the other does. They get assigned from their agencies to the same case, but one to protect, the other to destroy a target played by Adam Brody. After that they learn of each other and try to kill each other.<br/><br/>Even before Jolie was raiding tombs as Lara Croft she certainly had the fighting skills and spirit. Looking at the two of them I really got the impression they were having some great fun together. That fact really permeates your experience watching Mr.&Mrs. Smith.<br/><br/>Just beware lest you think that this is remake of the Alfred Hitchcock film Mr.&Mrs. Smith. That it's not, but these Smiths are enjoyable enough as is."

In this case that mirror was hard to avoid. The Long of the short, skipping the gossip , is that Pitt And Jolie could not hide from anyone that something real was going on. this can happen sometimes in Hollywood. In the case of this movie we the audience won.<br/><br/>The Life of John and Jane Smith is told. The story of two professional government killers who somehow end up married and unaware of each others secret pastimes (and you thought your spouse was hiding something?).After a botched mark they discover each others hobby and move to logically eliminate the threat. As it is said ""love conquers all"".<br/><br/>There is nothing overly fantastic about this film. The script is pretty straight forward with no really unbelievable scenarios in this type of setting. The Actors are lead through a series of challenges as they entertain you with the re-solidification of their wedded bliss.<br/><br/>The direction is pretty much on cruise control given the tight form of the writing , and as such the explosions and shootouts deliver you what you paid for. the editing is top notch and makes the deft film work move even faster in flow than most films. In fact flow in this movie is better than most and is almost it's greatest strength. Almost.<br/><br/>The Real Strength in the film is the lead Actors. As everyone knows this is where they hooked up. the realistic energy of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's off screen affairs are strongly applied to their on screen persona's , giving the demands of said characters an enhanced effect against the viewers suspension of disbelief. The characters are genuine , organic and your left with the subtle impression that more is going on than you are seeing, and , Of course it was.<br/><br/>The chemistry of this film cannot be denied and elevates it to something above the three star action mill it was certain to be.<br/><br/>4 Stars (of 5)"

","This romantic comedy/action pic starring Hollywood A-list sex symbols Brad 'Pretty Boy' Pitt and Angelina 'nice tits, WTF lips' Jolie has something for everyone, male or female... or so the studio must've thought when concocting their calculated 'sure-fire hit'. Shame then that they forgot to include decent laughs, neglected to bother whether the script made any sense, miscalculated the level of on-screen chemistry between the film's stars, and failed to generate any excitement until long after the audience had stopped caring.<br/><br/>Coming across like James Cameron's Trues Lies crossed with Michael Douglas/Kathleen Turner's black comedy War of the Roses—only minus both of those films' style, wit and charismatic lead performances—Mr. and Mrs. Smith sees Pitt and Jolie as a bored married couple who, to their surprise, discover that each other is a hired assassin working for a rival agency. This conflict of interest initially pits the pair against each other, but with so much in common, the couple eventually rekindle their love and form a formidable alliance.<br/><br/>Clearly, with such a set-up, the audience is intended to connect emotionally with the film's cold-hearted killers and find humour in their predicament, but Mr. & Mrs. Smith fails to pull off such a trick, the script lacking the sophistication and requisite dark humour that the subject matter demands."

","Pitt and Jolie star as an old married couple(and they really come across as one, and it's one of the better sources of humor(when it isn't kind of flat, as it is for the first bit) and what makes this memorable), who happen to both be assassins. They keep this from everyone else, including each other. One day, they're both hired for the same job, and they both ID their spouse. Their respective companies let them know they have 48 hours to kill off the other, before they will be dealt with by said employers. This leads to the most tense scene in the entire piece, where they are back in their dull, plain(if luxurious) suburban mansion(with nice neighbors, etc.), trying to gain or maintain control of the situation. Further developments should not be revealed here, but I will say that the middle portion of this is by far the best, the strongest. That is when the duo has been introduced, the scenario fully set up and when it just kicks loose and has fun with its clever concept(which works as an allegory, if it is somewhat disturbing to see how far these two go to kill each other, given that they are to be representative of a relationship that has lost its spontaneity) This is a pretty straightforward Hollywood popcorn flick, and other than first-mentioned aspect, it does little to distinguish itself(with the anticipated result of such). The action is phenomenal, with well-choreographed, energetic sequences such as shootouts(with various handguns, SMG's, shotguns, etc.; in fact, they get use out of many types of weaponry, also including knives, explosives, and rocket launchers), car chases and martial arts fights. This is remarkably well-paced(granted, this does take its time getting to the open and all-out battle between the two, however it is worth the wait and it isn't wasting time, rather building towards it), and never boring(even when we're seeing people who find stuff around them uninteresting). The plot does not hold up to scrutiny, what little there is of one, and the main conflict of it ends up unresolved, with this film limiting itself to focus on the lead pair. That is also evident in the additional characters barely being there(you could say the rest of the cast are cameos and extras), with Vince Vaughn being the only exception to that(and he plays himself so if you like him, you'll like his role). For this being a big spy thriller kind of thing, it doesn't have many exotic locations(I guess really just one, the nicely done bit where they meet, early on). They do throw in a lot of hi-tech gadgets and such. This has some cool surprises, and you don't see where it's going. The music is very fitting with the tone, with several love songs of different kinds. There is a lot of violence, though it is bloodless and not terribly brutal(if effective, it looks like it hurts), and a little direct sexuality(no nudity) and mild to moderate language. The DVD comes with two commentary tracks(one by writer Simon Kinberg and director Doug Liman, the other with producers Akiva Goldsman & Lucas Foster. Both are amusing and informational, they get into some technical stuff and discuss the elements of the movie), 3 deleted(more like extended they're OK) scenes(coming to 8 and a half minutes), a Making a Scene featurette(with a running time of 8 minutes, it's decent) and trailers for Fantastic Four, Guess Who, Fever Pitch, In Her Shoes, Into The Blue, one for this and a teaser for it. I recommend this to fans of the actors and other people responsible for creating it. 8/10"

","Many married couples have secrets, but one pair of lovebirds discover they've both been living dangerous secret lives in this action thriller laced with comedy entitled,Mr. & Mrs. Smith.This was directed by Doug Liman and written by Simon Kinberg. The original music score was composed by John Powell. <br/><br/>Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt and play Jane Smith and John Smith, a suburban couple whose marriage has started to go a bit stale after five or six years. Both wish for more excitement in their relationship, but as it happens, each of them is finding plenty of thrills elsewhere. Both Jane and John are world-class assassins who will take on perilous missions for the right price, but neither is aware of the other's secret life - Jane thinks her husband runs a successful construction company, and John believes his wife works on Wall Street. However, when John and Jane are both assigned to take out the same target, one Benjamin Danz, they become aware of each other's secret lives, and suddenly both their careers and their marriage go through some dramatic and potentially deadly changes.The newly-rekindled Smith partnership is quickly threatened by their employers, who have now decided to eliminate the couple. John's best friend and coworker, Eddie, turns down a bounty of $500,000 for each Smith, but John and Jane find themselves under fire from an army of assassins. Fending off an attack which blows up their house, the Smiths steal their neighbor's minivan and successfully destroy three pursuing armored vans of attackers, all while bickering over their fighting styles and newly-discovered personal secrets. After meeting with Eddie, the Smiths decide to fight together to preserve their marriage. They kidnap Danz from his high-security prison in order to give their employers something they want more than the Smiths. Danz reveals that he was merely bait, hired jointly by their employers after it was discovered that the Smiths were married, in the hopes of having one Smith kill the other.John and Jane forgo their separate contingency plans and make their stand together.<br/><br/>The pretty on screen union of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie is the only thing Mr. & Mrs. Smith offers an audience beyond a relentlessly repetitive series of gunfights and car chases wherein so many bullets are fired that you feel like you're witnessing an average film.The chemistry generated by on screen movie stars are palpable enough to make this a thoroughly enjoyable and satisfying despite of weak writing and one too many explosions and action scenes.Also,this was one controversial film as Pitt and Jolie started to develop their off-screen romance."
"eucok","8","1","3","3 May 2009"," Good film but too much random shoot out & blow up
","I enjoyed the movie. For me it's best seen as a romantic comedy about marriage which has a ""spy world"" setting, but you can't take the action itself too seriously. I am not sure but I think this must have been the producer and director's intention too because they never explore the action story fully, e.g. the respective spy agencies are left nameless, their respective allegiances unclear.<br/><br/>Regarding the actors, I thought both of them did superb acting as usual. In particular, Brad's poker scene is one of the funniest I have ever seen. The only problem in the movie (for me) is that it had a little too much shoot out and blow up. I would rather have seen more of Brad and Angelina, e.g. a couple of scenes showing awkward interactions with neighbours, etc."

Away from each other, they are assassins of rival groups. Their next mission is to eliminate each other and that will cause havoc.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good. I enjoy watching Brad Pitt act. Angelina Jolie was even better to watch. They had pretty good chemistry. Vince Vaughn even did a good job.<br/><br/>This movie is also filled with comedy. The Smith family had some pretty wise remarks. The special effects are good.<br/><br/>A major flaw would be the plot.

"so_original","7","1","3","18 May 2008"," The Chemistry Carries the Movie.
","Before it was even released, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" received endless publicity. Not particularly because of the film itself. But because of the drama behind the scenes. You know the story : super-sexy Brad Pitt is married to Jennifer Aniston, goes on the set of this film with super-sexy Angelina Jolie, something may or may not have happened between them, Pitt and Aniston get divorced after the film wraps, and suddenly Pitt and Jolie are a couple! Did Brad and Angelina have a steamy affair on-set that caused the eventual divorce of Brad and Jennifer? During those months of press, this question was continually denied. But, what we can tell is there is plenty of chemistry between the two leads, which makes this movie sizzle.<br/><br/>The plot of ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" revolves around John(Brad Pitt) and Jane(Angelina Jolie) Smith, a couple that has been unhappily married for 5 (or 6) years. They can't seem to relate to each other like they did before they were married. But little does the other spouse know that both John and Jane are secret assassins, that are working for rival organizations. And when the truth comes out, it has hilarious, action-packed and unexpected effects.<br/><br/>The story is pretty creative, yes. It puts a new twist on the standard ""marriage issues"" plot. However, halfway through the movie it wears thin and the ""make a joke in an action situation"" punchlines sometimes get old. But, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie milk the script for all its worth. Both of them are somewhat underrated when it comes to their acting, and more known for their sex appeal than their actual talent. They both have a great sense of the tongue-in-cheek aspect of the film (that blends action, comedy, and romance) and have a great comic rapport with each other. Their chemistry together is all at once passionate, funny, and believable. You actually can picture them as a couple. Nicole Kidman was rumored to have been considered for Jolie's role, but I honestly couldn't imagine two better actors as the leads. It wouldn't have worked as well, and the story would have dragged instead of entertained.<br/><br/>In retrospect, its no surprise that Pitt and Jolie became a couple after this film. The fireworks between them is the reason that this movie delivers."

","Everybody knows right now that this film was the reason why Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie became a couple in the first place.

That's just part of their day job where at night they're secret agent spies killing people left and right until they get briefings from their separate bosses that they have to kill each other. John and Jane don't know it until they meet face to face where once they don't kill each other, all havoc breaks loose where everybody wants to kill them.<br/><br/>While the relationship is one thing between Pitt and Jolie, the action is a surprise marvel where from bullets to explosions, I was wowed with my eyes almost wanting to pop out of my sockets. I was already used to the fact that Angelina Jolie has been in action flicks thanks to the Tomb Raider movies where Brad Pitt has been in crime drama epics and yet, it's both seductive and entertaining."

"elshikh4","5","1","3","30 December 2007"," A Remake of a TV Show, A Prequel of a Video Game; It's Nearly The Typical Hollywood Movie Of The 2000s !
","""I love it very much!""<br/><br/>I'm talking about the main idea, which is so inspiring, like (The War of the Roses) meets (True Lies). And not only as a new action comedy, but also as a developed version of the screwball or the misunderstanding comedies of the 1960s, with unique main motif to say about how lying on the one you love can kill the relationship, or how when you're not truthful then you're a killer for yourself and your love too. That's clever, especially when you have the capacity to express it brightly, and expensively, through big and loud American blockbuster, HOWEVER, not all the dreams can be fulfilled!<br/><br/>""What's wrong?!""<br/><br/>Truly it's ""what are wrong?!"" because it's a long list: there is absolutely no solid logic that can connect all of that together. Not to mention, making it as pure action which destroyed the beauty of the idea to turn it into another idiot video clip. Although (Brad Pitt) and (Angelina Jolie) are bankable movie stars with a controversial love story (out of the movie yet good for it!), but both of them in here are so inanimate. They seemed sometimes like 2 characters in one video game, with dead performance and rarely memorable moments. There is no evidence of wicked moment, or creative touch. They were unfunny in a very funny mood, events and situations. And surely the stupidest third act ever, where we have the pleasure of watching such a silly, tepid, boring, long gun shooting, without seeing the tough enemies like one of those games, but without even the heat, the thrill, or the dexterity of it. To tell you the strange truth, at the last 20 minutes, I fell asleep right in the theater, despite how sharp and high the sound effects were! And now I read about how the production company cut some of the original climax where the couple get revenge perfectly on their bosses; which means that what we were watching was a sloppy cartoon without even a fair ending!<br/><br/>""The bitterness of the sweetness!""<br/><br/>We all love the commercial movies, there isn't anyone who hates some entertaining time in their life, to feel loose, to live the dream; even if it's naive or foolish dream. But in the American cinema now, we have those too many, too costly, and too dumb remakes, with a die hard desire to be profitable by using: hasty unoriginal idea, low degree scripts, hurly-burly CGI, dead performances, the mechanical atmosphere of the video games, the hugest explosions all the time, and the usual triteness as assured scarcely good sequels & prequels & spin offs & video games, etc. (Mr. & Mrs. Smith) is a clear example of that condition, being semi-ideal for that kind of movies in the 2000s, with all of their bad ingredients, added to amputated ending which competently makes the whole movie deficient just like our feeling about it. So what was that anyway?! Well, it's another amusing merchandise from the dream factor, but wasn't that clever as its likes, or as its latent abilities.<br/><br/>""And as a wise man said once..""<br/><br/>Wait for better sequel!"

","There is an original film directed by Sir Alfred Hitchcock, and I assume this is a remake (except not a full screwball comedy), from director Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity). Basically John Smith (Brad Pitt) and Jane (Angelina Jolie) meet each other in a paradise place, and were almost immediately attracted to each other, and not long after married! A few years later they are a bit of a boring couple, but both have secrets from each other, they are both specially trained secret agents. When they are both given the same target, this is how they find out they are working for opposite sides, and at first both know they have to kill each other. But when this fails and their love reforms, they stick together to find out why they both had the same target, and are now being chased by people who mean to kill them. They find out from the target, Benjamin Danz (Adam Brody) that he was set up to get them both to kill each other, because their organisations found out that they were married. In the end, the ""happily married couple"" kill all the enemies, and years on are still happy. Also starring Vince Vaughn as Eddie, The Last King of Scotland's Kerry Washington as Jasmine, Keith David as Father, Chris Weitz as Martin Coleman, Rachael Huntley as Suzy Coleman and Michelle Monaghan as Gwen. The action can be gripping, Pitt and Jolie are quite convincing when both trying to kill each other and then loving (and obviously they are a couple now, poor Jennifer Aniston though who suffered Pitt's affair), I suppose it is a clever story, but not brilliant. Worth watching!"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","6","1","3","1 November 2007"," Entertaining, but a little too much
","I tried to stay away from Mr. & Mrs. Smith, from all the Brad and Angelina hype, I just wanted to get far away from all the news and their faces. Now, it's been almost 3 years since then, but we've still got that silly story going on, sad, I know. But I guess I was a little interested in seeing what Mr. & Mrs. Smith was about. My boyfriend had it on DVD and told me to give it a look, that it was actually pretty good. So I watched it yesterday and I have to say that it was a pretty good film, it had solid action with a great and original story, but the action at times was a little too much and then reminded me of True Lies. Angelina and Brad did have great chemistry, but the fight scenes between them could have just been a little bit more tamed down and more believable. Now I love action films, I love how unrealistic they could be, but Mr. & Mrs. Smith just could have been more of a realistic type of film like James Bond where at times is a little silly, but for the most part is something you can say that looks real.<br/><br/>Jane and John Smith met on a romantic trip in Columbia and immediately hit it off, they get married, but quickly everything isn't clicking as well. One of the reasons that might be is because they constantly lie to each other. They are both secret agents and neither one of them are aware of the other's secret double life. But when they are hired for the same mission, they spot each other and fail the mission. Now their agencies are demanding that they kill each other, but they may find a hard time doing that when they just reignited the flame in their relationship.<br/><br/>Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a good action movie, the acting was typical, it was average, but it worked for the film. Brad and Angelina had hot chemistry as we've had rubbed in our faces for the last couple years, but onto the film. The fight scenes were cool, but my favorite was when they came home to dinner and both of them know but don't know that they know about each other and they think that they are out to get each other. It was a funny scene and Brad really made the comedy fit in very well. I would recommend Mr. & Mrs. Smith for a watch, it's worth a look, it's just over the top, I warn you.<br/><br/>6/10"

It's as if they've taken ideas from Mad Max, The Bourne Identity, Scarface and Tomb Raider and tried to scramble it all together. If I gave you several spoilers for this film I'd be doing you a favour because you then wouldn't have to bear the pain of watching it. I cringed and felt embarrassed for all concerned with the film as it drearily unfolded. There were lots of unrealistic ""ugh"" noises as various characters got punched, shot or killed. How I wished that Angelina and Brad could be tortured and killed so that we could get to the end of the film. I can't tell you who as it would spoil your ""enjoyment"" of the film but at one point a spouse throws a knife at its spouse and with knife stuck in leg the recipient makes goo goo faces. When the bad guy gets rammed by a car he falls to the ground unconscious but not our Brad. When he gets rammed he ends up clinging on to the roof chatting and making funny faces. Lines in a fight scene like ""are you still alive baby"" and ""come on, come to daddy"" when you hear them are dire. Then there's the awful sexy scene with the silly Latina music.

","Absurd but amusing action/comedy about a married couple who are both Rambo type executioners, employed by rival organizations, and chaos predictably ensues when they are each contracted to obliterate the other. Driven by its marquee star power (Pitt & Jolie), it's a bizarre concoction mingling elements of romantic fantasy as well as intense action film nonsense.<br/><br/>Pitt and Jolie do a fair, but not great job of adapting their real life romance to the screen. They trade trash talk and pillow talk barbs pretty well, but the characters they play never replace the actors on the screen (although this appears to be intentional). Other than their bantering, neither actor really is given much of a chance to show their acting chops, and are just thrown in front of a setting of special effects explosions as stars usually are in action flicks. There are wild chases and shoot-outs with faceless masked Ninja-costumed attackers, and lots of stuff gets blown to bits. There's an inevitable battle of the sexes fist-fight between the lovers, and implausible but humorous farce throughout. The mall elevator muzak sight gag is one of the better moments.<br/><br/>This film will certainly become a curiosity if the ""Smith"" actors go their separate ways, but is only mediocre on its own."

Each is then assigned to kill the other; when they find out that they are both supposed to be eliminated, they decide two are better than one.<br/><br/>The film combines elements of ""War of the Roses,"" ""F/X,"" and ""True Lies."" It's interesting to see the comments so divided here. That possibly has to do with two elements: the more positive comments are from people who saw ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" as a rental or on television and the more negative are from people who saw it in the theater and paid $10; and/or: the more positive comments are from people who just like to be entertained, and the more negative are from people who like films to make sense. This is one of those films where you can't have it both ways.<br/><br/>""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is a fun rental with two beautiful stars who have great chemistry. The beginning is a little slow, but it picks up and then the pace is very fast. But in order to enjoy it, you have to let go of things like wanting the film to make sense. It can't - first of all, the premise is ridiculous. Secondly, in order to keep the stars alive throughout the film, the writer had to make the way the plot unfolds even more ridiculous. If you can make up your mind to just be entertained, this can be a delightful experience. There are some funny bits and some impressive action sequences. One of the funniest is when Jolie takes off in her car and Pitt tries to go after her. I found both the actors very enjoyable with great presence, and they really both light up and fire up the screen.<br/><br/>You can always find plot holes and in this case, you'll fall into the first one and never get out.

These assassins can really kill, and they can sort out each other weaknesses. Jane Smith(Angelina Jolie) tries her best to kill John Smith(Brad Pitt). And John, however, can really hold up his end of the deal when he kills. With bullets flying, and sparks blazing, this kind of marriage makes any other bad marriage looks toward simple reconciliation. To me, with a job like assassination, who wants to be married at a time like this? It's a lot of fun, and the fight scenes are great, these couple do well at almost anything. Rating 3 out of 5 stars."

","I was expecting this to be at least a half way decent film as I am a fan of both Miss Jolie and Mr Pitt. I just finished watching the film on HBO and I can honestly say ""thank goodness I did not waste my good money at the theatre"". I enjoy action films but this was utterly boring. The script, although witty at times, was very lacking in intelligence and did nothing to add to the rather outlandish antics. I thought the action sequences were quite well choreographed and once in a while imaginative but beyond that, as I said, boring. I certainly hope that Miss Jolie and Mr Pitt will put this piece of trash behind them and never look back! They are such clever actors and regardless of their personal lives I hope future projects are much more entertaining."

"Backlash_Jack","3","1","3","15 February 2006"," More like Mr. & Mrs. Crappy Movie
","I'd like to make something perfectly clear. Mr. & Mrs. Smith is not a good movie. DO NOT be fooled by comments along the line of, ""it wasn't that bad."" It is that bad. In fact it's worse.<br/><br/>It's not exactly an action movie and it's not exactly a comedy. It's a slow moving, ""not funny enough to be a comedy but not action packed enough to be an action movie. Taking elements from different genres can work well, and apparently it can be a disaster of Hindenburgian proportions. There's a blimp exploding and it says ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith.""<br/><br/>The first half hour of the movie is played straight. Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are married, but unhappy. It's never explained exactly why they're unhappy, so I was left to assume that the problems stem from the fact that Angelina Jolie is undoubtedly out of her mind. There's nothing in the movie to suggest this, but I saw her make out with her brother on TV. The unhappiness they feel in their marriage makes them stop having sex, which is the first of many very unbelievable things that happen. If you're going to make a silly movie about spies that are married to each other, for the love of God don't make it serious. The plot for this movie is played completely straight, the only ""jokes"" are the zippy one-liners they say to each other as they try to kill each other with machine guns. <br/><br/>After the first half hour we find out that both Brad and Angelina are both highly trained, and apparently highly paid assassins. This information comes a half hour too late for those of us that saw the trailer for the movie, or the poster for the movie, or had any idea what the movie was about. Perhaps there were some deaf blind people in the theater that were taken by surprise, but everyone that wasn't named Hellen Keller was forced to sit through a half hour knowing exactly what was going to happen. Not long after the audience is shown that they are assassins they find out for themselves and try to kill each other for about an hour. Then they team up for the last half hour. At the end of the film, well not to give anything away, but there is no ending the movie just kind of stops. There's no twist in the last five minutes there's no resolution, it just stops. I mention this only to let you know that there is no reason to see this movie after having watched the trailer.<br/><br/>It's not necessarily the director's fault that the entire plot of the film was given away in the trailer, but even if it wasn't, the movie wouldn't have been much better. The plot of the film still would have lumbered along like an opium addled dinosaur drinking molasses, and the movie still would have been PG-13.<br/><br/>A few f-bombs, nudity, violence or any combination of the three would have made this film infinitely more enjoyable. Unfortunately in a PG-13 film none of this was possible. I mourn the death of the rated R action movie, but even if Mr. & Mrs. Smith couldn't be Die Hard it could have at least been as entertaining as Tomb Raider: Cradle of Life. As it stands there is not one redeeming quality to this piece of crap film. Seriously, don't waste your time."
"lngjon","6","1","3","29 January 2006"," Rather Disappointing
","For all the hullabaloo, this picture really didn't deliver. Pitt and Jolie, both excellent actors, played generally unlikable characters. Where there was noticeable physical chemistry between the two leads, the rest of the movie seemed forced. There was no real build up to any sort of romance between them that might have explained why they got married in the first place, you see them meet, have a single date, then get married, then their transition from wedded partners to vicious adversaries was instantaneous and with no gravity. <br/><br/>All in all, it was a sort of enjoyable big bang shoot em up popcorn movie with no plot. OK but not great."

","Mr. & Mrs. Smith was not entertaining to me, so I am thankful that I checked it out from the library.<br/><br/>It appears to be a metaphor for divorce rapped up in feminism. It's difficult to view Mr. Smith as cool when his wife is beating him, however, if Mr. Smith landed in family court, the results would be the same. <br/><br/>I like action movies in general but many seem to be less cool technology-wise like cool cars, clever tools, and witty retorts.

","Positives first. There are a couple of moments that were quite funny and cool, but that was it for me. Now the negatives ....<br/><br/>Ignoring the obvious - i.e. the plot is ludicrous, this film felt like a waste of my time. Brad and Angelina seemed emotionless and rather unbelievable throughout the film. I found the first 40 minutes, or so, to be very boring and it failed to instill any empathy (in me) for either character. Consequently I found myself not caring if they lived or died as the plot 'developed'. In fact none of the characters mattered. The action scenes had me looking at my watch. They went on too long, without enough changes in tempo or content.<br/><br/>I like action films, but in my opinion this is one to avoid."

","I am willing to suspend disbelief for many stories just to enjoy them as sheer entertainment, but this movie fails miserably on delivering anything resembling an enjoyable film experience other than watching the leads interact and wondering in what stage their affair was when the scene was shot. There are actually two movies here, both incomplete and lacking creative twists, and the action-movie is completely unbelievable to boot. The studio execs must have been jumping for joy when the Brangelina romance hit the tabloids because this movie may have otherwise passed into oblivion without much ado. Brad has already had a few duds and needed a career boost to retain his bankable reputation. I am astounded by professional critics who gave this film 3-stars-out-of-4!! The plot has so many holes I could write a thesis on the many ways the story insults its audience with its stupidity. I'm also tired of seeing a hero survive a battle with nary a wound against a battalion of shooters armed with unlimited weapons and bullet-proof armor while the hero merely stands in the open in shirtsleeves and a Kevlar vest, swinging his arms around returning fire. How did 30 or 40 trained assassins miss - at the least - blowing out Brad's kneecaps? Another annoyance was the mumbled dialog in many scenes, but since there wasn't much of a plot, this ultimately did not matter. ""True Lies"" did a far superior job in this genre.<br/><br/>Maybe some talented writer will take the first half of this movie and develop it into the story it could have been. The second half has already been done, re-done, and overdone, except this one has no ending. My 2 stars are for the production values and the score."

Brad is cute, but this movie is far from it. I would not recommend it and unless it comes on TV, which it will, don't spend a penny. I could hardly wait for the movie to end. Disappointing and dull.

","An Assassins' Marriage I highly recommend watching the movie Mr. & Mrs. Smith because people from various age groups would enjoy different aspects of the film and because there are a lot of suspenseful parts that everyone would find entertaining. Furthermore, the overall theme of the movie is one that many people would find interesting.<br/><br/>My experience with this film has always been enjoyable. I have seen this film on various occasions, my first being when it appeared at a local theater in town. I also bought the film later when it first came out onto DVD.<br/><br/>Ages from teenagers to adults would enjoy this film. Teenagers mainly because it is a suspenseful story mixed with drama and comedy. It is well done for young adults also because the strong emotion shown in the scenes is appropriate for their age as it makes the mind think. Lastly, for the adults, there are a lot of marriage concepts and difficulties that occur that all mature adults can relate with.<br/><br/>Suspense is a necessary extreme for many movies. It allows people to become involved in the film and it definitely makes those confusing moments seem okay for you not to have total understanding. Many people aren't faced with suspenseful situations like this on a daily basis, so when they are faced with them in movies, they seem to be somewhat uncomfortable to the audience. When they solve the moments in the film, people feel as if they have become ""one"" with the film. People enjoy suspense; it makes them feel as if they can't turn off the film. They get hooked and connected to it because they don't know what could happen next. Suspense is a big aspect of film that should be included on all movies in my opinion because it attracts the viewer.<br/><br/>A theme is a movie is also a requirement that draws the viewers. You can't have a movie that doesn't have a theme; it defeats the point of a film. There has to be some reason for the movie to have been made. The theme in this movie would be easy for people to relate to since many people have been in love or thought of it. Love and relationship are a very common theme in many movies.<br/><br/>The film is a high quality movie that everyone should try and watch if they are into a good theme, suspense, some thrills, classical cinema, and a great love story."

","I remembered watching Angelina Jolie on ""Inside the Actor's Studio"" and she talked about the film ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith."" She made an interesting and really poignant view on what the film is really about: an analogy on marriage. ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" tells the story of John and Jane Smith, a seemingly normal, yuppie couple who live in the upper class suburbs. They have been married for five or six years and the first part of their romance was passionate and interesting, but as the years went on their marriage became routinely boring. They go to marriage counseling, but the void between them only grows more and more. But there is one little detail that neither one knows about each other (or at least not yet): they are both highly trained professional assassins. When they both discover that little detail they proceed to try to kill each other. Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt co-star as John and Jane Smith. Both actors are incredibly great to look at, but they are incredible actors. They both have excellent and smooth comedic timing as they sometimes poke fun of themselves. They are both genuinely great together as on-screen lovers and I personally would like to see them in a sequel. Vince Vaughn who plays Pitt's friend and partner is funny and it is very obvious why Doug Lyman continues to work with him. Speaking of Doug Lyman, he is unquestionably a director who makes comedies funny in a dry way and action movies cool and slick. Smart, funny, sexy, and great action sequences that make it great for men, women, and couples."

","This is the type of film where it really is about the costars - in this case, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie who are the perfect screen couple in a very long time. If it wasn't for their chemistry, there would be nothing memorable about this movie. A movie which has no story to speak of, not very memorable dialogue and has-been-done-before special effects. Regardless, the Pitt-Jolie connection is SO strong and quite hilarious that this is the type of movie you will want to see over and over again. For that reason, I give Mr. and Mrs. Smith a solid 8 out of 10 (with any other actors in these main roles, I would give the film around a 4 out of 10). Kudos to Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie for great performances!"
"BrandtSponseller","7","1","3","2 December 2005"," Could have been great with a better script
","The premise to this film is great, even if it's not completely original. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie--two of the biggest current box-office draws, and deservedly so for the most part--are a couple whose marriage is on the rocks. But they have even bigger problems. Despite living together for ""five or six"" years, their identities and professional lives, as each other believes they know them, are lies. They're really both ""secret agents""/hit persons, regularly trotting off to exotic locales to kill. When the truth is discovered, can their relationship stand the strain? We get to see both aspects of their lives, with the result being an unusual but potentially captivating mixture of well-crafted action/adventure scenes somewhere between James Bond and the Mission Impossible films and a light romantic comedy, a bit heavier on the turmoil than usual. The premise has the potential to fuel a more adult Spy Kids-like film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Mr. & Mrs. Smith suffers from a couple major flaws. This is a plot and character-driven film, but the script leaves the backstory, motivations, justifications and character development by the wayside, focusing instead on what writer Simon Kinberg must think is extremely clever dialogue. It's not--I may have only chuckled a couple times, and instead the audience is left in the dark wondering just who the protagonists are and why they would have the reaction they do when the big realization about their partner arrives.<br/><br/>We never learn just who they work for (hence the confusion about whether they're secret agents, hit persons, or something else altogether), why their employers would amount to ""enemy"" organizations, and why Mr. & Mrs. Smith would unquestioningly follow particular orders, especially when at the same time, insofar as the characters are developed, neither seems like a ""yes-man"" who would follow _anything_ that anyone says unquestioningly.<br/><br/>By the same token, we know that their marriage is on the rocks, especially because the film begins with Mr. & Mrs. Smith talking to a marriage counselor, but we never know why. Their marital problems are not further developed than the fact that Mr. Smith dislikes Mrs. Smith's cooking, Mrs. Smith thinks that Mr. Smith is somewhat slothlike and irresponsible at home, and they do not communicate as much or as well as they should. That, and/or similar states, describes plenty of married people whose relationships are not threatened.<br/><br/>Instead, the film sets its sights on dialogue that Kinberg must think is hip and witty, delivered in a fairly rapid pace. The dialogue isn't horrible, but it's certainly not hip and witty, and director Doug Liman--who has been hit and miss--he directed the fantastic remake of The Bourne Identity (2002), but also did the awful Go (1999)--encourages Pitt and Jolie to sound affected and pretentious far too often. Aside from this, Pitt and Jolie do an admirable job, and of course they're pleasant to look at, but you have to wonder why they wouldn't be more careful in choosing a script and more adamant against the occasional bad directorial advice.<br/><br/>The action scenes are competent to good technically. A lot of juice is drained from them because of the underdeveloped story--we need to understand these people and their situation better to be on the edge of our seats, and the scenes are a bit generic (even more so the score), but for a big action fan, as I am, they're entertaining enough. A car chase near the end of the film (no surprises there) and a big fight in a house are extremely well done, exciting and deliver a few of the funnier lines at the same time. But a couple scenes where Mr. & Mrs. Smith are practically invincible--for example, standing in the middle of a hail of bullets and small explosives, protected only by bullet-proof vests but receiving nary a scratch--tend to negate the great scenes.<br/><br/>You could look at the whole movie, even the action/adventure scenes, as more of a metaphor for a couple beginning the process of separation or divorce. It's not uncommon to hear of people having secret lives that a spouse is unaware of, and of course most people become quite nasty in the separation process, other people become involved, and so on. Seen this way, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is potentially cleverer, but again the script needed much more work for us to understand and care about the characters.<br/><br/>Overall, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is just so-so, as the result of a balancing act between good points and bad points. In my rating system a 7 is equivalent to a ""C"", but this one is really a low ""C"", which means it almost doesn't earn credit."

By the 30th time I was throwing Doritos at my TV. Add that to the fact that you couldn't imagine that the two stars had any relationship whatsoever, so when they figure out each other's double lives and find the surprising urge to stay married, I think any sane person is cheering against it... which kinda kills the romantic comedy thing. Again, not well written or well shot. Pitt's even borderline talent is wasted; he's given nothing to do or say.

","Hollywood is in a bad way, the studios, no matter how hard they try just can't do it anymore. How bad is this film? It's more of a question of how good isn't this film. when the director Liman (what a muppet) complains about using a 'car chase' scene due to budgetary constraints-you know something is a miss, well you do when you consider the budget was $110,000,000 for this trash excuse for entertainment. That's enough cash for about eleven credible independent movies or maybe more. Look at 'crash' it only cost $8 million and it's fantastic (it also utilizes talented actors). Anjelina Jolie can act, but those full lips deem her non convincing for 90% of any roles available. Brad Pitt, he may be attractive, but he cannot act, in fight club he simply gave the Pitt/Cruise (I'm really trying to be convincing by punctuating my words here-performance). Brad Pitt is a terrible actor, in fact my pet goldfish gives more of a performance when darting from castle to castle.<br/><br/>The director Liman is such a retard that he is unable to tell the difference between spies and assassins, the smith's are most definitely not spies (spies, secret service, special forces and the like use tactics in the search for information- they are not hired killers), these guys are clearly hired killers, working for two comic book agencies (insert moral debate about misinforming the youth of America).<br/><br/>Other than the trash that this movie is, do we really need another in bred-studio executive riddled script, no-one understands your sad games and even less people give a damn.<br/><br/>If this is a sign of what is to come and how movies are simply vehicles to fill the pockets of the weak and stupid then Hollywood can take a few steps back and run at full pelt to kiss my ass, but you won't land your lips because your obviously 'not worth it'.<br/><br/>How dare you spend King Kong money on what I find in my toilet bowl every day of the week (exept on Sunday's when I am rudely awakened by the dustman).<br/><br/>I'm off to watch Spy Kids, an entertaining fun movie with talented actors and crew, then I'm off to join the NRA as (The Duke) John Wayne has been resurrected and he's really narked off!"

It's not that the two principle roles were badly acted, but there was just very little in the screenplay for them to work with."

","Clever conceit for a spy thriller which has plenty of good stuff but is ultimately not as satisfying as it could be. Both John (Pitt) and Jane Smith (Jolie) are secret agents and have hidden their real jobs from each other; however, how they accomplish this secrecy is one of many elements that is poorly explored in the film. The rigors each would have to go to keep their real jobs secret could have generated several fun and inventive scenes.<br/><br/>When the movie begins, they are in marriage counseling. The counseling sessions with the unseen counselor are the best thing about the film, but is yet one more under-utilized motif. The disintegration of their initial passion is one of the many elements of the clever conceit that if explored could have made the film better.<br/><br/>Both unexplored story lines would have delayed the heart of the film's plot. When the Smiths find themselves given the same job by the competing agencies for whom they work, they are set to kill each other as part of their normal witness-removing procedures. However, they find it difficult to kill each other. Not just because they're good at their jobs, and they are, but because they both discover the awakening of feelings they have for each other. The attempts on each other's lives culminate in a home-destroying shoot 'em up conflagration that has the neighbors calling the police and has the two secret agents making mad, reckless, passionate love among the broken glass, shattered furniture, and assorted wreckage of their once lovely home.<br/><br/>This sex scene brings forward a theme from which the filmmakers carefully keep a distance. The violence of their lives carries over into the violence of their sex. At first, it seems that John will be dishing out a beating as foreplay to his wife and not taking it until she clocks him hard in the jaw and mounts him. Though the women-like-it-rough misogyny is thankfully avoided, the film is full of sexist choices despite its attempts to establish Jolie in a feminist design.<br/><br/>In the one job we see each perform, John (Pitt) is given a stereotypically masculine-style job. He must infiltrate a poker game pretending to be a drunk looking for the bathroom. He then makes the hit when the missing player arrives. Meanwhile, Jane (Jolie) dresses up in dominatrix gear and visits a mob boss and uses her sex to get close enough to break his neck. Though Jane shows prowess later with computers, bombs, guns, knives, cars, and more, this choice is disappointing and exploitative, though she does have a cool getaway with a bag handle that unfurls a tension wire and allows her to drop twenty stories off a balcony and into a waiting cab. <br/><br/>This sexist division of roles is evident throughout the movie. Jane has her hidden weapons cache in the kitchen whereas John's is under the garage. Also, John's work comrade and friend, Eddie (Vince Vaughn), is given some real screen time and a character, though his function in or out of John's organization is left very very unclear, especially later in the film when he receives a cell phone message to kill both Jane and John. Jane is surrounded by women in her agency, which is curious and begging for exploration in and of itself, but her associates, though named in the cast list, are given only a few lines and not characterized like Eddie.<br/><br/>But the film takes steps to make a show of not being sexist, probably unaware of the messages of these other choices. When re-arming themselves under attacks by both of their agencies, Jane asks John: ""why do I get the girl gun?"" And John trades weapons with her. This comment is also part of the bickering as the characters begin to confess the truth to each other, while on the run from both agencies who are trying to kill them. This bickering becomes one of the film's best comic elements. Thankfully, they do not make Jane into a nag and make John as much of a fuss budget as Jane.<br/><br/>But here too, they make the same sexist choices. In the job to get the target of the hit that they both botched when put on the same job, it is John who does the field work and Jane who stays behind to coordinate. Then when John is impulsive and disobeys Jane's orders, she looks like a failure. <br/><br/>In the end, though, they're both failures as the initial hit was a setup. Their respective agencies found out that they were married and put them on the same job to have them eliminate each other. When that doesn't happen, both agencies send dozens of agents, special forces, black, ninja troopers, after Jane and John.<br/><br/>And so faced with fleeing and being on the run forever, Jane and John suit up and arm themselves and make like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. But unlike the Newman-Redford epic, the two gunslingers don't jump off to certain death gun blazing. Here, they go into the fight, and we get to see them miraculously kill dozens of specially trained assassins.<br/><br/>The film ends with the now happy and successful couple telling their marriage counselor that they have solved their problems. But this final scene brings home the film's greatest weakness. Why do they discover that they love each other? The sex is steamy and wild. The players pretty and great to look at (Jolie is a hottie), but is that love? No. Ultimately, the film fails to deliver on the promise of its clever concept."
"philip_vanderveken","6","1","3","8 August 2005"," Entertaining, but isn't all that different from other movies in the genre
","All you read or hear about this movie has something to do with the possible affair between Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt and it's sometimes very hard to find some decent reviews in the magazines. That's why I didn't exactly know what to expect before going to the cinema to watch this movie. I already figured out that it wouldn't be a romantic comedy (I still find it a typical title for such a movie), but that it would be an action filled comedy. But that was all that I knew about it and I just gave it a try, hoping for the best.<br/><br/>When the movie starts, we see John and Jane Smith sitting in the office of a marriage councilor. They have been married for 6 years now and they admit that they are bored by their average married life. But what they don't know is that they both have a secret life. They are both assassins who travel the world to kill for money. But when they are both hired to kill one person, they get in each other's way without knowing it and blow the job. Now they are told to go after the person who was the cause of their failure, making them find out that it's their own spouse they are after...<br/><br/>""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is a typical Hollywood action movie. The car chases are incredibly fast and well orchestrated, the explosions are gigantic, the bullets seem to fly around your ears by the millions and they use plenty of gadgets that would make James Bond blush like a little schoolgirl. That's not exactly what I'm normally looking for in a movie, but in the end it's still enjoyable and the actors have a lot to do with that. If it wasn't for these two pretty actors, this movie would be a typical action flick that would have gone by unnoticed. Because, let's be honest, do you really believe that this movie would have drawn such a crowd if Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie hadn't played the leading roles in it? Jolie is the only reason why all men want to see it and only because Brad Pitt is playing in it, their wives or girlfriends are willing to go with them. And my own experience only proves it. To give you an example of what I consider to be a large crowd: it was very difficult to find a seat in the enormous room while they played it in three different rooms at the same time. I would say that that must be enough room for approximately 1,000 people and it was full of men and women.<br/><br/>Personally I must say that I liked this movie most for the humor. Thanks to the several witty remarks from both characters and the absurd situation of two assassins sitting in front of a marriage councilor without knowing who their partner really is, was really funny. In my opinion it saved a lot of this otherwise poor movie. I say poor, because it relies more on the marketing around the possible affair than on a decent script. I know that this is an action movie and that such movies don't exactly offer the most intelligent stories, but I've already seen a lot better action movies in the past. Take for instance ""The Rock"", that was a movie full of action too, but the story worked.<br/><br/>In the end it isn't a bad movie, but it is a typical American blockbuster that doesn't really stay very long with you once you've left the cinema. I only see this movie as some easy entertainment and than I must say that it's OK. But it's not excellent and that's why I give this movie a 6.5/10."

","OK, check your brain at the door. That is the best advice I can give on this movie. Yes it has action, humor, intrigue and is plenty of fun to watch - eye candy for all types of people, men (Miss Jolie), women (Mister Pitt) action types (plenty of fights, gun play and car chases), humor types (Vince Vaughn, although I wish he had a bigger role) and just about everyone else. Let's face it though, some of this stuff is WAY OVER THE TOP!!! The believability factor is about a 1, starting with the whole premise. A killer is married to another killer and neither one knows about it, come on!! Mr Smith (Pitt) has more arms and ammunition is his shed than some military units - and Mrs Smith (Jolie) has a complete set of arms and weapons in the stove - talk about being a killer in the kitchen!!! If you can get past that, well, the rest is up to you."

","TO THE PRODUCERS OF MR. & MRS.

One goes to the movie to see great actors and human been like Angeline Jolie and Brad Pitt and since the beginning received a slap in the face with the distorted image of the city of Bogotá. This is a way to attack a different culture. Is like said that because Italy has some 'mafia' all the Italians are 'mafiosos' or to distort the image of the beautiful city of Sicily. That is the same case with Colombia. We indeed have some problems (the same like the US.A. has) but we have also decent people and beautiful cities like Bogotá, Cartagena, Cali, and Medellin, just to name only some of them. We Colombians invite the director of the movie, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, to visit Bogotá and to do some research before doing a movie and ask him no to misinterpret one culture.

","I loved this movie! It was the perfect combination of spy/action and romantic comedy. I was not expecting it to be as funny as it was, I thought it was just a spy action movie with maybe some comic relief. This movie was hilarious! Besides being one of the coolest spy/action movies I have seen in a while, it is also one of the funniest comedies I have seen in a while. I am usually not a big fan of Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie but they were both great and hilarious in this movie. Vince Vaughn, one of my favorite actors, was great and hilarious as usual in his supporting role. The only reason I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 is it did get a little silly here and there. This movie will definitely be in my DVD collection as soon as it comes out and I highly recommend it for fans of both action movies and romantic comedies.

"noralee","6","1","3","7 July 2005"," Violent Screwball Comedy of Literally A Battle Between the Sexes
","Up to just beyond the half-way point ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" works as a modern screwball comedy, a less dark ""Prizzi's Honor."" <br/><br/>But the gloss of suburban satire turns unappealing when the violence first gets personal, then becomes like mutual S & M foreplay, if not disturbing abuse, and then goes completely over the top into military operations that make one wonder what has happened to law enforcement.<br/><br/>Staging the final battle in an Ikea-type store seems like a lame attempt to restore the satirical element of two assassins who have been living undercover as suburbanites, but it looks and feels more like a video game, though the shiny cinematography emphasizes their brittle surface environment.<br/><br/>So maybe it's not so much that their violence is an aphrodisiac as it is a wake-up call to stir latent emotions (including a ""Lethal Weapon 4""-like scars comparison) as certainly two of the most beautiful physical specimens on the planet do have sparkling chemistry together and each keeps up the battles of both wits and guts. Brad Pitt even occasionally shows some charming vulnerability and Angelina Jolie is a droll bad ass.<br/><br/>The camera simply loves them and there is just enough banter to keep up interest in them as people when they are blowing up everything around them. But the dialog misses many opportunities to go any deeper into their psyches beyond cartoon characters.<br/><br/>The contrasts in their businesses is amusing, with Pitt's casual headquarters anchored by motormouth mama's boy Vince Vaughn incongruously and vicariously planning mayhem, while Jolie manages an all-woman high tech, high gloss operation under cover as a temp agency, including Jennifer Morrison of ""House, M.D."" as yet another overly efficient assistant.<br/><br/>The music mostly supports the comic undercurrent, including a Muzak take on ""The Girl from Ipanema"" contrasting with other excellent Latino selections on the soundtrack.<br/><br/>While once your stomach has been turned by the mutually destructive violence so that it's hard to keep laughing, this is mostly about Pitt and Jolie looking gorgeous and doing impossible things -- and they pull it off entertainingly. Ah if only real violence was about these fantasies and not terrorists."

HOW CAN YOU DISRESPECT 8 MILLION PEOPLE (POTENCTIAL LOYAL COSTUMERS)? I wonder if all Americans really believe that they can present the rest of the world as the worst. The way they show Bogotá in this film is just inadequate, if you never been there you will think that is a city in fire and bombing every 10 seconds. For those that don't know Bogotá is one of the most livable cities in South America with a great lifestyle and wonderful people. Is a cultural and civilized city with couple of the best top academic institution in South American. Is just unfair to make it look revolting just for the sake of suiting the movie script. I am convinced that all Colombians need an apology. Beside of all this, if the main starts are the people they say (Angelina, caring for people around the world and working in human rights with UN) they shouldn't USE a culture to sell a Hollywood hit. I wonder what do Americans will feel if someone else will portrait NY or LA as chaotic as this (that in some way can be more possible)."

When a couple decides to make a commitment to each other and are willing to be honest and work things out they have a real chance of saving the relationship.<br/><br/>What I liked was that the initial efforts to kill were accidents and not intentional on their part. Then the hesitation. When Mr. Smith refuses to kill Mrs. Smith that is an incredibly brave moment. Not because she still holds a gun, but because he goes first in exposing his feelings and risks rejection. I also like that it it was perfect right away.

"icesyckel","5","1","3","1 July 2005"," Rental - Mediocre and Overproduced
","The basic plot was an interesting idea (obliviously married hit men) but was poorly developed in a week script and poorly executed with strained dialog. The actors do well with what they're given, and Vince Vaughan in particular seemed to shine for me, which should tell you why I think the movie is more of a rental than a trip to the theater. Vaughan, much like Will Farrell, is often funny, but his performances, on their own, are rarely enough to make me run to the theater (Swingers being the only exception coming to mind).<br/><br/>The film is saved by the chemistry between Jolie and Pitt, but it's chemistry we know comes from a real relationship. They carry it into the film, but I don't think the lines they deliver would have been believable outside that subconscious acknowledgment that they are really together. The movie, however, doesn't depend on plausibility for its kicks, which is fine. Still, after a while the glitzy and overdone special effects cease to impress and cover the lack of good writing.<br/><br/>All that said, it's a good movie to rent with your spouse, date, or significant other. Women seem to get more of a kick out of it than do men (check the demographics by vote), so it's something a guy can watch and enjoy while his date thinks he picked a real winner."
"manoj-aryan","6","1","3","30 June 2005"," Mr and Mrs Smith
","After enjoying this film I asked myself what was this movie about? What was the script? What was the plot? What was the its genre? I failed to answer any of these but I know I enjoyed this film.<br/><br/>In quick first act John(Pitt) and Jane(Jolie), two strangers totally over each other, fool around in a rain-party. And they get married on impulse. Now after 4-5 years of their marriage they are still strangers to each other! They haven't yet aware about true nature of others job. Both are 'deadly' assassins. They finish their jobs (killing people) and return home at night as if has done a '9 to 5' job. This routine is disturbed when they find each other on same assignment and came to know about true nature of their jobs. And so they come after each other. Sequences when these two try to kill one other are presented in carefree manner. As that supposed to be. ""Oh come on, it was just a little bomb"" says Jane- can give you idea what I am talking about. This is a vague idea of 'Mr and Mrs Smith'.<br/><br/>Film occasionally switches to the scenes (real, real high moments of movie) where these two are asked questions by a marriage counselor. We come to know that fire between these two is no more there now. Exact lines were: Therapist: How is your sex life? Jane: I don't understand the question John: I don't get it, is this another 1 to 10 thing? Or one where John: ..There were moments .u know..<br/><br/>It is full of hilarious sequences like the conversation about curtains Jane: If You Don't Like Then We Can Take Them Back. John: OK. I Don't Like Them. Jane: You'll Get Used To Them. And there is one car sequence these two commenting, retorting each other. scenes with Eddie(Vince Vaughan) and John are fun to watch. It's never ill or forced comedy, I must say. In one scene when these two look for hidden-weapons is sure to make you laugh. One with Angelina Jolie asked to hold the child in party, watch Jolie's expression there. <br/><br/>Dialogue here are funny and to chew over and over. My most favorites are when Brad Pitt is caught in lift and threaten to be killed by Julie : Jane Smith: Any last words? John Smith: The new curtains are hideous. and in last scenes before credits roll John says ""Ask the sex question again.(with that grin on his face)"".<br/><br/>No one dare to say against the performances. Those are fabulous. These two are the perfect cast. Sensuous Angelina Julie is now rated most beautiful woman on earth. Brad Pitt is heartthrob for years and he will continue to be. Vince Vaughan is smooth and impressive.<br/><br/>I loved Soundtracks from it. Joe Strummer's 'mongo bongo' (Jolie-Pitt rain-dance song) and Pink Martini's 'Don't stop falling in love' are just wow!! Yet there is something missing in the film.<br/><br/>All steamy scenes might have cut by our dear censor board so can't say anything about those. But they must have set screen on fire.<br/><br/>One advice before you see this movie: Don't ask too many questions. It is a slick flick. Just Go and feel the kick!<br/><br/>'Mr and Mrs Smith' is emblazoned with exploding chemistry between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and plenty of cheezee one liners. That's it."
"skymovies","7","1","3","29 June 2005"," May divorce be with you
","With a well-turned calf and a dazzling grin, this preposterous action flick goes about its business with a gleeful disregard for logic and plot exposition. But with a hit-couple as ridiculously good-looking as Brad and Angie, it's not surprising that the camera sticks to them like glue, only tearing itself away long enough to focus on their destructive handiwork.<br/><br/>The movie suffers from a beauty overload; too many long, lingering close-ups and scenes of navel-gazing slow it down. This is an action movie that loses its momentum too often, strategically timing each explosive set-piece to get things moving again.<br/><br/>Despite the stop-startness of it all, there is much for action junkies to feast upon. The 'domestic disturbance' chez Smith is a stand-out, and both the desert hit and car chase deliver the requisite thrills in an 'is this a John Woo movie?' kinda way.<br/><br/>But as the climactic, video game-like gunfight wore on, I thought that it would have been more interesting to have the Smiths squaring up to another couple of hitpersons, rather than legions of faceless goons who couldn't shoot fish in a barrel. But I suppose expecting originality from an action movie is preposterous too."

Not that the plot was hard to follow...a nice, simple plot with some lovely twists...but it would have been nice to hear some of the punch lines...most of which I missed.

I felt this movie was merely a chance to parade Pitt/Jolie around on the screen and have them shoot guns and blow stuff up. The plot/script really didn't matter. If Hollywood was to pump out a sequel to a crappy movie like Gigli 2 or You Got Served Again, and cast Brad or Angelina, people would still go see it and say it was good just because they get so caught up in the actor's/actresses's physical attributes. That is just the star power of these two performers, dialogue and plot doesn't matter with them.<br/><br/>Once the movie gets going it is non-stop action. The effects are cool at first but then to me seemed like a record skipping. Just a never ending series of gunshots, explosions, wrecked buildings and ruining expensive cars. Really no groundbreaking action or special effects that you can't find in other crappy movies such as Bad Boys 2.<br/><br/>Angelina looks gorgeous as ever, but once again, I've seen it before in other movies, and shoved in my face every day on the covers of magazines and on television. In fact if you want to see Angelina look real good I recommend one of her films where she actually shows some skin, like Gia or Taking Lives, rather than Mr and Mrs Smith. I'm sure women who watch this film would say the same about the former Mr. Jennifer Aniston.<br/><br/>Doug Liman directs but this film doesn't even come close to what he helped create with Swingers(one of my favorite films). I have always expected more out of Doug since that film. I am starting to give up hope.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn and Adam Brody co-star and do typical Vaughn and Brody things. Nothing groundbreaking. About a dozen attractive females co-star as well, which was nice.<br/><br/>The cinematography is decent, characters are underdeveloped, a lot of money got spent on special effects, blah, blah, blah.

But all the shooting and explosions - leavened with much humour - make this appealing entertainment when all one wants is some mindless action and fun (it was my birthday). I guess what makes the movie is the coupling - apparently in more senses than one - of the gorgeous Angelina Jolie (in effect reprising her ""Lara Croft"" role) with good-looking Brad Pitt (although his haircut is somewhat severe).

","It sure seemed like five hours, I was checking my watch every five minutes; about the same as for ""King Arthur"" and ""Electra"", but a little less than ""Catwoman"". It tries to blend the domestic-secret agent concept from ""True Lies"" but has none of the charm of that movie. It rips off ""The Big Hit"" for most of its action sequences and for what passes as comedy. But the big hit looks much better, only cost $13 Million, and gives viewers two much sexier actresses, China Chow and Christina Applegate (and a better looking hero-Mark Wahlberg). <br/><br/>I truly cannot imagine anyone with even an average level of intelligence or sophistication enjoying this thing. It is just one pointless bit of excess after another. Don't worry about the plot because the writer, director, and editor apparently did not bother to include one. And it's not really an action picture even though there is one mind-numbing CG enhanced action sequence after another.<br/><br/>What saves this from a complete suck-fest is that Pitt and Jolie seem to be having fun together on the screen. But now I understand Jolie's latest comments about giving up her acting career, there can't be much professional satisfaction making crap like this so unless you need the money why bother. I will miss being amused thinking about how much her face resembles what Jessica Alba would see if she looked at herself in a warped fun house mirror.<br/><br/>The 100 million dollar cost of this movie was only 35 million less than Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"". While very little of this budget found its way onto the screen, the movie is having no trouble generating enough box office to cover the cost. So my finding it incomprehensible that anyone would find it entertaining is pretty much irrelevant. ECON 101 tells us that people would not shell out money to see this if they did not derive considerable utility from the viewing (maybe even multiple viewings). <br/><br/>As long as some of this type of stuff makes money, Hollywood will churn it out. And as American citizens this is really more about embarrassment than anything else since we are not being forced to watch it. Whether you blame our education process, our gene pool, or just our culture; the fact is that pretty much the whole rest of the world feels a collective superiority every time we crank out something this moronic and devour it like a bunch of rubes who just saw their first moving picture.<br/><br/>So you can understand the laments that Hollywood big movies are killing intelligent cinema. But if it is any consolation I just caught the ending of the original 1976 version of ""Freaky Friday"", which featured car chase and water ski sequences almost as moronic the action sequences in ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"". This in spite of a cast that included Jodie Foster, John Astin, and Barbara Harris (fresh off her fantastic performance in ""Nashville""). In the almost 30 years since, the industry has managed to crank out an impressive number of so-called blockbusters that were actually pretty good, and the independent film movement has hung in there and produced some truly fantastic films. So maybe things are not as bleak as they seem while suffering through ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"".<br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."

","I was really shocked by how poorly it all came together in Mr. and Mrs. Smith. While the sexy fête-a-fête scenes may have worked well on the storyboard, they didn't jive with the violence...maybe I'm not as desensitized as most, but it seemed as if they hoped to trivialize the violence as they built the tension (both sexual and otherwise) between Jolie and Pitt. Entirely over-the-top and drawn out...I was yawning 90 minutes in and that's where Mr. and Mrs. Smith-in a failed attempt at blending action, comedy and drama-should have ended. I haven't seen Girl Interrupted and I hate to base Jolie's work on Tombraider and this piece of horse puckey, but she didn't do much for me on the acting side. Her physical presence is stunning enough that it would have sufficed to carry her through the film had it been shorter and tied things up more quickly. Props to V. Vaughan though for his standard Swingers shtick."

I hope my comment is useful to you, also it is my first so i am really sorry if it is not good enough."

","I thought this was almost as good as Bad Boys II, which came out two years ago. Great two hours of escapism. Ignore the critics for this one. Plus, with Angelina and Brad in this movie its a great date movie as both persons have someone pretty to look at! :-) One thing i noticed in the film was when Angelina and Brad dance, Brad looked taller, was he on a box? Also, when their vital statistics are brought up he's listed at 6'1 and Angelina is 5'7. For FANS of either one of them, one knows that Brad is 5'7 and Angelina is closer to 5'8 - 5'9 range (i believe). The driving sequence and the house being destroyed sequence were pretty crazy. Lots of shooting, so if you aren't in to MAJOR action flicks, u may want to pass this one up as the 'story' links the action scenes. Anyone know the make of the sunglasses Brad and Angelina wore at the end of the film? they had yellow lenses."

It dragged a little throughout the beginning, but began to interest me when they figured out each other's identities. <br/><br/>It had it's okay comedic performances, however I felt it wasn't delivering it's best. Jolie and Pitt were great together and seemed like a ""Normal"" couple. I also would have liked to see Pitt do better, I wasn't very impressed with his performance for the role of John. Vince Vahn's character was hilarious, but they did not explain him well enough to understand the meaning of him and why he was in the film. The story was great though and I loved how well it was plotted, but as I mentioned earlier how it dragged i little,and that bored me. The ending was perfect.

"lbockskopf","3","1","3","15 June 2005"," It was not entirely what I expected and not as funny as I thought it would be.
","I went to see this movie because I often enjoy the subtlety of Brad Pitt's comedic talent; and I had heard so much hype about the on-screen chemistry between Pitt and his co-star, Angelina Jolie, that I figured the film's humorous moments would be outstanding. Well, they weren't. They were only so-so.<br/><br/>Another reason I was disappointed with this movie was because the rating of PG-13 led me to expect one thing but then delivered another.<br/><br/>With a PG-13 rating, I expected that there would be no nudity. Also, knowing that the two main characters of this action film were world-class assassins clearly clued me into the fact that there would be violence. I was right. There was no nudity and there was violence. So I did get what I expected there (and I did find the explosions, chase scenes, etc. to be spectacular and entertaining).<br/><br/>However, what I didn't expect and what I found to be very disturbing was the implication that an intensely violent prelude to sex was entertaining to watch. I found myself wincing at the sight of Jolie forcefully punching Pitt in the face and then both of them giggling at the turn-on factor of this act, which was followed by a passionate kiss. I would MUCH rather have seen nudity than a link between intense violence and sex.<br/><br/>When I think of PG-13 rated movies, I do not think of a link between violence and sex. In my opinion, that is an adult subject and, thus, would indicate an R rating because I don't think violent sex is something to which teenagers should be exposed. (Personally, I would prefer to expose them to nudity.) Had this movie been rated R, I might have expected something a little different. Perhaps then I might have given it a slightly higher value on the 1-to-10 scale, but probably not much higher because the humor just wasn't there for me. (Although, I must admit that Vince Vaughn's neurotic character was hilarious. They should have put him in more scenes.)<br/><br/>So, to summarize my opinions, the movie was not entirely what I expected, and the humorous moments were not as strong as they could have been."

Annoyingly, the good lines all come from Brad. He gets to have fun, while Angelina Jolie acts dour and tough. They should have given her character ,and in fact the whole script, a bit of substance and humanity.<br/><br/>Apart from these few moments, the film consists of a lot, an awful lot, of violence.

","If nothing else, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" put a big smile on my face. When analyzed, it might seem to be its own enemy. The script and musical choices prevent the action from being truly tense or awesome. Writer Simon Kinberg piles the scintillating quotes and revelations on top of the action, which undermines its ability to enthrall. The music is totally inappropriate for a normal action movie. None of that is a problem, because ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" does not have the same goals as they do. It is exactly what the title says it is, and that is not ""Ultimate Deception,"" or ""Married Assassins."" <br/><br/>The movie begins innocently in a marriage counseling session. The therapist (William Fichtner) makes basic inquiries such as marital satisfaction and sexual frequency. His clients do understand the questions, reminding me of Spock's puzzlement towards ""How do you feel?"" at the beginning of ""Star Trek IV."" <br/><br/>They are, of course, John and Jane Smith (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, or Bradgelina). The two do not communicate well. John always appears preoccupied and Jane apparently lacks the language to express her feelings. Despite their positive responses to the marital satisfaction query, they act nonchalantly towards each other. Since both are professional killers and neither knows it, they are unable to open up to each other as they live their numerous lies. ""There's this huge space between us, and it just keeps filling up with everything that we don't say to each other,"" laments Jane as answers escape her.<br/><br/>""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" does not skimp on the setup, nor does the violence quickly follow their revelations of each others' real careers. The amusement continues as the movie plays coy with how they intend to resolve the dilemma. Possibly the best laugh comes when John arrives home for dinner and sees a most unusual item on the kitchen counter. The swanky dinner is a close second. None of the humor is presented in the Monty Python/Mel Brooks ""I put it right in front of your face, now laugh"" manner. It is merely there, hiding in plain sight waiting to be eaten layer by layer as one would a gourmet cake.<br/><br/>John Powell's score frequently employs accordions and violins harmonizing in happy movements. The absence of music can push the tension higher. The classic Bond vs. Grant fight in ""From Russia with Love,"" and Bond vs. Janus brawl amid the finale of ""GoldenEye"" come immediately to mind. Most high-impact tussles are scored with loud, quick and intricate music employing prominent guitars, violins or horns, which is what most expect as Brad Pitt leaps through a threshold and into action. The contradictory elements assure the more fun, light-hearted feeling to the movie's marquee scene.<br/><br/>Try as they may, John and Jane cannot deny their feelings for each other. The entire movie works around that concept. The true climax is not the final action scene. Angelina Jolie continues to amaze me. She creates more genuine tears than most actresses can, and repeatedly does so in goofball scripts. Her talents extend far beyond a pretty face and popular body. The action icon won an Oscar and played the lead in ""A Mighty Heart."" Pitt plays the relaxed but serious character he does so wonderfully, but sometimes speaks too softly. Director Doug Liman repeatedly fails to amplify his voice. Both Pitt and Jolie use their strengths to embody their characters' massive internal conflict.<br/><br/>The rest of the acting is passable, except for Vince Vaughn, who works well with the resident oddball. His character, Eddie, lives with his mother and gives a pretty convincing argument as to why. Vince shows his comedic gift, but he is not as sharp as usual. Keith David's near-absence is disappointing.<br/><br/>I had no idea what to think when the credits rolled at the conclusion of my first viewing. Upon further review, I appreciate the white picket fence approach employed. Pitt and Jolie were not just big name castings, but inspired choices who drew upon their budding love for each other to build a solid cornerstone for the rest of the picture. It is never difficult to root for them. I tend to prefer action movies with more vicious feels; nevertheless, I am happy I saw ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" and will continue to enjoy more viewings in the future."

","Not quite, but it does share the same spirit  big guns, fast cars, cool gadgets, pretty people, and good fun. And ever so slightly bonkers.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are the eponymous couple, and are the typical American suburbanites  live in a nice home, nice cars etc but seemingly their lives are in a rut. However they both have a secret from each other  they are both assassins, and working for rival companies. The rest of the plot writes itself so I won't regurgitate it here, but everything you can predict happen does.<br/><br/>But that is not to say that the film's predictability makes it boring. Quite the reverse, and while the plot twists are hardly on the level of Bryan Singer, Doug Liman never intends to make that kind of film. What he has put together is an incredibly slick and shiny film with all the veneer we have come to expect from the man behind the Bourne Franchise. Furthermore, the film was written with one thing in mind - entertainment, and it certainly delivers that. In the spirit of True Lies, the action in the film flows thick and fast but never seems to take itself too seriously, and it is obvious that the actors are enjoying their work, throwing everything into the action. The action is never anything more than barely believable, but to criticise this point is to miss the point entirely.<br/><br/>So what of the performance of Hollywood's latest 'First Couple'? Pitt and Jolie give slick performances and do well in the action scenes, but neither of them seem 100% comfortable with the tongue-in-cheek banter aspects of the film. Indeed, Pitt seems far more naturally relaxed interacting with co-worker Vince Vaughn rather than his (on and off-screen) wife. Given that this is the film where they reputedly began their love affair, this seems somewhat surprising  but then again, the gossip surrounding the production must have made for a slightly uncomfortable feeling on-set. This is not the taciturn but charismatic Pitt we came to admire in Seven and Fight Club, and perhaps it is the comedy that he is not keen on. Maybe he just did not want to be as hammy and corny as the great Arnie was in True Lies, and it is this which holds his performance back  caught between a desire to play it straight and the need to allow the comedy to come out a bit more.<br/><br/>However their performances are still more than adequate and contribute to a greatly enjoyable film. The guns, the gadgets, the fast cars and the attractive leads all add up to a good old action adventure for the twenty-first century. Just disengage the brain and don't think too hard and you'll be fine."

","The premise of Mr. & Mrs. Smith is strong: a husband and wife, married for years, have no idea they're spies/assassins for competing agencies. For the first 45 minutes or so, this seems to play out quite well and leads to many amusing sequences. There's a clever opening scene where we see them together in marriage counseling. This is followed by their silent, passive/aggressive dinners together which are quite funny. We learn that he hides his spy equipment in a place she'll never look: a secret compartment under the tool shed. She hides her spy gear in a place he'll never look: a secret compartment under the oven. Even the first assassinations we see are done in a clever, memorable fashion. How about Jolie posing as a dominatrix to take out her target?<br/><br/>Sadly, when the Smiths' secrets are revealed, the movie begins to unravel quickly. At first the Smiths try to eliminate each other, but predictably they eventually have to team up against their former employers as they are now the targets. What follows is the predictable revelation that they have actually loved each other all along. This leads to a lot of flirty and aggressive banter during action sequences; while the banter seems fun at first, it gets stale very fast.<br/><br/>Pitt and Jolie definitely have chemistry as the leads, but it is mostly lost in the never-ending shootout scene that is the last hour of the movie. We have to watch countless inept bad guys walk right into the line of fire as our heroes effortlessly gun down everything in their path. At this point the film feels like a poor installment in the Lethal Weapon series, where the bad guys are there just for target practice and dramatic effect.<br/><br/>Ultimately, all the cleverness and intelligence that was established early in the film is lost. We're left with a bad action movie and stereotypical scenes we've seen done better a thousand times before. A very disappointing finish given the film's promising start."

","Mr. & Mrs. Smith seems like an initially appealing prospect but ultimately ends up as a vacuous and unfulfilling experience. You approach it hungrily, with its wonderfully tempting component parts all laid before you; alluring and glossy. The exquisitely quirky beauty of Angelina Jolie, the sheer testosterone of Brad Pitt, the intriguing premise of the set-up, the money that will no doubt be lavished upon the project, the scope for comedic interplay and a complex plot of cross and double-cross and, hopefully, some blistering action set pieces. Well, it's all there but somehow the sum is not the equal of the parts.<br/><br/>Essentially, all the parts fail spectacularly. The leads fail to develop any real chemistry, the plot is too simplistic  to the point of being non-existent, the true comedy moments can be counted on one finger and the action is generic and, frankly, boring. Brad and Angelina do a reasonable job but they are not one of cinema's finest pairings, struggling as they do to inject any true charisma or personality into their parts. Vince Vaughn is wasted in an essentially cameo role (I can't help thinking that quite of bit of him must be on a cutting room floor somewhere) and the plot delivers no suspense whatsoever.<br/><br/>The set-up has been seen before where one or both partners in a marriage are not what they appear to be (most notably in James Cameron's True Lies) and has been executed to a much higher standard. The script itself is leaden and the direction is flat and lifeless. The ending is stunningly abrupt with no resolution, as if everyone concerned with the production simply decided to stop filming and go home. Extraordinary. Assuming that there are two rival ""agencies"" out to get them then just polishing off a few henchmen is unlikely to stop that happening.<br/><br/>Ultimately, you will sit through a couple of hours of pouting and macho posturing and come away feeling just a little cheated  as if the producers thought that getting Brad and Angelina together would be enough.

","First of all, I wanted to like it, but I just plain didn't. I could barely stay focused on the movie because it was really uninteresting. I didn't really think it was that steamy or sexy, and anyone that thinks it was needs to rethink their definition of steamy and sexy. The action sequences were ridiculous and not in a good way. The supporting actors were not even that great, and I loved Kerry Washington in just about every movie she is in, but this scenario was absurd and contrived. The only bright spot in the movie was Vince Vaughn, but even that is predictable because he is often the ""bright spot"" in less than mediocre movies. The plot line was predictable and tired. In summary, this is what I saw: a boring, half-hearted attempt at an interesting idea, which paid off for them in the end due to the morbid interest in their private affair. Who says cheaters never win?"

","What rubbish!<br/><br/>A married couple find out that each other is an assassin, and now they've been given the job of killing each other. What a premise!<br/><br/>Forgetting how dumb that plot is, you'd think maybe you could make it pretty wacky, right? A few jokes here and there? Seeing as how the script is weak and Angelina Jolie is about as funny as a soggy piece of toast, this didn't work either. So what are we left with? A bit of action, which is also poor except for a showdown in the house.<br/><br/>How could this have been better? Maybe replace Jolie with Janeane Garofalo, put some effort into the script, add some more support actors besides a wasted Vince Vaughn and you'd be getting somewhere.

"bob-bennett-2","3","1","4","3 January 2006"," Another Bad Jolie Flick
","This movie was one of the worst of the very many movies that I saw from this year. Sure it's passable as an action flick with some pretty good stunts and visuals. There's also a couple of chuckles here and there. These are the only reasons I gave it a 3 out of 10.<br/><br/>However, the story-line is ridiculous and the acting is awful. Brad Pitt's performance is generally not terrible, but it's never beyond mediocre. On the other hand, Jolie's acting is so bad that I wonder when she's realised as a box office killer - Look at all the flops in her filmography. Below, I have a list of movies she's in that I've seen, with my two cents about her and the movie.<br/><br/>Movies of Hers that I've seen... <br/><br/>Alexander - awful movie, which may be why she doesn't stand out as being particularly bad <br/><br/>Bone Collector - mediocre movie, Jolie's okay<br/><br/>Gone in 60 Seconds - everyone's bad in this one <br/><br/>Hackers - corny, but fun - her character was goofy, but so was everything else in this <br/><br/>Original Sin - BORRRING!!!! I thought acting was an emotive art, but Jolie doesn't seem to agree <br/><br/>Life or Something Like It - harmless tacky movie, I actually thought she's OK in this for what it was <br/><br/>Shark Tale - pretty good movie, her Lola character really isn't very memorable <br/><br/>Sky Captain blah, blah - great visuals, bad story, worse acting by Jolie and Law <br/><br/>Taking Lives - forgettable ""thriller"" with a very bland performance by Jolie <br/><br/>Tomb Raider I & II - she's awful in both of these movies<br/><br/>I know, the glaring omissions are Beyond Borders and Girl Interrupted. Generally good reviews for the former and she won an Oscar in the latter, but I haven't seen either one. Maybe my opinion of her as an actor will change based on these two movies. However, in the movies I've listed the movies have generally flopped and Jolie's performances are consistently bland. I appreciate an under-stated performances and a less-is-more approach to acting, but I can't give Jolie that. Honestly, I can't feel any effort to connect to the character is made by her, it smacks of just a paycheck performance."
"hoju_31","2","1","4","19 December 2005"," ridiculous and contrived
","Watching a movie for the sole purpose of seeing the chemistry between ""Brad"" and ""Angelina"" is not nearly enough for me. They have no chemistry as far as I can tell anyway. First of all, what ""agencies"" are they working for? They seemed to be simply private hit companies, yet they had the funding for all the surveillance equipment, military weaponry, etc. If they are government agencies, why would they be competing with one another since they would have been from the same government? It simply made no sense. Secondly, if their respective agencies wanted them dead because they were married, why not just off the two themselves while they were least expecting it? Why go through the trouble of pitting them against each other, only to have to go after them anyway after they discovered the plot and lose many lives and probably millions of dollars? Beyond belief and just a contrivance to keep the ridiculous plot rolling. The storyline actually had potential, which was why I watched in the first place, but it didn't deliver it even remotely well. Horrible. It gets 2 stars because of a few decent action scenes."

For anyone who has been in a relationship that started out strong but the flame has died, these characters are easy to relate to.

"feelinglistless","8","1","4","28 August 2005"," exhilaratingly brilliant
","Ten things I loved about Doug Liman's exhilaratingly brilliant film Mr & Mrs Smith.<br/><br/>(1) In the flashback at the start of the film our two characters are introduced. She's called Jane and he's called John. 'John.' I heard myself say quietly out loud. 'John -- Smith?' Only Doctor Who fans would be doing that and only they will know the reference.<br/><br/>(2) John and Jane Smith go to a party. I suspect I'm the only person in that audience to notice that the track playing in the background was 'Every Heartbreak' by Amy Grant (former passion, just after Kylie just before Debbie). I'm weirded out because I haven't heard it many, many years.<br/><br/>(3) The guy from the The OC in the interrogation scene is wearing a Fight Club t-shirt.<br/><br/>(4) It's an Angelina Jolie film I can like. I've never found her all that inspiring but there's just something about the way she pouts, raises an eyebrow, holds a gun and wears knee high boots which slays me.<br/><br/>(5) Can we have Vince Vaugn playing this character in every film? I loved the way he was just sort of there, although I suspect a lot of his part was lost in the editing, although they were right to focus on the central relationship. But seriously: 'I like were you're going with this....'<br/><br/>(6) Doug Liman somehow manages to meld some of the sensibilities of his previous comedies (Swingers & Go) with the action of The Bourne Identity. Some of the gunfights are utterly balletic, and remind me of the Robert Roderiguez of Desperado. There are moments which gun fire and dialogue give way to music and it all becomes a dance. I shivered.<br/><br/>(7) Brad Pitt never really gets enough credit for his comic timing. True there's a fine line with mugging to camera, but 98% of the time he's on the good side. You couldn't imagine anyone else playing this part which is a complement.<br/><br/>(8) The constant conversational within the couple about how some situations suddenly have a whole other meaning and their implications. A real attempt has been made to reignite the sort of quick fire dialogue of the 1940s. This is pure Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell in His Girl Friday<br/><br/>(9) You just feel like you've seen a movie, not just the impression of one. It hits all the beats on time and in the right order. At no point do you feel short changed or that anything could be done better.<br/><br/>(10) I can't actually understand the ongoing criticism of the ending. Almost every review I've seen says that it's great up until about ten minutes before the end. Actually this could have gone two ways: The Butch and Sundance or what we have. On this occasion the former would really have short changed the audience even though within a certain moral code which some reviews believe movies should follow, that would have created an important ambiguity. But I just thought about Martin Blank in Grosse Pointe Blank -- he can have a happy ending so why not these guys? Then again they do break his golden rule. No unions..."
"BdR76","3","1","4","7 August 2005"," trite, boring, predictable and lame, go see ""True Lies"" instead
","Humour can come from opposites, so why not take a boring suburbanite couple that lead exciting double lives as super secret agents. Thus the plot of ""Mr and Mrs Smith"" was born. The fact that the main characters are named John and Jane Smith gives away that very little extra thought has been put into this idea.<br/><br/>For example, every single joke is based on the housewife/secretagent paradox. Just check the ""memorable quotes"" here on IMDb and you'll get a rough idea of the quality of comedy in this movie. It's just lame and not funny. Especially the part where Mr and Mrs argue over a wedding ring during a high speed car chasing scene. The movie ""Team America"" has a scene that ridicules *exactly* this kind of thing. As for the action, it's big and bombastic but with barely any plot to back it up it's just meaningless and unbelievable.<br/><br/>It's incredible to see some of the user comments that rave and cheer about this movie, and a 6.6 rating (at the time of writing) is really way too high for this b-movie with a-actors. Go see ""True Lies"" or ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" instead, more or less the same plot but overall much better movies."
"QueenMakeda84","10","1","4","3 August 2005"," Sexy and Surprisingly Good
","I really liked this movie. Their chemistry reminds you of old Hollywood couples who did a certain amount of movies together: Hepburn and Tracy, Bacall and Bogart...they were sexy together. It looks like they had fun as well, and that's an important element to any film. To look like you enjoyed doing it, because it breaks down the 4th wall for the audience. Granted, there were a lot of rumors swirling around these two, they managed to keep professional and make a kick-a$$ movie.<br/><br/>The premise immediately took me, and when you found out who was in it, you were excited. That's how movies should operate. I could not see Nicole playing this part. She's just not sexy enough and you wouldn't buy that she and Brad were married. I can see how Will Smith could play John, but he'd really need an actress to bring on that crazy energy and chemistry the roles require. The chemistry was important, because you had to buy that despite how much they want to follow orders, part of their attraction was real, as was their love. Jolie and Pitt played that well.<br/><br/>Ange could've been more strong and forceful in her role. I thought she played Jane waaaay too subdued. I understand she was playing the part of a controlled suburban housewife, but let's face it, they're more nagging and annoying than that! :) (Smile please!) I get that Jane was the cautious and controlled character, but she could have put more behind her. Really pumped her up and fleshed out her character so that she was believable as an assassin who's killed 312 people. I guess the whole point was that you shouldn't believe it, but we as the audience already knew, so just go with it. She could've let herself go more with the role other than just the sex scene. Pitt was charming as John, but his comedic delivery was a little off at certain points. He needs more practice. It's like he expects you to think he's funny because he's saying it. It's not enough. It wasn't a major emphasis of the film to be funny I think, but it warranted doing it properly. For the most part, he was amusing because he didn't seem to get that he was being amusing.<br/><br/>I did notice some of the technical mistakes, but it goes with the territory. Fire the script editor or something. We don't care that much. *SPOILER* When they were in the elevator waiting to shoot off the enemy in the Home Made store and the Muzak was playing, it was hilarious. Them just bopping their heads as they're about to blow some tails. Utterly amusing. Supporting actors were wonderful. Who doesn't love Vince Vaugh? Typecasting could be a wonderful thing with Vince in the driver's seat. Had some great deliveries. The action was great, the acting, the humor, and the romantic moments (if you could deign to call them that, lol). I really liked this film. Worthy of becoming apart of my collection :)."
"PWNYCNY","7","1","4","31 July 2005"," Angelina Jolie for Comic Actress of the Year!
","Mr. and Mrs. Smith are just an ordinary couple, living in an ordinary town and in an ordinary house and leading ordinary lives. Or so the audience is lead to believe. But the audience knows better, or at least they should know better. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are not paid big bucks to play just anybody, and the movie soon proves this to be the case. Once Pitts's and Jolie's covers are blown, sparks fly, things blow up, and the one-liners spew forth at a rate almost equal to that of the speed of sound. What this movie proves is that Angelina Jolie is now the funniest comic actress since Sandra Bullock. In fact, if someone decided to make an updated version of ""I Love Lucy,"" I would definitely cast Ms. Jolie in the role of Lucy Ricardo. There is no question that she would do credit to such a role. Andy Garcia could play Ricky Ricardo, and Dom De Louise and Cathy Bates could play Fred and Ethel Mertz. But enough of this digressing. ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is good entertainment, and Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt work well together, and for these reasons alone the movie is worth watching."

"Buddy-51","6","1","4","14 July 2005"," takes awhile to find its footing but delivers the goods
","In ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith,"" Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie make love with blows and bullets rather than with hearts and flowers. Could this be the new paradigm for romance for the 21st Century? Pitt and Jolie portray a couple whose marriage, after six years, has become so boring and routine that they have literally nothing left to say to one another. This despite the fact that both lead extraordinary double lives as secret agents - so secret, in fact, that neither of them knows that the other is really a hired assassin working for a rival company. When the truth finally comes out, the film turns into a sort of James Bond version of ""The War of the Roses,"" with both parties devising ever more elaborate ways to rub one another out. However, the equation changes a bit when they discover that they have both been targeted for assassination by their respective agencies who fear that having two married spies from opposing camps might result in a serious conflict of interest for both sides. Soon, John and Jane come to realize that there's nothing like shooting it out with a common enemy to put a little zing back into a marriage.<br/><br/>Written by Simon Kinberg and directed by Doug Liman, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is a clever, stylish dark comedy jerry-built out of equal parts star power, high concept cleverness and cartoon violence. Although the actors sometimes seem to be having a better time doing their thing on screen than we in the audience are having watching them do it, the fact remains that ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith,"" after a somewhat faltering start, catches us up in its skewed view of marital relations gone wild. For the more threatened and knee-deep in danger and trouble the two of them get, the more they begin to communicate and reconnect as lovers - proving, I suppose, that two people can indeed make both love AND war despite what the slogan says. Most of the humor, in fact, is generated by the incongruity that arises from hearing them air their marital grievances against the backdrop of life-threatening gunplay and explosions. Who ever would have thought that facing death under a hail of bullets could be a more effective form of marital therapy than conventional counseling? As the bickering couple, Pitt and Jolie achieve a genuine romantic chemistry on screen, hitting just the right note of urbane sophistication and sly detachment necessary for what is, essentially, a slick, post-modernist comedy for star struck audiences. Both are suave, laid-back and utterly unflappable in their presence and demeanor, as befits the tone of the film. My only complaint is that the gun battles do go on a bit long at times and the film does have some trouble finding its footing at the beginning. But once the elements finally come together at about the midway point, the film turns into a cool and relaxing summertime entertainment."

The writers had fun with the script as it really made people laugh in the theater, even at the most intense times.

I shouldn't have worried- it was darn good.<br/><br/>Great blend of comedy and action, and while some of the shootouts do stretch your believability, it's nothing so far as to pull you out of the story. Admittedly, the stars CAN act, as we've seen in other films, so most roles will be a cakewalk, but these two are professional enough not to mail in a performance.

","From the very first scene, seeing Brad and Angelina receiving couples therapy, the chemistry between the 2 of them is so conspicuous and unbelievable. Once the opening credits have ended, your intuition leads you to believe that Mr and Mrs Smith has great potential...and you are certainly NOT misleaded.<br/><br/>I caught this movie today with a bunch of friends, and it was unequivocal that along with myself all of my other friends enjoyed this movie to a great extent. The degree to which the humour has been integrated with the action is perfect. Angelina Jolie's seductive looks, and feminist 'chick' attitude make her perfect for the role - and to match this perfection, Brad Pitt very wisely made his decision to re-join the cast. I don't think i have ever seen such good chemistry between characters - and though in all the endless Oscar nominated and winning movies, their producers boast about 'chemistry',none are exactly conspicous. Brad and Angelina - are brilliant - and its a movie worth watching again.<br/><br/>The supporting cast seem weak as opposed to the protagonists. Vince Vaughn was cast for even more comic relief, and to a certain extent overacted and seemed unwanted! Adam Brody who would have shown up on set thinking he was on the set of 'The OC' gave a Seth Cohen-ish performance, and Kerry Washington took on opposite role when compared to the performance she gave in 'Ray.' I had such a great time at the theatre just laughing at every other scene - i don't see why critics gave this movie a fairly low rating."

","If there ever were a couple who needed some marriage counseling, it's Mr. & Mrs. Smith (played by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie). Outwardly, they are successful entrepreneurs who have a perfect life, if not a mundane one. What they don't realize about the other is that they are actually highly-trained assassins who, after a botched attempt, are hired to kill each other. When they discover this, they use just about every tactic possible to exterminate the other, while struggling with the fact that despite their commitment to their jobs, they are, after all, married.<br/><br/>The plot of this film is really very basic, but the synergy between Pitt and Jolie is enough to make the film entertaining. It certainly doesn't hurt that these are two of the most photogenic actors working today, and if you're looking for something that is not thought-provoking or attempting depth, it's a good movie to see. Unfortunately, there's a lot of beating up on each other, so if you're not crazy about seeing a husband wail on each other full force for a good half an hour, this movie is probably not for you. Realizing that Vince Vaughn is a big favorite in the supporting actor field, I have to say that he was completely obnoxious in this film, and even though there was nothing profound about the movie, he seemed to make it even more vapid.<br/><br/>While watching ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" I couldn't help but compare it to the great 1989 cult classic ""The War of the Roses"", starring Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas. While the circumstances were different, (the Roses fought because they hated each other, while the Smiths just had to kill one another because it was their job) ""The War of the Roses"" had a very dark cleverness to it that could have been somewhat imitated in ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"", particularly in its ending. Sometimes it doesn't pay to try to add depth or improvement to what is essentially an action-laden popcorn flick, but unfortunately the end result will be just that: It is simply an action-laden popcorn flick. 5/10 --Shelly"

When she starts firing at him, he throws the refrigerator door open behind him and she launches a few rounds into the inside of the refrigerator, exploding cans of soda, cartons of milk, etc, etc, and they show it in slowmo...lol...my friends and i were practically in the aisles...<br/><br/>Overall, I thought that the stellar performance in ""Smith"" didn't come from Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie...instead, I think that Adam Brody stole the show. Yes, he only had a supporting role, but his great performance boosted my rating of ""Smith"" by a few stars. What was best about his performance was a subtle, deeper kind of thing -- his character, ""The Tank,"" actually acts like Brody's other well-known role, Seth in ""The O.C."". He had a few of those 'Seth'-y sarcastic moments, i.e. The Weather Channel sequence, ""More desert,"" etc. <br/><br/>Another great/hilarious fight scene comes at the end...when that one guard/agent has a rocket launcher and he keeps trying to shoot the Smiths with it. <br/><br/>A few of the best scenes (you'll only get these if you've seen the movie, they're not spoilers): the ""accidental stabbing"" part, the highway scene, and the neighbors...""I like the carpeting"" lol!<br/><br/>I think the worst part of this whole movie was the music. Some music choices in certain points, I think, were questionable...ah well, it was still a great movie and i'll definitely see it again."
"HyperJynx","9","1","4","15 June 2005"," Mr. and Mrs. Smith sure know how to entertain.
","Brad and Angelina are well known for stellar roles in such films as Fight club and Girl Interrupted, and I can safely add this one to both actors lists of great movies.<br/><br/>Both actors bring forth a great performance in a movie that is action packed, as well as touching. If you have been or are currently married, this is a GREAT date movie. The fights and conversations that take place can best be appreciated by those who have taken a vow of marriage and have hit a few rough patches along the way.<br/><br/>Witty dialog, great action sequences, and pretty toys (AKA weaponry) cause this movie to appeal to a wide range of viewers. I personally haven't laughed so hard at an action film made for adults in some time. Go see it!"

It made me laugh out loud, grin often and kept my attention the whole way through.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt we're an exceptionally great team for this movie. Bringing two gorgeous Hollywood stars together for such a movie was obviously a terrific idea.

","It starts off like a chick flick they are in therapy and you see the basic we love each other but we are miserable scenes. Then you find out that they both are assassins. Then it turns into a sexy dark comedy and action romp that never looses sight of the relationship. The unrated version sticks more to exploring the relationship. Two examples, the scenes exploring the sparks when they meet are longer and the scene when you see them together after you find out they are both assassins is different. In the unrated version you see them both dressed for the neighbors party waiting outside the door a typical bored married couple with nothing to say to each other. In the theater release instead of this you have a shot of Angelina almost being caught in her sexy domanatrix costume. The unrated scene works better because the audience knows they have so much in common and would be connected if they only knew about their common profession. This movie blends genres not unlike Beverly Hills Cop I and II or War of the Roses. It is well written on several levels dark humor, action and romantic comedy and it delivers well in each genre. You leave entertained and feeling like you witnessed the beginning of something spectacular. If that is not enough you get to stare at Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt for two hours - for us it was a great date night my husband got to stare at Angelina and I got to stare at Brad. What a movie!"
"johnnyboyz","4","1","5","12 November 2007"," A Tasteless, over the top $110,000,000 Tom and Jerry episode between the only two people on the planet you'd pay to see running on a non-existent story and script.
","Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a film that can sum up perfectly what's wrong with not only American cinema but star power and utilising (or taking advantage of) it. Here, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star as two people, married and yet have been able to keep one secret from one another: they are both international assassins for hire. Lots of things don't add up in this film resulting in it being a horrid and un-engaging film that I could only minutely recommend for perhaps having one or two decent chase sequences or action scenes.<br/><br/>The mentioning of 'star power' is relevant because even I could've starred as Mr. Smith in this film and someone picked off the street could've starred as Mrs. Smith but Pitt and Jolie get people into the cinema, I guess. Secondly, this is the reason American cinema is where it is with lots of dumb action and fast edits being the hook to drag everyone in: ironically enough, I saw this on November the 11th which is remembrance day here in Britain and what kind of film did I get to see that Sunday night? A network premiere of two people armed to the teeth with guns and explosives; jumping around and shooting the hell out of each other, the house in which they live, moving cars and other bad guys all the time not taking a bullet apart from the time Mrs. Smith hits her husband with a knife accidentally  if only it was as easy as this on D-Day or in the battle of the Somme or during Vietnam or Desert Storm.<br/><br/>I have a number of gripes about this film, one of which being the fact the film was made on $110,000,000: what a crock since this could've been made on a lot less, surely. Another gripe is the direction of Doug Liman; a man who delivered an entertaining film called 'Go' several years ago; a film that was clever since it didn't portray homosexuals as Hollywood would normally do; a film that was funny in its dialogue and engaged with its characters and their problems; a film that had three stories going at once  Mr. and Mrs. Smith didn't even HAVE a story; how it must've wished it could've borrowed one from Go. I also don't believe the way they could keep the secret from one another for so long: the film establishes a perfect Suburban American life and cleverly places Mrs. Smith's arsenal in the cooker, a place the typical male might never look therefore the secret's safe.<br/><br/>The actual premise for the film seems so clever and original, it can't fail. I can just see the fat cats rubbing their hands: We'll get Pitt and Jolie, sex them up a few times and get them to shoot the crap out of each other and everyone else when we need to as well as a stupid script that the idiots out in contemporary cinema land will love. There are the obligatory love scenes at the beginning; Jolie in a sexy outfit performing her first kill and lots of gung-ho action. The idea behind this film is so very basic that it's not enough to form an actual story. I was confused as to why Mr. and Mrs. Smith couldn't just explain to each other why they were going after the same hit; the fact these two now apparently hate each other and shoot at each other with intent to kill and yet we know that there's no reason for them to do so  we don't even have the pleasure of being led down the path since we already know there's no point of them doing what they're doing. The originality and humour behind these two bullet-proof people shoot each other becomes boring in its delivery after the third time it does so. First time you think: OK, very funny; second time you think: Yeah, you just did that and after that the same thing just keeps on coming and you just don't give a damn, you are begging the film to end. The fun and originality behind the whole idea becomes monotonous.<br/><br/>There is still room for me to say that Mr. & Mrs. Smith comes very close to a Charlie's Angels film once the brainless action steps up a gear for the final shootout but you'll have switched off by that time; the way they bicker during the car chase as they manage to flawlessly pick off any chasing enemies is so bad, it's cringe worthy. I read that director Liman was inspired by no less than five films before making this and it shows; it's a little bit of everything you don't want and in my opinion, five films is too many to be inspired by: where's the originality, Doug? Go and The Bourne Identity were good films  what happened? The film should be avoided unless you are literally looking for a two hour no-brainer featuring lots of loud rubbish, technology that hasn't been invented yet and Pitt and Jolie earning their cheques for having silly fun that eventually turned into a proper relationship: what a rip-off."

"jubilee77","1","1","5","18 July 2007"," Mr & Mrs ""on the cheap""
","The problem with some action films is that they have lame plots and very poor action scenes that isn't helped by its violence that sometimes goes over the top and all these things isn't everyone's type. Even so, Mr & Mrs Smith is among these in this category being with hindsight, an action film at its worst. It's because this was done on the cheap with a bad plot being overacted and over-directed with simply unnecessary high levels of violence to such degree of extent that this is a true candidate for being one of the worst movies of the year it was premiered. The casting is bad too and begins with two assassins being husband and wife (Pitt and Jolie) running themselves on a domestic wrecking spree by attempting to kill each other to boiling and exhaustive point that it in fact makes me wonder who would be the most exhausted. In reality as already stated, the levels of action throughout the film is actually nothing to get excited about and towards the end, the couple seemed to have achieved the impossible from bullseye range by gunning down every armed ""hoddie"" hiding in the corner without a single scathe of getting bullets on themselves. Just take my honest advice and do avoid this rubbish at any costs because once you have seen it, you will regret to having watched it."
"Galagonya","3","1","5","9 May 2007"," Entertaining, strangely.
","Having overcome the initial shock that two allegedly top-notch assassins are supposedly not aware of the job of the person they live with, despite the fact, that they met while both being on the run in South America and covered up for each other, the movie was quite enjoyable. <br/><br/>I feel the more so, since the Trivia for this picture states that the original cast would have been Nicole Kidman and Johnny Depp. It seems quite impossible to come up with a more awkward couple. At least Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are a good match. <br/><br/>The Smiths is nothing memorable, nothing special, but in its own way surprisingly entertaining (once). <br/><br/>Still, if for some twisted reason you would want to see professional, exciting and intriguing (and also touching and intelligent) fights between members of a couple, watch Ying xiong's Broken Sword and Flying Snow instead."

","Hi, I must say I think this film is incredible, the style of the film is great and most importantly the gorgeous and sexy Anjelina Jolie and hunky Brad Pitt are a brilliant couple. In my opinion there is real chemistry between them in this film. The plot line although not entirely original is still excellent, and is fantastically and strongly played out by the producers. In addition, the movie has a good blend of action, romance as well as a little humour thrown in. However if there was a bad point about the film it is probably the fact that to me the film felt as if was being a little rushed and I think if it had be slightly longer it would have helped.To conclude I think this is by far the best movie of 2005 and one of my all time favourite films, a must see..."
"jason_13","5","1","5","21 January 2006"," Average action flick with high budget
","Yes, that is exactly what Mr. and Mrs. Smith is. I recently understood that this movie supposed to be one of the highest grossing summer movies. I almost fell down. I thought it's just one of those movies that are mostly comedies that bring many people in the theaters for 2 or 3 weeks maximum and the movie gets completely forgotten, but it turned out that it is a box office disaster among with Bewitched. Give me a break. So what do we have here. Brad pit who is a great actor, but he not here. The spotlight is his and nothing could stop his overacting. The same could be said about Jolie, but I am a male and I didn't care she couldn't act that good, you know. So they play a separated couple who by accident get mission to kill themselves in different circumstances. OK, I guess that even the director and the screenwriter realize that the story won't make people watch the movie over and over again in the theaters. So we have action. Lots of action and lots of special effects. And still nothing. All the action scenes are ridiculous. Pit and Jolie shoot at each other with guns in a kitchen and they weren't even damaged and at the same time they are being sarcastic. OK again, I know the movie is not supposed to be serious even in the action moments, but what the hell was funny about these 4-5 action/comedy moments?! I think nothing. And there is nothing more that could make the movie special. Overally, it wasn't the worst movie of the year for sure, but it was from the high disappointments among with Episode 3 for example. I respect action movies and I think Jolie is hot and I also think it's a good way of killing time so it deserves a 6 for sure."

","The problem with ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is not the rope-a-dope script, the flatter-than-a-pancake delivery by the too-yummy leads, or even the misogyny (is 312 the number of people Jane has offed or slept with?), it's the reason John and Jane find themselves on their respective agencies' hit lists: why it takes five (or six) years for their bosses to decide that John and Jane being Mr. and Mrs. is ""bad for business"" (whatever that means) is beyond me!<br/><br/>Because John already knows what Jane does when they meet (he sees her slip the knife she just used to dispatch The Barracuda into its sheath), the whole premise of the film is bogus. Even stupider is the idea of the agencies jeopardizing the lives of countless of innocent people AND allowing the FBI to buy their ruse, just to take out two of their own! So who's trying to take out John and Jane at Home Made: his agency, her agency, the FBI or all three? Your guess is as good as mine!<br/><br/>Though Brad and Angelina are no Butch and Sundance, and they didn't give me a single reason to like them, I found myself actually rooting for them, which, in light of what's gone down, sickens me. When Bruce Springsteen decided to humiliate his wife by flaunting his affair with his backup singer, I remember the overwhelming reaction was a collective: ""You go, Boss!"" I remarked to someone at the time that if Madonna cheated on Sean Penn, she'd be crucified by the same retards who were giving Springsteen their seal of approval. To see the dance the media did around Brad's adultery is to realize the hell Jennifer would have been put through had she decided to do the horizontal mamba with the co-star of her latest film. The more things change, sadly, the more they stay the same."

","This movie was fast paced and lots of fun. Forget the somewhat convoluted plot-line, Brad and Angelina looked great. The zingers and one liners were flying and everyone in the audience obviously had a great time. So it's not Shakespeare - so what. We all laughed out loud. There has been lots of talk about the chemistry between these two - and that certainly is for real. Liman kept the action coming with just enough gun play without over doing it. The supporting cast was pretty good but the focus was on the ""the Smiths"". If you are not looking for something too heavy then this is a prefect choice. If you don't see it in the theatre then it is definitely worth buying the DVD."
"streetrat","2","1","5","13 July 2005"," Promising but key aspects lost
","This was a sure disappointment. Both Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie obviously possess more acting skill (not huge amount-- just more than is shown here) than they use in this wishy-washy movie. Brad Pitt was absolutely abysmal, doing clichéd high school lines such as (when his wife stabs him), gritting his teeth and saying grumpily, ""We'll talk about this later!"" Angelina, considered by most to be the most beautiful woman in the world, bases her whole performance on this. She wears ridiculous outfits (the white shirt and red-rubber boots-- how did she have time to put those on?) designed to make the audience reflect on how she can look fantastically sexy in everything. Most of her scenes, actually, contained this ""theme"". The movie's tired message (love is more important that career bla bla bla) is lost in the fact that these two are annoying, reckless, and don't actually appear to have much on-screen chemistry.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the action sequences seemed to be cheap James Bond-type drivel, bordering on video game. While it is feasible for 007 to beat 50 guys by himself, when these two do it-- it just seems ridiculous. Guns ablazing, the movie would have been more satisfying if the two heroes had shot themselves in the feet."

","I really liked this movie. The on screen chemistry between Brad and Angelina was everything (and then some) it was talked up to be before the movie came out. It was real! I think they make a great couple and I hope they can continue their relationship off-screen as well. They're both beautiful, sexy, fun, are great together, totally connect, they both love kids and would make great parents, and they're both dedicated to their humanitarian missions in third world countries. I do hope they can get married. I hope people can get past the Brad/Jen thing and saying that Brad cheated on Jen and making that the focus of their discussions. Some people are meant to be together and some people are not. I think Brad and Angelina make a better couple than Brad and Jennifer. It's best they found that out now (after just 5 years, and so they can have their remaining 60 or so years in happiness, tranquility and contentment) and before they brought any children into the world. Jen will find someone more compatible for her. Nobody should criticize them divorcing because nobody was with them 24/7 to really know what it was like in their relationship. It must not have been all that wonderful or they would not be divorcing."

","The time that I spent watching 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' this past weekend was one of the best movie going experience that I have had since watching 'Pirates of the Caribbean'. This movie is simply a lot of fun to watch.<br/><br/>The movie isn't very deep. Some may not look kindly on this if expectations were more along the lines of a pure action adventure like the Jason Bourne series that leaves an air of plausibility. Instead, the film is more along the lines of an 'Ocean's Eleven' of the action flick. As long as you don't expect an answer for how they were able to do what they do, and accept the movie for what it is, it will not disappoint. The beauty is in the chemistry of the characters and watching the action unfold rather than believing the actions could actually transpire.<br/><br/>This movie is a success solely because of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Both performances remind us that there is a reason why these are two of the hottest names in Hollywood right now, and together, they are nothing less than dynamite.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn and Adam Brody's trademark comedic styles are perfect in the small doses that we are given for each. And important ingredient for success was not relying too heavily on any supporting cast element. The effect of this leaves you relishing the few moments you spend with these two, rather than becoming inundated with the after taste of their distinctively odd ball personalities.<br/><br/>The bottom line of this movie is that you will not leave the theater with buyer's remorse."

Contrary to what I had thought, it wasn't based around the action scenes at all - which were, by the way, fantastic and all the better for the fabulous sound track!! - but around the problems facing a married couple who find they don't know each other any more. Mr and Mrs Smith has a script full of anecdotes and witty one-liners which stop it from dragging like so many action films do - also, look out for the Adam Brody's fight club t-shirt in the hostage scene!

I found myself laughing out loud more than anything else, even my friends who were with me looked at me a few times because I was laughing so loud. The entire theater was though too, so it wasn't as obvious. The opening sequence alone had me already biting my tongue to keep from laughing. Brad and Angelina definitely have the chemistry on screen, without being overly sexual, though the sexual attraction was there too for a ""5-6 year married couple""! This movie has the action, though cheesy at times (spoiler: I mean come on, the last fight seen has like 50 men versus the Smiths...not likely) but the overall relationship with Brad and Angelina is what kept my attention--as assassins set to kill one another, things get interesting when they have to fight their feelings for each other. I promise this movie won't disappoint...whether you're a fan of either of these main actors, it's a must-see in my opinion. Brad even gets in a few good one-liners, and comedy isn't something I see Brad doing. He does it well though, and Angelina is a gorgeous bombshell in this movie I think.

"madeba","Null","1","5","13 June 2005"," Slick, Sexy and Funny
","I have to admit that I enjoy a good action flick. Sometimes I simply don't want to be challenged. I want schlocky, escapist fun. Action movies are like pornos - the story and dialogue don't pretend to be great. We know they are there merely to advance you to the next action/sex sequence. I mean, that's why we bought the ticket, right? We can't expect anything better, or can we? Well, Mr & Mrs Smith proves that we should expect more. The opening title sequence alone had the audience cracking up. And in that moment, the filmmakers made us a promise: that this film would be slick, sexy and funny. Thankfully, it didn't disappoint. The well crafted dialogue transcends the genre and, with a great cast and fine direction, helps to create a product that's all class.<br/><br/>Both Pitt and Jolie show that they're fine comedic actors. We've had a taste of Pitt's looniness in 12 Monkeys and charm in Oceans 11/12, but not this. Here the comedy is subtle, the characters are truly engaging and the rhythm is perfect. (It got me thinking just how much better the Italian Job remake could have been with Pitt as Charlie Croker, instead of Wahlberg) The chemistry between the 2 leads is undeniable and delicious, heightened only by what the tabloids tell us we should read into it. We buy them as a couple, we buy them getting counselling, we buy them squeezing triggers. Vince Vaughn also delivers a wonderful (if unusually restrained) performance as Pitt's partner/booking agent. The rest of the cast are kept at arm's length. Even the multitude of agents our heroes encounter remain hooded and faceless, leaving us no option but to soak up Brad and Angelina. <br/><br/>Oh yeah - and the action's pretty great, too, especially in an inspired minivan sequence. Sure, we have to suspend our disbelief, but that gets checked when we enter the theater, right? This had all the goodness of an old Brit actioner, with Hollywood production values. I'd put it up there with Ronin and Renny Harlin's underrated, yet equally fulfilling The Long Kiss Goodnight."
"dbbuddha","8","1","5","13 June 2005"," overall, an enjoyable flick with understated performances
","I've been reading the IMDb boards again today (why yes, I guess that makes me a masochist), and I felt the need to comment on this movie.<br/><br/>Let's establish up front that this movie will not be in contention for any major awards (nor should it be), and that it required serious suspension of disbelief at times, perfectly in keeping with certain genre standards. Also, user ratings are necessarily distorted because of pinheads who insist on rating something a perfect 10 or a perfect 0 because they ""really liked"" the movie at that instant, or they thought it was slightly overrated and thus instantly deemed it the ""worst flick EVar."" That said, this movie was an excellent action flick with some extremely clever (and often subtle) dialogue and very subdued acting given its genre. Pitt and Jolie did remarkably well when expected to express more than their dialogue allowed, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching them gesticulate and manipulate their faces in place of just saying something. I frequently had to suppress laughter during the marriage counseling, and I loved other expressive scenes like the carnival, the rooftop escape scene, etc. where extra lines would have cluttered and detracted from their interactions.<br/><br/>The on screen chemistry between the two also surprised me. Sure, they're two beautiful faces with a lot of sex appeal, but they seemed to work rather well *together* instead of being two competing sex-icons trying to pretend they've got any business together. The great comic timing helped, to be sure, but you can rarely fake the chemistry. So many movies have failed in this, assuming that because they have good (or at least famous) actors, they can dupe the audience. (_Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow_ comes to Mind)<br/><br/>Also, the bits of surreal action (at the house, and at the end) seem to fit with the general tone of the movie, which is *really* funny. Again, this is where facial expressions and body language really come into play.<br/><br/>On a normal, unbiased scale, this movie would probably elicit a 6.5 overall, with a 7.5-8.0 for the witty dialogue and brilliant nonverbals (and, of course, for Vince Vaughan, who wasn't even at his best here). ...but given the nature of the system, I'll give it a 9 for the popcorn genre, and encourage people to consult IMDb's Recommendations for other films in its class."

I agree with the other reviewers that cite 'chemistry' here....I loved it!<br/><br/>The other characters who made up their teams were also interesting.

","I thought Mr. and Mrs. Smith was great. It had just enough action scenes to make it an action film. I liked the comedy. Brad Pitt fit very well as a comedienne and he look so good. He was smart like a younger James Bond and he was very agile. I like the sex scene but I wish there could have been a little more than there was. Angelina looked beautiful. She was the perfect fit for this role even better than tomb Raider. I like that they both did not over power the screen meaning they had their own way of bringing the story to life. It would have gotten a 10 but I did not like the ending. I wanted more and it did not give that to me. But all and all it was great and I wish they would come out with a second one which I think they will. I recommend a lot of people to see it cause it is not just one genre but a whole bunch of different ones."
"nathan_goetchius","8","1","5","10 June 2005"," the funniest thing since pirates of the Caribbean
","OK here is the simple lowdown, i don't want to take away from any of the fun, Pitt and Jolie are assassins, the best in the world, they both have no clue the other is one. and carrying on with there boring lives, until a chance encounter on a same target, they figure out the other is also a assassin. That is all i will say about the plot, not that there is amazing twists or anything, but that is all that needs to be known.<br/><br/>This is a fun film. period. the review on this web site quotes that Pitt wasn't that great and it's all about Angelina, but once again, i have to disagree with that critic. Brad Pitt is the heart and soul of this film. He makes this film great. His sly acting and great one liners, make this a incredibly enjoyable film. I must have found myself chuckling to Pitt a dozen times. both actors acting was above average. Pitt played his character to the top of his game. Almost if Mr smith was a pair of shoes, Pitt slipped in and fit perfectly. he knew how to use his character. Jolie was there to make Pitt seem more entertaining. although her acting was right on, this film is fun and the fun originates from Pitt. coming in with a really entertaining performance was Vince Vaughn. He was quite funny, playing Pitt's best buddy and friendly assassin. the performances from here on out are nil important. <br/><br/>The directing was Doug linman, and he knows what he is doing for action. just watch the Jason Bourne films. great. the action is fantastic. But the dialogue exchange between the characters during the action sequences made this film even better. The cinematography and screen writing all worked out nicely. The film leaves some unanswered questions, or some holes. but at the end you don't walk out thinking "" oh man i wonder what happened"" you come out saying some of the great lines. <br/><br/>maybe i tend to like brad a little to much, but this is really his role and his film. He is perfect for this and he does it perfect. This film can be enjoyed by almost anyone that likes to have fun. finally the man can take a woman out to a film that they will both enjoy. A rare sight in todays economy. this one's got it all, laughing, edge of your seat action, one liners, great acting, directing, romance. if you need something to do this weekend, then you can find all you'll ever need in this film. try and walk into this one let loose and try and just enjoy yourself for once. something theaters rarely get."

","Angelina Jolie does not surprise as Jane Smith. Her considerable talents, athleticism, intensity and beauty make her the natural choice for the assassin-wife to, er, die for. Brad Pitt does not surprise as John Smith. His considerable talents, athleticism, intensity and beauty make him the natural choice for the assassin-husband to, er, die for. As the film started, I wondered if the script and the director stymie Jolie and Pitt: they didn't. ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is yummy cinematic entertainment. Professionals are at work here: even a simple Tango is a study in pauses, glances, gestures, knowing looks and catchy dialog. Ah, some might say, the story is preposterous. Realistic films can be very rewarding  ""Crash"" proves that. ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is rewarding without reality's constraints.<br/><br/>The film, however does have its flaws: a couple of popular music cues are awkward, if only because the rest are so rewarding. Mrs. Smith's colleagues are professional women and obviously provide a balanced team of intelligence and intuition. Mr. Smith, alas, is stuck with Eddie, offered by Vince Vaughn. Vaughn repeats his nuisance-dullard-twitchy sidekick, a roles better left to ""Dodgeball."" Vaughn has achieved some popularity and the marketing mavens might have twisted some arms. Luckily, his on screen time fails to do major damage and is merely a nuisance. Go make another Ben Stiller flick, Mr. Vaughn.<br/><br/>Some critics have compared ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" with ""War of the Roses."" I don't see it: DeVito's ""Roses"" is nonstop acidic, hateful, unrelenting bile having no entertainment value whatsoever. ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is worth every fun minute at your local Cineplex."

","Mr. and Mrs. Smith was incredible. Great plot, truly unique, and the casting was amazing. I am gay, so to see Brad Pitt in an action film, was also amazing! Angelina Jolie was so hot in this movie, I almost did a 360 and turned straight! 10 Fingers for this flick. One question...what on God's green earth was Adam Brody doing in Mr. and Mrs. Smith????? Go back to the O.C.!! Send Ben Mackenzie, he's hotter!And I hope Kenmore comes up with an oven with a full arsenal in it. If not, there going to have some tough competition!!

"AirBourne_Bds","9","1","5","12 June 2005"," Rosy Lies In a Crown Affair...
","Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a little bit of the remake of ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" with Pierce Brosnan and Renee Russo; along with a piece of ""War Of The Roses"" with Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas; as well as a bit of ""True Lies"" with Governor Schwarzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis, Charlton Heston, Art Malik and Tom Arnold.<br/><br/>The ""Thomas Crown..."" part is where the duo are filmed visiting a marriage counsellor, and it reminded me of the psych parts when Pierce Brosnan was visiting Faye Dunaway (Dunaway was the Russo role in the original with Steve McQueen).<br/><br/>""True Lies"" fit in with how they made puns on their kills and not letting each other know what they really up to - like Brad Pitt's pun when he bumped off an Irish Terrorist whose nickname is ""Lucky"" and he was asked by Jolie how was work and he truthfully said, ""I got Lucky"" (groans) - ""True Lies"" also fit in that neither had a clue what the other was about... Unlike that flick though, when Jolie found out, she not upset at what he did but that he didn't trust her enough to tell her! Which means that although her character claimed she didn't love him - you know she was just lying to herself...<br/><br/>Of course, ""War Of The Roses"" fit in when they were on full assault mode with each other and a special remix of ""Express Yourself"" from Charles Wright emphasised their fight scene  those clashes were awesome, with spittoons as weapons plus real cuffs and kicks! Meanwhile, there was ""Love Stinks"" from the J. Geils Band, as well as ""Tainted Love"" from Soft Cell with Marc Almond on lead vocals, and The Voodoo Glow Skulls' ""I Used To Love Her (But I Had To Kill Her)"" among quite a few others to show the nemesis of affection.<br/><br/>Yet Air Supply's ""Making Love (Out Of Nothing At All)"" (which Brad/John Smith sang along to, and not too badly either) plus a remake of Bob Dylan's ""Lay Lady Lay"" as interpreted by Magnet with Gemma Hayes in addition to Captain and Tennille's perennial handling of Neil Sedaka's ""Love Will Keep Us Together"" showed why the smoochy stuff is worth it in the end.<br/><br/>How was the rest of the picture, content- and music-wise? Go and debrief it for yourself  if I told you, I'd have to kill you!"

"triple8","8","1","5","12 June 2005"," Mr and Mrs Smith is a hit.
","SPOILERS: <br/><br/>This movie was so much better then I ever thought it would be. Just saw it last night and the theater was so packed we could barely find a seat. Good turnout for a really good movie. This is definitely a great summer's release.<br/><br/>Jolie and Pitt have oodles of chemistry, not just physically but the way their able to keep their back and forth banter so interesting and entertaining. These two really carry the movie and it works. It is one of the most energetic movies I've seen in awhile and people look like they had a good time being in it. I'm definitely glad I saw it.<br/><br/>The movie is both an action movie and a comedy. And the comedy is just great. There are a lot of funny lines and Vince Vaughn was incredible as well, should have been in it more. The movie didn't take itself seriously at all and that is definitely a good thing. The wit factor was an unexpected pleasure because so many movies try to be funny and aren't. This had a lot of great one liners.<br/><br/>It also had something else which I must mention because I still laugh thinking about it. It had Pitt singing along to Air Supply's ""Making Love out of nothing at all."" Now bear in mind Pitt is not known as a major comic actor. But this scene was totally and completely hilarious. I am not sure just why I am singling this one scene out but it was the funniest scene I have seen in awhile. Pitt's got a gift for comedy!! Who'd have thunk it? Not me, the way he plays to the camera is really good and of coarse Jolie is great to, when the two of them are on screen together they shine. Good job.<br/><br/>The second thing I liked about it was the action sequences, particularly when Jolie jumps from the window. These action scenes are incredibly filmed and even though I, for the most part, don't like action movies, I got into this. The action sequences were never long enough to get boring(until the end that is-more on that in a minute), and kind of reminded me of ""The Italion Job"" with the way they were able to keep it all interesting and very larger then life.<br/><br/>Now-negatives(and there are some.) The last half hour. It was really dull for two reasons. One is because Pitt and Jolie stop sparring so much and start being chased. A lot. That brings me to the second negative. The action scenes become the focus of the movie rather then Mr and Mrs Smith themselves and that is where the movie loses focus. Had that not been the case, I'd probably give this a 9, because it had a lot of positives. But it became to much of a cliché at the end and lost it's sense of uniqueness which is the main thing it had going for it. Time did not pass quickly either, you always feel the time and it feels like it is way longer then it is. I think there should have been less of all that stuff at the end. I mean here are these two people who have such terrific energy and wit between them and the last part of the movie becomes a mix of a hundred movies we've seen before. I was disappointed with that.<br/><br/>In spite of the flaws, it was a fun and energetic movie, and much better then it could have been. It's worth seeing as long as you don't think to hard about the plot and just enjoy it for what it is, an off the wall action/comedy with two very entertaining leads. Oh and one more thing. This movie is wide open for a sequel and I bet that there will be one. My vote is 8 of 10."
"knere","8","1","5","11 June 2005"," Awesome
","This movie is a welcome relief to the box office as it seems to have the entire audience enthralled with its excellent story line and amazing acting. One could only wonder why everyone has not gone to see this movie. It shall certainly be one of my favorites for a long time. The story is simple, a married couple finds out each other's dirty secret and tries to become the first to kill the other. A few twists in the plots have the audience rolling in the aisles. It was not only the writing but also the way the actors performed that will make this movie such a huge success. Anyone can see this and get a laugh out of it, any type of person will have a good time at this movie."

","I just finished viewing the film and I thought both the acting and writing were very entertaining. I'm not really a Brad Pitt fan but his line delivery, his quirky body movements, and his ability to fire a gun kept my eyes fixated to the screen. Angelina was wonderful as well especially kicking Brad's tail. The fighting scenes between them were a bit hard to see at first, but I had to mentally adjust to the fact that both were assassins and not a scene between a husband and wife. Both, I thought, got even jabs in the fight-maybe that was done intentionally by the director but I thought neither actors showed any weaknesses. The only thing I found disturbing was the lack of acknowledgment for the actor who did the therapist. Its not mentioned in the cast list and its driving me crazy because the voice is so similar but I can't place the face. Does any know who he might be?"
"rogerrub","7","1","5","11 June 2005"," Light fun for a summer's eve, but I've seen it before.
","Everyone compares ""Mr. and Mrs' Smith"" to ""The War of the Roses"", but I think it also has a lot in common with the 1985 film ""Prizzi's Honor"" which is about two Mafia killers (Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner--again) who fall in love and then find out they are assigned to kill each other.<br/><br/>""Mr. & Mrs."" has a lot of humor and a lot of action. Unfortunately, there are many times where the dialog is hard to hear because the characters are whispering or the background noise level is very high (such as in the highway chase scene).<br/><br/>There is also the fact that the movie comes to an end without a resolution to the main driver of the second half of the film. However, who asks for complete logic in a summer movie?<br/><br/>Go and have fun!"
"robertgsmith","9","1","5","11 June 2005"," Good action, funny.
","Angelina and Brad accomplish two tasks here: They break the notion that romantically-linked stars cannot have an accomplished movie that performs well with audiences, and further, they show how far of a step UP each of them have taken from their previous romances. Billy Bob vs. Brad? Ain't happenin'! Angelina vs. Jennifer? Angelina is the single hottest female on the planet, and Jennifer has the ""dumb blond"" with a weird nose thing going on.<br/><br/>As for the movie? The action lulls a little in the beginning, as the movie sets up the final action. Once the action starts full swing though, the movie doesn't let up. The chemistry between Brad and Angelina is great, and the funny parts are really cute, especially to married couples. My wife and I, being a Mr. and Mrs. Smith for real, cracked up and kept nudging one another throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie and will probably rent it for a second viewing when it makes its way to DVD."

","This was an extremely entertaining movie.<br/><br/>The Acting - The chemistry between Brad and Angelina wasn't just sex, in fact it was almost always humor with a little tension. They really pulled off the typical strained/boring marriage life very well. I never thought of Angelina or Brad as comedians but they really were very good.<br/><br/>The Story - The idea I thought was great from the beginning, but I definitely saw potential for this movie sucking. I was happily surprised with how well they used it's potential to the fullest. It was much funnier than I thought it was going to be. The writing was hilarious.<br/><br/>OVERALL:This movie really did have it all. The movie shows in a very funny way what married life can become. Should definitely check it out, it's going to be a top 3 movie of the summer."

","Mr. & Mrs. Smith was simply fun. If you're looking for a serious action movie that takes itself seriously, this isn't it. John and Jane Smith are both charming and the one-liners, quips, puns and jabs come thick and fast. The stunts are well done, the visual effects are seamless. There is plenty of gee whiz technology a la James Bond and Spy Kids. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have just the right on screen spark and Vince Vaughn turns in a comedic performance as John Smith's slightly misogynistic business partner who still lives with this mother.<br/><br/>Grab and bucket of popcorn, settle back and get set to enjoy some pure escapist movie fare. This is summer entertainment at its best."
"~AleXa~","8","1","5","10 June 2005"," Stylish action and classy wit, but still a loose bag of sorts
","******************** <br/><br/>PROLOGUE: I've heard a lot of people say that they either don't want to see this or think it will 'suck' because of the rumors circulating around Brad and Angelina Grown adults saying this. I'm barely out of my teens and I'm not that shallow or judgmental. What business is it of ours what they do with their personal life?? It certainly has nothing to do with the quality of the film, and in an ideal world, should have nothing to do with whether we see it or not. And I'm speaking as someone who considers Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, and Jennifer Aniston as three of her all-time favorite actors/actresses. Rumors are just thatrumors. So open your mind, see the movie, and judge (the film) for yourself. But to each his or her own I'm stepping down from the soap box now. <br/><br/>********************<br/><br/>As much as I wanted to love this movie, I must admit, I came away a *little* disappointed. On the whole, it just felt a little haphazard, but then again, maybe that was intentional. But don't get me wrongit was highly entertaining and a fresh and energized action movieaction mixed with humor makes for some of the best movies, and I don't think I've ever seen one where the two come together as seamlessly as this. I was laughing throughout pretty much the entire movie, even in the midst of the shooting and explosions. <br/><br/>I'm sure I don't have to point out that Angelina and Brad have sizzling chemistry, and it was fun just to watch them interact. Still, the film *did* feel a little loose. The background story on the two opposing agencies was kept vague as well as a few other minor plot points which keeps the film from feeling solid.<br/><br/>Angelina turned in a better performance than Brad, showing us a vulnerable side to her character that convincingly seemed to finally have been stripped away after five or six years of secrecy. Brad did a fine job as well, but I felt more of Jane's turmoil than John's, which arguably is fitting to his character as he tends to be a bit passive. And to that end, I'd like to point out that I thoroughly enjoyed the minor detail of their respective weapons of choice matching their personal styles. Jane, being the more dominant and bold of the two, always has the big oozies and machine guns, whereas John, being more passive and malleable, usually carries your more standard hand guns.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I had with the movie was the open-ended endI think the makers had it in them to come up with another, more conclusive scene that could've given the movie some much-needed tautness.<br/><br/>But these on the whole are only minor discrepanciesthis is without a doubt one of the most entertaining movies I've seen all year. And FYI, this film held up to my second viewing standardsI laughed just as much if not more upon the second time around.<br/><br/>VERDICT: A success in making a refreshing action movie filled with plenty of both explosions and punch lines, but a little lacking in story and direction. Highly recommended to all looking for a wild ride in the midst of recent box office duds.<br/><br/>7.0 out of 10.0 (Original rating)<br/><br/>*** 7.5 out of 10.0 (Rating after 2nd viewing) ***"

Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a perfect movie. The chemistry, the tongue and cheek humor, the sexiness and also the romance behind the aggression is brilliantly portrayed in this film. In fact I don't remember a film of a similar kind being made with such success for a long while now.

I can't remember the last movie that made me laugh that hard - perhaps this is the first one. I haven't ever been interested in commenting on a movie until now, so I guess that says something.

","There are only three things worth watching in this movie: Angelina Jolie, her right boob and her left boob.<br/><br/>Of course, I'm kidding. The film is more entertaining than one would expect, especially from a movie that banks so heavily on the combined star voltage of Jolie and the 'I look much better than I act' Brad Pitt. The action scenes are expectedly explosive and spectacular, and hits the audience relentlessly. The surprisingly element of the film is the dialogue... non-conventionally humorous and bordering on being dark and slightly nonchalant at times. While not every joke hits the mark, this technique is effective in achieving what the director clearly wants to stress on with his 2 superstars: coolness. Everything about the show is made to make the audience go ""woooah.."", from the poses they strike, the pouts they make, the gadgets and weapons they wield and the lines they spout. For me, the comedic chemistry between the leads stands out as the most ""cool"" factor throughout the film. Credit to the stars, especially Jolie (ok, I'm a biased A.J. fan), for sizzling their way through the show with minimal effort. Trust me, you'll understand why Jennifer Aniston (formerly Mrs. Pitt) dumped Brad after you watch the Smiths get it on.<br/><br/>Needless to say, what's there to comment on a plot where the most delicious couple in the world find out that the other half is a top-notch assassin and both are assigned to kill each other? Married for 5 or 6 years without a sniff of a clue of each other's real identity? Some killer instinct I must say. Well, this movie's not about story anyway. So suspend all belief, sit back and enjoy the sexiest couple in the solar system prowl, scowl and make out on the big screen.<br/><br/>Rating: 7.6"

The movie starts with the couple consulting a psychiatrist though you do not see the who the psychiatrist is, for apparent reasons. The movie picks up with action scenes which are really cool. As the trailer suggests Jane and John (the couple) are setup to kill each other. When they learn the truth, the movie takes another turn. The humour is great as are the one-liners. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are as good as ever. With scintillating camera work, captivating score and breath taking action this movie is certainly a roller coaster ride."

If you're looking to spend some time at a theater, this is worth the trip. The only thing I can complain about was the camera. It was often way too focused in situations I thought should've been more clear. It was very jittery and not very colorful. But since the real power comes from the actors and script, I'd say it was still enjoyable. Will it win an Oscar? No. Will it be timeless? No. But was it fun. Yes."

","Upgraded as of 4 August 2008:<br/><br/>Brad Pitt plays Mr. Smith, a professional engineer who is apparently happily married with his wife Jane for 5 (or 6) years and live in a lavish house in a New York suburb. But things are not always what they seem. Both are first-class killers who pull of their jobs and keep them in secret... even from each other. Until the moment comes when the two, who come from rival organisations, end up facing... each other and... they fall into a trap.<br/><br/>Surprusingly good all-star vehicle in which Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt show off their chemistry to the full, which is so close to real life (even though they denied it at first). The two make very good performances and really light up the scene with their witty quarrels and word-trading. Vince Vaughn is a nice addition to the film as he adds more to its saving grace of humour. Doug Liman creates some very good action sequences, without the cliché Matrix-like shots and keeps the movie with the right pace.<br/><br/>However, the film becomes more over-the-top and exaggerated towards the end (where the two Smiths take out an entire elite squad in a supermarket a lá Matrix) and moves on to a corny and abrupt conclusion. Also, the lack of a central villain (or villains, since there has been an alliance between the two companies to pick off the Smiths) cripples the somewhat crude screenplay, all this undermining an otherwise first-rate action-comedy film.<br/><br/>But the movie doesn't hesitate to get started, and the two leads will make this an adequate date film.<br/><br/>**1/2 out of **** stars"

","Mr. and Mrs. Smith Reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com<br/><br/>Rating: 3.5 out of 4<br/><br/>Director: Doug Liman Screenplay: Simon Kinberg Cast: Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Vince Vaughn, Adam Brody MPAA Classification: PG-13 (sequences of violence, intense action, sexual content and brief strong language)<br/><br/>In a Summer season where ninety percent of the films revolve around pretty people shooting and/or having sex with one another, Mr. and Mrs. Smith almost seems like a parody of itself. In fact, that's what impresses me most about the film. It's a shameless pulp action thriller that's so self-referential that it turns itself into a kind of satiric and ridiculous comedy. The plot is a pointedly simple man vs. woman set up, the action is obviously abundant, and the leads are the two sexiest known actors is the world. In fact, I'm impressed that the corporate big wigs down at 20th Century Fox put this film through production. It's so pulpy and shameless in its approach that we can't help but have unbridled, Summer film fun.<br/><br/>The film opens at a marriage counseling office. Mr. and Mrs. Smith (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie) sit in front of a psychologist, awkwardly assuring him their marriage is running along as smoothly as it did five or six years ago (there's confusion as to how long it's actually been). From this little gem of a scene, we follow the couple back to their white collar house in the suburbs outside New York City. The two eat dinner, exchange a few sentences of dialogue, and each read books under the lamplight of their bedside tables, both hiding the fact that they're assassins for hire working under different agencies. Before heading off to a neighborhood party at the Coleman's house across the street, Mrs. Smith runs off to an S&M club to whip a big-time illegal arms dealer into shape. Mr. Smith, on the other hand, goes to play a fatal game of poker with some associates of his firm. Each return home and smile at the other, both wondering how the other gets through the normal workday in a real suburban lifestyle. But this calm ignorance of the other's secret career ends when Mr. and Mrs. are both assigned to the same hit. Identifying each other, their firms each give them 48 hours to eliminate the opposite hit-man. If in 48 hours the opposing agent is still alive, the firm must cut loose the agent of their own. It's just standard procedure. To put it sweetly, this creates marital tension like you've never seen. Domestic abuse has never been so fun. <br/><br/>A film with this sort of set-up (one of shameless formula and potential for car chase sequences) has to be handled by the right director. In someone like Stephen Chow's hands (Shaolin Soccer, Kung Fu Hustle), Mr. and Mrs. Smith would be a slapstick action mess. Contrarily, in someone like David Fincher's hands (Fight Club, Se7eN) the film would take itself too seriously and miss the comedic side of its satire. Somehow, Doug Liman is perfect for the role of director. Coming off of the immensely successful Bourne Identity, Liman gives Mr. and Mrs. Smith a tone of controlled seriousness. The comedy is already embedded in the screenplay, so he thankfully decides to let the actors' natural charisma play it out. And on the action side of things, Liman doesn't over-dramatize the violence or attempt to brutalize his characters with inhuman acts. The action is played out as it was in The Bourne Identity; with controlled seriousness, meaning it's an essential element of the film that simply needs to be played out. There aren't thousands of cuts each lasting a fraction of a second, or too many CGI stunt doubles replacing human actors; Liman takes a back-seat and lets the film work itself out in its own pulp action way. <br/><br/>As much as we'd like to deny it, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are the driving force behind Mr. and Mrs. Smith's PR. Rumors and tabloid gossip aside, the two are no-brainers for their roles. I've come to look forward to all of Pitt's films simply because of his wonderful charismatic style. He rarely changes his approach to the way he plays his characters simply because they all call for charisma, and here it's superbly apparent. On Jolie's side of things, she was made to play the role of a housewife assassin. Liman's said they initially were looking into Nicole Kidman to play the part, but they settled for Jolie. That's right, settled. In my opinion, Jolie is the only option for Mrs. Smith. <br/><br/>Satire is a difficult thing to find in a Summer action film, but Mr. and Mrs. Smith pulls it off flawlessly. There's a great sequence, a car chase sequence actually, that initially comes to mind when talking about the film's satire. The Smith's are running away from seemingly dozens of hired hit men all out for their heads. The bad guys are in BMW's and the Smith's are in nothing less than the Colemans' minivan. Swerving down the highway, the Smith utilize every feature of the minivan to their assassin killing needs. In one part, a baddie jumps into the minivan through a side sliding door only to be thrown out the other side by way of the newly standard second sliding door. ""That comes in handy,"" says Mr. Smith after his quasi-suburban stunt. <br/><br/>Between the wry satire on the suburban life, the blistering action sequences, and Liman's superb direction, I came to find myself having fun. It wasn't any meaningful, Oscar potential experience, but what we sometime lose sight of while at the movies. Simple, unbridled fun. -Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com"

","Summer is finally upon us it seems as blockbuster season is now kicking in. We have had Star Wars and now it's the Brad and Angelina movie. The name of the film escapes me, because this has been referred to as ""That film."" by so many media resources, in and out of the movie industry. The plot, such as it is borrows heavily from True Lies and War Of The Roses and has a bizarre melding of the two. What it does though is include the fun factor of those two excellent pieces of Saturday night fodder. Brad and Angie play a husband and wife, who lead double lives. By day a now bored married couple and at night gallivanting off in varied locations scrubbing out scum for their respective agencies. When out on conflicting missions they find out that the other is in fact also an assassin. Furthermore they are under instruction to kill each other. Now both Mrs and Mr have to face up to the question; do they love the other? Of course the end up trying to kill each other but when they get down to it they realise they love each other, blah-blahdy-blah! Then of course they team up against their organisations who have sold them out. This is essentially an excuse for lots of action and witty banter, and for a Sunday evening after hard days work, it's exactly the sort of undemanding brainless action flick you need. While other action blockbusters can tend to feel soulless and churned out by the Hollywood machine, this film has some class to it, thanks to indie director Doug Liman, who doesn't make this film too Hollywood. It's a fun movie, pure and simple.<br/><br/>As for the cast, well Brad and Angie have great chemistry and that also makes this a grade-up from the usual gun fests. Like Arn and Jamie Lee or Michael and Kathleen, they spark well off each other. Pitt proves himself a capable action man while keeping his everyman likability. Vince Vaughn also pops up in a funny bit part as Pitt's buddy and business associate in the whacking game. The rest of the cast have very little to do to be honest, it's essentially a three man show, and one of that three man team is a woman, the rather gorgeous Angelina Jolie. MY GOD! Jolie is a real walking advertisement for hand cream for the hairy handed adolescent in all of us. She is astonishing beautiful, and I'll tell you what else, she could kick Brad Pitt's butt from here to Bangkok with her hands behind her back, she is an ass kicking machine. This is Angelina's movie, she's a dynamo, a sex goddess, as well as being as good actress of course.<br/><br/>Elsewhere John Powell provides a simple and effective score while the film looks great too. The film is also full to the brim with cracking action. You have gun fights, fist fights, car chase and masses of fiery explosions, the film is pure eye candy on every level. The audience can gorge themselves on carnage while in the separate demographics, the ladies have Pitt to drool over while us guys can sit there transfixed by Jolie. Angelina kept my gaze locked upon her. God knows what Pitt was doing while the two shared the shot because I would have been concentrating on Jolie.<br/><br/>All in all this is a good fun movie, simple, yet exciting. ***1/2"
"OBrienman_88","10","1","7","11 June 2005"," Great!
","Definitely worth your money, the acting was believable and the on screen chemistry was what propelled the film. Pitt and Jolie worked together very well, and the script was well written with few awkward or misplaced moments.<br/><br/>The special effects and camera work were great, but fortunately they didn't get in the way of acting like in some movies (the newer Star Wars for example). The scene in Bogotá was interesting the way the director used movement that was both implied and actual. Parts of the action were cheesy and unbelievable, but hey - its a movie.<br/><br/>The best parts in the movie are by far the opening and ending scene, in the marriage counselor's office, and they were crafted as to tie the whole story together in a way that leaves you satisfied. No asking yourself, ""But why did . . . ?"" or ""So how did they . . . ?"""

","Beware Possible Spoilers.<br/><br/>""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is a great summer popcorn movie. Sexy, top-line actors play out a battle- of-the-sexes-themed black comedy where both sexes just happen to be spies/hit men for shady quasi-governmental intelligence agencies, all the while keeping these identities secret from their suburban neighborsand each other! There are scenes of high-tech surveillance, blazing ""Matrix"" style gunfire, hair-raising aerial escapes high over New York City, a novel twist on the average car chase and long glimpses of boring domestic bliss like dragging the lawnmower back into the shed during a rainstorm. In other words, a little something for everyone.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie play John and Jane Smith, a guardedly happy suburban couple submitting themselves to marriage counseling in the opening scene. After a few years of marriage they're not sure if the fire has gone out between them. So they voluntarily begin to explore their relationship, beginning with how they met<br/><br/>And where the fun begins.<br/><br/>Borrowing from ""True Lies"" but multiplying on its premise, the couple are both secret agents trying to lead public lives as happy suburbanites, eager to be home for dinner every night precisely at seven. They live in a home pulled from the pages of Architectural Digest as decorated by 007's gadget-master Q. In a nod to ""Prizzi's Honor,"" The Smiths discover they must each ""take out"" their spouse. This sets the tone for the rest of the action. A battle of the sexes begins but never gets anywhere near as nasty as in ""The War of The Roses,"" even as the love birds are trying quite hard to kill each other. Along the way, they discover that, perhaps, their mate isn't the enemy after all. But who is?<br/><br/>Pitt and Jolie's chemistry on-screen finally shows us the source of all those tabloid rumors about them. But ignoring the controversy, this movie wouldn't work without the clear and clearly volatile spark between Brad and Angelina. They laugh and love and trade needles and barbs in a rapid clip worthy of Tracy and Hepburn. The script is tight and laced with great jabs thanks to screenwriter Simon Kinberg; and the pacing is kept spy-caper perfect by director Doug Limon. Funny and packed with macho action by both stars, it's derivative of past genre flicks with enough twists and updating to feel modern and new and quite more than satisfying. A good night out, and sure to become one of the summer's critical, box office and  most importantly  audience pleasers. Four bags of buttered and a Coke."

","Freakin amazing! Guns, explosions,car chases, hand to hand combat and its freakin hilarious! The reason I and probably most people go to movies especially in the summer is to be entertained and this movie does that to near perfection. I'm not a big fan of Angelina Jolie but she was great in this movie. Brad Pitt was well. . .Brad Pitt to summarize him into one word. . . COOL. I'll probably end up seeing this one 3 or 4 times. Director Doug Liman who also did The Bourne Identity does an amazing job here everything just works out very well, and I know a lot of people talk about the off-screen stuff between the two leads it doesn't take anything away from the movie, they are great together on screen as well as Vince Vaughn, who as always is quite hilarious.

","We know before going to the theater to watch this action/comedy flick that it's a 100% commercial movie, so we know what to expect. Then why did we go? We went because we are either fans of Brad Pit or Angelina Jolie or even better admirers of both. Then the true question would be did they have chemistry? Yes they did! These two magnificent creatures mingle and mix, attract like magnets and definitely look good together. Unlike Brad's/Julia's collaboration in The Mexican which sucked, this one did not because it's much faster and has no dull moments.<br/><br/>The movie opens with our 2 stars in a marriage counseling office and going back after 5 or 6 years to the day they both meet. Then the movie moves on to their present time where the main events take place. We discover that both of them are assassins working for 2 different competitive unofficial agencies. Their line of work has affected their marriage, the secrets they hide from each other has become burdens on their chests. Suddenly they are separately assigned to the same mark, which led to the exposure of their true line of work, in turn their employers demand that they kill each other to protect the firm. The movie takes us on a wild ride with these 2 cats fighting, kicking, shooting them selves, which takes the shape of a marriage being chopped apart. In the heat of the flame of these fights them reach a point where they know they love each other so much and can't live without each other; they choose to take on the firm together which leads to more explosive scenes. Suddenly you find them back again at counseling and everything is great, which means their marriage is saved. I personally liked the way the director shifted from-to the last two scenes to bare us the usual ending scene of this kind movie, you know the scene when everything become OK and the hero takes his woman in his arms and suddenly you feel a certain strange taste in your mouth, you know what I am talking about.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie but I have to say its lame in terms of story line and precision, the script could have been much better; we needed more sharp sexy lines. Doug Liman directing is OK, he knows the answer is in being fast and moving with the camera in fast motion, like in Go and The Bourn Identity. Vince Vaughn is funny as always. The sound score was not to my expectation I believe they had to put in some great romantic songs and more dynamic techno beats and themes.<br/><br/>6.9/10 <br/><br/>Only admirers of both these perfectly matched stars will enjoy this ride!"

She made the movie with Brad Pitt and I could not see anyone else playing the part of Mrs Smith.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is great too, he has one of the funniest parts in the movie when he finds his wife(Jolie) is an assassin. Tripping on the fence and shooting the windshield made me laugh so much also when they are telling each other their deepest secrets and he says he was married once made me laugh.<br/><br/>They are many similarities between the characters and real life problems or marriage. <br/><br/>A great movie with not only action but a funny comedy with a million laughs. A must-see for this summer!"

","I went to see this movie last night, and let me tell you I was very impressed. I wasn't quite sure what it was about, and I wasn't even sure if I wanted to see it, but I went anyway. I was kind of surprised that it was as good as it was! It had action, comedy, and romance all in one! It was amazing! Brad and Angelina are the perfect people for this movie! <br/><br/>You will especially like it if you like explosions and things of the sort. Also, if you like love stories. It's not your average love story, but it's different and that's what makes it good. And there are some very, very funny parts in it. I laughed quite a few times. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend it. I would go see this movie again in a heartbeat. Even if you aren't big Brad and Angelina fans, I think you'll still enjoy it. Because I'm not too fond of Angelina Jolie, and I was highly impressed. <br/><br/>Well, I hope this urges some of you to go to the movie theater and see this movie! :)"
"pulpfictionman2001-1","10","1","9","11 June 2005"," Excellent - Better than ""True Lies."" A fun ride.
","Director Doug Limon did an excellent job with Simon Kinberg's script. Unlike most action movies where the character's lack depth, this is still a romantic comedy at heart, in spite of all the big budget action sequences and I predict this film will become a classic which continues to thrill audiences for years to come. While normally I abhor sequels I can't wait to see Mr. and Mrs. Smith in action again soon and hope a sequel is already in the works. Brad Pitt and Angela Jolie have an amazing on-screen chemistry that is a joy to watch. Vince Vaughan is hilarious as Eddie (Brad Pitt's hit-man boss) and Adam Brody exudes screen charisma as Benjamin (a young hit-man apprentice). The dance sequences (both beginning and end) between Angela Jolie (Mrs. Smith) and Brad Pitt (Mr. Smith) are a joy to watch and show the contrast between their relationship when things were good before the boredom of marriage set in. The ending reminds me of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and for a fun summer film, director Doug Limon gives us many touching dramatic moments. In my opinion, director Doug Limon's Mr. and Mrs. Smith is on par with Alfred Hitchcock's North By Northwest, which was also able to combine action with comedy."

","""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" expresses a degree of ""realism"" that's been lacking in most Hollywood movies in the last 10, 15 years or so. When I mean that what's taking place on the screen is real, I mean we get a feeling that the chemistry between stars Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie is genuine. Well, if the rumors are true, then the chemistry is indeed, ""real.""<br/><br/>Much has been made in the tabloids in recent months over Brad Pitt's failed marriage to his wife, actress Jennifer Aniston. The rumor mill has centered on the possibility that Pitt's on-screen antics with co-star Jolie were a lot more than just skillful acting. As the rumor mill would have it, things do seem to look the way the media is portraying the stars of this film.<br/><br/>Does this hype it up? Sure. Will it work? Definitely. Will it be a box office smash this weekend? Well, let's just see on Monday. While those who read the gossip pages in US Weekly or The National Inquirer will certainly get their just desserts, others who haven't been bombarded by those star-studded tabloid rags may find a surprising level of ingenuity in ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith.""<br/><br/>Pitt and Jolie star as John and Jane Smith, a happy suburban couple who literally save each other's necks in Bogota, when the military there is on a manhunt for lone tourists over an apparent assassination attempt on an important political figure. They introduce themselves to each other, go dancing, and spend the night in one another's arms before they realize that they're going to be a lot more than just friends.<br/><br/>Much to the dismay of John's friend Eddie (Vince Vaughn), who has more than a slight distrust of women and is living with his mother (the only woman he feels he can trust), they get married. Eddie is another one of those faithful movie buddies, who works with John and Vaughn's role here is a little more than a retread of the character he played in ""Swingers"" (1996).<br/><br/>Five or six years later, they're living in suburbia, where John has taken up a job as a construction worker, while Jane is a happy-go-lucky housewife, always fixing a beautiful dinner for her husband - who has perfect timing - just as he walks in the door from a hard day's work; they eat dinner, right on the money, at 7:00 p.m.<br/><br/>What neither individual is aware of, however, is that they are both highly trained assassins. When they are simultaneously dispatched by their respective handlers to take out a target, this poses a serious problem for the two lovebirds, as they both scramble to find the identity of the rival would-be assailant.<br/><br/>The action is paralleled by John and Jane's attendance of marriage counseling and therapy; an off-screen personality provides them with questions to which they answer, either jokingly or honestly. Well, if you found out that your lover is living a secret life as a hired killer, would you attempt to save your marriage? I honestly can't say.<br/><br/>The way that this is played out eventually culminates to what is arguably the funniest and most amusing scene in the movie, where Jane cooks John a wonderful dinner. John already has a hunch of Jane's intentions, and it's exciting to see them pick up knives, check food for poisons, test each other, and otherwise try to outdo the rival spouse who may or may not be aware that the other is a hired assassin out for their blood.<br/><br/>""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is helmed by Doug Liman, the hip director behind the already mentioned ""Swingers,"" which also co-starred Vince Vaughn, ""Go"" (1999), and attempted mainstream capability with ""The Bourne Identity"" (2002). Here, Liman exercises the comic timing and hip directorial flamboyance he perfected in both of his hit indie flicks.<br/><br/>The stars, Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith, have a chemistry that easily surpasses an otherwise ludicrous plot, which is also the film's biggest weakness. Like any average film, it only serves the purpose of providing big set-pieces, that are somehow or another balanced by the stars' attempts at sorting out the complicated details of a crap marriage. Also, how often do we have films where real-life couples come together on the screen, and the film either flops or is a magnificent triumph at the box office? The release of ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" couldn't have come at a better time for either star, as the rumor mill is simply going bonkers over both of their personal lives.<br/><br/>""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" works best as a screwball satire of idyllic suburban life, not an action flick. Both Pitt and Jolie aren't strangers to action (Pitt's been in ""True Romance"" and ""Spy Game"" - both directed by Tony Scott; Jolie starred as Lara Croft in both ""Tomb Raider"" films). They fill out their action scenes all right, but aren't terrible or full of themselves in their skills.<br/><br/>Well, the tabloids are sure to have a ball with this one, if you haven't already seen the front page stories of their rags. It's a decent effort, if not entirely memorable one. But the tabloids will definitely be this one's biggest ally in helping to rake in the cash over the weekend.<br/><br/>7/10"

They had good on screen chemistry, both when it was supposed to be romantic and when it was them going at it trying to kill one another. It makes sense that the chemistry was so good once the news of affair broke. Poor Jennifer Aniston.... Back to the movie. The action scenes are very well done, they have everything you could ever ask for from an action film. The love scenes are well done too, well lit, and a mix between being hot and romantic. The writing accomplishes what the film wanted to accomplish. And in my opinion that's all you can really ask for. I mean sure the movie could've been better, and I've seen better more entertaining action films with romantic leads. But overall not every movie is gonna knock it out of the ballpark, and truth be told I didn't expect this one to do that. Since I didn't have really high expectations going in, I was overall pretty satisfied. 7/10 for Mr and Mrs Smith."

","Romantic comedies usually not please everyone, much less when disguised as action films like this. The basic idea of ​​this film is a fight between husband and wife, secret agents of rival agencies have to kill each other. The idea is excellent for a film of this genre, but Simon Kinberg's script was not able to develop in a natural and effective way.

About them can be said that they knew not disappoint the audience and were at the height of the characters and the film. They are two extremely talented actors who combine talent to physical beauty, and scenes where both participate, interacting with each other, in a more or less friendly but always passionate way, are worthy of anthology, not only because they can combine and comedy and action but also by showing excellent meshing with one another.<br/><br/>The special visual and sound effects are basically the standard of Hollywood, not the least bit surprised the public. Guns, shooting everywhere, explosions, martial arts, car chases ... in a way, the film looks like a parody of action films, exhibiting comically most of its cliche's.

","They're a lovely couple, aren't they? I'm watching this a couple weeks after Angelina Jolie made major headlines by her decision to divorce Brad Pitt, take the kids and split. I don't follow these celebrity trials and tribulations, but could anyone doubt that would happen someday? It just seems par for the course.<br/><br/>Well this plays out like it might have been a warm-up for the divorce settlement. I have to say, their little marital spat in the movie was handled rather creatively. Set up as bait between rival government agencies to take each other out via the extermination route, John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) Smith display remarkable creativity in choice of tactics and methods. One major gaffe by Johnny though when he missed catching the base charge on the primary cable at Jane's company. Heck, everyone knows that's where you're supposed to look first.<br/><br/>Hey, it's over the top and mindless, but at the same time it's a fun flick if you go for this kind of stuff. I don't know if either star ever looked better on screen, and Vince Vaughn was priceless in his role as the calm and collected buddy of Johnny-boy. I think they could have played down Janey's number of kills though, three hundred and twelve sounded like a bit of a stretch. With a hint of assassination tango, this is the kind of film you can watch and just let your mind wander without too much strain, so go ahead and give it a shot. Figuratively speaking of course."

It is a combination of the storyline, the action and the acting that makes ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" work out so nicely.<br/><br/>The storyline is about married couple John (played by Brad Pitt) and Jane (played by Angelina Jolie) who has been married for 5-6 years. They lead fairly mundane lives together, but individually they are both top trained agents. Things become very complicated for the couple as their respective agencies set them up to kill one another.<br/><br/>""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is very fast paced, and the story does get up into high gear right from the very beginning, and it actually never slows down. And on that account, then you are in for a very enjoyable thrill ride.<br/><br/>The characters in the movie are actually quite nicely detailed and fleshed out on the screen. And they are characters that you instantly take a liking to and that you feel connected to somehow. But a lot of credit does, of course, go to the actors and actresses in the movie, as they really put their heart and spirit into the movie.<br/><br/>What really impressed me in this movie was the action sequences and the amount of action throughout the course of the movie.

","Assassins have been married for years without knowing about each other's secret profession, but things get complicated when they become each other's targets. The story is silly but the potential is there for a delicious black comedy. Unfortunately, the film is let down by a mediocre script that is more concerned with explosions than characters and wit. It gets off to an interesting start, but becomes increasingly preposterous and eventually turns into a routine action film with mindless shootouts and car chases. Pitt and Jolie have great chemistry as the couple with a boring marriage, a pairing that ignited sparks off-screen for the stars."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","1","21 December 2012"," Weak story, fun characters and dashing actors
","I feel that with a better writing this could have been a good film. The basic idea itself isn't all that intelligent in that a movie based on this idea is never going to revolutionize your way of thinking or how you see the world. But it's a fun little idea with a clever premise that could allow for lots of jokes, humour and action. And we do get some of that. There are some really good scenes when the first starts to drop hints about the professions of its two main characters. On the whole I actually like the first half of this film a lot more than I like the second half. The first just has more good scenes, better humour and more character moments where we are introduced to these people. The second half is almost nothing more than one action scene after another. They're good action scenes, mind you, but the strength of a film almost always lies on its characters and its story, and we don't much of either of those during the second half.<br/><br/>Though there are some scenes, where the characters of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie come to grips with what they have learned about each other and those scenes do work, mostly because the chemistry between Pitt and Jolie is that good. It's always nice to see two big stars sharing a film. Dueling Stars these films are called and I usually like them a lot, because these stars usually have such a strong presence, especially mega stars like Pitt and Jolie - they're famous for a reason - and that presence usually translates to great scenes where they do nothing more than interact with each other and it's still enormously entertaining. We have that here in abundance.<br/><br/>On the technical side of things, the visual style of this film looks rather good. I especially like the flashback to the day when the main characters met, with its blazing colours and hot atmosphere. And, as stated, the action scenes are great as well. Nothing groundbreaking, but they're entertaining and feel realistically brutal, although they still add in that necessary touch of ""no way!"" grandeur.<br/><br/>So, is it a good film? Well... no, it's not. It's a bit below average, if I'm being completely honest. Whether you'll like it or not, depends a lot on your taste in movies. If you're looking for good action and humorous storytelling, then you might very well like this just fine. If you demand deep characters and thoughtful pondering, you're out of luck with this film. It's not for everyone, but I was personally entertained by it. If only had it spent more time with its story."

","This seems to be one of those movies that probably should appeal to both sexes, Brad Pitt for the girls and Angelina Jolie for the guys, the action for the guys and the romantic comedy for the girls, however I simply do not feel that the sexes really do work like that. I have noticed on internet dating sites (yes, I do like to explore those sites) that the girls tend to advertise that they like the action movies and the guys tend to point out that they like the rom-coms. I guess that is the idea of attempting to appeal to the opposite sex. As for me, I like good movies, whether they be an action flick or a rom-com, and as for actors, I like good actors, and that is usually defined by the type of movies that they appear in (and to be honest, it is Brad Pitt, being a good actor, that made this movie appealing).<br/><br/>Okay, this is one of those about a couple who are going through the sort of marriage mid-life crisis. They had been married for five or six years and all of the sparkle that initially defined the marriage has vanished leaving us with a couple of people that simply have little small talk when they are at home and simply share a bed (as well as a house). On the outside they seem to be the perfect professional couple living in the perfect neighbourhood, being the envy of those around them, however there is something that they are both keeping from each other, and that is that they are both assassins.<br/><br/>Obviously it is going to get to the point that they will end up discovering each other's secrets, which brings us into the main part of the movie, and that is the two former lovers (who were using each other as cover) end up going for each other, not so much in the marriage breakdown sort of way (though one could argue quite easily that at this point the marriage has broken down, but more on a professional as opposed to an emotional, level). Oh, there is a little twist in the film, which involves some guy known as the Tank (which a little scene at the beginning of the film should give away), and the film pretty much ends with the two of them gunning down a horde of special forces troops determined to kill them (yet there seems to be no real conclusion, with the exception that they have kissed and made up).<br/><br/>I guess the idea that comes out of the movie is how many marriages these days are pretty much between strangers, and while I suspect the makers of this movie aren't trying to create some deep and meaningful movie about marriage, we must consider that many marriages do break down because of this, the passion is gone, and maybe even the kids are gone, and we suddenly realise that the person we thought we had married actually isn't the person we actually married. Maybe the solution, as suggested in this film, is to actually discover who this person really is, and then go on an adventure together. True, they did fight, and fight viciously, but in the end they made up, the passion flared up again, and we discover that in the end, while problems had not necessarily been solved, the life had been injected back into the marriage."
"dave13-1","7","0","3","30 April 2012"," Ignore the outlandish plot device and enjoy the scenery.
","John and Jane Smith are a long married couple who have stopped communicating in any meaningful way. It's not that they hate each other. They make polite small talk but seem more like roommates than a couple. The reason for this is that everything they say to each other is a lie because each is an undercover assassin. Maintaining an innocuous facade to conceal this fact has made them bored and distant. They each learn simultaneously that the other has been assigned to hit them, but instead of checking with THE SPOUSE, each assumes that the marriage was a false front, entered into to keep an eye on the other and gain information. Each decides to test the other instead of actually discussing the situation openly, misunderstandings occur and this leads to an escalating war of words and more than a few bullets. And then there is that staple of the action comedy, the groin kick. Take THAT Brad Pitt... <br/><br/>My take on the central story device was that it was a 're-imagining' of that old chestnut the 'oops-we're-not-really-married' gambit. How many 60s sitcoms used it to kill an episode? Gilligan's Island, The Flintstones, The Dick Van Dyke Show etc. etc. It's a pretty shopworn story device by this point. But, in the wake of movies like Fatal Attraction, and The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, in which a character within or close to the main household turns out to be a threat, likely somebody got the half-clever idea that instead of not being married, the couple should find out that they had no idea to whom it was they were married. In short, let's substitute subversion of legal concepts like 'good faith' and 'informed consent' for the more straightforward device of not legally being married. And laughs and many expended shell casings ensue.<br/><br/>The resulting movie is strictly popcorn fare, built around a central plot device so outlandish as to defy reason, and yet quite entertaining despite this, thanks to imaginative staging of fantastically elaborate action set pieces and tightly choreographed comedy ballets. The technical demands of their roles are surprisingly varied and one has to gain an appreciation for Pitt and Jolie in this regard. They are as attractive as the picture's background scenery, but more than just eye candy. A potential action classic and worth a watch at least once."

Now, in a boring five or six year marriage, John and Jane are going to counseling. Little did this married couple know that they were both assassins hired by two different jobs to kill each other. Their quiet work life was getting between their marriage, causing a rift between them. Every night before John came home from work, Jane had some sort of scheming plan to kill her husband. Jane and John both had secret compartments throughout the house where they kept their guns and plans. One night they two realized they were still in love, but also figured out that they were trying to kill each other. Jane and John got into a brawl, shooting at one another, causing the house to be in shambles. John and Jane succumb to their love for each other after having guns pointed to each other's heads. John laid his gun down, leaving Jane weak and realizing she cannot shoot him either. John and Jane join together to fight for their marriage. The lighting in the film was very important to me. I noticed that any time the Smiths were home, the lighting outside was dark. The darkness outside usually cued for an action scene, where when it was light outside, the scenes were calmer and the Smiths were going on with their daily routine. The darkness showed me that the untrustworthy relationship was being shown and the brighter lighting showed the Smiths succumbing to their love. The angles of the movie all depended on the action scenes. The director made sure to give the audience the possible angle to get the most out of the scene. The audience was able to watch the bullets fly and the wrestling throughout the movie in the most vivid way because of the way the camera was angled during the shooting of the film. When it comes down quoting 'untrustworthy relationships,' I liked one Jane said when she and John were fighting in the house.

","I recently watched the movie, Mr. and Mrs. Smith staring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. I have watched this movie one time before. When I watched it last time I did not watch it for the art of analyzing it, but I watched it as a movie. This time around taking a film studying class, I watched it for the art of analyzing it. When you look at the special effects of this movie, it is a rather intriguing movie. Let's start with the plot of this movie. I feel the plot of the movie was a rather good one. I think it would be hilarious to meet someone new, fall in love, get married rather quickly, and yet, know nothing about them. This is not uncommon this these days In fact this is almost the norm. Both of them being assassins is the comical part. I especially loved it when Jane Smith ( Angelina) called her husband (Brad) local trash or something along them lines, as he urinating on the sand, right before they both tired to take out a convoy carrying a passenger. The lighting, the scene, the backgrounds all made the movie actually seem though as they were in a dessert location, and gave the appeal of what they might actually run into if they were on a job. Vince Vaughn, (Eddie) was supporting cast as the friend to Jon Smith. Vince Vaughn takes whatever role he plays and turns it into a short fused classic character, just a great actor in my opinion. I especially love his crazy character in the movie The Wedding Crashers. The scene where Mr. and Mrs. Smith were fighting in the house and the look of the night, made it that much more fun. When John went back to the house to look for his guns, Mrs. Smith and her team cleaned him out. Typical of what would happen when a spouse of another is offended. They would take revenge and take all of they're stuff. The special effects of the blowing holes in the walls, debris flying through the air, the slowness to it., all made you feel though as you were going to get hit with it. With today's technology I think that this would be an excellent film for 3D rendering. Before as I started in the beginning I watched this movie, just to watch this movie, I did not really care for it at first, when I watched it for the purpose of analyzing the film and its features; it makes it a much better film. I would recommend this movie to any film studies student. I will have to add this movie to my collection very soon."

There was hardly any dull moment in this movie and from beginning to end it was mostly entertaining, even if there is hardly any character development. From what I seen in the trailer, I can say I got what I wanted out of it.

But that is sort of part of the fun.<br/><br/>This is meant to be a romantic comedy action film and it is funny at times, though it didn't make me laugh that much. Angelina's character is more of a tight cow in this film and I actually felt more sympathetic with Brad Pitt's character instead as he actually is more gentlemanlike in this movie.<br/><br/>The plot - well it is pretty thin and it is pretty cliché in my opinion.

They really light up the screen and are really charismatic, but that alone isn't really good enough. I found the film a bit silly, sometimes boring and overall I didn't think it was that funny. But the two stars make it worth the whole way through though they do seem a bit flat in their characters which makes it feel more like they are just there for the motions - but then this movie isn't really about character development.<br/><br/>Also, I didn't really like how they ended it and I won't say anything here, but they could have done a bit more on the relationship between the two at the end and how things changed for them. It didn't satisfy me at all."

","Mr & Mrs Smith is a typical Hollywood summer blockbuster that relies more on the star qualities of its leads than on any attempt at a logical involving storyline or depth of characterisation. Not so much sidestepping as completely ignoring the myriad number of difficulties a pair of married assassins would have concealing their professions from one another, the film quickly establishes that Mr (Brad Pitt) and Mrs (Angelina Jolie) Smith's marriage is submerged deep within the doldrums through one of two straight-to-camera counselling sessions that bookend the tale. Of course, their ignorance of their shared profession is what is killing off their marriage, thus reinforcing the jokey old adage about the family that slays together stays together.<br/><br/>The film's saving grace is that, by placing itself squarely in a world in which the couple work for blatantly ridiculous killing corporations, it refuses to take itself seriously. This is a mix of James Bond gadgetry and Mission Impossible missions, and on this superficial and unchallenging level it works well, and the manner in which the couple are situated within a recognisably normal suburban environment is cute. However, if it's an engaging story or an involving world in which you wish to immerse yourself then you're better off passing this one by. At more than two-hours its way too long, and its tenuous link with reality is broken completely for a final-reel denouement that is as forced as it is farcical."

Much of its appeal is purely superficial: you get to stare at Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt in fabulous costumes, and the shreds of those costumes, for two hours.<br/><br/>It's also funny and smart and stylish.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is terrific. I never really understood his appeal before. I do now. He has a great gift for deadpan comedy.<br/><br/>Can Angelina Jolie act? If she can, she doesn't show it here. But, as everybody knows, men like to look at her, so what else is there to say about Angelina Jolie? (Yes, I would have liked to have seen a woman who is both beautiful and something of an actress, but you can't have everything.) The chemistry between Pitt and Jolie would be obvious to the dead. Jennifer Aniston never had a chance. Pitt and Jolie were fated to be together.<br/><br/>This movie is sort of a pumped-up version of movies like ""His Girl Friday"" in which Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell sparred over work while also working out marital issues common to all couples. Here, of course, the marital issues are worked out through the two leads' careers as high-priced assassins.<br/><br/>It makes no sense at all except as a big, sexy prank. John and Jane compare numbers -- not how many people they slept with before they got married, but how many people they've assassinated.<br/><br/>The ending falls flat, but, other than that, it works."

I give it two points for Ms. Pitt's tits.<br/><br/>Otherwise forget it and watch PRIZZI'S HONOR from 1985, that is a good one (and I bet nobody from the crew or cast of ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" has ever seen that one)."

","The new Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie romantic thriller comedy ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" blends bits and pieces from the 1994 Arnold Schwarzenegger shoot'em up ""True Lies"" and the 1989 Michael Douglas & Kathleen Turner domestic black comedy ""The War of the Roses"" to tell the often amusing but sometimes violent saga about an alienated married couple who try to knock each other off. Director Doug Liman, who helmed ""The Bourne Identity,"" ""Swingers,"" and ""Go,"" doesn't break any new ground with this mindless kiss-kiss/bang-bang potboiler, but he keeps the far-fetched action moving at a fast enough pace that you don't worry about the weaknesses in Simon Kinberg's hopelessly outlandish screenplay. Neither the explosive firefight sequences can compare with Liman's earlier spy thriller ""The Bourne Identity"" nor does the humor rival either of his previous comedies ""Swingers"" and ""Go."" Nevertheless, the sexy on-screen chemistry between Pitt and Jolie as well as Vince Vaughn's hilarious scene-stealing antics as a hit-man who lives with his mom make ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" worth watching once, even when everybody isn't trying to blow more holes in each other than a wedge of Swiss cheese. Incidentally, for the record, aside from its title, Liman's ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" shares nothing in common with Alfred Hitchcock's one and only screwball comedy ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" (1941) that toplined Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery.<br/><br/>""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" opens with Jane (Angelina Jolie of ""Alexander"") and John Smith (Brad Pitt of ""Troy"") seated in separate chairs as they answer a variety of questions from an anonymous, off-screen marriage counselor (voice of William Fichtner of ""The Longest Yard"") about the length of their wedlock, where they met, and how often they have sex. During their martial therapy sessions, Jane and John break the fourth wall. In other words, they address all their responses to us—the audience--as if we were the therapist. You cannot watch these scenes—all action occurs in flashbacks--without thinking about the infamous, off-screen meltdown of Brad Pitt's own marriage to actress Jennifer Aniston. Unless you've lived in a cave for the last year or kept your eyes shut while standing in the check out lanes at Walmart where the tabloids proclaim that Pitt cheated with Jolie, you know what I'm talking about. Director Doug Liman relies on this clever framing gimmick to tell us that neither Jane nor John is happily married. John claims that they have been married for five years, but Jane contradicts him they have been hitched for six years. We learn that our heroes met in Bogotá, Columbia, where they had carried out respective assassinations, then paired up to throw the local constabulary off the scent. The law is out to round up all singles, so our heroes lie and say they are a couple. What difference should it make whether assassins are single or come in pairs is never explained? Furthermore, we learn that they spend more time apart from each other than with each other. Their time together isn't any rosier. They quarrel about the new curtains that Jane has brought for their luxurious home in suburbia. Jane works for a Wall Street firm, while John runs an engineering business with best buddy, wisecracking Eddie (an unshaven Vince Vaughn of ""Swingers""). In reality, Jane and John work for different assassination agencies. She stashes her arsenal of automatic weapons and throwing knives in a compartment inside and beneath the oven, while he hides his hardware underneath the garage. Neither has the faintest notion what the other does, because neither intrudes on each other at their respective workplaces. Eventually, the competing agencies that hire them to make hits accidentally double-book a hit. The target escapes their gun sites, because Jane and John wind up shooting at each other. When our protagonists discover that they have been exchanging shots, they start blasting away at each other in what constitutes the most unusual way to remodel their home.<br/><br/>Absurd as it may seem, scenarist Simon Kinberg penned his exercise in weapons-toting, one-upmanship as part of his thesis for his Masters of Fine Arts degree at Columbia University. Naturally, a squad of uncredited scribes rewrote it for the big-screen, but the problem is that neither Liman nor his writers can make up their minds about what kind of movie that they wanted to make. Some of the action gets pretty brutal for the PG-13 rating, while at other times the gunfights resemble kung fu battles with our outnumbered heroes repulsing literally hundreds of expendable SWAT team clad assassins. If you've seen the trailer for ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith,"" you have already caught a glimpse of the best scenes: the interior redecorating scene between Pitt and Jolie; the desert shoot'em up, and the hell-for-leather chase scene. ""Mr.& Mrs. Smith"" gets off to a slow start as Liman sets up their martial woes, but he never goes very deep into the action itself. Since we know that neither Jane nor John is going to kill each other, suspense takes a back seat. Moreover, we have no villain at which to vent our rage. The one-liners are witty in a James Bond sense. Jane blows up the elevator that she has John trapped in, and he accused her of giving him the shaft. Repeatedly, other characters ridicule their marriage. During the guidance counseling scenes, John describes their life together as "" . . . a huge space filled with everything that we don't say to each other . . ."" When John asks the therapist what he would call that, the therapist crisply replies: ""marriage."" ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" lacks any shred of either sentimentality or narrative depth. Guys should enjoy the over-the-top but unbelievable action scenes, while gals will find Jane's efforts to outsmart John in the kitchen, bedroom, and battlefield comical, too. Without the luminous chemistry of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" would qualify as just another mediocre matrimonial melodrama."

","This film had some terrific fight scenes which I felt were the highlights of what was offered. So, okay, let's get it out in the open. We all know the scandal and press overdone gossip about the two leads. Sort of reminded me of the Eddie Fisher, Debbie Reynolds, Elizabeth Taylor breakup. However, Jolie is no Taylor, believe me. Her looks elude me. Don't quite see it. For certainly Pitt is the looker in this. And I don't like her treatment of her Dad, Jon Voight, who IS a good actor and DOES have a body of work to be proud of. What has Angelina Jolie done on film that is that groundbreaking? I don't find her that pretty. Her lips are compared to a blow fish. Although she does have that evil look to her that makes you want to hiss at her. Brad is a strapping young man and a not bad actor. Some of his work deserves good credits. Namely, THELMA AND LOUISE, VAMPRIES, JOE BLACK and LEGENDS OF THE FALL. In this he plays the part well. You know, I don't see the electricity between he and Jolie at all. In fact their love scenes, and thank heavens there weren't that many, were flat. The women that Jolie had surrounding her, were like a troupe of lesbian agents. I just laughed at that. Anyway, I didn't like this film too much.

","I thought there might be something behind all the hype on this movie. I was terribly wrong.<br/><br/>I have no idea what Brad and Angelina do at home, because the only relationship that I saw click on the screen, oddly enough, was between Vince and Brad. That bouncing camera work (what is up with that?) just added to all those things that made me slightly nauseous when watching this film. Such as the storyline, which was so full of holes, I think someone from the Swiss Cheese Company Sales Department wrote it - as well as the hackneyed script. The only production ""values"" I saw went into that kitchen and tool shed, areas that just added to the potholes in the script.<br/><br/>Speaking of which...I have to point out it's really unlikely that the Mr. & Mrs. never noticed the other's stash of guns, cash, etc. Not to mention odd absences, inability to contact each other while traveling, etc... I mean, I don't cook, but I still trot through the kitchen and pull a few drawers open just for fun, and make my own coffee. And if my husband had hair-trigger reflexes, that would be such a difference from his usual stance of ""beer me"" that you can be sure I would notice. And I expect to be able to contact my husband by land line to mention there's a skunk in the backyard even if he's just out losing money at poker. The plot just didn't stand up to second thought, not to mention real scrutiny.<br/><br/>I didn't even get to see decent costumes - aside from that interesting (and no doubt squeaky) rubber corset, Angelina trotted around in either St. John's Bay or a close replica. There were no secret identity or special costumes to liven things up.<br/><br/>I gather there was supposed to be humor (black? dark? sarcasm? of any kind?) in this movie somewhere. I did see a few lines that were funny every time I saw a commercial for the movie. As usual, those were the ONLY lines I found funny in the entire movie (since I had already heard them 400 times, the hilarious thrill was gone for me). Which is too bad - you can get past a cheesy script or impracticalities if there's enough humour - and this concept had potential.<br/><br/>Sadly, I found Mr. & Mrs. Smith to be a waste of time. The personal lives of the players involved gave the movie far more attention than it deserved. And this trend of having big (paycheck) ""stars"" in bad movies is appalling. At least the old movies with big stars and silly scripts were funny. The fact that there's an audience out there that believes such dreck is actually worth paying to see twice is just pitiful.<br/><br/>I myself, because punishment seemed appropriate one day, agreed to watch this movie on HBO for a second time with an Angelina Jolie fan. He turned it off. What does that tell you?"

"TerminalMadness","5","0","3","20 June 2006"," Mediocre
","One thing I can't begrudge ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" for is its excellent direction. Liman's directing is always visually appealing, he can make dumb films worth watching, for his style alone, and ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is a gorgeous movie with some very good cinematography in its corner. And it's often entertaining to see the action sequences intertwined in the paper thin story. But the film becomes much more interesting once they learn about each other and their professions, it becomes less a retread, and more two highly skilled agents trying to outwit one another and put to test the tactics they've learned, and then it becomes like a video game in which we're watching which one will kill off the other first. With more black comedy this could have been a well done ""Spy vs. Spy"" mimic, but it's just as fun watching them fight and banter back and forth, especially with the excellent choreography. Their fights become a form of sexual foreplay, and repressed sexual energy they've had to keep down over the years, and the introduction of their secret lives are a renewal of their relationship.<br/><br/>About a little under a year ago, a filmmaker named Russell Emanuel sent over a film called ""Girl with Gun"", about a single girl who has to balance her single life, career, and job as a hit man all at the same time. I loved that movie and it was a little under twenty minutes long. That film, an independent film, was fun, light, and breezy and managed to grasp its concept with enough entertaining novelty, that it felt too damn short. With ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"", I didn't get that feeling. And I wanted to enjoy it, I really, really did. But I couldn't. And why? Well, mostly because ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" takes itself much too seriously.<br/><br/>Rather than being a campy rollicking film, it has instead a smug self-awareness about itself. It saunters about throughout the entire film with a self-serving attitude. Yes this is Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, Yes they are having an affair yes they are secret agents. And yes they are too cool for the screen. But, I just couldn't get past the fact that Pitt and Jolie have no chemistry. Together, on-screen, they aren't as believable a couple as they think they are. They have no interesting personality traits, they're boring characters, and they're much too artificial to be bought as a couple whom are in a rut. Pitt is utterly cardboard as the ""sly and cocky"" Mr. Smith, looking awfully bored in his character while Jolie basically instills much of the sensibility from Lara Croft into her performance as Mrs. Smith. Not to mention Vaughn plays Vaughn yet again as the quirky fast talking gigolo.<br/><br/>How many times can he play the same character? The two constantly bat eye brows and exchange glances intending to be aware that they can kill one another at any moment, but the gimmick often becomes rather grating, especially when you consider neither of them are likable, or watchable to begin with. The plot is utterly paper thin comprised of ""chemistry"" between the two actors attempting to out do one another constantly, and you know neither are going to put each other in immediate danger, so the constant action sequences are more annoying than suspenseful. ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is bland, and brutally underwhelming for what I was expecting, and for a retread of ""True Lies"" I expected much more.<br/><br/>I wasn't all mistaken in terms of the quality in ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith""; Doug Liman knows how to direct a damn fine action film with excellent choreography and dazzling direction, while the story takes entertaining twists with its characters, but as a whole it's mediocre with boring performances, and a plot that's often too self-serving to be watchable."

They show how they met in Bogata. Hot! Each gets assigned to the same target. They try to kill each other not knowing the other's identity. The target gets away but they soon discover it was the other that tried to kill them. So the middle of the film is them trying to kill each other. There's an awesome gun and hand fight between the two as they wreck their home. But neither can kill each other. They make up and now got both their agencies after them since their cover is blown.<br/><br/>The last 20 minutes with another gun fight was rather boring, not as good as the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>And Jolie and Pitt are as hot as ever. Brad takes his shirt off several times and looks better then he did 5 years ago.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: One of the better big budget action films that has been released lately.

I couldn't imagine Billy Bob Thornton, Johnny Lee Miller, or Jennifer Shimizu instead of Mr. Pitt; or Jennifer Anniston, Gwenyth Paltrow, or Juliette Lewis instead of Mrs. Jolie. Second, the action is, mostly, exciting. The battle between Mr. and Mrs. Smith in their home is a real kick in the head, while the freeway chase fully shows off the adaptability of an SUV. The only disappointments, in my mind, are the lack of a face for the villains, what about Keith David and Angela Bassett, and the bland use of Vince Vaughn.

","Relationships can be tricky sometimes, as I'm sure you're aware. Take the uncommonly good-looking Mr Pitt, for example. While his relationship with the box office is stronger than ever, his relationship with critical success seems to have turned sour of late. Nowadays, he seems more concerned with being Brad Pitt than being an actual actor and who can blame him – it's not like he needs the money or anything! And that, ultimately, is the problem with this film, which will go down in history as the moment when Brad met Angelina (if these things matter to you at all). It's a shambolic waste of a good idea that runs out of steam before the end and the impressive action scenes are eclipsed by the off-screen antics of its two stars.<br/><br/>Deep in an American suburb, a married couple have run into trouble. John Smith (Brad Pitt) and his wife Jane (Angelina Jolie) have lost the spark after five or six years of marriage and both have kept secrets from the other. Both of them are top assassins working for rival associations and have kept the other in the dark about their true profession. But once they encounter each other on the same job, they both have to face up to a choice that has always been there – do they remain professional and take the other out or can they resolve their differences and save their marriage?<br/><br/>It is certainly different, despite the hackneyed implausibility of it all. It's like watching James Bond being married to one of Charlie's Angels and while it's intriguing, I don't really know if that's enough of an idea to sustain an entire movie. Pitt and Jolie sizzle as only they can and a few comic moments stand out but by and large, this is a really schizophrenic patchwork movie. The first half is pretty dull and the second half quickly descends into a bizarre supermarket-based shootout that doesn't feel as if it fits in somehow. There are good ideas here but they are completely obscured by the presence of Pitt and Jolie, who you never take seriously anyway. Jolie doesn't even look like a housewife, an aspect demonstrated in one scene in particular when she is left holding a baby and has a look of complete disdain on her face (how's that for irony?).<br/><br/>I can't help but feel slightly disappointed, even though the warning signs were there. Plenty of DVDs on the 3-for-£18 shelf and a lack of credible reviews on the back on the box give the game away all too easy. It's not a bad film but it could have been brilliant and perhaps if the 'Brangelina' phenomenon hadn't been spawned behind the cameras, both might have been more focused on making this film much better. Actor couples rarely work on screen (remember ""Gigli"" with 'Bennifer' or ""Days Of Thunder"" with Cruise and Kidman?) and although this isn't the worst of examples, it does highlight what can happen when events off-screen prove more interesting than events on-screen. Only Vince Vaughn impresses in what is little more than a cameo because screen time is restricted due to the overwhelming presence of Pitt & Jolie. Basically, ""Mr & Mrs Smith"" has only limited entertainment value and is not really worth spending your time or money on. Still, you get what you pay for – maybe I need to look harder on the 3-for-£18 shelf next time"

It is fun, fast and pleasant. So, the problem with it. I've never been a huge Jolie-fan.

OK, she is not a disaster i Mr. & Mrs. Smith, but you can feel she is not having any fun.<br/><br/>So the grade only reaches an average, and only because of this insanely overrated (both as an actress and as a beautiful? woman). But in all other departments this is a great film. I would have loved to have seen a more down-to-earth-woman in the role as Jane Smith.

","Here is my 2 cents worth of opinion on Mr. and Mrs. Smith. I felt the need to comment since I sat through the DVD feature, all three commentaries, and the other special features to try and understand why I was left with a mediocre feeling about the movie. I was thinking about giving it a median 5 rating, but increased for Angelina Jolie and great set design work to make LA & Pasadena look like other locations.<br/><br/>There is a lot to like about the movie if you look at the actors, sets, editing, and cinematography. Even though the studio seemed to be making the producers cut costs all along the way based on the commentary, the $110 million budget estimate seems more than adequate.<br/><br/>The weakness seems to be the lack of a great plot, and the producers admit that they decided to focus on the relationship between John and Jane Smith and abandon the original plot points after having about two thirds of the film shot and edited together while waiting on actors to complete other projects. The scenes at the marriage counselor's office seemed to flash ""The Sopranos"" at me even though it seemed like a good idea, most of the other budget cuts and location changes did not seem to degrade the movie at all, but they may have relied on computer (CGI) graphics too much, even with very good editing.<br/><br/>The producers and director were changing and forming their vision for the movie as it was being shot, I think that made it difficult for the actors to know what their ultimate result was supposed to be. The level ranged between serious assassination & action fight scenes to silly comedic style scenes resulting in a cartoonish feeling even though I thought the visual aspect of the movie was very good.<br/><br/>My first thought about this movie was how will they be able to even pull off this difficult plot in any way that is believable and novel, and I felt they did it in the relationship scenes at their home better than the rest. I would have guessed the opposite. The only way I can see dealing with the plot better would have been to create something more like old TV ""Avengers"" staying with a less violent Steed and Mrs. Peel tongue in cheek relationship the whole way."

","The movie's mostly a romantic comedy with some action thrown in. Director Doug Liman (""The Bourne Identity"") gives fresh direction to what could have been a run-of-the-mill flick.<br/><br/>This movie is the perfect popcorn movie. Regardless of their relationship off-screen, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie do have chemistry in their roles as John and Jane Smith, a pair of assassins who are clueless about the true identity of their perspective spouse. Over the years, their relationship has gotten cold and distant, since they're not really allowed to share their lives with their partners. Doug Liman, as he did in The Bourne Identity, really knows how to direct action scenes; the fights are well-choreographed, as well.

","Only in retrospect can we see how, and why, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have become a couple in their personal life. However, the chemistry and electricity between them must have been obvious on-set, too, as it certainly comes through in the film.<br/><br/>The device of the to-camera marriage counseling sessions (from the point-of-view of the counselor, presumably behind a desk) allows several revelatory occasions that help to tie the movie's time-line together.<br/><br/>The emergence of the Smiths as coolly efficient killers is brought out by degrees. Once established as a 'fact', the killings then multiply.<br/><br/>SPOILER: The scene where the good/bad guys come for them, dressed in black (with an appearance like Ninjas), and are obviously defeated, is in the end a gratuitous scene of carnage. This scene is reminiscent of the ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" shoot-out scene, complete with the dressing for the occasion, but the body-armor saves the scene from becoming a remake."

Though Angelina Jolie is dominated by Pitt's presence in the film, she is nearly able to hold her own.

It's a marriage movie. The violence, the lethality, and the misdirected aggression are all deliberately ironic: They're symbolic of things that most married couples, including most happy ones, actually feel from time to time.<br/><br/>If you watch this film is a straight action pic, it's still perfectly entertaining. Pitt and Jolie come across as both romantic and sympathetic, which is impressive given the nature of their characters.<br/><br/>But if you (the watcher) are married, and particularly if you're approaching about 7 years in that blissful state, then you are one of the people for whom this movie was made. Watch it together with your ball-and-chain, or, if you prefer, ""the one you love.""

This is what makes the whole over-the-top absurdity work -- all of their interaction occurs in a cinematic stratosphere. Much like their real lives; their current state of white-hot celebrity has them flying through a higher plane of existence.<br/><br/>The entire movie is their mutual wink at the audience -- ""look at us and how much fun this is!"" Pitt confesses that he was married once before (nudge, nudge), and Jolie snippily demands the ex's name and social security number. <br/><br/>This was all a good deal more sophisticated than it was advertised. We know we're in for something special when we learn that home base is that stunning Colonial revival house. It serves as both setting and a way of narratively tying the first two acts together -- that of a metaphor for the civilized veneer of their five (""Six!"") years of marriage, and for rekindling their passion when they 'remodel' it into the war zone where they first 'caught fire' together. <br/><br/>The movie is a clever exploitation of the couple-of-the-moment phenomenon, far better than most of these things turn out."

You won't find a 'True Lies' or a 'The Mexican'. Nothing more than straight, mindless entertainment. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, although worked well together, there wasn't much chemistry between the two of them, which some might find ironic since they did end up having an affair together behind the scenes of shooting this production (no pun intended.). After six years of marriage in the movie, their relationship seemed like they'd been dating for less than a year. They didn't seem very comfortable with each other, and that made for a bad connection between the two of them.<br/><br/>I will admit though, I was impressed with the cinematography, the wardrobe, locations, and direction. The whole movie was enjoyable to watch, but nothing more again, than something easy to kick back with where you really don't have to think much. There are no twists, nothing that you're not going to figure out within the first ten minutes of the movie, and no big surprises by the end of it.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt was pretty to watch, and surprisingly really funny too, at times. Angelina Jolie stole most of the scenes with her beauty and amazing figure, and it was hard to keep your eyes off of her most of the time, which I'm sure were the intentions of the director and costume designer for Ms. Jolie.<br/><br/>If pressed, though, it was a good movie and I liked it well enough to watch it again someday.

","Having earned his action-adventure spurs helming 'The Bourne Identity', and it's serving as Producer on it's sequel, the excellent 'The Bourne Supremacy', it's no surprise that Doug Liman should deliver a focused, energetic product in 'Mr & Mrs Smith'. Like the Hitchcock flick from which it borrows it's title (and the names of a fair number of supporting characters  'though somehow I don't think this is supposed to be a remake of Hitch's only screwball comedy), this is a vehicle which eschews the dark side, and establishes itself as a romantic-comedy early on. It lacks the pitch-black comedy of it's nearest cinematic relation, John Houston's 'Prizzi's Honour', or the emotional subtlety of George Armitage's 'Grosse Point Blank', but it's an engaging-enough romp for all that. Mind you, the words are by Simon Kinberg  previously a script-doctor on such stellar catastrophes as 'Elektra' and 'Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle'  so a lack of subtlety is hardly a great surprise. <br/><br/>The plot is a no-brainer. A bored young couple discover that they are assassins working for rival agencies when each is assigned the task of killing the other. In their increasingly manic attempts to off each other they discover the true love lurking beneath the lies. Hmmm. 'True Lies' and 'War of the Roses' join the crib-sheet. That much is in the trailer. There's really little new, here: this is almost an anti-Bourne, the characters are amoral and mercenary and the action is provided in a succession of gleefully destructive set pieces, rather than arising out of plot-driven necessity. That said, the Smith's boredom when placed amongst their suburban neighbours (killers are not social animals), and the final scenes  in which that great shrine of American consumerism, the Department Store, is decimated by the newly reconciled spouses  could be read as a critique (of sorts) of the trappings of domestic 'bliss'. <br/><br/>It's a star-vehicle, and one which delivers exactly what we expect. Brad Pitt wears a lot of smart-but-casual gear, takes his shirt off regularly, and pouts in a manner likely to please many a young lady in the audience. For the boys, Angelina Jolie is back in Lara Croft mode, strutting her stylishly sexy stuff in Prada and PVC. She also pouts a great deal. Poor Brad's pales in comparison. Much the better actor of the pair, and possessed of rather more natural screen-presence than Pitt, it's notable that she's given rather less screen-time, but there is a chemistry between the leads, and neither Liman allows neither to dominate the movie in it's totality. They work very well together.<br/><br/>It's not a bad movie, and it has some genuinely funny moments. I liked it far more than I thought I would. Given Liman's track-record, though, it's a slight shame that the opportunity wasn't taken to make a more satiric film."

","John Smith (Brad Pitt) is an assassin for hire. Jane Smith (Angelina Jolie) is, too. They work for different companies, and neither one knows the other's true occupation. Until they're hired to kill each other. *cue suspense music*<br/><br/>Thanks to the excellent chemistry between Pitt and Jolie and some riveting action scenes, the movie manages to lift itself above most others in the genre. That is to say, it's not just another dumb shoot-em-up, although not as brainy as, for example, The Bourne Identity. The mutual discovery that their spouse is a hit man doesn't occur until a good half hour into the film, but once it does, you're treated to a series of fast-paced scenes in the tradition of The War of the Roses, including a decimation of the couple's home. The trouble is that I can't give you too much of the plot without telling you the twists, because there aren't that many to begin with. But as long as you concentrate on the combined hotness of the starring duo - so smoldering that sparks flew off-set as well - you'll be fine. Don't let the story distract you!<br/><br/>Doug Liman, who gave us such instant classics as Swingers, Go, and The Bourne Identity, keeps things moving pretty quickly, although a peek at the goofs page on IMDb will show that enough errors were made to make one question the editing. Still, the action scenes pack quite a wallop, particularly the close hand-to-hand combat between the Smiths in their house. <br/><br/>The story varies for the most part from implausible to improbable, as is often the case with action films. But Pitt and Jolie both look right for their respective parts, including handling firearms and other weapons. What impressed me is that neither character seemed particularly moralistic about their line of work. For example, no ""oh, we kill only bad guys!"" junk - they kill whomever, whenever, wherever. Particularly amusing is the scene in which they reveal to each other how many kills they've had.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn is on hand as Eddie, who works with John, and even though his role is very small, he manages to walk off with every scene he's in. That's because Jolie and Pitt wisely underplay their roles, leaving the fireworks to take center stage. Oh, and their obvious good looks, too."

","Mr. and Mrs Smith- how many ways can you spell b-o-r-i-n-g? This movie has one major flaw. It should have been made ""R"" instead of ""PG-13"". Why they watered it down, I'll never understand. By the movie poster (yes, I fell for the poster like millions of other American males) I thought the movie would be sexy, sophisticated and sublime, perhaps in the line of Bourne Identity or James Bond. Instead it was watered, bland, and silly. I don't want to see Pitt and Jolie in comedy, OK? I want lust, bullets, action. I liked both of them in other movies and thought their pairing would be dynamite. Alas, it was like weak tea. And why do movies where the co-stars fall in love with one another tend to fail?

","Mouth-to-mouth advertising for this movie was full of prejudice also (see: ""National Treasure"") but in this case it's badly justified. The movie as a whole is unbalanced between action & comedy, but there are enjoyable bits nevertheless, so let's move on to the G-B-U section, shall we !<br/><br/>THE GOOD <br/><br/>The initial spoof of two professional assassins united in a phony marriage whilst unaware of each others hidden life naturally makes for (has to make for?) most funny moments, p. ex. after Jolie finishes off her target in the midst of an SM game, she joins the neighbour's welcome party while still wearing her kinky stockings - The first scene is also pretty amusing in its obscurity but most of the punch comes in retrospect - Some of the confessions swapped between the Smiths have some comedy value, especially with beacon Tank as a non-understanding witness - Jolie studying camera images of her mysterious opponent taking a leak in the desert.<br/><br/>The T&A department is exceptionally well covered thanks to Angelina Jolie handling guns dressed only in nice outfits such as undies & a male shirt. I'm told Pitt hasn't lost his appeal yet, but his haircut was horrible anyway. <br/><br/>THE BAD <br/><br/>Most action scenes. Played straightforward they could've saviored a ""Mission Impossible"" flavour, but all the shooting is mixed so heavily with tongue-in-cheek one-liners & marital arguing that nothing sticks. - The elimination story may be fairly logical but the hunters from both secret agencies out for the Smiths are far from memorable also. <br/><br/>THE UGLY <br/><br/>The 'sex' between Pitt & Jolie. Long live the R-rated movies, at least they know how to make use of attractive leads. - Jolie handling guns isn't really ugly but still Jolie handling guns in a good action scene would've been better. See how a right & a wrong don't always make a right? - Tank. He would've made for a good sidekick or saviour at some point. - the couple fight in the house. We're used to überphysics when it comes to the toughness of human tissue in relation to wall bashing & glass diving but I felt this scene overdid it. - the escape route from Jolie's agency. How subtle is breaking out of the top of the Chrysler building by rocket-powered cables?<br/><br/>To summarize; this is an action-comedy with cute leads, good comedy & bad action, so try to watch it as a comedy. The experience will be better."

","I rented this today, a lonely and rainy day, which I just had to satisfy my curiosity. I refuse to go into any depth about the plot, story or premise whatever. But this just focuses more on the popularity of Jolie and Pitt. And , because it had great success at the box office is largely due to the fact that their budding relationship was the advent of this stylized action yarn. Of course, there is loads of action, gun fire, fancy arsenal contraptions, explosions, daredevil stunts, etc. etc. There is even some quick and smart dialog in the interim, but many of the lines get dropped. As if Jolie and Pitt were more interested in looking cool. It also seemed very long for only 120 minutes. I must have walked up to the kitchen 7 or 8 times and placed the machine on pause. That is not a good sign for suspense seekers. This movie will only be remembered as the one that hooked up the stars in real life and destroyed Pitt and Aniston's marriage. This film is narcissistic bilge."

","I found this movie quite similar to the Jack Nicholson Kathleen Turner film ""prizzi's Honor"" back in 1985. I found the plot this time to be a bit predictable. and as such, the action was OK but the plot was really a snoozer. It was a bit funny though to see a couple of hit persons at a marriage counselor. The only difference here was that the two were to hit the same person and both got in each others way. As a result, each had to go after the person who spoiled the hit, and naturally it was each other. In Prizzi's Honor, Nicholson throws over a mafia don's daughter and hooks up with Turner. of course they are ordered to hit each other but Prizzi's Honor comes off like a black comedy."

When the main characters find out about each other's hidden life they're way into their marriage, and I found it incredible that it took such a long time to realize only because they were placed one against the other to mutually eliminate. It would have been fun to have a closer look to their early marriage years, with the various ups and downs and an intimate look at how their violent jobs started setting the couple apart - and only then turn the story into an action movie. There doesn't seem to be a way for U.S. producers to tell a story in a more innovative way, and given the incredible screen presence of Pitt and Jolie it would have been a wonderful acting opportunity as well."
"The_Void","6","0","2","12 December 2005"," Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in a movie together.
","All I wanted from this film was an action-packed parody on married life - but alas, it didn't deliver. Simply put, the film is too cool - and every action therefore comes off as being very unrealistic, and this is more a parody of fluffy romantic comedies than married life. Despite his impressive role in Troy, I've been rather unimpressed with Brad Pitt lately. He seems far too keen to wallow in his celebrity, and his role here; along with the one in the terrible Oceans Twelve last year, shows that all too clearly. His co-star, Angelina Jolie is another who is more bothered about her star status than putting in a good performance. Both Pitt and Jolie are clearly in this film for the money, and the fact that it will be liked by all the casual cinema-goers; and it's rather annoying really, especially as the idea that either of these two could kill someone  let alone be professional assassins, is ridiculous. The camera caresses them both - and all we get therefore is Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in a movie together, not a movie with characters being played by Pitt and Jolie. The excuse for Pitt and Jolie being in a movie together is that a married man, who is secretly an assassin, finds out that his wife is one too. Oh dear.<br/><br/>The star power of the leads is what attracts most people to this movie, but for me it was always the action. To be honest, if the film could have gotten this right, I would have been willing to forgive most other mistakes. The action isn't all that great really, but the way it's fused with the idea that the two people who are trying to kill each other, don't really want to kill each other - is actually well done, and you can believe it in spite of the characters being non-existent. The film also does a good job of setting itself plainly in suburbia, and the way that the neighbours poke their nose into the central couple's business; while the two of them pretend to be just the norm in suburbia provides the film with most of it's laughs. Vince Vaughn appears too, but is lost under the central duo's ""star power"", and is never given a chance to shine because of this. Overall, I would say that this film is good enough to provide entertainment - but it's not all that good. All of it's good points come in spite of the leads, not because of them; and I for one think that this plot line is capable of springing a much better film than this one. Perhaps next time (i.e. in thirty years time when this film will be ripe for a remake) they could cast a couple of actors that are right for the parts, rather than being right for the box office."

","Maybe I am not a ""REAL MAN"" but I don't automatically run for the action aisle every time it's movie night for me and my girlfriend. Don't get me wrong, I don't care for what we'd typically call ""chick flicks"" either. So While I was searching DVD's for something to watch with my girl, I took a chance on this and put aside Batman Begins (for now) and Sisterhood of the travelling Pants (forever!) As it turned out, she and I really enjoyed ourselves with this flick. Granted, it is no cinematic masterpiece, but for an action flick it has some really endearing qualities. It plays on the premise that no couple really knows their significant other on the deepest levels as apparent by the opening marriage counselling sequences, but the film takes it a step further and asks ""just how much do you want to know?"" The plot is not new, the ending is somewhat predictable and the action sequences are a tad far fetched. But we are an imaginative species are we not? We can allow ourselves to suspend disbelief for just 90 minutes, no? When you do that, you find a film that has a lot of good laughs, a clever twist, some ultimately gratifying destruction sequences and two of the best eye-candy actors out there. Brad and Angelina are as captivating to watch here as they are on the supermarket tabloids.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn gets some of the best comedic parts as John Smith's high strung, over-analyzing partner. The scenes where he is trying to console his friend are classic and worthy of a sequel if only to reprise and further develop this character.<br/><br/>All in all it's campy and silly, but the gunfights, explosions and general mayhem make it for a fun evening in, with almost anyone you choose to watch it with."
"TxMike","Null","0","1","9 December 2005"," We were mostly disappointed.
","We like Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. I can't think of one movie either of them made where I was disappointed with either of their performances. I was not disappointed here, in either performance. However, the movie as a whole was a disappointment. It was directed in a style that emphasized elaborate fights, with lots of gunfire and lots of people getting killed. It also emphasized elaborate vehicle chase scenes that defied all sense of plausibility. Not that any of the plot is plausible, but for my tastes more wise trickery and less brute force would have been 'more' in the long run. A wasted opportunity.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is John Smith and Angelina Jolie is Jane Smith, surely not their real names. Because they are both professional assassins. But each hides their true profession from the other. The movie starts with them in counseling because, it seems, they think their marriage is getting stale. Yet, they both rate it 8 of 10, which is better than most couples can claim. We see a brief flashback to 5 or 6 years earlier, and how they met quite by coincidence in Bogata, fell madly in lust, and have been married ever since.<br/><br/>So, the story is really about their relationship, and how they will rejuvenate their marriage. But nothing simple happens along the way and, since both a professional assassins, we wonder if they will end up killing themselves. A fine movie to examine the 'chemistry' between Pitt and Jolie, who now appear to be an unofficial couple in real life, but for me not a very satisfying movie overall. (Vince Vaughn plays John's associate, Eddie, and now in real life Vaughn appears to be attached to Pitt's real life 'ex', Jennifer Anniston!!) <br/><br/>SPOILERS. Things heat up when both John and Jane are sent secretly to a remote location near the Mexican border to intercept someone, but in reality are sent so that they can inadvertently take each other out. Turns out they are working for rival assassin groups and having them married is not good for business. That sets their pursuits in motion, several fights and chase scenes, in the end John and Jane prevail over all the others, none of the bullets hit them in the arms, legs, or head, only in their bullet-proof vests, by surviving they make their relationship stronger, and we last see them in the therapist's office, happier than ever before!"

First of all, it is a flick both men and women could enjoy. There is a lot of action with violent shoot outs, but it also has a hidden love story in between.<br/><br/>Second the acting is great. Jolie and Pitt played these parts very well. There is definite chemistry between the two in this movie (gee I wonder why.) Unfortunately, they alone could not pull this film together.<br/><br/>Finally the last bit of entertainment is found in two words, Vince Vaughn. Eddie (Vaughn), John Smith's partner was a riot without even trying. He definitely adds to the likability of this movie and should have been given more air time.<br/><br/>What was not so great about this film is the long running time of 120 minutes. There could have been a lot more editing to not make this movie drag on like it does.<br/><br/>In addition, towards the end, there is just too much that is unbelievable. Really, is no one going to notice a swat team and bombs going off at their local home store?

However, the charm and likableness of Brad and Angelina make it more enjoyable than 'I Love Lucy.'<br/><br/>The reviews of this movie which I have read failed to mention the film's subtext, which in essence is: 'It's okay for the government to assassinate people because the victims of political assassination are the worst sort of people and deserve to be killed and these killings don't really affect ordinary people.' <br/><br/>I remember where I was when John F. Kennedy was murdered and I remember how it made me feel. The official story was that the President was killed by a lone assassin. Similarly when his brother who was killed a few years later. Likewise when Martin Luther King was murdered the same year. Whoever was ultimately responsible, the victims of politically motivated assassinations are not necessarily the worst sort of people. I feel that certain individuals who have a lot of influence with the movie industry are attempting to make political assassinations, at least political assassinations which may be sponsored by the U.S. Government, more palatable to the American people and thus easier to carry out.

","2005 hasn't exactly been the best year for movies. I really can't think when there has been such a lull in Hollywood. OK Mrs and Mrs Smith hasn't really set the world of movies on fire, but on the flip side it has its moments.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie, Mrs and Mrs Smith live comfortably in their suburban paradise. All isn't well in Pleasantville, when they suspect each other of conducting extramarital affairs. Neither Mrs and Mrs Smith realise that they work for secret organisations. From there, the jealousy could either kill them or enhance their marriage.<br/><br/>The performance of Joile was like her looks totally flawless. Brad Pitt wasn't that bad. In the back of my mind, this movie would have been better scripted for Catherine Zeta Jones and George Clooney.<br/><br/>Mrs and Smith has a refined look, and it was well choreographed, especially the scene in the home hardware store. To a certain extent the movie is predictable, but on the other hand it has some twists and turns. I would have to watch the movie again to give it an educated opinion. I really don't know if it was the casting or the script which caused the downfall of the movie. On the whole, Mrs and Mrs Smith is a relatively decent movie, but I felt there was some room for improvement."

","Okay, so the plot is paper thin - there is virtually nothing in this movie that isn't covered by the basic ""married couple who both find that the other is a hit man/woman"" one line summary. Certainly if you watch the trailer, you will know pretty much the entire plot.<br/><br/>For a comedy, it's not all that funny. So much time is given over to action scenes that there isn't all that much time for jokes. But what comedy there is works well. Brad Pitt especially shows himself as a good comic actor, and Angelina is no slouch either.<br/><br/>There's bags and bags of people and things getting shot and blowing up, which is entertaining enough in an over the top kind of way.<br/><br/>What puts it over the top from just another comedy/action movie to a pretty good comedy/action movie is the presence of Angelina Jolie, who is absolutely the most beautiful woman alive."

","I have seen the movie this afternoon. Well, the story is completely flat. Ms. Jolie looks great although her siliconed lips..... There was missing a sentence like ""this movie is sponsored by at least Tissot, Panasonic and Johnny Walker"". Scenes like the cool shooting at the end have already been shown in The Matrix as well as the stunt drives on the highway. At least the police could show up sometimes to make it look realistic. It was not even at the level of Mission Impossible, from where the initial scene where Angelina climbs up the mountain was taken. Well, Tom Cruise did it before and the music was better. And of course Angelina sleeps with big ear rings and wakes up after a night of sex with a perfect make-up and perfect hairs. And how pathetic the whole marriage morale..... I found it also completely useless to tell that they had sex 10 times during the last week. Did this change anything or add something to the film? It was not even 2 hours of complete switching off watching a movie like James Bond, where you know that Mr. Bond always jumps out of a submarine at 200 meters depht and steps on a boat perfectly dry in his smoking with a bottle of champagne. It was a movie that pretended to be but wasn't. Probably people go watching it cause of Ms. Jolie and Mr. Pitt. Well they could have done something more in line with their careers, especially Mr.Pitt who did some really appreciable works."

Example - Scene One - Day - I'm sorry but if you meet your husband/wife the way they did, you won't need more than two braincells to figure out that something's up with them too -- Result -- entire premise destroyed. I'm surprised that test audiences didn't catch this. The acting was equally as weak. If Brad Pitt can't dance he shouldn't do a dance scene (note to the filmmakers, the solution to getting a hot dance scene is not by switching off the lights (!?) but by hiring an actor that can dance)..

As it is, when watching an action adventure film, you must slide into that state of mind. Taking a film like this seriously would only result in a travesty. In my opinion if the makers, writers and producers intended to make a family feature which you could sit through with a smile they succeeded.<br/><br/>First of all i did enjoy the cast. Each character was believable as who they were meant to be. I know that sounds strange placing Pitt and Jolie as agents; but it worked for entertainment purposes. Their was chemistry between them, and it seemed they enjoyed being on screen together. And that always helps between two leading stars.<br/><br/>Some scenes may have pushed it a little far. For example when they are fighting, it spirals a little out of control but still maintains the fun element with going too far. The action scenes are nice and balanced, and in the end it becomes what it was meant to be; An action film, which offers excitement, thrills, and a rich plot to keep an audience entertained for a little under two hours.<br/><br/>All in all, a fun film that kept me occupied.<br/><br/>78/100"

From the very opening credits you are drawn into the world of this movie.<br/><br/>Two secret agents who are married to each other, but don't realize that their spouse is a secret agent was just a genius script.

Then they find out and try to kill each other. The fight scenes are amusing and have a 'War of the Roses' vibe to them, but spinning plates are replaced with Uzi's and ak47's. Most of the film is totally over the top and pretty much unconvincing but it is good at getting its job done, which is providing a vechile for both stars to headline a major movie, and to provide an hour and 45 minutes for the viewer to get away from their everyday life and be in this fantasy world where if you had Angelina's hand bag you too could jump off a skyscraper without any safety devices and land completely safe with no one seeing you even though there is thousands of people around you... which is daft"

They do have a lot of screen chemistry so I was tempted to see more. They meet in Bogata, have a tequila drenched steamy affair (yes I am convinced I saw steam!) and then decide to marry. So far, so good. Then somehow they manage to keep the fact that they are both undercover operatives from each other for the next 6 years. That certainly suggests it's just a ""physical"" relationship, doesn't it? I think it is a good paring, they have something going for them and perhaps it was the off screen stuff that was translating so well on screen, but half way through the action scenes and thin dialog I was thinking....""I'm done - I want a divorce."""

","So, imagine you're Doug Liman. You've made some enjoyable smaller movies (Swingers, Go) And your first venture into the blockbuster zone was a welcome relief that already spawned an even better sequel (The Bourne Identity/Supremacy) So then, what is your logical next step? Well, considering that you've proved your bank-ability to the people in Hollywood, you can now have loads of fun with other people's money, and make pretty much any movie you damn well please. And that's exactly what Dougie did!<br/><br/>Two elite assassins, working for separate employers are married to each other without having a clue about their better half's secret life. When their next mission blows both their covers, they have to decide whether to kill each other, or team up against a mutual enemy.<br/><br/>It's a simple storyline, perfect popcorn movie fodder. Mr and Mrs Smith delivers exactly what the audience expects. Now even tough that is a plus, it's also a slight downside ... you KNOW what's coming, so that's half the fun gone. It's only originality lies in the exquisite way it feeds off of Pitt and Jolie's star power. It's a joy to see them on screen together delivering one-liner after one-liner in a ""plot"" that grows more and more ridiculous towards the end. And on a technical note: the editing seems rushed and unfinished. Maybe Liman has a whole bunch of deleted scenes he's keeping for the DVD release.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it very much, but where ""Bourne"" sticks to the retina for a couple of days, this one is too volatile and dissolves from the mind too quickly. But if you're like 90% of the world's population, and can't get enough of a well made Hollywood flick then this is without a doubt your thing."

The action was fun and that was the key to the movie. It was fun. It was a spoof. I want to see it again because it moved so quickly that I missed some of the dialogue. Unlike other pairings, Helen Hunt and Mel Gibson come to mind. Jolie and Pitt spark like Hepburn and Grant in the Philidephia Story. Or Bogart and Bergman in Casablanca.

Starting rather slow for an action film, it progressed into something magnificent. With points of laughter that my father generally helped me realize was there and action sequences that had me on the edge of my seat i couldn't help but realize that the film was better then what i had expected it to be. Brad Pitts portrayal of John Smith was very well done. Using his charm often seen in many of his films he would have put any dean Martin impersonator in his place. The thing i noticed about him that bothered me a bit though was that this seemed like his usual role. The suave mans man that has the hot woman grabbing at his ankles when something was going of balance. Still better then some films i have seen him in. Jolies' acting as Mrs. Smith was actually the best acting i think i have ever seen her in this includes Hackers and in fact way better then any Larra Croft movie. She still let on that seductive look and had her crazy beautiful look to her but she also led on that i'm going to beat you down into the ground wit. The training in this film must have been brutal not only for the actors but for the director as well.

","My date picked this movie. When we left the theater I said to her, ""from now on I'll pick the movies."" She said, ""that's probably a good idea.""<br/><br/>Mr. & Mrs. Smith was supposed to be a campy, action packed, big-star studded War of The Roses on steroids sort of film. I guess it was a lot of those things. It just didn't work. It was campy, but in a disingenuous sort of way because Jolie and Pitt come across as if they are really just playing themselves, giving us a wink and nod that this is a movie made primarily so we can get a good look at them. It was action packed, but in an absurd sort of way. It had big stars, but the bigger the star does not mean the better the actor. And it was sort of like the War of The Roses on steroids, but Brad and Angelina are not Michael and Kathleen. This script was amateur compared with Roses, and the plot was just too flimsy.<br/><br/>Usually a weak script and plot are enough for me to dislike about a movie, but my least favorite thing about M&M Smith is that entirety is so strongly anchored to the looks of Pitt and Jolie. OKAY, WE GET IT, THEY ARE GOOD LOOKING, but this is not porn, and movies can't get by on looks alone.<br/><br/>Off the screen Pitt does seem like a nice guy who is humble and means well, and that's worthy of respect. And he is handsome, pretty...insert whatever good looking adjective you like. But he is a mediocre actor. I have yet to see him take on a role that called for substantial acting talent. He is safe relying on looks, but I'd like to see how he fares taking on a little risk. Maybe he has the potential, but the way I see it he has not developed that potential, nor a range, and most definitely not in this movie. <br/><br/>The same is true of Jolie, except she adds the unpleasant dimension of shamelessly reminding you in every scene that she is a very pretty, sexy...insert whatever good looking adjective you like. She doesn't do this by getting into the role as an actor, trusting that her looks will shine brighter if she allows a little humility to guide them. Instead she delivers these arrogant ""everybody's looking at me"" smirks. That's fine for the hot looking woman sitting in the bar who likes that kind of superficial attention--can't even tell you how many times it's gotten my attention, but that's not what I'm looking for when I see a movie. But I guess a lot of people are. You will see Brad Pitt in a badly fitting pair of boxers, and Angelina exercise her ego, and this was an annoyance to me, and my date. <br/><br/>In my opinion you are better off staring at a magazine cover for 90 minutes. It would be a cheaper way to get your fix of two attractive people, and you would not be nearly as disappointed when you put it down. <br/><br/>One last note: this movie was fairly violent, lots of language, and sexual innuendo.

It has ""smithereens"" written all over it! How soon should I start this review? I say ""How Soon is Now?"" (Smiths' song). Most of you know that this film has been a real ""hit"" with audiences! For those of you who have not been on the ""hit"" list and are oblivious of what the film is about, it's about a married couple who are also a couple of contract killers! However, the real ""killer"" part about this is that they are unaware of each other's deadly occupations. To add fuel to the fire, they have both been assigned to kill each other. I know some of you guys are sick of Brad & Angelina because ""Us"" ""People"" have been seeing the Bradgelina suspected romance in the covers of the aforementioned magazines just about every week. However, give ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" a chance. John Smith, played by Pitt, will go to no ends to make sure that he successfully completes his mission or in other words end up with a ""Girlfriend in a Coma"" (Smiths' song) or in this case ""Wife in a Coma"". OK, I am pushing it! I am being a comamierda! Jane Smith, played by Jolie, is also on a continuous relentless pursuit to doom Mr. Smith, or in this case Pitt ""Meat is Murder"" (Smiths' first album title). The always vociferous Vince Vaughn co-stars as Mr. Smith's sidekick or in other words ""Bigmouth Strikes Again"" (Smiths' song). Director Doug Liman does an admirable job with the verbose and chemistry of our main Smith protagonists. However, Liman did push it to the depthless formulaic level with the action of the film. Pitt and Jolie obviously light up the screen with their beautification physical characteristics. There was no ""Jennycide"" in this film! Sorry Jennifer! Brad & Angie also did execute; I mean execute praiseworthy acting performances.

As far as her career goes, Mr & Mrs. Smith wasn't a bad choice for Angelina Jolie at all. Might not be the greatest hits, but she finally got paired opposite a well reputed actor and she'll need a few more such roles to hit off her career. Their chemistry was just brilliant! I gave it a 6/10. This is just for Jolie and the chemistry between the 2 leads. Vince Vaughn was funny again as he was in Be Cool, but he needs to take up more lead roles in serious/semi-serious movies. I agree he got over-looked earlier on in his career with Psycho, Return to Paradise and The Cell. He also paired up well with Jon Favreau for Swingers and Made, but the time has come to return to serious movies."

","Having thought this would be a typical loads of fun, big action summer film I looked forward to seeing it. I am a Brad Pitt fan and Angelina Jolie is okay in most things so I thought it would be very cool. The plot seems like action perfection and any time two big Hollywood stars are put up against each other it's usually good times ie: The Jackal, Assassins etc. I wasn't wrong about the action...the action sequences are intense and well done and not overly wrought with stupid special effects, unfortunately the rest of the film drags it down.<br/><br/>Mr and Mrs Smith is the story of a bored couple who have been married ""five or six years."" They met in Columbia and it was instant attraction and they married quickly but then find themselves in Marriage counseling because they aren't connecting and becoming very bored. Their boredom stems from the fact that neither one of them knows the other at all. Mr John Smith, is supposedly a big time construction contractor and Mrs Jane Smith works with computers on Wall Street or so each of them believe of the other. In fact they both work for opposing factions as Assassins, and they are each the best in their line. Everything is kept well hidden from the other until they are both given the same target by their respective companies. They don't recognize each other as they both fight to off the target and it isn't until afterwords they discover each other's identity. Now it's a problem...each of their companies wants them to knock the other off having identified each other at the target. Feeling betrayed and feeling that their marriage is a sham their anger transfers into the desire to kill each other in the 48 hour time frame. But as they fight back and forth they slowly begin to learn more about each other than they ever knew before and they fall in love all over again. Now both their companies want them dead feeling they are a threat to their security and they must work together to escape their deaths.<br/><br/>I will agree with the popular opinion that Brad and Angelina have no on screen chemistry. Separately they do an adequate job and some of their fight scenes are very cool but their chemistry never changes from ZERO!! Perhaps it's all the outside stuff working it's way in. The first 45 minutes of the film is downright boring and the audience is twice as bored as they are in their marriage...at least I was. Director Doug Liman seems to aim more for story and drama than outright action which for a film like this doesn't always please. He works too hard at establishing their boring lives and their alter egos and then all the comparisons and funny little anecdotes that go along with being a boring normal housewife/husband but actually a hit-man(woman). Basically the film tries to take suburbia and drop assassins into it but it doesn't mesh. Nonetheless the action scenes are wicked cool and Jolie and Pitt trying to kill each other in their home was very awesome. The only downside to the action was how incredibly invincible both Jolie and Pitt's characters are. They take a deadly beating first from each other and then other assassins and still manage to come out completely unscathed. I know this is the kind of thing that has to be accepted for big action films sometimes but it really stands out in this one. Vince Vaughn's role (although granted he had some funny lines) was completely unnecessary and took away from the story. It seems that most people think this movie is just awesome so I won't argue with them, I will only say I was more than slightly disappointed with what I thought it would be compared to what it was. Personally save it for a DVD rental...then it won't be too bad, but save your cash for the theater and see something else. 6/10"

(well I know what I mean) The musical score helps to, carrying you through the film with pace and emotion... its very powerful just like the characters within the film. For the first time I thought Brad Pitt suited his role, but then who wouldn't enjoy being next to Angelina?? I also like the way the film focuses around marriage, it can be a battle ground, yet true love conquers all, and together they were stronger than apart. Its hard to write a comment without giving away too much of the film. One thing I do find frustrating is that at a certain stage in the film it was quite obviously cut... so it wasn't as seamless as it could have been.

They don't really wanna kill each other. They're having too much fun and it's hard for the audience not to have fun as well. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are excellent and pull off their parts extremely well. Plus they have great chemistry as well. <br/><br/>The movie just falls apart at the end a little. They argue and talk about their marriage during shoot-outs which can be annoying after awhile. Plus the shoot- outs can last too long and not be very believable. I also think the end is flat and uneventful. The movie just ends after a shoot-out that's not that involving or believable. The movie really really needed a main villain. The movie is just about their marriage though and I guess it would've lost focus a little if their was a main villain. Still though it needed something besides them just killing soldier after soldier that come after them. <br/><br/>The movie could've used more of Vince Vaughn who steals the show every time he's on screen which isn't enough. He plays a loyal friend to Pitt who doesn't trust any women but his mother. He even lives with her. I was hoping he would even get some action in the movie but that never happens. Still though Pitt and Jolie do their best work in awhile and carry the movie fine. I feel sorry for Jennifer Anisten who was sooo in love with Pitt.

If anything, they're mostly tongue in cheek, anybody who doubts that should consider the shot when Mr. Smith (Brad) is tip-toeing around the house, trying not to get shot and then knocks over a teapot, fumbles to catch it and then grunts in painful anticipation as its top then falls off to the ground.<br/><br/>The therapy scenes are also quite funny, and the couple grow from seeming bored with futility to being quite joyfully smug about where they are now. The last scene, although somewhat Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid, is all the better for it - and the ending is logical given the couples collective body counts. You'll know what I mean if and when you see it.<br/><br/>Why the bad reviews? Why the people going on about it being bad? I have no clue, really. I can hazard a few guesses - maybe they guys hate Brad for getting Jolie, maybe the women hate Angelina for getting Pitt, maybe these people just can't tell a whacking good time when they see it. Maybe they wanted it to be more 'realistic' - as though movies were obliged to mirror reality, maybe they wanted more sex scenes, and y'know what - maybe they're just 13 year olds with a chip on their shoulders. I don't know.<br/><br/>Can't say I care.<br/><br/>You shoudn't either.<br/><br/>Watch the damn thing, and god-damn - 6.7? What're you nuts?"

","Major gaping plot holes aside, it's been a long while since I enjoyed myself so much at the cinema. If you're okay with turning your brain off and accepting a film such as this for what it is - guns, explosions and snappy one liners - then I can recommend it.<br/><br/>Pitt is maturing as an actor and I'm beginning to like him more and more. Not that he's in danger of winning an Oscar anytime soon, but he's not just another pretty face anymore. He had a lot of nice moments, so did Jolie, but I had a hard time accepting her as a character in this film. Can't put my finger on why, though.<br/><br/>As well, I felt a little disappointed when I walked out of the theater saying ""geez, a film I actually don't feel I wasted money on"".<br/><br/>Where have all the good films gone? Is there any hope that the ratio of 10 bad films to every good one ever going to rectify itself? Is it my imagination or has recent cinema gone extremely down hill?"

","Mr and Mrs Smith is funny, sexy and action-packed, appealing to both men and women. It's hard to believe that Nicole Kidman was originally selected to play Jane. Jolie and Pitt are perfectly cast as they look like they could pull off the stunts in real life and they play off well against each other. This film has received a lot of publicity and for all of the wrong reasons. Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt work well together and it remains to be seen whether this is just good chemistry or something more. However, we don't go to the cinema to watch a film because we think the female lead destroyed her co-star's marriage and we don't choose not to go because we think she is a home-wrecker. We go because we want to be excited by the action, we want to be dazzled by the special effects and we want to be able to lose ourselves in a good story. Mr and Mrs Smith manages to tick all three boxes and doesn't fail to impress."

","This is a movie about two contract killers who are married to each other, and implausible as it may seem, it is not a caper flick, or a crime story, but a domestic comedy. Roger Ebert in his review is spot-on: the only reason this movie exists is to see Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie together. So strong is their chemistry that it relegates the flying bullets, impossible plot, and preposterous posturing to the background.<br/><br/>The movie opens in a marriage counselor's office, which sets the tone for everything that follows, namely, what their occupations and deceitfulness do to their marriage. The incongruity of all the murder for hire machinations is simply to be dismissed as irrelevant to the real business at hand. And, from the quotes section for this movie is a sampling of what this movie is about:<br/><br/>John Smith: Your aim's as bad as your cooking sweetheart... and that's saying something! <br/><br/>Jane Smith: Happy endings are just stories that haven't finished. <br/><br/>(about the new curtains Jane bought) Jane Smith: If you don't like them just say so and we can take them back. John Smith: All right, I don't like them. Jane Smith: Learn to live with them. <br/><br/>Counselor: How often do you have sex? Jane Smith: I don't understand the question. <br/><br/>Jane Smith: There's this huge space between us, and it just keeps filling up with whatever we don't say to each other. What's that called? Counselor: Marriage. <br/><br/>Eddie: This broad is not your wife; she's the enemy. John Smith: She tried to kill me. Eddie: They all try to kill you. Slowly, painfully, cripplingly. How you going to handle it? John Smith: (grabs assault rifle) I'm going to borrow this. Eddie: I like where your head's at, man. <br/><br/>Therapist: How long have you been married? John Smith: Five years Jane Smith: Six years. John Smith: (chastened) Five or six years. <br/><br/>Jane Smith: Any last words? John Smith: The new curtains are hideous. <br/><br/>It is offensive to my personal sense of morality that the occupation of the two likable protagonists is never examined. To the credit of the screenplay, they only kill ""bad"" people thugs and gangsters and such, so we never catch any hint of dystopian fatalism. Think Adam's Rib or When Harry Met Sally with gunplay, and you have pretty much the essence of this movie. I liked it in spite of myself. Miss Jolie is now officially on my list of hot actresses ..

Speaking of reservation; Angelica Jolie tried to be funny in this movie but sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. It's not like when I saw ""The Room"" in Los Angeles (midnight showing only) and everyone was laughing, clapping, talking and having fun.

","I enjoyed this movie, although the beginning was a bit slow and lacking energy. The one thing that was very obvious to me was towards the end of the movie, during the car chase scenes there were some visual errors, I believe. At first, the cars are in New York City, NY, driving and chasing. Then, in the middle of the chase scene I noticed the Long Beach, CA bridge which is used for the cruise ships and such. Then I was blown away when I saw a sign which read ""Los Angeles"" as an exit on the highway/freeway. Then the scene is back in N.Y. City while the chase continues. I happen to know this because I was raised in NY until I was 21, then drove to CA (Ojai/Ventura) and know this area well as I've been here for 23 years. Please be more careful during editing.

The plot leaves something to be desired, especially in terms of its simplicity and originality, but the style and offbeat humor, especially Brad Pitt's, can almost make up for it.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're going to see one movie this summer ( so far ), see Batman Begins. If you're going to see two movies this summer, see Star Wars or Cinderella Man. If you're going to see anywhere between 3-6 movies this summer, try to make Mr. And Mrs. Smith one of them."
"colonel_green","8","0","1","2 July 2005"," Brad and Angelina make an enchanting (off?)screen couple
","Most of the early publicity surrounding ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" had to do with the alleged relationship between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, which supposedly led to the demise of Pitt's relationship with Jennifer Aniston. Regardless, this doesn't affect the film that much; whether or not they are soon to be Mr. and Mrs. Pitt, Mr. and Mrs. Smith are both engaging, fun characters, and the movie can be similarly described.<br/><br/>The setup is well-known; John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) are a bored married couple each unaware that the other is a highly-trained assassin, and that they work for different, rival companies. When they eventually do figure this out, they are ordered to eliminate each other. The plot of the film could cheerfully be called minimalist; it's mostly about the darkly comedic interaction between John and Jane, and some brutally fun fight scenes. When the Smiths demolish their house, reminiscent of a famous ""Alias"" fight, laughs come fast and furious. The whole film really resembles, more than anything else, a 1930s screwball comedy, except with lots of guns.<br/><br/>Neither Jolie or Pitt has a particularly difficult role; they're both required to seem cool and sexy, which they are capable of doing in their sleep. But they both do it well, and the result is undeniably entertaining. I give ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" an 8/10."

I was born in Bogota Colombia and it is nothing like what they made it seem. I know it wasn't filmed there for obvious reasons but it only takes a trip to ""Google.com"" to figure out that Bogota is not a warm city. The characters were obviously dressed in summer ""Beachy"" clothing. Its obvious to me no research was done to make the setting realistic. Another thing I found offensive was how bombs were constantly exploding everywhere. The United States has publicly showed their support to better the situation in Colombia and I believe it to be rude and upsetting to depict Bogota as an ongoing battle scene.

Even so this movie surprised me with how good it is.<br/><br/>This movie has the typical big guns, shooting up buildings, explosive action but a very original plot underneath all that.<br/><br/>Coming into this movie I was really skeptical about how just finding out that their spouse is an assassin as well and being told to eliminate them could possible turn two married people against each other so quickly but I really liked how this was explained in the movie. How it all started with a simple misunderstanding that got the one to think that the other was really planning to kill them and it just took off from there.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were excellent. What surprised me though was how much I enjoyed Vince Vaughns performance (small as it was). I really enjoyed the comedic aspect he helped bring to the film the few scenes he was in.<br/><br/>What some will find especially enjoyable I'm sure is the highway scene in which the whole time Angelina is just wearing an over-sized t-shirt and Brad is just wearing a pair of boxers.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this movie.

This film touched just about every piece of human emotion. The acting was great, the plots were intriguing and the directing was excellent. The beginning of the film really brought you into the thoughts of each character it let you see there personal lives before the ""business"" side of them, so that when the action starts you know how one or the other would react to a situation.

","Summer is the prime season to release the wham-bam guilty-pleasure action movie. These movies are pretty much brainless, but they are fun to watch because you can escape reality and watch someone get the crap beat out of them. Well, that's what Mr. And Mrs. Smith is. It's nothing more then a guilty pleasure popcorn flick, and I really enjoyed it. It isn't anything great, but it's a hell of an entertaining film, with immense amounts of explosions, cool cinematography, and some fantastic fight sequences. If you enjoy kicking back and watching some kick-ass action movies, 'Mr. And Mrs. Smith' is the movie for you. The movie is about a seemingly happy, seemingly normal suburban middle-class couple, the Smiths. All the neighbors like them, and invite them to all their mind-numbing Tupperware parties and such. Yes, John and Jane seem ever so content on the outside, but their marriage is falling apart. A lot of their passion for each other has faded (like most married couples), and they both have a big secret they are hiding from each other - they are both C.I.A. assassins. When the couple finds out these truths about each other they try to kill each other because their jobs come first. Watching Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt try to run over each other with cars, shoot at each other or attack each other with household appliances, 'Mr. And Mrs. Smith' kind of turns up being a violent version of 'War of the Roses'.<br/><br/>Doug Liman, who just recently directed 'The Bourne Supremacy', does a fine job with 'Mr. And Mrs. Smith'. It's nothing to even consider handing out an award for, but he makes sure the film stays fresh and doesn't drag. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are consistent in their parts, but I found that they didn't have very good on-screen chemistry, which is funny due to the two actually being a couple in real life. Vince Vaughn is funny and steals some scenes for the very limited screen time he has, and The O.C.'s Adam Brody seems to be just thrown into the cast for window dressing. Brody plays a role that could be cut from the movie easily, but the producers probably figured with him too in the film, it could boost ticket sales, especially for clamoring teenage girls who are obsessed with 'The O.C.'. Keith David has a short cameo as Father, and 'House's' Jennifer Morrison has an extremely short role as one of Jolie's co-workers.<br/><br/>In closing, 'Mr. And Mrs. Smith' is a big, loud, extravagant popcorn flick that any action fan will enjoy. I felt it was superior to a lot of other films in it's genre, because it had a perfect balance of fun, drama and comic relief, which is rare these days. It's a good film, not a great one, and certainly not one worthy of any kind of award. It's just a guilty pleasure, no more, no less. Grade: B- (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, Arizona, 6/10/05)<br/><br/>my ratings guide - A+ (absolutley flawless); A (a masterpiece, near-perfect); A- (excellent); B+ (great); B (very good); B- (good); C+ (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D+ (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutley horrendous); F (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces)."

","I was hardly blown away, but this film could've been a lot worse. Pitt and Jolie hardly surpassed themselves, but used natural comedic timing to provide convincing performances, making up for the somewhat two-dimensional plot. Some of the best parts of the film showed their amazing on-screen chemistry, such as the seductive and dangerous tango scene. I was disappointed with the fact that Adam Brody had such a small part to play, and the attempted twist with Brody was obvious from the moment you met the character Â– who was really Seth Cohen in a suit. I have never seen such obvious type-casting, and having looked forward to seeing Brody in a new light, was frustrated Although intended to be intense with humour interspersed, one didn't really connect with the film, and it was clear that the audience were viewing with little more than mild interest. This was wholly understandable, given that one was supposed to believe that two presumably smart assassins did not check their partner's backgrounds thoroughly before agreeing to marry, and that the two agencies felt that the two of them living under the same roof was ""bad for business""... What's that even supposed to mean? Whygo to that trouble, with the risk of potentially killing your best assassin? All in all an average film, one that Pitt and/or Jolie fans may appreciate, but never one for the DVD collection."

","I initially though that this was going to be a movie with a so-so plot, typical action sequences thrown in, and bad acting covered up by explosions and pretty faces. I was pleasantly surprised by the movie that is Mr. and Mrs. Smith.<br/><br/>The story is fairly basic but lends itself to be a unique and funny experience. It centers around John and Jane Smith who are both assassins. Neither of them know that the other is leading a deceptive double life to cover up their questionable line of work. When each of them are assigned to target each other by their respective employers things start to get shaky between the couple. It's a fresh mix of a romantic comedy about a couple's problems, and a fast paced action movie. I think that this different approach to marital problems and action is a large draw to this film.<br/><br/>The whole movie is well over two hours long but surprisingly never drags it's feet. The dialog was delivered almost flawlessly by both Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Pitt plays the typical husband and agent but never delivers anything truly unique. Joile's character is a bit more fleshed out and believable but nothing special. Jolie seems to play the more dangerous roles naturally and just plain looks good while packing heat. Despite the ho hum characters, their interaction is what brings the film together. As far as the action sequences go, it was all very stylish but again it falls short when it comes to being truly outstanding and unique.<br/><br/>Overall, it was just a fun fast-paced movie with a fresh idea and a well played out plot. What it lacks in creative action sequences it makes up for in it's comedy and style. Some people who don't find married couple jokes so funny won't enjoy it quite as much, but there impressions will still definitely be positive.

Sure, it has moments where it kinda didn't know where its going, but Pitt and Jolie's chemistry just sizzles the screen, they look hot together! Brad plays John Smith, an assassin for a top secret agency, and so as Angelina, who plays Jane, an assassin for a rival agency. They meet in Bogota, Columbia, 5 or six years ago (as Brad's character would say in the movie), in what it seems a very unstable place brought about by political turmoil, which obviously caused by either of them. Since, every foreigner traveling alone, are being questioned, their characters meet, and pretended they were together, which I must question if you're a professional spy, wouldn't you suspect each other, what were you doing in such place and time? So, they liked each other and got married under the impression that both have such ordinary jobs, they believed that they're both safe for each other. So, 5 or six years have passed and both of them are meeting a marriage counselor trying to figure out what seems to be the problem, here Angelina says one of the funniest one liners in the movie- ""There's this huge space between us, and it just keeps filling up with all the things we don't say to each other. What's that called?  Marriage!"" says the counselor. Here, we witness the comedic prowess of the two as they exchange dialogues and present their arguments to the marriage counselor, I had more fun with Angelina's pun but I would say Brad's reactions and mannerisms he gave his character was better.<br/><br/>Then just one fine day, they each got an assignment to put a hit on a certain Benjamin Diaz, played by the OC's Adam Brody, little did they know that this was actually a set-up so both can be eliminated, for their identities were discovered by both agencies. And this is where I think the movie falters, of course we know that they still love each other and will join forces and battle their respective agencies, and with their combined expertise, who could stop them? The action scenes were really explosive, and the stunts were exciting. The car chase scene, where Angelina drives a minivan (which she says she drives it better for she's a suburban mom), and while being pursued by 3 BMW's and getting peppered with bullets, she and Brad has moment wherein they confess their lies and the truth about all this time, was just really funny. We know how this will end but for a moment in the scene where they get trapped inside a shopping mall and all the snipers are ready to take them down, I kinda hoped that they will live and survive, even you know what's gonna come, that is why over all, I still enjoyed this movie."

Filled with explosive action and very entertaining laugh-out-loud moments, MR. & MRS. SMITH does about everything right in it's ambitious scale. Brad Pitt is very pleasing as a comedian though Jolie works far better as a serious actor, and it's truly the first film I've seen her acting this well (except GIRL, INTERRUPTED that is). And Vince Vaughn is also very nice in the character as Brad Pitt's boss, living with his mum and being on high alert with a shotgun Vaughn alone creates true comedy here. With really nothing to complain about, the overall most impressing part is the great action sequences that takes place at different, great areas. Either it's Pitt vs. Jolie in their own house, or on the road co-operating with a open trunk and firing and shooting and blowing things up, it's always fantastic watching! Brad Pitt growing better and bigger as an actor every year does a great performance here and as said about Jolie, also she acts good here. And the movie never trembles, it's focus is razor-sharp inside action and comedy, and offers every entertainment sweet you can ask for. Brad Pitt's natural charm spanned around his messy John Smith and Angelina Jolie's cat-eyes in her terrible-cook Jane, taking this to the extreme together with the action twisted in with Latino rhythms at the end, cool! MR. & MRS. SMITH is truly a fantastic entertainment movie, nothing to say about that.<br/><br/>Doug Liman still in the success of his Jason Bourne adaptations takes everything further here, and dodges in all of his director - strikes in between the flirting romance and lethal action scenes. Fine scenes as when Pitt and Jolie are dancing and checking each other for weapons is one of the many sexy scenes MR. & MRS. SMITH delivers with great confidence. Truly one of this summer's biggest and coolest movies! Very worth watching."

","This was the first summer movie for me to see. All in all I think it was what I expected, fun and flesh and a bit of story. Jolie was better than Pitt and we all know about her looks, but I didn't think there was much on screen fire between the two of them.<br/><br/>I wonder if the off-screen rumors are true, because it wasn't on the screen, except for maybe the last shootout.<br/><br/>Still good summer fun, but I would like to see more Vince Vaughn, since his scenes are the most entertaining. Plus, I saw this movie in Las Vegas and laugh every time I think of Vince Vaughn saying ""Vegas, baby. Vegas"" in Swingers. I give it 7 out of 10, but this is by means a classic."

"The_Orenda","7","0","3","20 June 2005"," Action/comedy hits the right buttons.
","In many parts of the movie, you have to suspend belief if you are to enjoy Mr. and Mrs. Smith. It opens with a comedy sketch and tries to loosen you up to its reality, that a husband and wife, for half a decade or more, can keep the secret from each other, that both of them kill people for a living. That wouldn't be much of a stretch, but of course, it's a 'blockbuster' movie, with a large budget and an 'all-star' cast. This has been a better movie for both Pitt and Jolie in some time though.<br/><br/>A couple meet in Bagota, Columbia, of all timing and places, just when they need each other and decide to quicken things and get married. Little does the either know they are assassins and are about to get caught in a sticky situation.<br/><br/>There is no sex in the movie. I walked into the theater thinking that something would happen that prompted all of these silly headlines as of late, thinking the media knew something I didn't. Absolutely nothing worth mentioning folks. As an entertaining comedy, I think it works but nothing else beyond that. You know, if you have the technology at home to enjoy the sound and explosions, I suggest a rental. I could have lived with that and so can you."

It was funny, original, and entertaining! Ignore the 6.9 score, did those people even see the movie? This movie sets the mark for others. It's hard to get that kind of action, and believable comedy at the same time, and they pulled it off. I took my 11 yr old son, and he loved it to. The bickering between husband had wife had the entire audience laughing the whole way through. As a married woman, I wish my husband would have been there to watch it with us. He would have loved it. I called my adult kids, and told them they had too see this one. My son and I literally laughed so hard that we were covering our mouths, and got tears in our eyes.

"thatchinesekid","7","0","3","19 June 2005"," A surprising summer blockbuster
","When I first heard about how Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were dating, I looked at my calendar and found this all kind of ironic. Only a few weeks away from the release of the big blockbuster film that they were both starring in, we find out they're dating. Could this be one of the many marketing schemes that went into this film's promotion? Probably, they must have been dating since they were actually making this film,then they thought, ""Hey, wouldn't it be smart to let the world know were sleeping with each other a couple of weeks before this film is released? More money for us!"". What better promotion is there for a film like this? How about the idea that Jennifer Aniston must feels horrible right now! For months now, i've been seeing trailers and commercials for this film then this little 'Brangelina"" thing came along, my initial reaction was that this movie was going to be horrible. Surprisingly, it wasn't! The film follows a married couple who are bored of their sub urban life style, they both feel a growing space between them. Most people who was told this story would say, ""Hey, that's normal"", but you guessed it, their wrong! John and Jane Smith are both assassins for separate corporations and they have no idea about their spouses identity. They both believe that they work boring desk jobs. As you can imagine, the film's plot starts to get interesting when they find out of each others identities.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is surprisingly believable, when it's her time, Jolie as a house wife works perfectly. Vince Vaughn plays Eddie, John's boss, I was hoping for some comic relief coming from his character and I guess that's what the writers were aiming for but it really didn't work for me. In fact, this film was publicized as a sort of comedy film, I didn't find it funny at all. Since Brad and Angelina's acting is so believable, the relationship between the characters are even more believable.<br/><br/>As the film's plot unfolds, the action starts coming. The action scenes in this film are probably the most entertaining in awhile. Unlike most of the recent action films, this one does not use the shaky camera effect which if you ask me, is getting really boring and annoying. There is one highway chase sequence that is a lot like the one we saw in 'The Matrix Reloaded', this is probably the best action scene. Unfortunently, this film has just as many cons as it does pros, probably even more. Like I said earlier, Vince Vaughn's performance was disappointing, usually he plays some doped out idiot, in this film he played someone who was so serious that it was awkward to see him not crack a joke. Of course, there's still some subliminal jokes but they weren't funny at all. One of the biggest problems with the film is that we never really get an idea of who John and Jane are working for, you can never tell which corporation is the ""good guy"", we probably aren't supposed to know this so it wouldn't take away from the main plot but it would still be nice to have a little background information. One other problem I had with this film is that it kept trying to push this message that really didn't effect anyone even if they did get it. The film wanted people to go home confessing their secrets to their loved ones, this didn't work out at all. The film makers should make a note that this film is a summer blockbuster, not a late winter Academy Award plea.<br/><br/>Anyways, I may have not gotten to the points of the film i've wanted to because I can't spoil the film for everyone so you might not understand my final verdict on this flick. I was going to give this film a 6/10 but since it had a good ending, i give it a solid 7/10! Would I buy this film? No. Would I see it again? Maybe."
"Victor Field","4","0","2","19 June 2005"," Pitt? Jolie? Brody makes this movie for me.
","Wacky and thrilling premise (husband and wife discover they're rival assassins), helmed by Doug Liman and starring two of Hollywood's Sexiest Stars... how could it fail? <br/><br/>At the box office, not really. Artistically, not so hard. <br/><br/>The trouble with ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is that what is supposed to be a romantic action comedy is lacking in the romance (in part because Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie don't really connect on screen - Pitt is in dull mode throughout, and I've never been a member of the Jolie Barmy Army; anyone of the female cast from ""Sin City"" wipes the floor with her), not entirely successful with the action - only in the third act is there any kind of adrenaline, and even then not much - and absolutely DOA with the comedy. ""The War of the Roses"" took the husband-and-wife-trying-to-kill-each-other premise and did a far better, edgier and funnier job.<br/><br/>To be fair, the movie was cursed from the beginning by being produced by Akiva Goldsman - and know this: unless the least deserving Oscar-winner in recent memory makes a movie with someone I really, really like, this is absolutely the last movie I will see with his name on it (after ""Constantine"" - which I admit I couldn't get through - ""Starsky & Hutch,"" ""Deep Blue Sea,"" ""Lost in Space,"" ""A Time to Kill,"" ""Batman Forever"" and ""Practical Magic"" enough is enough) - and written by the man who wrote ""xXx2: The Next Level."" What saved the show for me was the performance of Adam Brody as a spy who proves to be the key to the whole business; he isn't on screen long, but he always delivers the goods when he is. But otherwise, as Summer Roberts would say - ""Ew."""

","I think this is one the best films of 2005. The continuity was excellent throughout the entire movie, which anymore for Hollywood is a rare moment. Although it is billed a thriller, I have not laughed that hard in a long time. The comedic timing was incredible from both Angelina and Brad. I will also have to view the movie again to pick out the other films that were interlaced, such as Fight Club. During the interview of the ""target"" he was wearing a fight club t-shirt and being interviewed by Brad Pitt. In addition he did a couple of fight steps that were similar to when he played an Irish boxer in Snatch. To say that Angelina and Brad had chemistry in this movie would be an understatement. I could care less what they do in their private lives but on screen it works like magic. Although I read the earlier comment that Angelina did not look so good in this movie, I would have to admittedly disagree. Angelina has matured in her abilities as an actress and continues to impress both on screen and off.<br/><br/>Not only do I highly recommend this film but I recommend this film for your home collection."
"ClassicMovieFans","8","0","4","18 June 2005"," Even better than I have expected
","I walked into the cinema, knowing that the film will not be boring and expect it to be just another Hollywood summer film. Yet surprisingly, I find it highly entertaining - it never made me feel that 2 hours have actually passed. Brad Pitt and Anglina Jolie are cooler than I have expected. No wonder the movie appeals to a wide audience. The music score does not disappoint. I am glad that Nicole Kidman is not available for the Jane Smith part (according to the Time magazine, she is preoccupied with the Stepford Wives). Kidman is beautiful but she may not be a convincing assassin. Neither is Catherine Zeta Jones. Both of them have not the determined look and physical prowess as Angeline Jolie has. Action-packed movie fans will find this a delight! <br/><br/>But what makes this movie better than other summer blockbusters is that there are moments which strikes a deep chord in the audience - the dialogues or the way Brad and Angelina looked at each other. There is chemistry between Brad and Angelina. I really cared what happened next. It pained me to see how they actually tried to kill one another. And when they were at each other's throat, it was not unlike what happen to couples with difficult marriages in real life. <br/><br/>You gradually see how they admire one another when they fight one another and discover the other person's killing instinct and professionalism. The more they know one another's secret, the harder it is for them to kill the other and save own's life. <br/><br/>(contains spoilers) The movie will definitely appeal to woman audience of all ages. Brad Pitt is a big draw. Marriage problems are well handled in the film. Also compare the head count between Jane Smith and John Smith. How Jane outsmarted John in the search of the house. And John proves to be a gentleman who refused to shoot at Jane etc. <br/><br/>This is a fast-paced movie combining action, romance and drama. I am tempted to keep a DVD copy when it is available."

"jeffthemartin","7","0","4","14 June 2005"," Guns and marriage.
","Before seeing ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith,"" I'd never gone to a movie because of the actors who are in it. Movies are such a collaborative effort that it's usually very difficult to say it's good or bad because of an actor. This movie is a little simpler. I like the work of director Doug Liman (""The Bourne Identity""), but this movies greatest strength is undoubtedly that the majority of screen time is given to images of two of the coolest, most beautiful people in the film industry.<br/><br/>""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is an action movie, and it is a movie about John and Jane Smith's marriage. As an action movie, there is nothing particularly novel or interesting about it. If you like big explosions, and guns, and knives, and more guns, you will enjoy watching this movie. I don't particularly mind these things, but they were not nearly as interesting as the relationship between John and Jane. (Many people say it's actually the relationship between the actors Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, but I'm not going to go there.) The concept of the story is thought-provoking. A married couple discovers that they have each been leading a secret life that their partner knows nothing about. When they find out, it revolutionizes their relationship.<br/><br/>The parts of the movie that focus on their marriage are the parts that I enjoyed watching. Not the scenes where they were in marital counseling, but the scenes in which momentous things are happening all around them, and suddenly they realize that their relationship is blossoming into something different. These scenes made me believe that they were John and Jane (rather than Brad and Angelina), and that the characters had a relationship that, fundamentally, was realistically human. This allowed me to identify with them.<br/><br/>When I was watching this movie, my experience was marred by noise. Not people-in-the-theater noise, but the-volume-was-too-loud noise. Before you think I should shut up and call the theater about this, let me say this. I was sitting just 5 seats over from where I sat during ""Revenge of the Sith"" and although that movie was also uncomfortably loud, it didn't bother me. Here's why: in ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" the loud explosions, and over-long gun fights don't do very much to advance the interesting story of John and Jane's marriage. Instead, they show-case a dizzying array of weapons, and yet another boring scene of bad guys being killed while the good guys emerge from the fight virtually unscathed. If this were an artistic choice, and were anywhere near original, I might not complain. But I know it is pandering to the masses; that it is an effort to take more ticket money from those who have a thirst for stupid action and senseless killing.<br/><br/>If you like Brad or Angelina, you will like this movie. If you don't like gun violence, you will likely be turned off. If you are married, you will identify with or laugh at what I think are the best parts of the movie."

","One of the best date movies I've ever seen. Action for the guys--especially like the mini-van sequence on the freeway--with romance for the gals--the dance sequences are hot--and a lot of humor sprinkled in. Jane and John Smith, unknown to each other, are assassins for competing intelligence agencies. They are each ordered by their agency to go after ""Tank,"" who is being transported across the Mexican/U.S. border. The catch is that there is only one point of vulnerability--which is where the trouble begins. Jane has set up shop to take out Tank when John arrives and, unwittingly, interferes with her plans. Neither gets the hit and, frustrated that they didn't get the job done, they try to take each other out without success. Upon their return home, the action really heats up (as do the one-liners)as they discover who it was who botched the job for them and they get hired to take each other out. Despite what the trailer indicates, this is a great romantic comedy with explosions! The best Brad Pitt movie in years. Probably also the best movie to feature marital counseling in years as well (which is kind of ironic since Brad and Jennifer broke up during the filming.) Lots of violence but little gore. Some sex but very little nudity. This is a movie you can feel safe taking your grandmother and your 14-year-old son to."

"Rich B","7","0","5","14 June 2005"," Good evenings entertainment with the shining coupling of two perfectly matched actors
","It's interesting that I saw this on opening night and have since forgotten about writing a review about it, for me that says a lot about a film. You could feel it fading as you left the cinema and even talking about it with friends twenty minutes later you found each other reminding yourself about scenes.<br/><br/>For me that shows one of two things, the film was bad or it was pure entertainment which, although it can be enjoyable, just washes over you and lets you walk away without getting in your head and making a big impact. For Mr and Mrs Smith it was the latter.<br/><br/>There's something that hits you about this film straight away in the opening scene, and it follows through the whole movie making it much more than it really is. The acting and chemistry between Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. On screen they play off each other perfectly, and if you forget the movie and everything that's happening around them for the moment, you can be reminded of one of those great on screen couplings from the older days of Hollywood. Together they are classics. Really, I'm not selling this too high, the opening scene nails it in terms of performance, their timing and playing off of each other is perfect and brings forward the sharp, incisive comedy in the script. There were many a nervous laugh from couples in the audience, and the singles laughed much harder! That's what makes the film for me, with any two other actors I think the movie would have ridden an even keel and never made half the wave that this movie has.That aside, the premise of the movie in that the couple are both hit-persons, provides for a lot of set pieces and some excellent action. The interplay of a pair of warring hit-people reflects that of a badly married couple very well (not that I would know that!). The script is really strong, and gives some excellent dialogue to the leads. For me the beauty is in the detail here, not the big explosions. When John walks to his tool shed to check if his secret stash of money has been taken he's instantly upset that the tool shed has been rifled, the typical man's domain, except he never ever used it. It's these little moments of pettiness in an angry relationship that made me, and the audience laugh. Those and the superb counsellor scenes, perfect moments.<br/><br/>The action is pretty cool in most parts, and the most excellent scene was the car chase. They've really tried to pull the camera back from the action a bit, something I wasn't really enjoying in a lot of Hollywood movies these days, and you get to see things that are actually happening. Plus the script writers haven't stopped at the dialogue, they've brought the sharp inventiveness into the arena of the set pieces as well, and there are a few good laughs to be had while the cars do battle from the action itself as well as the continuing married banter.<br/><br/>A couple of things did stand out for me though, there seem to be a few huge cuts which were quite jarring. One is early on when you see for the first time John Smith on a job, and the camera seems to drop and hide behind a chair for most of the events. Then the second big one is when John and Jane go for glory after having a big fight, and just as they seem to be getting to the nitty gritty they suddenly collapse and you are left wondering if Brad just can't go for that long. To be honest that's a nice relief for us mere mortals with sixteen packs instead of six.<br/><br/>Yet that's something I noticed throughout, bullets firing and hitting nothing more than walls and inanimate objects, which is fine for the fight scene between the couple, but during the rest of the movie it all seemed a little watered down for me. I'm not saying give me an R or 18 rating, I'm just looking for a little more of the real hit-person feel. There's also something along these lines that happens near the end that makes me think there was another ending but again it was chopped. Perhaps it was, perhaps it was another cut I felt just didn't work right.<br/><br/>However, those niggles aside, it's a great evenings entertainment, and an enjoyable film. The script is sharp and insightful, with the wonderful chemistry on screen from Pitt and Jolie, who bring back the beauty of the old Hollywood on screen couplings for me. They have proved themselves in some key scenes in this movie, I'd like to see them take it to something meatier.<br/><br/>I now hold a good hope for The Bourne Ultimatum from Doug Liman and for X-Men 3 from the writer Simon Kinberg."

It's all three. When we were walking in, I thought ""PG?"" come on - but seriously, there is nothing in this movie that anyone would not enjoy or be offended at. It's just plain FUNNY.

I can certainly see why people who saw this while being made said these two should be together. I can't imagine anyone else being able to pull off the whole married assassin look.<br/><br/>Personally, I can't wait for the DVD and I would pay extra for the premium stuff with outtakes, etc. I'm almost ready to go see it again."

","""Hey Johnny! So how is Mr. and Mrs. Smith?"" Well, what exactly are you expecting from the movie? ""Hmm, I'd say the action of Revenge of the Sith combined with the the clever script of Memento. Oh, and with complete plausibility thrown in for good measure."" Ah, well in that case I would have to say you should probably be flogged with a wet, jello-filled straw. Don't worry, it's not too bad. Trust me. Then you should take my course, ""How to Properly Analyze a Movie Based on its Trailer."" It'll help you look a lot less like a jack-a-dandy and prevent you from complaining about how this movie is just too unbelievable.<br/><br/>Too unbelievable? You don't say. Look, right off the bat we're expected to believe that this couple has been married for 5 or 6 years, they're trained assassins who pride themselves on recon, and they never suspected the other of being an assassin. If you can buy that premise going into the movie then you waiver all rights to complain about anything else that's a bit far-fetched, OK? <br/><br/>Is this a great movie that I'll gladly add to my DVD collection the day it's released? Nah. But it was good for a couple of hours of non-analytical fun. It's a little slow-paced at times, and there is probably too much emphasis at the beginning on the mundanity of their marriage (they're bored, we get it), but once things start to kick in we get beautiful people, gunplay, car chases, explosions, one-line exchanges, inside jokes, and doses of humor thrown at us left, right, and up the middle. I'd also add ""out the ying-yang"" but that'd be too cliché. The fight scene between Brad and Angelina is particularly funny (though probably a little too reflective of a day in the life of Ike Turner), as is Vince Vaughn's small role. You gotta love his defense of living with his mom, ""She cooks, cleans, makes my bed, and I'm the dumb guy?"" <br/><br/>If you're looking for character development then you better keep on looking. Chances are you won't ever buy into the fact that you're supposed to be watching the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Smith on screen. More likely you'll be thinking as I did, ""Hey, there's Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie just having some fun!"" But who cares? As long as it entertains then so be it. It doesn't really take itself seriously, so why should you? <br/><br/>I mean, come on, Angelina Jolie walks out of gunfights and explosions looking like she just walked out of a salon, so what are you expecting? It's funny because this prompted my sister Amber to comment, ""I wish I could get blown up and still have my hair looking nice."" To which I inquired, ""Why would you want to get blown up in the first place? How about just wishing for your hair to look nice and not worry about being involved in an explosion?"" Amber's response? ""I'm just saying, if I were in a gunfight or explosion then I wish I'd walk away looking as fixed up as Angelina Jolie was."" Oh. Well, THAT makes sense. *shakes head* Women.<br/><br/>THE GIST <br/><br/>There are some pretty cool scenes that I wouldn't mind witnessing again one day, but there are also some clunkers that I'd fast forward through just so I could get to the good stuff. In a Summer full of heavier (albeit entertaining) material, if all you want is to watch a bunch of beautiful people blow stuff up and aid you in a little escapism, then Mr. and Mrs. Smith just might satisfy.<br/><br/>3.5 marks (out of 5)"
"bondluva","8","0","4","13 June 2005"," Downright Fun - a great night out! Will see this one again!
","What an extremely pleasant surprise this was! I went to see this film mainly because, like most males in the 18-25 age bracket, I am quite partial to the wiles of Angelina Jolie. I had also seen the trailers a number of times and thought there was potential in it. However, I didn't have extremely high hopes because most of the stuff coughed up by Hollywood lately has been far from inspirational! The deciding factor to see it was a cousin on the opposite side of the spectrum who, as with most females in the afore mentioned 18-25 age bracket, is rather obsessed with Mr. Pitt. I hadn't been out in a while so why not, right!? The style of the film was perfect. How could it not be with such a director! The scenes wafted smoothly, gliding from scene to scene effortlessly. The pace gradually picked up until reaching its peak and the ending was actually quite ingenious - The final shootout was most enjoyable to watch as it didn't opt for the usual - and highly unoriginal - ""Bang Bang, you're Dead""! The acting was something that I thought would be a concern. The film had seemed to me to be mainly a vehicle for adolescents to purve of the perfectly sculpted bodies of Jolie and Pitt. But they were actually really good. Brad Pitt is very adept at this style of comedy (as he displays in the ""Ocean's"" films) and Jolie is perfect in her role - it didn't require too much from her as she is a natural seductress but I didn't question her character once which means she did the job well! Another testament to their acting abilities is during the dinner scene after the big ""revelation"". With hardly any dialog they both manage to convey the tense situation to the audience who have no doubt in their minds about what is going on - not only was it a highly comedic scene, but it was pulled off so well that one can only take one's hat off to not only Pitt and Jolie, but also the director and writer alike! The music was downright funky, but without becoming overpowering. It was subtle yet poignant and therefore perfect. While the storyline itself was a tad weak and far-fetched, it doesn't really bother you as it is such an enjoyable film to watch that you just don't care. And at least it isn't inane. It is a very original film with quite a nice little message about marriage and ""sticking together"" and all that jazz. And that final scene is exactly what was needed. It brought the audience back to planet earth, settled them down and gave them one final laugh - leaving them with a very pleasant taste in their mouths and a desire for more. It achieved exactly what a film should achieve - a great deal of fun and a sense that the huge amount of money spent on the tickets was worth it for this one!"
"dredyoung","8","0","4","13 June 2005"," An Action Packed, Exaggerated, but Effective Metaphor for Marriage in the Modern (jungle) World
","The basic plot is of two secret assassins working for opposite agencies but who happen to meet, fall in love, and marry without knowing that they are both assassins for opposing agencies. Assassins, since they have fake identities and jobs, are not supposed to reveal their actual occupations or for whom they work. Such an arrangement, of course, would not encourage much authentic sharing in a marriage. In the beginning, they have the romantic and erotic excitement of their relationship to share, but as all couples find out, the flame of eroticism eventually turns into dying embers and, typically, there is nothing to fan it back to life. Also, beginning couples are satisfying their curiosity about what each other are really like. This 'also' part, of necessity, has to be missing from this ill-fated pairing of the aptly named 'John' and 'Jane' 'Smith'; the secret assassins working for opposing agencies. This movie is in part an exaggerated metaphor for communication in modern marriages in which couples' lives outside of the home have little in common with each other. Like the modern marriage, when interdependence begins to become a tug of war for equality and equity in sharing responsibilities and negotiation falters, then sharing personal, intimate information merely makes each more vulnerable to blackmail, one-up-man-ship, or revenge as they alternate between roles of victim and victimizer. This movie, then, is also a metaphor for a tight-lipped standoff in marriage. After a few years of unsuccessfully trying to form and maintain sharing roles in the home, staleness permeates the marital air. What are more critical in this case are the long, dry, empty years of not being able to communicate and 'share' what their daily life is like. Hence, they surrender and begin to accept their boredom with one another. So they, as with many couples, do not give up without a last 'token' attempt to salvage the marriage by seeing a marriage counselor. The script for the counseling sessions is compressed into brief statements, by both clients and counselor, which epitomizes the very essence of a typically long, spitefully, and pitifully drawn out process that in the end trudges down an inevitable road to failure and divorce. After the glow, and the ashes of a burned out marriage are about to be thrown out, suddenly there is an 'assignment' in which John and Jane are, seemingly, accidentally pitted against one another. Here, the plot thickens as they each discover they had attempted to 'rub out' one another. Through an of un-covering of each other's true identity and attempt at mutual destruction, the years of smoldering disaffection and resentment explodes into a pressure-cooker of roiling rage. Back home, they each deftly play the domesticated cat while suspecting the other of a sneaky plot to pounce with the lethal blow on their wary mouse. They continue circling in a to-the-death bout but now, as more open assaults at one another unfold, their roles of predators and prey escalate. Egged on by their co-workers, all out battle rages but ends in a draw. In the course of the battle they begin to have a genuine respect for each other's equality in skill and courage. This is the first key turning point. In spite of the great show of determination to destroy, they do not, well, really, emotionally they cannot, bring it off. The secret of their hidden, deep, persistent-against-all-odds love for each ekes out when neither can strike the final blow. This is the second key turning point. Being off guard in the heat of their battles, they are confused when the stealth troupes of both of their agencies enter the fray, attacking both of them. After successfully fending off onslaughts from both sides they meet with John's fellow agent who informs them that they indeed are both targets because no one wants two secret assassins of opposing agencies to be marriage partners. However, they are told that they have a way out. They must find the person, now being held hostage, who was target of the assignment when the fiasco started and surrender him to the agencies. Again, unsuspectingly, they are being setup by both sides so both of these birds can be killed with one stone (Uzi). Nevertheless, they eventually 'get it' and seize this as an opportune moment because they see that by the two best of the best killers teaming up they may defeat the assassins' assassins. When they survive after a harrowing all out war waged by hordes of the agencies' hit men, they pull out all the stops in brutal interrogation and confessing the truth about themselves. Surviving the worst of odds together forms the bond they had longed for all along. They now begin a genuine attempt at an authentic relationship based on mutual respect and a win-win strategy for negotiating equality and equity. Once again, love triumphs against all odds. The final metaphor for modern marriage is that fighting it out as equals, neither one surrendering ground, and developing mutual respect as equals with mutual support in their struggle to survive in the modern world can make a marriage work after all."

An ideal summer movie experience; from the moment it starts it's a pure adrenaline rush of energetic action scenes and hip dialogue, but the film's strongest asset is its clever since of humor. Pitt and Jolie are a sizzling duo, perform effective fight scenes/stunts, and spout diverting wisecracks that give the film a pleasant and playful feel throughout. It also manages to display some merits of a healthy marriage despite its silly, tongue-in-cheek content. An impressive showing from the director of The Bourne Identity, and sure to please fans just looking for a good time. ***"

","Mr and Mrs Smith is a very entertaining movie. There were a lot of people laughing at the humorous parts of the movie when I saw it today. The directing by Doug Liman is OK. Both Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are excellent actors. They play a husband and wife having marriage troubles who don't know that the other person is an assassin. Their sidekicks are interesting but this movie stops short of having an ensemble cast. The sets are really quite good. As respected film critic Roger Ebert said there is real chemistry between Pitt and Jolie in this film. Pitt works for the company which is slang for the CIA while Jolie is Jewish. America Canada and Britain helped Israel get statehood in 1948 because it was the right thing to do. Relations between the three countries have been cordial ever since. All three countries are united in trying to stop terrorism. The British Jewish and American characters in this film looked like they were on an intelligence exercise together. If CIA and MOSSAD agents ever married each other I think the world would go on and they could be genuinely in love too. I think that there should be a sequel or two to this movie."
"tinyinkling","8","0","4","12 June 2005"," Something for both sides of your brain
","""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" delivers two kinds of summer fare - the chic flick, and the action blockbuster - in one tasty package. The film opens with our stylishly-dressed couple at the marriage counselor. He says she's lost her spontaneity. She says he's too unreliable. When the counselor asks if they're honest with each other, she says, ""Yes. Mostly."" <br/><br/>Discovering exactly how honest, and how dishonest, they've been with each other is the driving question of the movie. But the answers to those questions come in the midst of flying bullets, pyrotechnics, chase scenes, close calls, and plenty of revealing shots for each actor. <br/><br/>Along the way, there is an intriguing subtext of the modern day roles of men and women in marriage, where passion comes from, and how succumbing to the first may spell the death of the second. <br/><br/>If you don't have an appreciation for both genres, you may find that either there's too much talking or alternately, there's too much violence. But if you enjoy both... or are thinking about a date with someone who strongly enjoys the other type of film... it's fun summer romp."

","First of all, this is the second movie I've seen of Brad Pitt's (the first was IwtV) and about the third or fourth of Angelina's. The chemistry between the both of these fine actors was very much of an upgrade than that of Brad and Catherine Zeta-Jones in Ocean's Twelve. It had the right amount of comedy but a little bit of an overkill with the action.<br/><br/>The thing that bugged me the most about this movie was, of course, it was rated PG-13. I know that this year's movie supply hasn't been so great, but downgrading it to a PG-13 to attract even younger audiences won't help by much!<br/><br/>This movie could have been a little better by extending the scenes with Brad and Angelina, and also have more of a storyline. And by doing this, probably would have been rated ""R"" and been better for it. I saw better scenes in the commercials than I did in the movie itself!<br/><br/>Overall, the acting was well done, action was extensive but okay i suppose, and the comedy was on point. 3 and a half out of five stars."

The action was very cool, especially in the scenes where they meet up at the house to fight and the last shootout scene towards the end. I also thought that some of the scenes could have been cut out, like when they were trying to avoid one another, but it all worked out for the best in the end. I know one thing for sure, if there was ever a sequel to be made, I know that I would go and see it.

","This film crackles with energy and excitement. Pitt and Jolie provide great chemistry, comic timing, and a clear mastery of weaponry. Their on screen presence is palpable.

It is different from the two aforementioned films in that it is unique in it's premise.<br/><br/>This is a dark love story/action film that is easy to follow. The dialog is smart, the action scenes well executed. The most captivating part of the film is that it is fun. The actors clearly enjoyed making the film, and the audience laughed heartily in response.<br/><br/>I have two points to criticize: 1. The sound editing - much of the exposition is done during car chases and explosions. It is difficult to hear some of the subtle dialog that lends itself to the story.<br/><br/>2. A few minor annoying plot holes, but not enough to detract in a major way.<br/><br/>This film is well worth the price of admission. Appropriate for ages 13 and up."

","Usually your reviewer puts a lot of thought into the movie choice of the week, but this week he went with gut instinct (or perhaps lower), had low to middling expectations but was very pleasantly surprised with the result.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star as John and Jane Smith, married for five, perhaps six years. John is a gut instinct kind of guy, who makes plans up on the spot, works out of a dockside warehouse (albeit with a Manhattan view), and is basically a bit of a slob. Jane, on the other hand, is a meticulous planner, is over-fussy about the way her household runs, and works in an all female office with décor similar to the X-Men headquarters.<br/><br/>We could go into the plot, but suffice to say the marriage has hit a calm spot - going to a marriage counselor with an upper middle class setting, reminded me somewhat of particular characters out of Desperate Housewives. Oh, and they still don't know each other is a top international assassin. Don't ask how they haven't found that out yet, it is not important to the enjoyment of the moment. As would probably happen with any further discussion of the plot.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn does his usual quick talking sidekick role as well as ever (in this case, as Pitt's boss), and Adam Brody from TV's 'The OC' has more than a few lines as well. Apart from those two, the other characters all fit into one of two categories, either cannon fodder or cute girl in black. Yes, let's not think too deeply about character development either, put it in the same box as the plot shall we? The strengths of this movie are the action set pieces and the sly sense of humour throughout, sometimes combined in the same scene, such as the extended car chase, beginning and ending with 'Making Love, Out Of Nothing At All'.<br/><br/>Or, after doing a mark each early in the movie, heading to the Coleman's for a neighbourly 'thing' to the strains of Amy Grant's 'Baby Baby'  the look on Jolie's face when she holds a baby as if it is an alien is priceless. Continuing the music theme, stopping in the middle of a huge gun battle to take refuge in a lift, with 'The Girl From Ipanema' as background muzak, is another delicious moment.<br/><br/>There are just too many of these moments to put together a full list  do I include the dinner where they realize each other's secret life, every bite analyzed for ulterior motives? Or do I leave out Pitt's reaction to his toys taken away in a moment of Jolie spite (every man in the cinema sympathizing completely, I am sure). And on it goes, what to mention what to omit.<br/><br/>The comedy highpoint, however, has to be Brody wearing a Fight Club t-shirt. Took me straight back to Pitt discussing the rules in that earlier movie ('rule one, there is no fight club, rule two, there is no fight club'), and again, he plays the role of Mr Smith with a grin on his face and an ease everyone can see. Actually, everyone looks like they are enjoying themselves in this movie.<br/><br/>Come for the sex appeal, stay for the laughs and action. Not since Bad Boys has there been such a laugh out loud, fun, entertaining time at the movies  best action comedy of the decade thus far."

What the couple don't know is that they're both assassins but someone else does find out and dispatches them to kill each other. That's it really. They find out, they fight, they exchange a few bitchy comments and destroy the matrimonial lair. Liman though is no slouch in the action department as he proved in the Bourne Identity and the couple bust each other up with enough destructive zeal to stop you getting bored, even if you're never exactly brimming with excitement. It's not much of comedy but there are a few mouth raising asides and Vince Vaughn is good value was Pitt's anxious friend and associate. A perfectly diverting two hours when all is said and done, sentiment free and worth seeing for Jolie's curves, the house is on fire moment and Seth from the O.C looking at an aggressive looking Pitt, wearing a fight club t-shirt, tied to a chair. Actually he didn't half look like Tyler did in the scene where Ed Norton was tied to that chair. Come to think of it, the Smith's shrine to unrestrained capitalism did go up in a firey ball of fury."
"jay-486","8","0","4","11 June 2005"," Surprisingly Funny Romantic Comedy
","In previous roles, neither Brad Pitt nor Angelina Jolie has shown that they have a flair for comedy. Because of this I was not expecting to laugh out loud while watching Mr. & Mrs. Smith, the much-gossiped about romantic comedy starring the two actors. But I did just that. Judging by the bursts of laughter from fellow moviegoers, I wasn't the only one who enjoyed this preposterously plotted flick.<br/><br/>The plot itself is somewhat absurd. A couple experience marital problems until they discover that they are both paid assassins who have been hired to kill one another. Putting aside the notion that the two actors are far too attractive to be paid assassins, it is difficult to believe that they could be married for five (make that six) years without knowing the other was a hired hit-man. Still, the movie is not meant for those questioning the quality of ideas coming out of Hollywood. This is a popcorn movie for those who want to escape the boredom of civilized suburbia.<br/><br/>What makes this movie work is the amazing chemistry Pitt and Jolie have on screen. There I said it. Sure I wanted to hate this movie for creating the tension that may have led, to the separation, of the world's most beautiful couple, but the truth is undeniable. Pitt and Jolie make a great couple - on film at least. The movie also benefits from some well-timed tongue-in-cheek screen writing and some fine comedic acting by Vince Vaughn. Vaughn plays John Smith's (Brad Pitt) faithful friend and sidekick and is mostly used as a comedic extra in the film.<br/><br/>The movie goes a little over board in the home-furnishing department, but I guess the producers were trying to appeal to the nation's indebted homeowners thinking of remodeling their abodes."

","Regardless of how one feels about Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's offscreen antics, its their on screen chemistry that really fires Mr. And Mrs. Smith. Without that chemistry much of the film would have been a disaster since the heart of the film is its spies lying to each other plot line. When Jolie and Pitt are on screen together sparks fly, whether they are having a nice dinner, sparing verbally or attempting to knock each other off. The film is full of funny lines that never seem to come off as one liners. They are merely funny things that you may think but never actually say to your spouse.

I like Angelina Jolie and I especially like to watch her in action roles (yes I love and own the two Tomb Raider films). Seeing her run around with a big gun, kicking butt, is FUN. She's as great in this kind of role as Diana Rigg was as TV's Emma Peel! A perfect fit. And Brad Pitt is an underrated actor, he is really very good, and he is funny in this movie! He has great comedic timing.<br/><br/>The plot is simple. Two professional assassins find out that they've been hired to kill the other. The plot is only barely complicated by the facts that (1) they are married to each other, and (2) they did not know until this point of the story the other's true occupation.<br/><br/>The ""eye candy"" factor is high: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, often scantily dressed, heavily breathing lines such as ""Who's your Daddy now?"" It's also an action-packed movie, with good dialogue, great chemistry between Pitt and Jolie, and plenty of (not too bloody) violence. It's much more tongue-in-cheek than the trailers indicate. And Pitt and Jolie get some great one-liners.<br/><br/>All in all, a highly entertaining ""popcorn"" movie; great summer flick. As we walked to the car I said ""It's sort of a mix of 'True Lies', 'Tomb Raider', 'The Avengers' (the old TV show, not that lousy movie), with a pinch of 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' thrown in. I really enjoyed it."" And look for a ""Fight Club"" reference, in the form of a t-shirt."

","This movie has been advertised and publicized and tabloid-ed for over 6 months, circulating rumors (and truths) have come out of the soup bowl and, in the end, Mr. and Mrs. Smith surpassed even MY expectations!<br/><br/>Brad and Angelina flow with ease as the uneasy, struggling, and dwindling married couple The Smith's, who are finding their marriage more of a struggle to live through then their jobs. When the truth is revealed to them both, the gloves and facades fall and the ammunition and knives come out.<br/><br/>The script is not as perfect as anyone would want it, but the actors and directing fuel this small engine to hit home hard. The action is very similar to Doug Liman's Bourne Identity, close up and in your face. It doesn't have the same touch as it does for Bourne, but it brings you into the action.<br/><br/>The summer has a perfect opening couple; Mr. and Mrs Smith is it's name."

","I don't know why they were trying to reach a younger audience by editing the would-be gritty sex scene to get the pg-13 rating. This movie is too smart for pubescent boys and girls on their first dates. Similar to Kill Bill in humor-action sense (minus the gore), and in character relationships. The behind the scenes look at spies was like an episode of The Venture Brothers. Bourne Identity + Arrested Development. Liman puts the ""man"" back in ""LIMAN IS THE MAN"" End comment. I don't like writing a minimum of ten lines. Ten lines is too many. Why should you have to read that much crap? I said all I wanted to say, just let me post!"

","Who can tell me what the terrific song is at both beginning and the near-end of the movie?

"cultjones","7","0","5","10 June 2005"," Laughing With The Smiths
","Angelina Jolie is breathtaking while the ladies will certainly swoon over the ever-cool Brad Pitt. Even though the public probably views Jen as a better match for Mr. Smith, the arresting Jolie does a commendable job of playing his better half in the movie.<br/><br/>The action scenes are engaging but it's the playful and almost childlike exchange between the couple that keeps the audience entertained. While not known for his comedic talents, Pitt delivers the laughs in his own unique manner and the amusing Vince Vaughn only adds to the entertainment.<br/><br/>Although burdened with a predictable plot and an anticlimactic ending reminiscent of a 'Gun Kata' fight sequence from Kurt Wimmer's Equilibrium, one still enjoys the film for what it is, a fun movie."
"silentlyscream","8","0","6","10 June 2005"," I'd buy it on DVD, but I wouldn't pay retail.
","I think this film was good value for money. It is entertaining and provides enough explosions and gunfire to entertain the average teenage male. Superior to, say, the James Bond formula, for two reasons: 1) Female lead character, who is not a damsel in distress, nor evil temptress 2) Less dialogue emphasis on gadgetry. Plus, the product-placement was less obvious, except the full-screen shot of Mr Smith's watch. There is definitely chemistry between the lead actors, and, surprisingly, the comedy was actually entertaining; though I think the director had problems maintaining tension in some of the action sequences."
"lillian_lin","8","0","4","9 June 2005"," Pretty funny
","I had an okay expectation for this movie, and what I received was simply OK (well maybe a bit above okay at funny moments). There were hilarious parts in there that weren't part of the trailer (which is good because then you still get some fun). Also, the story itself actually wasn't so bad. It actually had a twist, but was a little predictable as the time came. I wish the movie had focused a little more on the story than just Pitt and Jolie's shots, although their shots are probably what enticed many to watch this movie. I'm definitely not an expert, but I think the shots were okay as well. My friends who went with me wanted to watch it again, and it's indeed very entertaining to watch again. Jolie seems a lot hotter than Pitt in the movie, maybe it's her dress. Oh yes and her cool gadgets were awesome. I thought there would be more gadgets in the film (I'm quite attracted to them), but not much more than the ones shown in the trailer. To sum up, this is an entertaining movie that won't let the average viewer down. It's pretty Hollywood though! Haha."
"jitengami","6","0","10","4 June 2005"," A sexier True lies...
","The only thing funny about this film is Vince Vaugn. Pitt and Jolie are good, but there's no great chemistry. There's hardly any supporting cast, other than Vaugn, so the whole film revolves around Pitt and Jolie, which becomes slightly boring and predictable (even if it is good eye candy for the audience). The dialogue is very suspect, but you can't knock the action sequences, especially the highway chase which is top dollar.<br/><br/>Of course it's sexy and glamorous, which is what you'd expect from a film with these two as the main characters, but it plays off that way too much, and the story fails due to there not being a genuine bad guy. <br/><br/>A decent Friday night date flick, but nothing more. Arnie and Jamie Lee Curtis still rule as the best undercover agents."
