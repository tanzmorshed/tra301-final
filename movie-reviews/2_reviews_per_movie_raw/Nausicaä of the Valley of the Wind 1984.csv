"GDC","10","211","230","18 November 1999"," A masterpiece, if you can find the real version
","First off, let me state emphatically that I'm referring to the REAL version of the film, not the pathetic crippled creature distributed as ""Warriors of the Wind"" on video. Although I must admit that I first fell in love with the movie in that form, I have now seen the full subtitled version, and I place a hideous curse on those who hacked over 20 minutes from its running time.<br/><br/>Although the incredible ""Princess Mononoke"" later upstaged this early work in terms of art and detail, in many ways I still prefer ""Nausicaa"". Its imaginitive and well-conceived world puts me in mind of Dune with its feuding factions, its giant creatures, and its strong ecological message. Even with a rather long running time, the story moves very briskly (boiled down as it was from a very lengthy manga series). The music deserves special mention, as well, as it is a large step up from the electronic pop stylings of most anime.<br/><br/>If you can get your hands on a copy of the original version, you'll find it more than worth the effort."
"ElMaruecan82","10","21","21","27 July 2017"," If Miyazaki had made that film only, his legacy would have been the same...
","The name of Nausicaä belongs to Greek mythology; she was the Princess who saved Ulysses from drowning. And the ""Valley of the Winds"" was loosely inspired from the tragedy of Minimata Bay and the way it maintained its ecosystem viable despite the pollution. ""Nausicaä of the Valley of the Winds"" finds the perfect balance between the theme of nature always finding its way and the dramatic struggle of a heroine saving humanity from ""drowning"" in belligerent wickedness.<br/><br/>I'm mentioning Minimata but the tragedy of Fukushima could have inspired a similar intuition that technological advances could only lead to the downfall of humanity inasmuch as men continue to display the same carelessness and arrogance. In his ""Nausicaä"", Hayao Miyazaki doesn't warn us but rather confronts us to a plausible future, a future with a few survivors driven to the last corners of Earth where wind and water prevented a toxic jungle name Fukaï from spreading.<br/><br/>The film, all in visual splendor, displays the usual Sci-fi and Fantasy archetypes but they don't distract from the environmentalist and pacifist message. We accept them in the sense that the story is set one thousand years after the apocalypse and we expect technology to have produced jet-propelled gliders and flying vessels. But the film also has a Renaissance look à la ""Princess Mononoke"", it's not an artistic license, the privileged people of the Valley represent a wiser side of humanity that got back to the roots, acknowledging the eminence of nature, a renaissance indeed.<br/><br/>They live in an oasis-like area where the air is breathable, outside; they must wear a gas mask, accentuating the dystopian look even within a natural setting. The hostility of nature is symbolized by giant mutant insects and the Ohm, armored trilobite-like insects whose eyes turn to an ominous red whenever they feel threatened. But Miyazaki never lets us get the wrong idea about these Ohm, understand they're not the most life-threatening creatures out there.<br/><br/>There's a key scene right in the beginning where a little fox-like creature bites Nausicaä, she patiently keeps her finger until its frenzy fades out and then the animal licks her wound. This moment is pivotal because it highlights the real tragedy that caused men's downfall, not violent actions but immediate assumptions of violence causing bad reactions. Only Nausicaä is capable of showing mercy and empathy toward any living creature, she challenges all the common conceptions and even tries to understand the place she lives in, which is the epitome of wisdom.<br/><br/>From the spores taken during regular expedition, she discovers in her laboratory that plants are capable of producing air, later in the film that some jungle plants purify the polluted topsoil and produce clean water. In other words, life always finds a way but humans can't see it. Nausicaä becomes the messianic character that will open the eyes of humanity, and as truth can be stranger than fiction, she's also a pivotal moment in Miyazaki's career, as the first film to have emerged from the fertile soil of his own imagination.<br/><br/>Nausicaä foreshadows all the elements that will define his work: the independent free-spirited heroine, the aerial settings and the environmental and anti-war messages, and more than that, the revolutionary notion that you don't need villains to make a story. Everyone is imperfect and fallible, even the most violent attacks are meant as defensive moves or precautions. The film contains a lot of action, lethal explosions and battles, people die by the sword, including Nausicaä's but Miyazaki couldn't have been more pacifists, every detail says in subtext that violence isn't the answer.<br/><br/>Indeed, how can the cause of the trouble ever be the solution? Miyazaki, a master storyteller, delivers crucial information even in the most unnoticeable moments, even the opening credits show through Roman mosaic and medieval tapestry the fate of the modern world. Seven giants launching immense fire blasts (metaphor for nuclear power?) into modern buildings, it's just as if Hiroshima was depicted like the Pompeii eruption. But what is the tragedy exactly, that history taught men a lesson or that men didn't learn it? <br/><br/>Nausicaä is set at a time that looks like a second chance but people are still fighting for good or bad reasons, from a sword master and father-figure named Lord Yupa, a young Pejite interceptor who respects Nausicaä's actions and the Tolmekian queen who (like Lady Eboshi from ""Mononoke"") is perhaps the tumultuous counterpart to Nausicaä, mutilated by the creatures, she believes in violence as the language of the force, illustrating its dangerously communicative effect, the never-ending spiral that killed the world or that might lead to a third worldwide conflict.<br/><br/>And in the midst of nihilistic violence and desolation, Nausicca emerges as a beautifully inspirational heroine. There's a hypnotic flashback (with a so-catchy playful tone) where Nausicaä's father kills a baby Ohm, on the basis that human and insects can't live together. The whole conviction of Nausicaä is that every creature has its place on Earth; it's not just about empathy but the unshakable faith on Nature's equilibrium. It is very significant that the most beautiful images from the film, all in golden yellow, are provided by the Ohm's tentacles, weren't they supposed to be the ugly monsters? <br/><br/>Yet, at the time of its release, the film was badly edited for foreign audiences and lost into translation to become some Manga adventure in the air, and the Ohm were indeed hostile creatures. It's just as if Miyazaki was ahead of his time and it would take one decade and half before people would come back to their senses and realize that this isn't ""Flash Gordon"". Nausicaä is about conviction and goodness, pacifism and environmentalism deprived from any political innuendo.<br/><br/>Miyazaki drew the original Manga so the film could be made, showcasing as much confidence as his heroine. In a way, Miyazaki was the Nausicaä of animation, a man with a vision, spirit and guts."
"TanjBennett","10","132","151","15 April 2003"," loyalty, bravery, and adventure after an apocalypse
","This was the film which introduced me (and many others in the 1980s) to Miyazake, and even in the form of a poor quality VHS on an ordinary TV, it was amazing.  By 1984 Miyazake was already well known in Japan for his anime work in film, TV, and for the comic strip that this film was based upon.<br/><br/>In this early full length film he really got to spread his wings.  There are fantastic aerial sequences like the jet-glider evading the flying snakes, which (this predates computed 3D, and aerial sequences are present in most of his work) are just a tour-de-force of imagination and geometry.  And yet this is a world that feels very organic, not geometric, with a cast of characters drawn in a unique cross between hobo, samurai, and pirate - totally blending in to an imaginary post apocalyptic world where humans scratch out a precarious life in villages hidden in the few green valleys left in a world of desert, where the only remaining resources are wind, sunlight, and humans.<br/><br/>But it is also a world of enormous dangers, including airborne bandits and the strange, mutated creatures that have evolved to control the barren and scarred earth.  When our heroine's valley home is attacked by raiders, she embarks on an adventure against them that will lead her, and some unlikely allies found along the way, to an eventual confrontation combining warring armies of bandits, ancient machines of infernal destruction, and the implacable, mysterious, threatening beasts which roam the badlands.  The pace is swashbuckling - if this were a book, it would be one you could not stop reading.<br/><br/>It has the feel of the original comic books, but plays out wonderfully on the screen - you don't need to know the comics.  The style is very unique. Even though it is very stylized (no photorealism here), you immediately get the feeling of the world and the characters.  The story works for children of all ages (mine both first saw this before they were 6, and have memorized it long since), and combined with the wonderful visuals it is a treat for adults too.  As a genre I would classify it as soft (no attempt at scientific correctness) sci-fi rather than fantasy, though some might think it more a work of fantasy.  It is fascinating partly because its roots in style and action are unexpected for a western viewer.  Japanese manga and stories had evolved in their own way, and although this is early Miyazake, it is already a product of that mature and distinct art form.<br/><br/>As always with Miyazake - if you haven't seen his work, well you haven't seen anything like it, and it is time you did."
"insightstraight","Null","149","172","19 February 2004"," THE film to challenge people's assumptions about anime.
","I saw the dubbed version years ago and, even in that form, was taken by the imaginative visuals, interesting storyline, and worthwhile characters. I was also impressed by the fact the lead character was a strong young woman, who was a ""warrior"" yet whose greatest strength lay in her compassion (rather than striving to become a female Rambo.)<br/><br/>I tracked down a copy of the VHS and sent it to my young nieces, pleased with a ""kid's"" movie which provided a positive role model without being dumb. The movie captivated them as well -- they wore the tape out, and it started them on a lifelong interest in anime. It was they who sent me the uncut subtitled version years later, completing the circle.<br/><br/>Nausicaa is decent science fiction, often breath-taking animation, and unusually *human* characters, and every time I see it I am glad I returned. Everyone should give it a chance, especially those who have written off anime as ""round eyed kids and lots of explosions""."
"mahlersoboes","9","66","74","25 May 2005"," A Masterpiece of Animated Cinema
","Director Hayao Miyazaki won a place in my heart after I saw his 2001 film Spirited Away. I'm in no position to claim to be an expert on Miyazaki (I've only seen three of his films), nor am I really a big fan of Japanese animation; but I can safely say that Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind is one of the very best animated films I have ever seen. The beauty of the animation is stunning, with its close attention to detail--every frame is constructed as a work of art--and the story is enthralling. As with other Miyazaki films, the majority of characters are much more three-dimensional that you typically get in Western animated features, and nearly all of them aren't exactly what they seem to be.<br/><br/>Nausicaä, which is based on Miyazaki's gargantuan Manga series, is set in the distant future, after fires destroyed much of the earth. The world is being consumed by the Sea of Decay, a toxic forest that spreads through airborne spores and is protected by giant insects called ohmu. The Valley of the Wind is one of the last pure places on earth, and its Princess, Nausicaä, is a strong-willed yet free-spirited young woman seeking to solve the mystery of the Sea of Decay. A nearby nation, which claims to have harnessed the power that allowed humans to rule the earth a thousand years before, takes over after a plane carrying a mysterious living cargo crashes in the valley. What follows in the film is a struggle, not of good versus evil, but of man versus nature. The story is complex, as is its message, and Miyazaki has ingeniously spun deep complexities into the animated characters: what look like foes may not be, and what look like friends may be a bit more dangerous.<br/><br/>The animation is colorful, sweeping, expansive, and beautiful, as are the plot and characters. There is an immediacy to the story that makes a big emotional impact and makes us question how we handle our position in nature. As one of the characters in the film asks, have humans become but a tribe destined to be swallowed by the Sea of Decay? It is ultimately a film about compassion in the face of violence and war, which is what makes it so different from Western features.<br/><br/>Disney's recent DVD release is excellent. The film can be watched either in the original Japanese audio or Pixar's dub with Patrick Stewart and Uma Thurman, and there are separate subtitles for each language track--a literal one (hallelujah!) for the Japanese track, and a more closed-captions style set for the English track. The film is so stunning in the Japanese that I have never considered watching the dub, though a fellow film buff has said that it is ""not so bad."" After this film was released in the US in the 1980s in a completely mangled version called Warriors of the Wind, Miyazaki suspended all US rights of all his other films until the distributor would honor the stipulation that they be released without any editing. The fact that Disney, which is known for watering down nearly everything it touches, has done this with such a non-Western-style movie is amazing."
"Lupercali","8","88","106","18 September 2004"," The first of the 'canonical' Miyazaki films.
","The first thing to establish is that this is a science fiction epic. It has more in common with 'Dune' or any number of SF novels - Brian Aldiss's 'Hothouse' springs to mind for one- than it does with a typical western animated children's film. Therefore one's expectations should be a little different, and ultimately it was the SF aspect which gave the movie such a high grade in my books. Whereas it didn't have quite the emotional clout that I look for in an animated feature, it was a stupendously told SF story.<br/><br/>Technically not a Ghibli film (Miyazaki actually used the studio which did most of 'The Last Unicorn', and which more or less became Ghibli when 'Laputa' was made a couple of years later), 'Nausicaa' is a far-future SF story with a princess/warrior/nature-lover heroine and strong environmental themes. There's also an opposing princess/leader trying to use technology to overcome the apparently hostile environment. If you're starting to think 'Princess Mononoke', you'd be on the right track. In some ways 'Nausicaa' seems like an early stab in the direction of 'Mononoke', though the latter would delve far more into spirituality and mythology, eschewing the SF aspects.<br/><br/>There aren't really any major weak points in Nausicaa - unless you count the frustrating 12 drawings per second animation which I constantly complain about in Japanese animation. The backgrounds aren't as amazing and the animation not as good as the last few Ghibli films, but for 1984 it was plenty good enough. I have a fairly trivial complaint in that the character of Kuratowa is drawn in a slightly more 'anime' style, ala Lupin III, whereas all of the other characters are done in a realistic style. He just seems a little out of place, though he's quite delightfully drawn.<br/><br/>The really strong points of the movie are its pacing (at least until the very end. Miyazaki was unhappy with the end too), its story telling, which manages to be sophisticated without being impossibly complex, its engrossing background drawings and settings, - and most of all in the amazing attention to detail in the fully realized post-apocalypse SF-fantasy world in which the story is set. Every little thing is worked out and placed such that you find yourself admiring inventions, ideas, structures, creatures, etc which don't draw attention to themselves, but simply exist as part of the backdrop of the movie. Of course 'Nausicaa' had existed for several years as a serialised Manga, so Miyazaki no doubt knew its universe inside-out.<br/><br/>There's a very clever plot, which I won't give away, but which involves humanity's relationship with the Earth and nature.<br/><br/>It's the sort of movie which you can get thoroughly caught up in, and which will stand repeated viewings. It really is a film which is perfectly pitched at both a young and an adult audience. As Miyazaki's second feature film it is also, rightly or wrongly, usually considered the start of Studio Ghibli, and is arguably worth watching for historical reasons, too.<br/><br/>Not the very best from Miyazaki or Ghibli, but an auspicious beginning.<br/><br/>PS, in case you didn't know, there was a heavily butchered US version floating around called 'Warriors of the Wind', which is universally reviled as a disgrace. Just to make it confusing, some of the Japanese copies are also called 'Warriors of the Wind'. The thing to look for is the 116 minute running length. If you get that, you've got the right one. At the moment the only way you can get the film is in Japanese dialog with English subtitles. Personally I'd go ahead and do that, rather than wait while Disney squats on the US distribution rights (Amazon gives it a release date of 2010 for God's sake). You can always replace it later.<br/><br/>Good stuff."

","The film of all times. My personal favorite of all films, anime and non-anime. It has it all, a great, involving story that holds many important lessons of life. Interesting characters. Action, adventure, and above all feeling, the mood just sucks me in and holds on till the very end and beyond. The music is epic, and the animation is top class. The setting is a futuristic kind of midevil inspired fantasy... if that says anything... but anyway it feels very real although fantastic and apeals to me. This movie is from the very heart of Hayao Miyazaki, the master of anime... Its so sad that the dubbed version was so butchered, it was the first version I saw(actualy the swedish dubbing of the american dubbing(sigh)) and I thaught it was great, but now that I have seen the original, a new door has opened and revealed a true masterpiece. I recomend this film to all and everyone. Average 10(10)"
"JTurner82","10","25","30","20 March 2005"," Early masterpiece by Miyazaki finally gets the treatment it deserves.
","Before I start my review, let me state that I did manage to see this film subtitled at an art museum in New York. For me, it was a very interesting experience to discover Miyazaki in his youngest days. While some may find the quality of this film to be a bit dated upon initial glance, it is important to remember that NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND was made back in 1984, so the animation, likewise, does not have as much polish as Miyazaki's later work displays. But this is not to say that NAUSICAA is unwatchable because of that. This is a deeply complex, imaginative tale set in a post-apocalyptic world which will remind many of PRINCESS MONONOKE, only the protagonist is a girl. Nausicaa is a compassionate princess who prefers to solve problems with peace, not vengeance. Her struggle to resolve a bitter conflict between two warring kingdoms and prevent them from reaching her home valley is not a good vs. evil tale. The characters are all flawed, believable people with their own agendas and redeeming qualities.<br/><br/>In a testament to Miyazaki's admiration of nature, the film offers a sub-plot involving a supposedly poisonous jungle. The product of a terrible global war, this thick, lush forest not only showcases Miyazaki's imagination (those insects sure are creepy-looking!) but also emphasizes the dangers of world pollution.<br/><br/>While NAUSICAA is an older movie from Miyazaki, it manages to hold surprisingly well--most classics have such staying power.<br/><br/>Its long journey to America is a story in and of itself. In 1985 (a year after the film broke records in Japan), NAUSICAA was brought to the America--retitled WARRIORS OF THE WIND, drastically altered, and cut by a quarter of its two-hour running time, much to the outrage of Miyazaki and his colleagues. Since that time, Miyazaki declared that any adaptations of his films for American release must be done under the supervision of his company, Studio Ghibli.<br/><br/>As much as some folks love to hate Disney these days, one can credit them for taking the time to strike a deal with Miyazaki to distribute his films globally. While the Mouse House has made their share of marketing mistakes with his films, the dubs they've produced thus far--KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE, PRINCESS MONONOKE, SPIRITED AWAY, and CASTLE IN THE SKY--all have maintained a quality of excellence and strong performances from a solid cast of well-known actors and actresses. This brand new English version of NAUSICAA is no exception.<br/><br/>As the title character, Alison Lohman provides commendable sincerity, compassion, and vulnerability, and is amply supported by a grand cast of side characters, which include Uma Thurman (the embittered empress Kushana); Chris Sarandon (the sneaky, smarmy Kurotowa); Edward James Olmos (feisty, loyal Mito); and unexpected appearances by veteran character stalwarts Tress MacNeille, Jeff Bennett, Tony Jay (who does a brief opening voice-over), and the Little Mermaid herself, Jodi Benson. Shia LaBeouf's Asbel sounds a bit rocky at first, but he grew on me. Mark Hamill, fresh from his outstanding turn as the evil Muska on the brilliant yet under-appreciated (on some places anyway) CASTLE IN THE SKY dub, plays a small role as the Mayor of Pejite. He only appears in two scenes, and consequently, his performance here isn't as remarkable as his work in CASTLE IN THE SKY, but it's nonetheless great to hear his golden voice in another Miyazaki dub. Arguably the highlight of this dub is Patrick Stewart as Nausicaa's mentor, Lord Yupa. He speaks with strong Shakespearian diction and carries the dub as a whole through his subtle, charismatic rendition of this skilled swordsman.<br/><br/>Miyazaki declared that any new adaptation of his masterpiece should be nothing but a straight translation and no cuts. English dub scriptwriters Donald H. Hewitt and Cindy Davis Hewitt (who worked on SPIRITED AWAY) honor his wishes through their adaptation, remaining faithful to the story while tweaking a bit of terminology for comprehension purposes.<br/><br/>As with Miyazaki's other works, Joe Hisaishi provides the music score. Compared to the more lush soundtracks he composed for Miyazaki's later films, his score for NAUSICAA, while undeniably beautiful, occasionally comes off as a tad primitive, notably when it breaks into sometimes jarring techno-synth jingles. For better or worse, his score remains intact in the new cut of NAUSICAA which will no doubt please purists. I was a bit disappointed, however--especially when his ambitious reworking of the CASTLE IN THE SKY score (composed exclusively for that dub) turned out so well IMO. A film like this deserves a 5.1 remix! Nonetheless, it's my one quibble of this otherwise top-notch English track of Miyazaki's most revered masterpiece.<br/><br/>The DVD sports a near flawless visual transfer and a humble serving of extras--which include the typical English voice talent featurette we saw on Disney's previous wave of Miyazaki's films, trailers and TV spots, and a second disc devoted entirely to storyboards. The most noteworthy feature on this disk is a 30-minute long documentary, ""The Birth of Studio Ghibli"", which is undistractingly dubbed into English. For fans that are curious about the upbringing of this animation studio and wondering which of their films have yet to be released, this is a must-see.<br/><br/>As someone who has been very pleased with Disney's releases of Miyazaki's works so far, I am delighted to say that they have done yet another bang-up job on polishing this legendary classic for new generations to cherish. Don't be fooled by its primitive looks; NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND's status as a masterpiece resonates from the first minute to the last."
"choden","Null","60","79","10 December 2004"," A Corner Stone
","Now that everyone knows Miyazaki is a great talent and he has been doing many great stuff, his earlier works are internationally popular. After Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi, Miyazaki's well deserved fame got huge. Since his fame increased, his older works has been taken from the drawers to upper shelves and this is leading to discussions of which of his works are better than which. Kaze no tani no Naushika has been compared many times with his Mononoke - hime, however regarding how Naushika formed a perfect background for the further works of Miyazaki, this comparison is not very fair. Kaze no tani no Naushika is the basis of Miyazaki's charming mastery which becomes more and more apparent in 1990s. It features one of the greatest heroines in anime history in an unusual sci-fi environment. The story of the film shows us how resourceful human imagination can be. What makes Naushika a cornerstone is not only this efficient story telling but also the visual fiesta that it has been presented in. So lose no time in comparing this film to another, instead savor it again and again."
"silentcheesedude","8","46","60","27 February 2005"," A Miyazaki masterpiece
","Brilliant, captivating, and sometimes just plain awesome are some of things that come to mind while watching yet another one of Miyazaki's epic tales: Nausicaä of the Valley of the Winds. Deliberately slow-moving at points, yet undeniably exciting in and out of it's action sequences, and a fantastic introduction to anime itself.<br/><br/>Without revealing too much of the plot, it takes us through the life of Nausicaa, a princess of a small village, and her struggles to stop warring nations from destroying an important source that can save the planet. The planet has already gone through a major destruction that nearly wiped out humanity, and their are large insects called ohmu, that guard the source that is spreading through the world.<br/><br/>Miyazaki introduces an empowerment of female characters in his animes, such as Princess Mononoke, Kiki's Delivery Service, and his most recent, Howl's Moving Castle (Hauru no ugoku shiro). The characters are done with style and care, and, in Nausicaa, there is no exception.<br/><br/>It amazes me that this film created some controversy when released, being banned in Poland because of it's depiction of an ecological disaster. Though the movie is obviously fantasy, it turns out that some may consider it a touchy subject. I didn't find any offense whatsoever with anything the movie showed, just a futuristic disaster no doubt caused by man.<br/><br/>Combining fantasy and science-fiction, Nausicaa is nice to look at. It certainly shows it's age when compared to some newer animes, not having the help from high-end computers. Considering it was done in the 80's, Miyazaki's production team did a great job. Little details, backgrounds, gadgets, & animals are drawn slightly better then some Japanese animes from that time.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that my review is based on the Disney release (Feb 2005). It's cleaned up, unedited, with new voices from well known actors that sound great (but I still prefer subtitles). Keep far away from the old version 'Warriors of the Wind', which chops off more then half-hour from the movie.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"

","""Nausicaa of the valley of the wind"" is about an epic story of mankind in the wastelands of polluted earth. Thousand years after the end of industrialized civilization mankind is once again in the wrath of nature as it is taking it's vengeance for the brutality it has received from the human. Although being an action packed adventure, the main story of the movie is one of the most humane stories ever told. Nausicaa, one of the most powerful characters of modern motion picture, tries to find a way to make the connection between earth and human to save mankind from extinction. I will stop here for rest of the story you have to find out yourself. I can assure you that you will not regret it. And for movie lovers it is a movie that you just cannot miss.<br/><br/>There are actually only three 100% real Hayao Miyazaki movies. They are 1.Nausicaa of the valley of the wind, 2.Laputa: Castle in the sky and 3.Princess Mononoke. All these films are considered as masterpieces of the history of animation. Of all the movies that Hayao Miyazaki has created ""Nausicaa's"" is the best. Many people will argue with me on that point because they have not seen the original uncut Disney version. If you are a people outside South America and speak in a different language than English and Disney's animations are available in your native language only then you can understand the quality of a dubbing of Disney. So please see the movie with the English dub by Disney, I am pretty much optimistic that you will surely say that ""Nausicaa of the valley of the wind"" is the greatest movie ever built.<br/><br/>NB1: Please try to watch only the Disney dubbed movies of studio Ghibli if that is not found it is better to watch it English subbed.<br/><br/>NB2: Try to watch the real Miyazaki movies (the three I mentioned here and whisper of the heart) in theaters or at night in a quiet place. Believe me I have tried this and I was able to understand the movies better. <br/><br/>NB3: one of the main problems in Miyazaki's movies is the expectation. Here are some tips the three movies I mentioned here are real movies (I don't like to degrade them by saying they are animes) not cartoons. Howls moving castle and Lupin the third are animation movies and the rest are cartoons just like cars or toy story. <br/><br/>NB4: Many people argue about the fact of watching foreign movies dubbed. I won't argue with them. I will just go with Miyazaki in the point, he told 20% of the movie will be lost if you read the subtitles instead of watching the movie. <br/><br/>Special request: because of the kidified version of ""Nausicaa of the valley of the wind"" many people have rated it quite badly. So please watch the movie rate it according to your enjoyment and rate my review too. <br/><br/>Many thank for viewing."
"Quinoa1984","10","9","11","5 March 2007"," a tale pure goodness, and the inanities of greed, in human beings, set in Miyazaki's amazing world
","Before Princess Mononoke, which is still for me Hayao Miyazaki's greatest work, he made this film, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, which like that other later film addressed issues that are paramount for the filmmaker: the environment, and the Earth, and how human beings can have highs and lows in attention to it. On the one hand Miyazaki gives us who is perhaps one of the purest heroes in any animated film, Japanese or otherwise, with Nausicaa as a woman who doesn't want killing on any side, and knows that there can be some peace with the environment of the world. <br/><br/>Her greatest strengths end up coming out in various ways, like when she goes to stop the Ohm, the big beetle-insects that are the largest ""threat"" (threat in quotes because it depends on the reaction of the two sides- the Tolmekian and the Pejite- and how either one inflames the reaction of the Ohm)- and in her general attitude to killing and violence. It's a fragile world, and she's perhaps one of only a few, and the only one willing to 'go the distance', to understand how what remains underground, what can't be seen, can make a difference. She's like a big action hero for preservationists and pacifists, but it's such a strongly defined character that the basic qualities come out wonderfully, like when she has to contend with her obvious emotional reaction to her father being slain (almost a Star Wars 'force' moment if you ask me).<br/><br/>So as she represents the good, there is the other side, which is represented by not necessarily the outright evil, even if the Tolmekian find the only way to combat anything is through warrior actions, but by ignorance and greed. It's not always as simple as that, and one could see a little dimension to the princess Kushuna, but even there the essentials get burned down to not just Miyazaki's points, but what works for the structure of classic fantasy. It might be tricky for Miyazaki to balance out his message of peace and understanding with what should be a sensational entertainment of a world 1000 years from now following an apocalypse; it treads the line, as Mononoke did, of becoming incoherent with the message and the manipulation of the audience. <br/><br/>But Miyazaki happens to be intelligent enough to trust the audience on the front of the message, and so he puts up his film in his usual thrust of indelible, one-of-a-kind images and exciting action. I especially liked seeing the Ohm themselves, one by one looking like even more detailed, nuanced versions of the Garthem in the Dark Crystal. Or in the sky-flying scenes, where the clouds are like unique formations that can't really be of the world we're in, but are in this world nonetheless that Miyazaki forges from classic mythology, reinterpretations of forests and insects, and post-apocalyptic technology out of a high-powered junk-yard.<br/><br/>And on top of this, as a word of note, this grandiose (in a good way) kind of epic work is supplanted with a better than expected voice cast- for the English language dub on the new DVD. They help back up the pieces of Miyazaki's world where there is some science fiction, but not in a fully compiled sense (if anything it's sort of like a 'used' science fiction world like Blade Runner, in part I mean). There's also some moments in the classical style, of a hero coming into her own that might seem too reminiscent of other movies. But Nausicaa is backed up by several cool supporting characters, like the equally heroic Lord Yuru, and the conflicted Pejite Asbel who has to choose the greater good (and common sense, in the Miyazaki form) over his tribe's priorities. <br/><br/>By the end, it actually left me like Totoro did with a huge, well-earned smile on my face, due to it being one of those happy endings that is so unlikely, yet is done as if there could be no other way in Miyazaki's universe. It's fresh and sublime anime, and the master of Studio Ghibli at one of his best."
"blackhawk.sc","8","48","78","9 October 2000"," Unlike anything you've seen
","Usually I try to compare one anime with another but I find it impossible to do for Nausicaa. I doubt if any other anime tried to repeat (or at least not successfully) the combination of science fiction, drama and medievalism that's in this film. However the most captivating (yet stereotypical perhaps) aspect of Nausicaa is her sympathy to all living things and her uncanny intuition about the things around her. Her abilities are the only drawback to this film because such characters can be found in most anime involving a heroine, whereas the storyline makes it a most unique experience.<br/><br/>I was somewhat dissappointed with the ending. I won't give it away but the character of the Princess was just made to conform to the ""standards of a heroine"". Animation was acceptable but not superb although the designs of some landscapes and characters were spectacular. Overall an 8."

","I have been watching Anime since I can remember. Of every single one of the Miazaki films, and all the other Anime films that I have seen, without a doubt, this has to be my favorite one of all time. This movie is just so incredibly beautiful in every way. The characters are so easy to fall in love and sympathize with. The scenery and music are both simply spectacular. Hayao Miazaki is obviously a man who cares deeply for the environment, and I truly think this film shows his undeniable love and compassion for all living things better than all of his movies. This Anime contains some of the most powerful and touching scenes I have ever seen in any movie, anime or no. I cry without fail every time I watch it.

"hooby-1","10","11","16","14 February 2006"," Miyazakis very best
","of all the movies i've ever seen (including nearly all of Miyazakis films) i can't seem to remember a single one that fascinated me as much as Nausicaa... <br/><br/>Kaze no Tani no Naushika opened on March 11, 1984 in japan. It's big success lead to the founding of Studio Ghibli, the film studio where all Miyazaki films after Nausicaa where made.<br/><br/>There is also a Manga of the same name, which was drawn by Miyazaki as sort of promotion, after the film was rejected by his financiers. After the success of the Manga (which counted already 16 chapters back then) the planned film finally got into production. The Manga should continue after that for a total of 13 years (with breaks) until it came to an unsuspected ending in chapter 59, that is quite different from what you might guess after seeing the film.<br/><br/>>>Around the mid 1980s, a severely-edited version of this film was released in video under the title Warriors of the Wind. The editing was done without the knowledge of Miyazaki or Studio Ghibli. They were unhappy when they learned about it and want those who have seen it ""to dismiss it from /their/ minds.<< (Nausicaa.net)<br/><br/>This is the reason why all negotiations about translations of Studio Ghibli films were so hard: After that disappointment Miyazaki won't allow any cutting or changing of his films. Warriors of the Wind was a Movie that had nothing to do with the original film and better never had existed at all...<br/><br/>so, what is the real film about?<br/><br/>1000 years after the breakdown of all industrialized civilization in a war only remembered as ""the seven days of fire"", mankind is on the brink of extinction. a deadly forest of fungi - spreading poisonous spores and gases - spreads over the world and threatens the very survival of the human race. this is the world that Nausicaa lives in, and amongst all the people fearing and hating the forest and the monstrous insects protecting it, she seems to be the only one full of love for all life, even the forest and the insects.<br/><br/>i have seen this film countless times again and again. so many times, that i can watch the Japanese version without subtitles and still understand every word that's spoken (without knowing a single word of Japanese)... i don't like to watch the translated movie (neither the English nor the German one) since Nausicaa doesn't seem to be the same girl like in the original. there's much too much anger in her voice, which absolutely doesn't fit her at all. she seems so naive at times, or even dumb... i'd really advise anyone rather to watch the original version with subtitles than any dubbed version. <br/><br/>so what is it, that makes this film so special, so extraordinary? IMHO it is Nausicaa herself! the film is great in all aspects: the story, the (absolutely not flat or typical) characters, atmosphere, etc... and still she outshines all of that. although she seems so fragile and helpless at times, she is incredibly strong and powerful. a typical Miyazaki heroine. but the one thing that i find adorable the most: she has (nearly) totally freed herself of all hate. she doesn't judge others because of their opinions or goals, even if they collide with her own... and i really admire that. that is what makes her a real hero in my eyes. she has something that doesn't seem to exist in the real world out there: unbroken, untainted love..."

","""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"" was Miyazaki's second movie, adapted from his own comic book. Viewers of the film may become involved in debates regarding the movie's relation to the comic(they are exceedingly different). I personally advise looking at them both as separate, but equally great pieces of art.<br/><br/>Regarding the film: The music is lush(the first film score of Miyazaki-veteran Jo Hisaishi), the animation impressive despite a few passages of static character movements, and the eponymous heroine is a figure of brilliant characterization; gentle, kind, valiant, passionate and pained.<br/><br/>It may lack the cognizant wisdom of ""Princess Mononoke"", perhaps, but NOTVOTW doesn't suffer by the comparison.

","This is an epitome of animation and storytelling at it's absolute best.  I am so glad that Miyazaki was able to tell the story of young Nausicaa, both in story form (the comics-- available on-line) and the silver screen.  The movie brings the four-dimensional characters to life (they also change in time) in one of the most thrilling movies of all time.  I can recommend this majestic sci-fi tale for action lovers of any age, and most wonderful for young girls, as Sandra/Nausicaa is one of the few human women in animation/TV/movies that is strong, independent, and caring for the people she rules."

This fascinating and haunting adventure set in the post-apocalyptic wasteland world by the great Hayao Miyazaki and happens upon a thousand years after a nuclear war left the Earth as an aftermath , with the barren and stark lands . Human race has destroyed the Earth in the ""Seven Days of Fire"". Now, there are small pockets of humans that survive . Warrior/pacifist Princess Nausicaä desperately fights to avoid two warring countries from destroying themselves and their dying . The Valley of the Wind, a small community commanded by King Jil battles for survival as the kingdom attempts to defend the Valley from gigantic Ohm bugs and toxic plants that live beyond the Valley in the Sea of Decay . The Valley is invaded by the Tolmekian warriors who scheme to destroy the Sea of Decay by utilizing the greatest monsters that caused the holocaust. Nausicaa goes after the pirates, severely damaging their aircraft but she is gunned down . After Nausicaä is caught , Nausicaä breaks out and goes beneath the Sea of Decay where she learns the toxic plants are not poisoning the air and are purifying the world by draining the air of radiation and toxins . Later on , Nausicaa join forces with the creatures Ohms and makes a friend ; both of them will confront on the air taking place overwhelming chases , pursuits and dogfighting on the skies and set out to the Valley and foil the Tolmekians schemes of unleashing the Great Monster Warrior.<br/><br/>This attractive film is plenty of fantasy , adventures, spectacular dogfighting and with agreeable message . Masterfully made by Miyazaki who also directed other excellent cartoon movies as ¨ Ponyo , Howl's moving castle, Chihiro, Nicky , Porco Rosso , My neighbor Tororo , Castle in the sky ¨ and many others .The picture is narrated with sensibility and sense of wonder and being quite entertaining , it is apt for small kids but no contains graphic violence as ¨Monokome-Hime¨ and similarly contains an ecologist message. The film packs lively situations , hilarious scenes , spectacular images and culminating in an impressive confrontation with breathtaking ending . Note that the foreign release titled Warriors of the Wind is an adaptation well restored and remastered from television series and released in cinemas , being entirely kiddiefied rendition that edits the original episodes heavily, thus creating a completely diverse tale . All roles have multiple dimensions and display really astonishing humanity . Never remotely didactic , the movie is ultimately an enjoyable fantasy that touches brief thoughtful issues dealing with ethical , ecological and juvenile psychological themes . The drawings have a special ancient touch that conveys the forgotten wisdom of the past that could really affect the way you interact with others and with the ambient . This stunning film with appropriate runtime , converted the first of any kind to get a big hit in Japan .<br/><br/>The motion picture was splendidly realized by Hayao Miyazaki and accompanied with sensitive music score composed by his usual musician, Joe Hisaishi. Miyazaki wasn't yet a culture hero in Japan when made this animated mythic adventure ; later on , he directed ¨Princess Monokone¨converted the first of any kind to gross over the box office in Japan and all over the world , it raised him to a status approaching living national treasure . Miyazaki also directed other excellent cartoon movies as ¨Lupin¨ (1978) , Castle of Cagliostro¨ (1979) , ¨Howl's moving castle¨ , ¨Laputa castle of the sky¨ ,¨Porco Rosso¨ , ¨Kiki's delivery service¨, ¨Chihiro¨ or ¨Spirited away¨: the highest grossing Japanese film ever , and the cult movie : ¨My neighbour Tororo¨ .

It's a shame that Disney seems to hide Miyazaki's works behind the Mousehouse money machine.<br/><br/>Dubs and subs war aside, the dialogue is good, the animation fresh, the premise disturbing, and the characters enthralling. Said dubs are not so bad, no one character jars my senses. For sci-fi junkies, the plot is pure nirvana, challenging minds to think and explore. So before moving on to the next soulless Disney sequel, give Nausicaa and Miyazaki the respect they deserve."
"RbDeraj","3","11","20","16 April 2015"," Completely Lost My Interest
","Having seen three other Miyazaki animes and thoroughly enjoying them, I expected as much from this film but was ultimately let down. Like all the other Miyazaki works I have seen, this film was set in a beautiful, mysterious and exotic world along with cool creatures (like the fox-squirrel and the Ohms). The flying machines were also creative and a lot of the images reminded me of the incredible comic artist Moebius. But the animation of these fantastic elements was tacky, cheap looking, and not of the highest quality. The storyline was simply not up to par either. The script was poorly written and almost every line seemed cheesy, unintelligent, and dumb. Maybe part of the blame should rest upon the actors and their delivery, but either way it was not good. The music in most films typically goes unnoticed, but it was hard to miss here and not in a good way. Techno music from the 80's definitely did not fit the mood. It seemed to lack the emotional connection that I thought Miyazaki's other films excelled at. The ending seemed abrupt and unsatisfying but I had lost interest so long before that point that I simply ceased to care."

The one exception is the old blind soothsayer who is a terrible cliché and is annoying every time she is on the screen, she is a cheap and unimaginative way of foreshadowing and explaining things.<br/><br/>On the whole though this is an enjoyable film with a lot of action and some good animation and reasonable dialogue, the English dubbing is some of the best I have come across.<br/><br/>The ending is cheesy and has a rushed feel as if it is trying to tidy up the loose ends when there isn't room for a traditional happy ending.<br/><br/>All in all it's watchable but not great for an adult."

If you like this film, I would recommend Miyazaki's other work, i.e. Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke.

All the classic Miyazaki themes and emotional content are there, and it's beautifully realized.

","When I caught wind last week that Nausicaa had finally been re-released as it was originally viewed in Japan 21 years ago and was on sale at Wal-Mart, I rushed two towns over to see if it was true.<br/><br/>15 years ago, my brother gave me a copy of 'Warriors of the Wind,' a much more cropped version of the movie that barely summarized the first few books of the story and left much to be desired. But I fell in love with the film and its captivating story and superb animation. Since then, I've guarded that tape religiously, fearing that if i lost it, I'd never see another copy of it again. It was basically the movie that started my love and appreciation of Japanese animation.<br/><br/>The tape is now old and stretched at the top and bottom, and the box falling apart. So imagine my surprise to find it at Wal-Mart of all places as a two-disk special edition. I bought it yesterday and have already watched it twice. The English voices have all been re-cast and dubbed, and scenes that weren't previously in 'Warriors' are included. This version is truer to the first few chapters of the Nausicaa story, and truer to the manga dialog. Alison Lohman is a nice choice for the voice of Nausicaa - she's sweet, and gentle sounding, and really makes you empathetic to the situations when she talks. Patrick Stewart in the role of Lord Yupa is also a wonderful choice as his voice quality is beyond measure, simultaneously comforting and demanding your attention.<br/><br/>Even though the techniques for animating a film have changed drastically since the production of Nausicaa 21 years ago, it still sparkles and glistens like the jewel it is in Miazaki's crown. His way of storytelling and depth are enough to make even the youngest child think and ask real discussion questions. The way he makes you love the characters as they struggle can provoke tears from from almost any cynic. (And if you don't believe me, try Grave of the Fireflies - nary a dry eye to be found.) Miazaki is a god among animation directors, and we should all watch and benefit from the lessons in his films.<br/><br/>'Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind' is a must for any anime fan, environmentalist, Miazaki fan, or anyone who just wants a movie you can watch again and again, and let your children watch over and over without fear of their brains rotting. I'd also recommend Grave of the Fireflies and My Neighbor Totoro."

","Anyone who has worked in film knows every project is engineered. A film is built by combining visuals, effects, and various forms of audio. When everything comes together, the audience is simply absorbed in the experience. Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind is such a film, where the final product is far greater than the sum of individual parts. <br/><br/>There are many science fiction films that deal with apocalypse, or disaster. Hayao Miyazaki travels 1000 years past the earth's last stand in order to tell this tale of heroism. The setting is a ruined, scorched earth - toxic, but with small patches of habitable land. Inside the toxic land a mutant fungi and insect jungle thrives, where we are introduced to the main character, and the strange wonders of this future world. <br/><br/>Even after a millennium of war almost exterminated humanity, conflict still rules the day. Nausicaä is not without harsh moments, but even at its most difficult or strange moments - beauty persists. <br/><br/>The audio fits - dialog, ambient, music. The atmosphere of this film lives and breathes.<br/><br/>I've always loved creepy crawly things. I sought them out as a kid, and still am fascinated by the abundance of available media showing earths range of insects and arachnids. Any wonder I love this movie? Sure I also like arachnophobia, slither, and critters - but don't confuse any of these movies to NVotW.<br/><br/>I feel Nausicaä Valley of the Wind is one of the most wonderful, symbolic films ever made. It displays Miyazaki's unique brilliance; as a world builder and detail oriented film engineer. This is my personal favorite Miyazaki film, and though I'm a huge fan I don't think any of his other movies are in the same league. Certainly his newer movies are more polished, complex, and beautiful. But Nausicaä the character shines with the greatest qualities - heroic, able, brilliant and selfless. Combine this character, a wildly creative setting, add an epic story = 10/10 <br/><br/>viewed 1080p version that really showed the detail of this '84 animation. dated, but just so good!"

","In the future the Earth has been decimated by the ""Seven Days of Fire"" and the human population is clinging to survival in small pockets. Their main ongoing threat is the spread of the toxic jungle where the spores are poisonous to mankind and an uneasy tolerance exists with the creatures in the jungle  where they feel under threat the creatures attack with force and numbers greater that can be withstood. In one area called the Valley of the Wind, Princess Nausicaa strives to understand the jungle rather than fight it. However when her village discovers a surviving Giant Warrior, they are taken over by Princess Kushana and her men sparking a fight for not only the valley but the earth itself.<br/><br/>I couldn't really care less whether this is ""officially"" a Studio Ghibli film or not (I'll leave that to the ""hard core"" fans to worry about), the main thing that interested me was whether I would enjoy this film in the way I have some other Miyazaki or if it would be one of the ones that I felt fell short of the mark, for whatever reason. Despite only being a few years after the disappointing Castle of Cagliostro, this seems a world away from that average film and is a well rounded story full of great animation that will appeal to adults and children. The sci-fi plot is engaging and has a solid environmental message at its core regarding the balance of nature and the lack of understanding we (man) seems to have of it all. At times it is a bit heavy and obvious a message but it is never to the point of being a turnoff or patronising. It helps that the message is woven in with the narrative so it is not as clunky as it could have been.<br/><br/>The animation is great and again was a nice surprise considering how soon after the basic Castle of Cagliostro it came. The sci-fi setting makes for good use of Miyazaki's vision and imagination and it is a quite beautiful film to watch if you like the sci-fi genre. Whether it is in the aircrafts, the creatures or the whole environment, visually it is impressive and engaging throughout. I know there is always the debate over versions and dubs with these things but I can only watch what is available and I as happy that the 2005 dub of this was not the universally hated dub done earlier. However this is not to say that I loved Lohan in the lead role. She was OK for the most part but when the material asked more of her I occasionally found her wanting and a bit grating. Generally she was fine but it is hard to think she has the depth or range that the dub could have used at times. Stewart can deliver the phone book like it was profound writing and he is great value here, the only shame being his character has comparatively little screen time once it gets going. Support is generally good past these two from solid turns from Uma Thurman among others.<br/><br/>Overall this is an impressive film that doesn't feel even one of its 22 years of age. The sci-fi story and environmental message blends together really well and produces an engaging film that is visually impressive and imaginative. I don't have kids but if I did then this would be on my video shelf in place of some of the recent Hollywood animation offerings churned out."

You must watch the original uncut version ONLY.<br/><br/>I forgot the title of the film but could still remember images that were burned into my memory. I have been searching for this film ever since I first saw it when I was 9 and finally found it in 2003 under its proper name ""Kaze no tani no Naushika"".<br/><br/>This film should be apart of the school curriculum for children it is beautiful, touching and thought provoking. Nausicaa is an amazing heroine - I usually don't like female heroines but Nausicaa can save me any day.<br/><br/>I used to have dreams of flying when I was a child and I am sure they were inspired after watching this film with Nausicaa on her glider diving through the clouds.<br/><br/>The music in the film is brilliant in its self - its worth buying the soundtrack. It is impressive when a soundtrack can add so much emotion and ambiance to a scene.<br/><br/>Give this a chance if you have watched ""Princess Mononoke"" it is similar except it is much better - the only thing that is not perfect by todays standards is the animation I guess - its a little dated but still beautiful.<br/><br/>Trust me this is the GREATEST anime film ever - far surpassing any of Miyazaki's other works TRUST ME please watch this and do yourself a favour."

","I have read cliched comments about some other supposedly special anime- how fantastic the artwork was drawn. Until I saw this film, I never really agreed when I watched those anime that were raved about the art. Even though I haven't ever heard anything about this anime film, I can imagine the same kind of acclaim about the art. Well, in this case, I really do have to rave about the artwork. In Nausicaa of the Valley of the Winds, the paintings, story, and music soundtrack combine to form a whole much greater than the sum of the parts. But of all the parts, the artwork and animation was by far the most creative and magnificent art paintings of any feature length animation I've ever watched. This is how science fiction fantasy should be done with anime: soft, flowing plantlife and alien landscapes, not the sharp, hard edges of artificial metal worlds. Humans trying to survive at the most basic levels- as they have for thousands of years, not some cool, hip, fake society. The story was very precious and entertaining. 117 minutes seemed like less than an hour to me. No, this anime wasn't perfect, but it was the closest thing to perfect I have ever seen in a feature animation. This is probably one of the greatest feature animations ever made, and I do not think it can ever be surpassed in our lifetime, because the current trend is more toward the slick and superficial, just as in other mainstream films."

Keep in mind that everyone else in the Valley of Wind dresses like her, and they don't appear to be in kilts. Now with that out of the way, I'd just like to say that it's an amzing movie that I've enjoyed watching since I was 5 years old (although back then I only had the butchered Warriors of the Wind).

","English translation: Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind - To say an animation is up to Hayao Miyazaki standards is to give the highest possible praise. But to say that an actual Miyazaki film exceeds its own standards is the highest praise. That is what NAUSICAA is: Miyazaki at his best.<br/><br/>Set in a fantasy reality that blends ancient and futuristic into a world that is at once impossible yet believable, NAUSICAA details the fight between two warring factions with Princess Nausicaa's beautiful but weak kingdom caught in the middle. Crystal clear Miyazaki, the protagonist Nausicaa is the sounding bell of peace and reason. A young girl - as are many of Miyazaki's protagonists - Nausicaa is both naive in the way of war but determined in the way of living with the world and not against it.<br/><br/>The supporting characters add zest and humor and depth to the story, one that twists along lazily to its awesome conclusion, always providing excitement or wonder while keeping the audience guessing as to the outcome. And Miyazaki's final solution to Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is indeed a surprising and deeply satisfying one."

Even in it's filtered down form, it sounds so much better than a Disney flick, doesn't it?  Darn right it is. <br/><br/>I was fortunate enough to see the subtitled version of Nausicaa, and I must say that it has only strengthened my belief that Hayao Miyazaki is one of the greatest storytellers in the history of this planet.  What most people will not realize is that ""Kaze no tani no Naushika"" is actually the life's work of Mister Miyazaki.  Based on the manga (comic) of the same title, this movie is a mere snapshot into the world he has created for over a decade in comic form.  Where similar movies like ""Akira"" failed to keep most of the impact of it's impossibly large story, Nausicaa actually keeps the same feel and look of the original story.  <br/><br/>Without overwhelming the viewer, an amazing, well-crafted world is thrown into the mind's eye.  One that is so breathtaking and alien to us, yet also one that is very possible.  It even refrains from too much ""This is the history of the world in one paragraph"", and uses events in the story to explain the past, and why the world is the way it is. <br/><br/>
Characters are very well crafted and wonderful to watch, especially Princess Nausicca and her protector, Master Yupa.  The creatures in this movie are simply amazing as well, and Miyazaki is known for his wonderful creature imagination.  The mighty Ohmu are some of the coolest ""monsters"" I have ever seen, and I'm looking forward to reading the manga version to see them more in depth.  Another monster...this time very much so...that was amazing was the ""God Warrior"" who made a brief, but horrifying appearance against the Ohmu.  Truly, this movie is the stuff of dreams...and nightmares.<br/><br/>This is also a very touching film.  One that any age group can watch and come away with a happy heart.  Though life is far from a perfect fairytale in Nausicaa, this movie focuses on the human spirit, and the harmony with the planet we should strive towards.  It does sound a little sappy, but trust me, it's not.  It's a struggle.  If it is a triumph...well, that's up to the future to decide.  <br/><br/>Anyone who likes the new Princess Mononoke movie will want to see this film, that started Miyazaki's amazing career with a momentous event.  10/10 rating."
"devil.plaything","10","3","4","5 May 2002"," Excellent!
","Years ago I was having a discussion about anime with one of my colleagues, and she told me that ""Nausicaa - Valley Of The Wind"" was her favourite anime. ""That's a stupid name"", I thought, ""I bet its rubbish really"". Well, I was wrong and she was right - Miyazaki's first movie under the studio Ghibli banner is a fantasy of the absolute highest order.<br/><br/>
Set thousands of years hence, the human race is eeking out an existence around wastelands populated by all manner of alien plants and animals, all emitting deadly toxins. As if this wasn't a hard enough life, the different groups of humans are at war with each other. Nausicaa is a princess in the Valley Of The Wind, a tribe of pacifists who are closer to nature than most others. The movie is a tale of struggle, adventure and discovery - all with a strong environmental message. Those who have played the Final Fantasy games will recognise much here in terms of narrative and art style. In fact, there are quite a lot of similarities with the Final Fantasy movie, though the story here is definitely better constructed. <br/><br/>Miyazaki has always been an imaginative writer/director, and especially here. The world of Nausicaa is fabulously detailed and unique - like the best sci-fi and fantasy, Miyazaki has envisaged a whole history, ecology, sociology and technology... all of which is very well realised in the animation and art. He's also got a good eye for characters, and the various people you will meet in the world are all very well developed. Nausicaa herself is the centre of the story, and a fine embodiment of purity and virtue. <br/><br/>It isn't often you see a movie that is so well developed. Anime is a medium with some unique strengths when it comes to fantasy, and Nausicaa exploits them to the full. Even without the artistic license that animation provides, the story is one that is so strong it could have been placed in any environment and still made a wonderful movie. <br/><br/>Recommended!  As others have observed though, the only way to see it really is widescreen/subtitled/uncut (115 minutes)."
"zh84","10","4","6","16 March 2007"," Complex, beautiful, moving and profound
","This film is technically a ""pre-Ghibli"" work: Ghibli as such didn't exist when it was made. You can, however, clearly see where Miyazaki's style and preoccupations came from. I am a part-time science-fiction fan, and it has always saddened me to see that while reams of intelligent SF are published (consider ""Grass"", ""The Sirens of Titan"", ""A Fire Upon The Deep"", ""A Requiem for Homo Sapiens"", ""The Cyberiad"", Cordwainer Smith and many more) Hollywood generally takes the line that SF on the screen either means Star Wars (lots of whizzy spaceships, weird aliens and battles) or Alien (horrible monsters picking people off one by one.) Both of those are good films, but they have been far too much imitated because of their success, and the other things that written SF has to offer never seem to have made it to the cinema. ""Nausicaä"", however, is an exception. It is a film which, like a good SF story, always has something to reveal, introduces you to a well-designed and fascinating world, and plays out through the actions of properly-developed characters. If you want to see space battles and mindless action, or people being horribly murdered by alien creatures, this is not the film for you, but if you'd like to see some SF written for the heart and the mind instead of just the senses, I can't recommend it too highlyexcept to say that ""Laputa: Castle in the Sky"" may be even better."
"rampant1970","10","4","6","8 November 2006"," Miyazaki is the master
","Please vote high for Nausicaä, and get it into the list of top IMDb animated films. This film has a great average rating, but it needs more votes!<br/><br/>Parental Advisory: This film is not for young children. The MPAA wasn't kidding: ""Rated PG for violence."" Please rent or buy Nausicaä, and give your teenagers something to think about.<br/><br/>Nausicaä was my first Miyazaki or Studio Ghibli film, and it broadened my horizons. Miyazaki-san and the best of Japanese animation are on par with Disney's Fantasia as the most creative, most beautiful animation ever produced. Thanks to Miyazaki, I am more a fan of animation today than I was at age 10.<br/><br/>Studio Ghibli stories are fascinating for me as an American with no direct window into Japanese culture. They draw archetypes from a rich mythos completely separate from European culture to challenge your assumptions and your view of life.<br/><br/>Nausicaä has a completely compelling heroine, the requisite cute animal sidekick, brilliant steam-age technology mixed with magic, and a message. Some of my friends find the environmental and anti-war themes of Nausicaä to be heavy-handed, but I think allegory is more effective than persuasion.<br/><br/>Think about it this way --- which is a more memorable criticism of war --- the nightly casualty figures from Vietnam or Iraq, or a grieving family at Arlington, a photo of a naked Viet girl running from a napalm attack, and The Wall. Would you rather hear about the perils of environmental crime from Erin Brockovich or Al Gore?<br/><br/>In the late 80's, four films affected me to the degree that I was taken aback for hours after watching them --- Gandhi, Matewan, Testament, and Nausicaä. I felt the impact of each of these stories on individual characters and on nations; I saw the truth in them.<br/><br/>Many thanks to Miyazaki-san for Nausicaä. She ranks high among his greatest gifts to us."
"Boba_Fett1138","9","4","6","19 November 2005"," A magnificent imaginative movie.
","This movie has an absolutely magnificent imaginative story. The movie perfectly creates an unique post-apocalyptic world with some wonderful settings and strong characters. The movie is filled with some wonderful and certainly unique moments.<br/><br/>Really the best element of the movie is truly the story. I have to admit that in the beginning I wasn't exactly grabbed or fascinated by the movie its story, characters and settings. However as the movie progressed I got more and more drawn into the movie and its story and characters and the unique world the movie was set in. The second halve of the movie, when the real action begins and the story takes more form, is especially extremely good. There are some fine action- and tense moments in the movie and the ending is build up very well and is truly both spectacular and adventurous to watch. Kudos to Hayao Miyazaki!<br/><br/>There are some really good characters in this movie. Princes Nausicaä is a strong heroic female lead and the movie features some good sidekicks, such as characters that provide comical moments, the wise man Yupa, who in several ways resembles Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings and of course the villains who are often so important in movies like this one. It are all very stereotypical characters who work very well for the movie its story. The characters are build up nicely and because of that they work really well for the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is an beautiful unique and wonderful experience to watch. It's spectacular, imaginative, powerful and beautiful all at the same time. It's truly something you have to experience for yourself! It's no surprise that I can whole-heartedly recommend this movie to everyone. You don't have to be into anime movies, to be able to appreciate and enjoy this movie. Be sure the watch the original Japanese, 116 minutes version of the movie though, for the most optimal movie experience.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

Unfortunately it was re-released as a special collectors edition in Germany beginning September 2005.<br/><br/>I just had to buy this gem. And I love it. This film *is* anime for me. It was my first anime I saw and it's a definite must have. The collectors edition comes with 2 DVDs in a paper-case and 5 high-quality picture ""postcards"". The bonus DVD has a running time of app. 152 minutes.<br/><br/>The film itself has a running has a running time of 116 minutes and seems to be the uncut version."

","I've seen it a few weeks ago and it still amazes me. All the children I've seen it with love it and I've also shown it to many students. The action parts are gripping and it keeps their attention to the movie, but it's also nice to chew on the environmental aspects of the movie afterwards.<br/><br/>I had the good luck to read the Manga a few years ago and Nausicaa's character undergoes an interesting change. In the movie, taking up maybe only one-third of the entire series, she's seen as a Christ-figure, wanting to save everyone and willing to suffer for them all. In the Manga, her idealism becomes downright scary. Is she so positive she's right? She starts acting like a fanatic, and though her character doesn't change from the first third of the Manga (and from the movie)till the end, this unmalleable character borders on (I think) megalomania. It's a subtle, frightening transformation, and I highly recommend watching the movie and reading the Manga to experience it."
"Iria","7","4","6","16 May 1999"," The difference between Warriors of the Wind and Nausicaa
","Miyazaki's Nausicaa, of the Valley of the Wind, is deeply moving, but in the dubbed version (Warriors of the Wind) that poignancy is lost due to the extensive reinterpretation of the film.  Over 20 minutes were cut, as that company wanted to make it more an animated action movie for its targeted market, rather than attempt to portray the subtleties of human nature. Thus, they edited the ""slow"" scenes that gave the film so much of its bittersweet feeling.  Nausicaa is renamed as ""Princess Zandra,"" and the sweet-sounding Japanese voice actress for Nausicaa is replaced with the voice of Rocky from Bullwinkle.  Although the first time I saw Nausicaa was in the dubbed format, I still found that the cinematography and music were breathtaking.  I only recently was able to see the uncut version in Japanese, and was shocked to see how much of it was butchered in Warriors of the Wind.  It has been recorded that Miyazaki was horrified at what had been done to his beautiful film.  Perhaps it was good that that happened, because (for those who are aware of Disney's plans to translate his creations) he will not allow his films to be touched in any way, allowing only for a direct translation.  Therefore, should Disney change anything about his anime, it would be an illegal action."
"Auryn-4","10","4","6","21 March 2000"," always leaves my crying
","Thanks you Miyazaki, for making two of the best movies of all time: Nausicaa and Mononoke Hime. I have not yet seen Laputa, but I am going to. :-)<br/><br/>I fell in love with ""warriors of the wind"" when I was a little girl. And it remained my favorite movie throughout the years, right there on my top-ten list along movies like ""star wars"" and ""braveheart"". But I always felt that there was a portion of the story lacking. As if someone had cut scenes out... after watching the movie about 50 times, these gaps really started to annoy me.<br/><br/>And finally, yesterday, after loving this movie for 15 years, I got to watch the real movie, ""kaze no tani no nausicaa"". While ""warriors"" left me touched, ""nausicaa"" left me crying. Both for the beauty of the story that now became obvious to me: I had found the missing pieces at last, but I also cried because of what they had done to this great movie.<br/><br/>Almost no scene was left uncut. There was something lacking from almost every scene, as if someone had chopped this movie up with the deliberate and evil intent to destroy every single scene. Furthermore, whole sequences was cut out, like *all* of the scenes that explain what it's all about. Add to that a lousy translation from japaneese. (And after that, someone translated from english to swedish, added annoying swedish dialects and stupid jokes. (I saw the swedish version earlier)). It was two totally different movies. ""warriors"" feel like a commercial for the real thing: the have all the action sequences, but the story itself is lacking.<br/><br/>The ""new"" scenes always leaves me crying: little nausicaa trying to save the baby ohmu...<br/><br/>/Auryn"
"ryzinhy","4","23","56","24 December 2005"," Confusing and overrated.
","I am partly a fan of Miyazaki's work. I say ""partly"" because most of his films fall into two categories: brilliant, and boring. Sadly this film falls into the later category.<br/><br/>This film suffers from the same fundamental problems as Miyazaki's recent film ""Howl's Moving Castle"". An intriguing premise is set up, but then immediately reduced to little more than a backdrop for some unfathomable events that only serve to confuse the plot rather than explain it.<br/><br/>The first third of the film reveals the post-apocalyptic world the story is set in, and actually looks like an very interesting story is about to unfold. From then on things go down hill. The middle part of the film is mostly made up of thinly-veiled eco-propaganda, and the ending is heavily marred by the reliance on the kind of impenetrable spiritualism which ruins a large number of Japanese animated films.<br/><br/>Overall the film feels as though someone ripped out every other page from the script before passing it on the the animators. What is left is something which is visually stunning (although sadly the version I saw was an Nth-generation copy, with poor colour - which gives rise to the common myth that Nausicaa shows her bare bottom when flying), but which makes little sense and ultimately left me confused."
"ccthemovieman-1","6","18","42","11 August 2008"," Story Unable To Match Interesting Visuals
","Visually - thumbs up; story - thumbs down.<br/><br/>The animated effort from the famous director-writer Hayao Miyazaki features, as usual for him, very nice animation. I especially enjoyed the beautiful colors in the landscapes, the interesting windmills, World War II bombers, strange insect-monsters and a lot more.<br/><br/>The problem is that it's too long and, despite the decent characters and colorful animation, 116 minutes of this so-so story is too much. Combine it with a story that can be convoluted at times, way too environmentally preachy at other times (tree huggers would like this storyline - literally) and I can see where viewers' minds would begin to wander or get discouraged after about 45 minutes.<br/><br/>Nausicala is a cute little heroine, but bland, someone I just couldn't relate to, and an unnecessarily unclad for a preadolscent. The main villain, ""Princess Kushana,"" didn't excited me much, either. I couldn't get involved enough with the characters to sit through a two-hour animated movie and be entertained as I hoped to be.<br/><br/>More good and bad: I liked the main voices, those of Alison Lohman and Patrick Stewart. A little humor would have helped, but there is none in here. (Exteme environmentalists aren't a bunch of laughs.) This should be a lot of fun to watch, but I didn't find it such."
"grantss","5","8","16","9 January 2016"," Mildly interesting
","Mildly interesting.<br/><br/>An animated fantasy-adventure. Set 1,000 years from now, the earth is ravaged by pollution and war. In the Valley of the Wind lives Nausicaa, princess of her people. Their land borders on a toxic jungle, filled with dangerous over-sized insects. Meanwhile two nearby nations are bitterly engaged in a war and the Valley of the Wind is stuck in the middle...<br/><br/>A so-so movie. Was reasonably interesting initially but the story lacked focus or engagement as it went on. It is really just one long rambling story, filled with random turns of events. There's no character depth or variety - characters are either good guys or bad guys, and clearly and stereotypically so. There is no grey.<br/><br/>No profundities, except some half-hearted, naive attempts at statements about war and the environment.<br/><br/>Kids will enjoy it (the hero is a young girl, after all, so kids must be the target market). Intelligent adults will find it average, even tedious."
"dkeesto","4","19","51","5 June 2005"," NOT as good as his later masterpieces
","(This is a review of the later English release by Disney, featuring Alison Lohman, Patrick Stewart, and co.) <br/><br/>I really wanted this film to be good. Really, really. I'm a huge fan of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, and after seeing all the glowing reviews on this earlier Miyazaki film, I was eager to see it. But I was shocked, shocked I say, at the quality of this film. Those later films boast well-crafted plots, 3-dimensional characters, and the best film music since...well...ever. This film just doesn't come close.<br/><br/>Might as well start w/ the positive aspects, though. Like all Miyazaki films, this one is still very imaginative, with a bizarre fantasy/sci-fi setting, in a post-apocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species. Nausicaa can also boast some far superior animation to other films from its time. (though not as beautiful and fluid as Miyazaki's later films) And the English voice acting is quite well done.<br/><br/>But this film...just...isn't...good... The characters are all cardboard - from saccharine sweet little Nausicaa, to the ruthlessly evil Tolmekians, to everyone in between. Once you've seen each of them for 30 seconds, you've seen all there is. And the fact that the plot just ambles along doesn't help.<br/><br/>Then there's the music... Now, Hisaichi is hands down my favorite film composer, but Nausicaa doesn't do him justice. Half the music is 80's keyboards on overdrive, and it usually enters and leaves so abruptly that it distracts the visuals rather than helping them. I highly suspect that Hisaichi was told to compose a lot of the music before he even saw the picture.<br/><br/>But wait! There's a great message with this film, right?! Let's all save the environment! Too bad that this film hits you over the head with it like a sledgehammer. There is a scene in which Nausicaa hugs a tree. No, really. I ain't kidding.<br/><br/>It makes me a little sad to talk about how lame this film is. But for some reason all the other reviews on IMDb seem to adore it. And when the characters have to talk to themselves in extended sentences to tell you what's going on, that's lame.<br/><br/>If you're the kind of person who worships anime, enjoys 80's music, and plants a tree every Arbor day, you will probably like this film. Otherwise, save your money for his later films, because they rock big time."
"andrejvasiljevic","10","3","5","12 April 2011"," Enchanting
","I met with the world of Japanese anime relatively late in my life, somewhere in the mid 20s, but once I got to know it the life changed upside down... my eyes opened to a new and wonderful world of imagination.<br/><br/>""Kaze no tani no Naushika"" is not my first Ghibli anime, yet it left the strongest impact which I can still feel. So much is right about ""Naushika"" - the perfect drawing, beautiful landscapes, well based characters... but the thing which made me fall in love with this masterpiece is the beauty of a tale and the way it was told. Just as Japanese have everything done by the book, so does the story unravel step by step. It shows us it's depth through the history of earth, people, their ambitions, illusions, mistakes and struggles. I instantly formed a bondage with the characters, who above all firmly believe in good, nature, and are willing to fight for it no matter the cost. And that fight isn't just flares and fists... we see the true power of belief. That's what storytelling it's all about.<br/><br/>And then, an enchanting musical creation of Joe Hisashi comes right like a cherry on the top of a perfect cake. I really don't see anything that could improve ""Naushika"" in any way... it's absolutely sublime like this and will remain for ages to come.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not a person who easily gives high marks for anything, motion pictures especially, but if I could, 100 points would beyond any doubt be awarded to ""Naushika"" on my behalf. Since we're deprived of such a choice, 10 would do for now. Enchanting..."
"Rectangular_businessman","10","3","5","14 June 2010"," One of the best anime movies ever made
","Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is the first film to come out of Miyazaki's Studio Gibhli (or what would become Studio Gibhli) and is one of the most beautiful and amazing animated films ever made. The art style is consistently fascinating and original, there is no telling what will happen next because the visuals are so nuanced and unique. The music as well is delightfully quirky and even experimental with dissonant avant-garde leanings. The English voice overs are surprisingly well done, especially Alison Lohman, whose full girlish voice fits the endearing charm of Nausicaa. The art style is a weird hybridization of Japanese and Western styles, with a European looking cast and an Olde English setting. Some characters even sport impressive Nietzschean moustaches. One thing that struck me most about the film, and I say this knowing little of Japanese anime, is how influential it seems. The Final Fantasy series must have been influenced by the artistic style and countless video games borrowed the battle music. Even Zelda seems to have used the whole close-nit village with an ancient myth theme, though this might stretch back much further into Japanese culture. Suffice to say, the whole experience comes off more genuine than other fantasy-adventure films, like the Lord of the Rings (which is also great, don't get me wrong). There is just a kind of intimacy, an undeniable rush of sentiment gushing throughout the film (that doesn't feel hammy)."
"jlovejoy","10","3","5","24 February 2005"," One of the best films I've even seen, if not THE best
","1984. I was born that year, and that was the year Nausicaa was released in Japan. That was a dang long time ago by my reckoning. Yet here, 21 years later, the US is fortunate enough to get a decent version of it on these shores. I saw a TV ad for this movie; I had never heard of it before. But I had seen Spirited Away, and I knew that Studio Ghibli was capable of creating cinematic masterpieces that blew any other animation out of the freakin' water. I had to see this, and I saw it the first day it was released, and I wasn't disappointed. Never mind it's age, this film is timeless in its power and imagination. It was definitely one of the best films -- anime or not -- that I've ever seen (just to make my tastes in film more specific, I also consider the godfather, Strangers on a Train, Citizen Kane, 2001 A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, the Untouchables, The Fifth Element, Brazil, Spirited Away, and Leon other great films...I know, its a wide spectrum).<br/><br/>Nausicaa has so much going for it. The story pulls you into this fantastic world; the legends engross; the landscapes are surreally breathtaking (saying something for an image on a 2d screen); especially with Joe Hishashi's score, which can only be described as virtuoso. With an ingenious mix of traditional orchestral and 80's electronic, seamlessly merged. The English dubbing is superb, too. Alison Lohman has a great voice. Patrick Stewart, whom I'd known for more than a decade as Picard, was a very welcome surprise.<br/><br/>These are all my opinions, I'm not selling anything; everyone's tastes are different, especially in film. But I really liked this film, and as such felt compelled to comment on it. I would recommend seeing it. I thought anime was stupid until very recently. A lot of it is. But not this. This is peerless cinema."
"joshuafagan-64214","10","2","3","3 September 2015"," Miyazaki Soars
","All good movies grab me at some point. But by the time movies that are just that, just good, do so, the great movies have had me for an hour and a half or so and have thirst into my spirit all sorts of wild passions and deep darknesses and complex thoughts. It is one of the methods I use to judge a movie. And I do say, with the forty or so of you that read these things as my witness, that few movies have grabbed me as quickly as this one. While the opening credits were rolling, I got hooked. And I never got unhooked.<br/><br/>Nausicaa (which is what I will call it from here onwards for convenience's sake , though I adore the full title) is a movie about a princess, obviously named Nausicaa (by the way, I love that name and would totally make an effort to name my daughter that when and if I have one), who tries to bring peace between multiple warring factions of people and some enormous insects clad in thick armor while navigating a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Now if that description alone does not make you want to go out and see this film, then you are not as cool as I thought you were. <br/><br/>One could say that this is Miyazaki's most creative film; there is enough effort put into every detail that the world he has created feels both like a surreal world that we could visit and a real world that we could visit. The many flying scenes add to this feel, giving off an air of tangibility, almost tricking our minds into thinking that this must be real because there is not a person or even a large group of people, alive or dead, who could possibly create something like this. Most films need to create gravitas. This film bathes in it. <br/><br/>And that is not to mention the energy pulsing through the movie. As this is both Miyazaki's (but not really Ghibli's, as the studio wasn't around back then; it's... complicated) first grand film and it is common knowledge that the great animation auteur is a fan of aviation, I do think that it is appropriate to say that this film feels like a plane taking flight for the first time.<br/><br/>Not to say that this film is perfect. There are some rough edges that Miyazaki had not yet sanded down. One is that some of the characters could have used a bit more development and depth. Particularly Nausicaa herself. While I did not mind her at all and I give Miyazaki props for, despite being from a country that is considered to be relatively 'backwards' in a lot of things, getting way ahead of Disney in terms of creating strong (though people really should come up with a better word than that) female heroines, she falls into the Belle-trap of being too nice and, to make matters more 'troublesome', does not have Belle's charisma. While she is not a Mary Sue if only for the reason that I carnally and viscerally hate it when that word is used to describe any original (non-fanfic) characters, she could have been stronger.<br/><br/>The other big one is the environmental message. Both for the sake of avoiding spoilers and because I want to try to keep these reviews under a thousand words, I won't go into too much detail. But I will say that Lapita had a subtle one. Princess Mononoke had a subtle one. Spirited Away had a subtle one. This does not. At times, particularly at the climax, the storyline seems less like it was composed by a master artist and more like it was made by a hippie in Boulder who was both a member of the Green Party and a PETA advocate. Some people let this ruin the film for them. I did not. For what it's worth, I do think that this film is a major signifier on where you stand in the cinematic battle of character and plot versus atmosphere and design. <br/><br/>As far as I go: So what if this film only correctly nails down one of Miyazaki's three trademarks (the planes, which look magnificent, by the way. If you pay attention, you can see that they are inspired by insects and not birds, something that makes sense considering that insects are far more populous than birds in this world.) It is still a ten out of ten. If you want to see the height of animation during this time period, your search is ended. The designs are stellar and the soundtrack is almost better. There are times when this movie feels more alive and resonant than you would ever expect a movie could feel. <br/><br/>I cannot rightly go without giving a mention to my favorite scene in the film. When the protagonists and one of the antagonists are sucked into quicksand, they fall through into a lush underground cave. I stopped and stared, my mouth agape. There is a simple shot showing the characters walking along the lakeside. It is about five seconds but it feels like five hours in the good way. I love Mr. Disney and his company, but this is more magic than he and it could ever or likely will ever muster. It is five seconds that exemplifies why is love these movies, as well as why I love animation and even why I love film in general."
"toqtaqiya2","9","2","3","5 October 2010"," This impressive work from acclaimed Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki represents a significant departure from traditional anime.
","Nausicaa Of The Valley Of The Wind is an epic science-fiction story that ranks among director Hayao Miyazaki's best works. It's based on one section of his classic manga. The film is beautiful, and the heroine is convincingly human. The narrative is action-packed, with a world that is wonderfully realized. All the characters are well drawn. This is due to Miyazaki's commitment to the project, and because the film was made before the foundation of Studio Ghibli so the director was able to pick up the best staff available at the time. The result is an impressive technical achievement. The script is another of the film's strengths, overflowing with excitement and passion. Joe Hisaishi's symphonic score sounds marvelous in addition to all this. Whether you choose to ponder its various messages or be swept away by its adventure and sense of the fantastic, Nausicaa Of The Valley Of The Wind is a science-fiction classic."

Since then I have purchased it on DVD, and seen it in its original dub.<br/><br/>This film might be a shade under 25 years old, but do not let that put you off, this is 1 animated film that stands up to the test of time and looks as amazing now as it must have all those years ago. The story will grip children & adults, presenting to them a Post-apocalyptic era where the world is partially inhabited by Humans, and the rest to giant Insects in an uninhabitable areas known as the Sea of Decay. Its a mixture of morals about living together in cooperation and of protecting the Environment, but is so well presented into the narrative that it doesn't force it onto the viewer.<br/><br/>The characters are all presented and given enough time for us to learn about them and not just added in as cannon fodder or fillers to the main protagonist. Speaking of whom, Nausicaa is standout character which all Studio Ghibli films produce, someone we just cant but like and love whilst never being weighed down in clichés or by others.<br/><br/>This is a film for anyone, of any sex and of any age and all will find enjoyment from it, and possible a bit more. Its a timeless classic by which you can judge any animated film to, and I cant recommend it enough. 10/10"

","I love this film, it has a great warmth. It is a piece of artwork which is astoundingly beautiful, where the colorful graphical creation blends well with the well composed music. The setting is interesting and innovative, especially by the unpredictable turns it takes.<br/><br/>There is a clear message in the film and for cold persons who don't care for other thing than themselves it is probably a menace, but I really liked it. With the numerous films preching violence, destruction and revenge as method, it is wonderful to see one of the few where non-violence and caring in a larger sense is suggested. It is a film where even a great warrior might choose to get him-/herself insured to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. The film does not simplify and demonize the ""bad guys"" - these are shown as complex figures who do what they see as the right thing in the situation they are in. Although fantasy, the film does tell a lot about the complexity of human conflicts and other ""big issus""."

The characters, animation, and story are all great. Plus the voice acting for the English Debut is great. Alison Lohman is a good choice as Nausicaa. Patrick Stewart was suitable for his role as Yuppa. Uma Thurman(not a fan of her) but she was great as Kushana. Chris Sarandon as Kurotawa a perfect choice. Mark Hamill even got to do a role in the movie, not a big part as the Pejite Mayor, but still a good part.<br/><br/>Some of the music is a bit 80s like, but this was the first movie Joe Hisashi teamed up with Miyazaki. His composing was still great back then and still great for Miyazkai's recent films.<br/><br/>If you like Princess Mononoke, you might see about checking this one out. Has the same type of plot which contains Human Vs. Nature related story. Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is now one of my personal favorites next to Spirited Away, Castle in the Sky, Porco Rosso, and Totoro.<br/><br/>I give it an 8/10.

Unfortunately I think this film is dated in tone, direction, and style. The animation isn't overly impressive, the music feels very of its time (80's) and I think more recent films have done this type of journey better. Unfair or not, that's just the reality. Even with that said, the pacifist angle to the story is pretty fascinating and Miyazaki's world building is impressive for being that many years old.

"lasttimeisaw","8","1","1","14 July 2018"," a stunning, thought-provoking anime worth the name of Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli
","Hayao Miyazaki's second anime feature film, NAUSICAÄ OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND is an adventurous post-apocalyptic fable that presciently and astutely imparts us what will become humanity's ruination, humans. <br/><br/>While Miyazaki's fatalistic outlook runs deeply in his works, he knows how to tell an intriguing story by putting a doughty protagonist in the cynosure, typically, a young girl ne plus ultra, possesses all the merits of human nature, against the worst-case scenario, in this case, the residual mankind is facing the aggression from giant mutant insects (called ""ohm"", resembling a trilobite decked with numberless eyes) peopling a sprawling toxic jungle as the aftermath of the Seven Days of Fire, a war has obliterated most of human civilization. Nausicaä, the princess of Valley of the Wind, an untainted Shangri-La covered by verdure and powered by pneumatic energy, becomes the linchpin to thwart this seemingly inexorable annihilation, even if this means she must sacrifice herself.<br/><br/>But what becomes involute is Miyazaki's off-beat sensibility to seek transcendent beauty beneath (in its very literal sense) the overwhelming darkness and venom, perchance those ohms are not aggressors but protectors of the planet earth, the purifiers to detoxify it from human's undue contamination, this revelation strikes like a gut-punch to our anthropocentric conformity, and instantly gives this anime a rightly cynical yet self-examining heart that seminally elevates it to the stratosphere of this unique art form, apart from the artifact's sweepingly fluid craftsmanship of redoubling narrative integration and bizarrely awe-inspiring cel animation imagery, to say nothing of Miyazaki's vibrant palette that often exceedingly appeals to kids and adults like. <br/><br/>As enterprising and edifying as any masterpieces hammered out under the brand of Studio Ghibli (in truth, the studio was founded in 1985, after the film's success), NAUSICAÄ OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND might lose a modicum of plaudits for its rapid-fire agenda-divulging, viz., the motives behind Tolmekia and Pejite peoples are somewhat discombobulating for subtitle-reading first-timer, also the prophecy-fulfilling finale might crop up a tad slapdash and sappy if one is familiar with Miyazaki's other works. <br/><br/>At any rate, quibbles do not obscure all the virtues of Miyazaki's thought-provoking masterwork, garlanded with Joe Hisaishi's synth-generated bravura and a humble reverence to the animistic existence, NAUSICAÄ OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND is a timeless classic, indeed, not for anime aficionados alone."

"bizinfo-09986","10","1","1","15 August 2017"," One of the Best Animated Films of All Time
","Nausicaa is a film everyone should see. I say film because to me it's not really ""anime"", at least not the anime that's littered the media in recent years (most of which I can't stand). It's a film in the traditional sense, and excellent one at that. The story grips you from the very beginning and will take you into a journey that is both fascinating and awe-inspiring. <br/><br/>The biggest challenge for young viewers will be the animation style. With kids these days being used to ADHD-style Disney & films containing pop-up attention grabbers and ultra-slick computer animation, young viewers are likely to pass this film up after seeing that it wasn't produced by Pixar. <br/><br/>Luckily, for those willing to give it a chance, the animation style doesn't hinder its brilliance one bit. I showed this to my kids (7 & up) and they love it. There is some violence, so I don't recommend showing it to toddlers or younger than 7-ish, but overall this is an amazing sci-fi fantasy film that is appropriate for practically all audiences.

"digdog-785-717538","3","12","38","10 February 2013"," Crap
","I will tell you why, with absolute certainty, Nausicaa is crap.<br/><br/>Long, long ago, the same people who made this film also made a much better animation, called Future Boy Conan. Back then, it was revolutionary, and everyone loved it. Fast forward twenty years, and the same exact animations, the same set pieces, backstory, characters, the same identical anime is being resold as Nausicaa, only this time there is less action, less humour, a worse story, the same crappy 80s animation and a lot more of diabetes-inducing sweetness to appease all those girls who in the 80s instead of Conan were watching Candy Candy.<br/><br/>Now, you would be forgiven for thinking this *the bestest piece of anime in the world* as you're probably too young to know that this was once cutting edge, and assume that nothing like this existed before (blessed ignorance), but to see no change in 20+ years and a watering down of the story's darker points to appease the carebear crowd, it's cinematography murder.<br/><br/>Nausicaa in the Valley of the Wind is the story of a girl who is really special, there's some nasty post-atomic crap going on with mutants but she talks to them. Some guys shake their guns a lot. There is an ending.<br/><br/>Well, the storyboard for this film must have not been very challenging to write. <br/><br/>If you are completely oblivious to anime having a history, and wish to gimp yourself, go ahead and enjoy Nausicaa in all its glory; if, on the other hand, you want to *know* what you are watching, leave this piece of crap alone and invest sometime in digging into the Golden Age of Anime, there is a mound of treasures to be found. <br/><br/>Also, Patrick Stewart, could you kindly stop being everywhere? You're in Family Guy, in Star Trek, on stage, and in about a dozen other TV spoken roles. You'r getting to be f* annoying. Your voice is more inflationed than the Zimbabwean dollar. Please stop it.<br/><br/>My vote: 3/10 - this kind of rubbish could only please young children."
"moroboshi-3","Null","7","21","17 April 2001"," Ghibli Shmibli, Nausicaa sucks.
","I've never understood the anime community's opinion of Miyazaki's films.  Okay, so he's made some pleasant movies (My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service), A rip-roaring action romp (Castle of Cagliostro), and one flawed but overall excellent film (Princess Mononoke).  Since when did this entitle him to the rank of ""God of anime?""  Any review of a Miyazaki film done by someone with even a modest amount of anime experience will say something along the lines of: ""Five Stars!"", ""Perfect!"", ""It's Miyazaki, what do you expect?""  The reason that I think Miyazaki gets this kind of praise is that his films, by and large, take no chances.  The character designs in his films are completely homogenized, and almost everyone in them looks exactly the same.  I challenge anyone to tell me the cosmetic difference between ""Mononoke's"" San, ""Cagliostro's"" Clarice, Kiki, Nausicaa, or the angel from ""On Your Mark"".  The themes in his movies are very ""nice"" ones.  They tend to run along the lines of ""Friendly woodland creatures are good"".  Who can argue with that?<br/><br/>But it's this same homogenization and easy morality that tends to get under my skin.  While I enjoy most of his films, I always wish that they were directed by someone with a little more style and individuality.  The purpose of the above rant is to draw attention to the fact that ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"" encapsulates everything that I dislike about Miyazaki into a neat little package.  Some people like to point out that Nausicaa covers similar territory to Princess Mononoke, and was called the inspiration for the latter film.  This is the understatement of human history.  I am extremely glad that I saw Mononoke before Nausicaa, since they are practically the same film.  The only difference is that Mononoke is a good film, and Nausicaa is not.<br/><br/>The film's problems are summed up in Nausicaa herself.  There's nothing wrong with her.  She's a perfect young girl, she's the princess of her people, she loves nature, and abhors violence of any kind.  Thus everybody loves her.  Whenever confronted with a crisis, she reacts in the most naive and idealistic way possible.  The film, just like Princess Mononoke, is in essence a battle of man against nature.  Princess Mononoke was a thought provoking examination of complex issues, showing both sides of the issue, and realizing that there was no simple answer to the problems we face. Unfortunately, Nausicaa decides to beat us over the head repeatedly with a very simple message: ""Nature is the only important thing.  Mankind are scum for trying to destroy it, even when nature is destroying the land that man lives on, because friendly woodland creatures are good"".  I won't spoil the ending, such as it is.  Suffice to say that the only thing worse than the ending I was led to expect was the one that actually happened.  I guess we're all supposed to be happy that the bad people are dead (or curiously edited out of the film), and that everything is all shiny and golden, just like the wise old blind woman predicted.  Oh, and the creepy looking worm creatures have a heart of gold.  Aww. Isn't that precious.<br/><br/>Forgive my cold-hearted cynicism, but this is a complex world we live in, and sometimes the fluffy forest creatures don't know all the answers."
"whitly_12","9","2","4","20 March 2011"," A Somewhat-Flawed Yet Truly-Inspiring Masterpiece from the Mind of Miyazaki
","When I first started writing reviews for this site, I made a promise to myself that I'd review Miyazaki's movies at some point. Now that Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Miyazaki's sci-fi/environmental masterpiece, has finally made its way to Blu-Ray this past year, it's time to keep that promise.<br/><br/>Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind takes place in a post-apocalyptic world of the future, one where the planet has become desolate from an event known as ""The 7 Days of Fire,"" where the world's remaining civilizations are constantly at war with one-another and where mankind is on the verge of extinction due to an ever-expanding toxic jungle. The movie follows a 17 year-old girl named Nausicaa, princess and sole heiress to the peace-loving kingdom of The Valley, in her quest to help keep the peace in her troubled region. When the kingdoms of Tolmekkia and Pejite threaten the safety of The Valley, it's up to Nausicaa to reconnect with man's long-forgotten connection to nature in an attempt to end the chaos once and for all.<br/><br/>There are many things about this movie that I really love, one of them being the animation. Far too many anime shows and movies rely on over-the-top animation to express emotion, and this bothers me because it doesn't help get the point across in the slightest. I've always been an advocate for good animation selling itself, so overblown facial expressions don't help with that in the slightest. To that end, this movie-fortunately-doesn't do that, instead conveying emotion in a respectful and appropriate manner fit for true acting itself. Miyazaki's always been known for adding believability to his characters and environments, and he does that successfully here.<br/><br/>Additionally, the characters themselves are quite interesting. Whether it be the antagonists themselves or even the minor characters, every individual has an underlying motivation for his or her actions. Of course, the antagonists aren't as menacing for it, but you can still relate to them because they're 3-dimensional characters underneath their tough-and sometimes goofy-outer appearances. Props have to go to Nausicaa, the star of the movie, though: had Miyazaki never made Spirited Away, Nausicaa would easily be my favourite of his protagonists.<br/><br/>Two other things I'd like to point out are the story and music. In the story department, you have an environmentalist theme that's given a certain amount of subtlety. This means that both sides are given reasons for what they do, and no one is truly evil (unlike many environmentalist films of the West, which tend to point the guilty finger at man.) As for the soundtrack, it's quite epic, even though some of the tunes are a little too synth at times.<br/><br/>Of course, just like any of Disney's other dubs, the voice cast is great here too. Props go out to Chris Sarandon as Kurotowa, as he's easily the best voice in the entire movie, although even minor characters like Asbel and Obaba are matched well to Shia LeBouf and Tress MacNeille respectively. Alison Lohman, who gives her voice to Nausicaa herself, does come off as a little hoarse in certain shouting scenes, but it's nothing serious.<br/><br/>With that all that said, the movie isn't perfect. Even though I find it incredibly strange that the movie's just now receiving harsh criticism from reviewers on Rotten Tomatoes (up until a month ago, the movie had a 100% approval rating there,) nevertheless there are a few flaws to be had here. Aside from the occasionally-lackluster soundtrack (key word being ""occasionally,"") the second-half of the movie suffers from Manga-Syndrome. This means that the movie, which was based on a manga of the same name, suffers from some pacing issues as it tries to wrap itself up. Not everything is fairly tied up at the end, the villains lose their impact in the climax (not like they had much of it to begin with) and certain side-characters who had potential to be more interesting than they already were are cast aside and forgotten almost entirely. But my biggest complaint is the ending, which seems almost like a cop-out to some degree. I get that the movie is supposed to be a Jesus-like tale about death and resurrection in some ways, but it's very awkward to see Nausicaa be brought back to life after having just been trampled by an Ohmu stampede seconds before that.<br/><br/>Still, even with its complaints, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is definitely a masterful and timeless classic. There are parts that have aged better than others, and it's not my all-time favourite Miyazaki movie, but you'd be hard-pressed not to fall in love with this little gem. Miyazaki really is the master of Japanese animation, and it shows here. A must-see for thinkers who are also artsy, let-alone just a movie lover in general.<br/><br/>Final Score: 9/10."

When riled, the Ohms sally forth in immense herds, crushing entire cities. Sea winds drive the valley's wind mills and keep the inland toxins at bay. Warring kingdoms lie to either side.

","This film has several similarities to Mononoke, the most notable being a more nuanced take on the otherwise standard ""human vs. nature"" conflict. Admittedly, at first it seems as though we are being presented with a bunch of evil humans who want nothing but to destroy nature. Later on, though, it becomes way more believable that people in this post-apocalyptic future are driven to such extreme actions due to their paranoia, ignorance and irrational fear. Normally in such a film, I would be extremely irritated at people's unbelievable stupidity, but it worked for me this time.<br/><br/>The world and creature design were extremely creative and unique and hold up to this day. In particular, the image of the enraged Ohms still stays engraved in my mind. Apocalyptic landscapes are inherently an overdone concept, but Nausicaa manages to be its own thing. It makes no attempts to disguise the inherent harshness of nature nor the inherent ugliness that exists in humanity.<br/><br/>The score is absolutely phenomenal, as we have come to expect from Joe Hisaishi.

Based on a manga of his own making, it's a story about a world fallen into ruin and a secluded valley near the sea where the people are desperately trying to avoid the corruption and poison that have been left behind by their ancestors.<br/><br/>It would take Miyazaki a long time to reach the depth and quality of this film. I'd say that it was Princess Mononoke that finally eclipsed this film in terms of sheer storytelling and world building. Every single detail in this film seems to be thought out and hiding deeper meanings. And the reason for that is because most of the details are given more room and depth in the manga, which I heavily recommend you read. Because if you liked this film, you're going to love the manga.<br/><br/>I'd also claim that Miyazaki never managed to create a better main character than Nausicaä. She embodies all the great things about Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. A warrior princess, who's also studied the Toxic Jungle more in depth than anyone before her. A compassionate leader, having taken over ruling when her father succumbed to the toxins of the world. A pure soul, but lacking the naivety that often accompanies such a characteristic. One of the finest examples of how a seemingly perfect character can still be made interesting and engaging to watch.<br/><br/>As for the animation, Studio Ghibli would go on to make even better looking films, but this is still a beautiful film. Especially the Toxic Jungle scenes that are breathtaking in their majesty. The flying scenes are also very well made and convey the feeling of flight like only Miyazaki can.<br/><br/>The honorary first Studio Ghibli film is also one of their best.

","When I rewatched this film a few weeks ago, I remembered why I love Miyazaki's films so much. This beautifully animated epic, (and I do mean an epic, in every sense of the word), is probably my favorite of all of Miyazaki's films. And it isn't even a Studio Ghibli film, technically. It's stunning animation was by a studio called ""Topcraft,"" and they really knocked it out of the park.<br/><br/>I should also mention the brilliant voice acting by Sumi Shimamoto. She voices the titular Nausicaä, (Who's my favorite Ghibli Girl), and she really nails every single line. In my opinion, her perfromance in this film, and as Kyoko in the ""Maison Ikkoku"" anime are her two greatest vocal performances.<br/><br/>Oh, and this film has my favorite musical score from any Miyazaki film. A must see, overall!"

","Over 30 years ago, a film director predicted how the world would be like quite precisely, and his extensive knowledge, ideas, thoughts, and imagination were tried to reflect on this film. However, this attempt did not result in complete success, because the film could not accommodate his too much big ideas due to substantial reasons at that time.<br/><br/>His excellent predictions imaginatively described a devastating future resulted from nuclear wars, atomic energy, and abuse of technology, as you can easily imagine living in this century. Nonetheless, Nausicaa does not fully solve the mystery of this world, and this film suddenly ends when Nausicaa resurrected by big insects which she soothecalmed, meaning that the peaceful world has come. Despite of whether this ending are satisfying, note that this is not the original ending in the comic, he really wanted to depict.<br/><br/>In the original story of his comics, the relationship between insects (or rotten woods) and people reverses again. Like, polluted airs are actually clean, and clean airs will afflict people. This makes readers be more confusing, ""which side is truly right?"". The director told his producer about this changeover, ""this is life"". At the end of the abstruse tale, a destiny finally made Nausicaa a dramatic decision.<br/><br/>This reversal of values well represents the 21st world which we live in. Around globalism, religion, wealth...people should face and deal with these multiple ambivalent confrontation axes. Moreover, no one can tell the easy answer of these complicated questions, exemplifying political events in England and US.<br/><br/>Hence, this historical magnificent tale tells us how the destiny of selfish mankind will become. This tale is not a fairy tale, but an incredibly realistic prediction for us, who are likely to forget nature and misuse technology. This is why this tale is often regarded as an epic poetry, like Odysseia, from which the name of Nausicaa derives."

One of those story adaptations that does itself justice.

Right? <br/><br/>Well, although kinda cliche... it works quite well here. Her understanding and compassion for those giant worm-bug creatures is touching, when most people would flee in fear and disgust just seeing one.

","I am not a particular fan of animation. There are several reasons why not, for me I often find the charecthers hard to connect with. I also often find the animation takes precedence over the storyline, and the directors get to caught up with making the film look good. Meaning that animation may look fantastic but lack in substance.<br/><br/>However, putting all of those thoughts aside, I still think I would of found precisely the same faults with this picture if it had been live action.<br/><br/>One thing which I was find annoys me in film is when dialouge is used as the sole means of explaining what is going on, or used to push the plot forward. A lot of the time in the first half an hour, the film seemed to do nothing but this. It seemed to be telling you things you already knew, or were obvious and apparent. I find this detracts from the picture, and doesn't allow you to process the information for yourself.<br/><br/>Another complaint would have to be the ending. The film both loses and gains marks for it. I don't like Deus Ex Machina endings generally, so when this one was sprung out of the box I was less then impressed. I don't see the point of killing a charecther only for 3 minutes later resurrect her, with little obvious explanation. When the princess is dropped in front of the horde of stampedding bugs, my instant reaction was that they were all going to miraculously stop, so I was quite impressed when they didn't. I just feel this was spoiled by the resurrection scene, which in my eyes achieved nothing.<br/><br/>There is a lot of good to though. The soundtrack is awesome, and fits perfectly with what the director is trying to achieve. There are also some fantastic shots, and views of the world. I also like the way the credits are used to continue the story.<br/><br/>Overly, i found it to be a very sentimental film.

The reason that I only gave this movie seven stars is because I had seen Princess Mononoke before hand. Princess Mononoke was a visual masterpiece with an extremely similar story to this film, that was made after this film. Both are absolutely amazing portrayals of the same story, but they are the same story.

","I've never been a fan of anime. I'm simply not a fan of their style, storytelling or themes though I understand why some people are. I think it's to do with their pacing. The only reason I watch Miyazaki films is because I've been trying to complete IMDb's top 250 for the past few years and he has several, including one more I have left Castle In The Sky (then it's only two more, Anatomy of a Murder and Ip Man, until I'm done for the first time, assuming nothing in US cinemas suddenly jumps in the list). I never usually dislike his films, but they range from average to decent. I find him too cynical to the point where I can't enjoy his work as his messages aren't charged by anger or sadness, just hopelessness. It makes his work draining in the wrong way. Nausicaa did start strong, but by the second act I was lost even though it did get me back by the end.<br/><br/>I'm usually not a fan of how he invents worlds and creatures that aren't somewhat grounded to a reality I can relate with. In Nausicaa, there are strong parallels to reality but it's dealt with in a far too heavy handed way. It's literally preachy (in this case about how violence and pollution are wrong) and while I don't disagree with the message, it's dealt in a very lazy and on-the- nose way which could easily become more subtle and sophisticated if it could be addressed within the subtext, rather than context. Granted, I can't deny he's a fantastic artist and there are many beautiful paintings here. I like it best when the landscapes are busy than when they're sparse, which Nausicaa suffers from a lot. Fortunately, the film has a great protagonist who (aside from her preachiness) shows great courage and sacrifice and was easy to root for which made it more watchable. Cheesy 80s score didn't help though.<br/><br/>6/10"

","I liked it before it was cool.<br/><br/>Back in February 2002 a local cinema was showing the original Japanese version of Nausicaä and I decided to give it a go since I was such a big fan of Castle of Cagliostro. The English subtitles were horrendous and laughably in need of spell-checking, but the packed audience really got into it, and there was something infectious about the movie.<br/><br/>It wasn't until 2005 that Miyazaki allowed the movie to be properly released in Western countries after the disastrous 1984 cut titled ""Warriors of the Wind"" lost 21 minutes of story and destroyed his vision. Miyazaki lost faith in selling his movies in foreign territories. The new English version has some dialogue problems that one last script revision could have solved, but it's still a far superior animated masterpiece than most of the Disney, Pixar, and Dreamworks offerings of the past ten years.<br/><br/>A thousand years after mankind destroyed that planet and made it uninhabitable, humans have retreated to a few, isolated communities across deserts while a toxic forest spreads across the land. Nature is simply fighting back against the last of mankind, and the gargantuan insects in the forest might be initially terrifying, but are generally looking for peace and status quo.<br/><br/>In the Valley of Wind Princess Nausicaä leads her people with love and inspires them with peace. An invading army from the country of Tolmekia kills her father, the King, and provokes a confrontation with the insects of the forest.<br/><br/>Without Nausicaä there would be no Ferngully or Avatar. Miyazaki was well ahead of the game regarding the story and themes. There is imagination and scope here rarely seen in animation since. There are a few problems though - the subplot with the ancient warrior God falls flat and goes nowhere, the bad guys do not get the retribution that they deserve, and the ending is a little abrupt.<br/><br/>Joe Hisaishi's score is catchy and wonderful, and I highly recommend that you hunt down the many different versions available on CD. The Manga, also written Miyazaki, is much longer and expansive too if you're into that sort of thing.<br/><br/>Not my personal favorite Miyazaki film, but a masterpiece no doubt."
"johnnyboyz","6","2","5","9 February 2013"," Fleetingly interesting; moderately engaging animation that's ultimately too spectacle driven and empty to be anything great.
","I like the opening ten minutes of Valley of the Wind, a dialogue-free passage of purist film-making (animated or otherwise) relying on the premise to a situation; the ambiance, put across via the sound, and the mystery of what's going on as we're allowed to build up our own opinions as to what is transpiring/has already transpired. In fact, I enjoyed the majority of Valley of the Wind; a decent film which is about thirty minutes too long and a lot less interesting by the time it' descended into a rock-'em-sock'em action adventure piece featuring a lot of flying around than it was during its opening. And then there is that opening; a sequence set in a vacated space that has, like so many others in this universe where we are, been killed off by a tidal wave of toxins which travelled through the air brining about death. The character we observe stands, anonymous and gas mask-clad after arriving on board a camel sporting similar face wear. They find a child's doll on the dusty ground thus heightening the impact when the harsh reality is put across in the most subtle of manners: no one escapes, not even kids. The character is armed; a weapon that looks like a shotgun is at hand, but surely a shotgun is a weak and quite primitive weapon in an Anime universe that opens in a post-apocalyptic space. Then, something whirrs into view of our ears: it's what a jet ski would look like if it could fly, and it too sports a masked rider looking to touch down in this exact same space...<br/><br/>Alas, most of what characterises the above does not last and we've long since lost the immense amount of interest we had in how that opening plays out by the time herds of giant beetles are charging across the screen and tank divisions are firing all over the place, a closing sequence we reach by way of huge airships; giant insects and somewhat heavy handed ""green"" political messages. The film is not bad enough to induce a negative reaction, nor too much in the way of being negative to cop any heavy flak - it's more ordinary than that. It does, however, very gradually become less and less interesting as the memory of that opening scene, and how heavy on atmosphere and scenario it was, fades and a newer order sets in. The film follows the titular Nausicaä (Shimamoto), a young woman who, like everyone in this dystopian new world, lives under the proverbial cloud of a recent apocalypse brought about by a huge war causing the planet to be covered by a huge jungle known as the ""Fukai"". Within this jungle lie giant bugs, who are hostile although are not the enemy; one character during the opening even manages to calm one of them down when trouble brewed, an instance lending heavier weight to the glory of the beginning in the fact it sidestepped what a lot of other films might utilise as an opening action ditty to hook the audience in: here, we observe the pacifist alternative.<br/><br/>On the coast lies the settlement of the Valley of the Wind, somewhere immune to the poison out of the fact the sea winds keep it away thus allowing people to plough on. Everybody gets something to do when a group of unpleasant warring people known as the Tolmekia drop into proceedings; their imperious blimp quite literally crash landing into their world and coming to force the settlers to work with them in getting involved in a nonsense plot hopefully resulting in destroying the Fukai. Given the sense of magnitude the Tolmekia's airship possesses, not to mention their existing fleet, you have to wonder what they saw in this settlement of camel riding pacifists who can only muster up a shotgun as their weapon of choice. Drawing on what the Japanese, specifically with their expertise in animation, did in The Castle of Cagliostro, and would later go on to do to in Laputa: Castle in the Sky, the film careens us down a route of a grandeur quest featuring each of these diverse parties and their specific goals. This time, the predominantly rural setting veers us away from the ""castle"" locale and all its joys of its secret tunnels; turrets and clock faces, whilst we have not quite reached the airborne territories of ""Laputa"" which dealt almost exclusively with airships; aeroplanes and fed of a heightened sense of danger its altitude inclined setting had.<br/><br/>It's all moderately engaging, with the Tolmekia suitably nasty, and we enjoy the company of our own leads, even if one of the tracts about how Nausicaä manages to save a young grub on this escapade thus righting a wrong of years ago feels a tad pedantic. Miyazaki has created a fictitious world here wherein we are able to just lose ourselves amidst the exclusive nature of the technology and the unique, unremitting ecological system that they've come up with. There is nothing spellbinding about this particular example of Japanese animation attempting to hit new highs in manoeuvring animations away from their cartoony reputations and into more ""serious"" realms; the very hypothesis of which they mostly undermine anyway in veering it down the childish routes they do when, as mentioned, all the spectacle takes over. It's not bad, it's not fantastic and it does get a little wearing towards the end. Good opening, though."

","As with Miyazaki's other fantasies - such as CASTLE IN THE SKY (1986) and HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE (2004) - the film (based on a graphic novel) takes in a rather unwieldy and muddled narrative which goes on too long! Needless to say, the animator's imagination is most evident in the epic-scale production design - and this is complemented by regular composer Joe Hisaishi's appropriately sweeping score (inevitably fused with then-fashionable synthesizer sounds).<br/><br/>As usual, we get a plethora of characters and factions - both human and anthropomorphic: still, while the heroine is fairly well-delineated (if unexpectedly underclothed!) and the monsters typically impressive (and revolting), her animal companion is severely under-used and the villains prove to be not all that interesting. In essence, what we get here is plenty of action, a touch of magic (it's interesting how in all of Anime', children seem to posses some kind of power which places the fate of mankind in their hands) and a plea for ecological preservation."

","I have to admit the first time I watched this I was left completely overwhelmed, alternately thinking it was either very moving and profound, or just very silly fantasy. So I watched it again the next day.<br/><br/>The second viewing however was quite a revelation. Once you know the basics of the story and characters, you can really immerse yourself in this detailed world, rather than having to keep up with all the exposition and the ""who, where, why, how, what?!"" of the first viewing.<br/><br/>I must add now, that I'm usually a firm believer in original language dubs and subtitles, but having watched the English dub of Nausicaa I honestly think it's the better version to watch. Alison Lohmann is an inspired choice, and gives Nausicaa a much more sympathetic and less sentimental character, compared to the original, rather shrill and hysterical, Japanese dub. Nausicaa also sounds closer to her apparent age, a teenager, rather than a child and the story seems much more coherent and easy to follow, without losing anything in translation.<br/><br/>The animation is brilliant, especially all the flight scenes which I understand are a bit of a Miyazaki trademark. The only slight clunker is the very dated 1980s music, which is an almost avant-garde combination of melodramatic orchestral synths, or crazy disco / pipe organ beats! Not to mention a dose of ""exotic"" sitar flourishes. But it does give the film a kind of 80s ironic charm! Won't go into the story - suffice it to say it's very eco-friendly, with lots of valuable positive themes for the kids. However it also has a great amount of depth (the epic ""Dune"" series springs to mind) and enough complexity and welcome lack of excessive sentiment to entertain adults.<br/><br/>A must-see for fans of Miyazaki's later work, although it may take a few viewings to fully appreciate this fantastic, epic story!"

","Shocks the hell out of me, but this is a negative review of a Miyazaki film. I loved it once when, not too long after its release date, it played a single day at Berkeley's UC Theater. It may have been only the second subtitled anime I'd seen, after ""Hi no tori 2772.""<br/><br/>Last year I read Miyazaki's 1,050 manga of Nausicaä. The manga drew tears that rewatching on DVD simply did not. Watch the film, by all means, but watch it after, not before, you've read every page. The manga, much more so than the film, carries the roots of ""Mononoke"" if those are what you're looking for. Find links there also, mainly in Volume 4 (or 6 and 7 of the Japanese), that don't make it into the film, to the woman/god flux of 'Serial Experiments: Lain' and 'Evangelion.'<br/><br/>That said, the film is full of visual wonder, an extraordinary and necessary primer for everything Miyazaki would do thereafter.

","It's likely my *least* favorite Miyazaki film.<br/><br/>While it is an amazing story, it seems to drag on for hours, well beyond the point of tolerance that many have for a film. It would be nice if it perhaps moved a little faster; there is a point where artistic becomes... painful.<br/><br/>Perhaps the manga version is better- you can read comics at your own pace as opposed to having to follow the story, even the insignificant bits in a film.<br/><br/>Nausicaä herself is boring; she has no flaws. She is exactly the person that is needed for the job and then some. She has superfluous amounts of perfection. Her sidekick is her real highlight, the one spark in her character that makes her truly interesting.<br/><br/>Despite Nausicaä's blandness, there is quite a bit of charm; the visuals are, for the most part, breathtaking when their age is considered. They lack the flash of the more modern anime, but have the quality and detail that marks them as a true Miyazaki film.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this movie to anyone who does not have the patience for a long film, or is unable to stand under-developed characters. I have to say, if it weren't for the Miyazaki label, it is likely this would not have been anywhere near so popular as it apparently is."

","Anime has been a favorite of mine for years, starting with dubs of Pokémon and getting better from that point. I have known, similarly, that Akira was among the first popular anime films in North America and thus opened the way to dubs of Studio Ghibli films. However, I have been wondering if maybe an attempt was made earlier than 1988, all the way back to after this film's release in Japan. Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, being the founding film of Studio Ghibli, is quite easily an S-tier movie. The characters are complexly developed and can deliver both eerie calmness (like Nausicaä herself) and blowout action (like the Commando). This is supplemented by the pristinely elaborate story, giving us a glimpse of the post-apocalypse with depictions that seem relevant in a time when stories like this would only be told by conspiracy theorists. The relative lack of music doesn't hinder the film at all and actually helps it in areas when it is trying to feel realistic or get its message across. To match this is the animation, which I am actually surprised took only 9 months to complete; its drawings of various large objects like the airships and especially the Ohmu seem like they took so much more time to animate so fluidly in 1984. All I can say is, you will miss much if you decide to pass this film, even in favor of other Studio Ghibli films."

","It is hard to believe that an animation like Kaze no ta-Ni no Naushika was released in 1984,considering how well produced it is,even till now when you start comparing this artwork with all the recent releases.Well,I watched it in Blu-ray but still its just gorgeous.<br/><br/>Like all my previous reviews, I usually feel the need to include some basic story-line for the work I am reviewing because it gets me going for elaboration with those said, but whichever way you look at it, Valley of the Wind can be explored in so many different ways so in a way I do not feel its necessary to go by the traditional method.So, this review I have decided is for those who have watched the movie,but simultaneously I will try my best to not give anything away.<br/><br/>The first thing that has blown me away about this movie was the character of her royal highness,the Princess of Nausica. This movie simply could not be made without her, just like all the different religions of Christianity cannot be established without God sending his son- Jesus in mortal form onto Earth to save us.Now,I am not here to challenge your religious believes,and you can be an atheist or Buddhist seriously I don't care because even though I believe in and love Jesus with all my heart and soul, I could really give a sh-it about Christianity and their church warfare and pedophilia obsession as I am an atheist myself,like I always have been.<br/><br/>I don't think I am stretching by any means by comparing Nausica to Jesus,because after you have watched the movie, you will find a lot of similarities between these two exalted figures. First of all,Nausica as a young adult woman is simply beautiful, and all in all when you are looking at someone like Nausica,I think that is the least important trait of hers, but yes for all you Ni-Jikei fanboys out there, she is physically extremely well-endowed for all your wet dreams.She is also an extremely proficient acrobat,martial art and combat warrior, proving herself able to take on batches of hardcore Tolmekian elite soldiers all by herself under years of tutelage by the legendary swordsman in the region. She can also operate her ultra-agile custom-made glider for take-downs and extreme aerial maneuvers with such prowess, she has GOT TO BE one of the best pilots in the universe that she is living in.<br/><br/>But the only thing that made me love her was her character.<br/><br/>For Nausica,her royal highness is an extremely kind,gentle,humble and compassionate individual despite her being a princess of an entire nation. The citizens look up to her, and genuinely adore her for who she is.<br/><br/>On critical occasions, her royal highness's mental acuity had prevented a series of ripple-like effects from consuming entire kingdoms and massacring of hundreds of millions of people.<br/><br/>I find it impossible to even comprehend the possibility or likeliness of maybe there MIGHT be such a perfect woman existing somewhere on the planet.But you if your a normal man like me, you KNOW you would spend all your resources to even stand a 1-in-million chance to catch a glimpse of her presence in real-life.<br/><br/>Now, if you have made it this far,thank you and you are finally going to hear me explain why I think she is someone like Jesus.Nausica had on a lot of occasions, seemingly driven by an innate impulse and a higher call to spiritual dominance for her royal highness to rule on the material plane, constantly risks herself to the most dangerous situations or getting herself killed just to save the most common people whom she love so much,even if it means they will point a gun straight at her face after she had rescued her enemies. I am not saying anything about the ending, but if there is anything in the universe that can command and possibly stop billions of Ohms in their utmost primal rage, if there is anything that can both end and start a war once and for all,if there is anyone hundreds of millions people would die for willingly without a single shred of hesitation,if there is anyone all the countries would sacrifice themselves just to protect that person, if there is anything that can change and shape the course of evolution of universe itself, Nausica is one of the legendary figures you wish you can meet or just reincarnate into Teto loll. I mean, you guys do know Jesus came back after he died right?<br/><br/>This movie is about the life of Nausica, and Nausica, like Jesus are not miracles.They are the ones creating miracles in everyone's life by making you and me smile and filling us up with warmth and love and shining the holy light inside the darkest recesses of your soul. I am sorry if it seems inappropriate to talk about Jesus, both seemingly unrelated figure but they are really similar.<br/><br/>This movie has surpassed a movie, I would give this 20/10 if I am allowed to because I think this is exactly what we need right now.<br/><br/>IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED THIS FILM FOR WHATEVER REASONS, GO GET THIS MOVIE.... NOW!"

","I can directly tell that this is a great movie indeed. The Japanese are great people in designing fantasy worlds. I like how the world has so great diversity in contrast. Anyone versed enough in movies can immediately spot the things that gave ideas to other movies. I see this movie's influence on Avatar (the ship design, the plants design, the forest design), Attack on Titan (the Titan's own design), and even Starship Troopers (the whole insects theme, and the ohmu's design on the brain bug). The story is unfortunately is a straightforward a children's story of good versus evil with minor twists here and there. There it's very much predictable. I saw the original version with Japanese voice, adding adequate authenticity to the experience."
"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","9","1","2","3 October 2015"," Can Miyazaki make a boring film? I don't think so.
","Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is an incredibly beautiful film that is like a classic Disney film: its animation is still striking and the story still moving in spite of when it came out exactly. Hayao Miyazaki wanted every one of his frames in his films to be as beautiful as paintings in an art gallery, and boy are they gorgeous here. <br/><br/>This film is further evidence of Miyazaki being a cinematic genius comparable to Stanley Kubrick, Alfred Hitchcock, David Lean, Sergio Leone, Jean-Luc Goddard and Akira Kurosawa just to name a few. Nausicaa is one of the many memorable entries in the Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki film canon, and contains many of the filmmakers' trademarks, like feminist characters, environmentalism, aviation and sweeping landscapes of the film's world.<br/><br/>Compared to the rest of Ghibli's films, it stands out from them with its predominantly post-apocalyptic themes and misunderstood creatures, which Miyazaki has the rare gift of making something seem so alien, visually easy for us to understand and remember.<br/><br/>Nausicaa is a gem and is truly a film for the eyes of the beholders."
"Vartiainen","Null","1","2","10 September 2015"," Postapocalyptic environmental adventure
","One of Hayao Miyazaki's earliest film, based on his own manga series, and the film that allowed him to found Studio Ghibli. Often considered to be the honorary first Ghibli film, and definitely an important film for Japanese animation in general. It's also a tremendously fantastic story in general.<br/><br/>The film takes place after the fall of civilization. Something called the Seven Days of Fire has ravaged the Earth, leaving desolate wastelands and deserts behind, but also something more sinister and threatening. A humongous mass of spores, rot and corruption called the Toxic Jungle is slowly engulfing the Earth and there's nothing humanity can do to stop it. The jungle is completely inhospitable to humans, but it breeds life of its own, most notably giant guardian bug creatures called the Ohm. But why did the jungle came into being, what is its purpose and how can Nausicaä, a warrior princess of a small seaside valley, save her people while two opposing nations threaten to unleash war upon her lands?<br/><br/>Nausicaä is one of the first films directed by Hayao Miyazaki, but even then he had already found his voice and the film is filled with his trademarks. Fantastic flying scenes, strong female characters, gorgeous animation and designs, haunting music by Joe Hisaishi, and one of the most nuanced and subtlest environmental messages ever seen on film. It took Miyazaki a long time to eclipse this film, and in my opinion only Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away do so without question.<br/><br/>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind is one of my favourite films of all time and definitely my favourite postapocalyptic film. It is a tale of heart, courage and acceptance, filled with unbelievable characters and breathtaking visuals. Go see it and then see the rest, if you haven't already."

","Warrior/pacifist Princess Nausicaä desperately struggles to prevent two warring nations from destroying themselves and their dying planet.<br/><br/>Going through the IMDb Top 250, I keep thinking I have seen all the mainstream anime films, and then another one rears its head. Most I simply do not care for and I have no idea what the appeal is. One, ""Howl's Moving Castle"", is actually quite good, and deserving of being on the Top 250.<br/><br/>This film is second best, and could be worthy of the Top 250, so long as it is below ""Howl"". Now, I get that the creatures are impressive and the animation is actually quite good for 1984, but there is just something about ""Howl"" that is hard to beat."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Kaze no tani no Naushika"" (1984) is another superb piece of art from a great Hayao Miyazaki. It tells a very involving sci-fi / fantasy story and it tells it very well. The animation is deep, rich and beautiful as always, although not as impressive as it will be in creators next efforts, but that's understandable as it was one of the first movies he created.<br/><br/>Still, ""Kaze no tani no Naushika"" is not to be missed to all who loves works of Hayao Miyazaki and who likes good sci-fi stories.

"Thanos_Karagioras","7","1","2","24 February 2015"," One more masterpiece from Hayao Miyazaki...
","""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"" is an animation movie which shows us a Warrior/pacifist Princess Nausicaa who is trying really hard to prevent a war between two nations and also wants to save their dying planet.<br/><br/>I believe that for one more time Hayao Miyazaki made a really good job not only in the direction of this movie but also in the writing of it and his great job is obvious in this movie. I liked this movie because it wants show us a fight for the best result which is peace and wants also to shows us what people have to sacrifice to succeed it and protect it. This movie shows us all of this from the animation perspective but it wants us to think further more than this and not think of this movie as a childish movie and nothing more. Some movies that I can compare this movie with would be of course from Hayao Miyazaki and especially ""Howl's Moving Castle"" and ""Princess Mononoke"" which I found them equally good.<br/><br/>Finally I believe that ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"" is a great animation movie to watch because even if is an animation movie it can give you many things to think of and of course consider about these. It can also make you feel somehow different because I have to say that Hayao Miyazaki is a master int his, he can transfer to you emotions even from an animation movie and this is something that I believe that makes him one of the best of his kind."

I recommended because it tell you to forgive people for their mistake and struggle and never lose hope how bad the situation is and have different point of view all your own while other people think forget about their thinking do whatever you think is like. A good message is shown by film.

Look before you leap"
"MissSimonetta","10","1","2","7 August 2014"," More than a rough draft for Princess Mononoke
","Yes, we get it: this film does not have the depth of the original manga, which is to be expected as Hayao Miyazaki's epic would not be completed for another decade. Now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's talk about how this film stands on its own merits.<br/><br/>Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (1984) marks a turning point in the career of Hayao Miyazaki. His previous work in television was marked by lightweight adventure and slapstick. In his feature directorial debut, The Castle of Cagliostro (1979) we can see signs of the melancholy and maturity which would arise in his later work, but it is in Nausicaa that this vision erupts in full bloom.<br/><br/>As great as this film is as a sci-fi adventure, at its heart it is a drama about the tense relationship between man and nature. This is no preachy after-school special in the vein of Captain Planet; Nausicaa eradicates black-and-white morality by portraying characters with both virtues and uglier sides. And this includes the titular heroine herself.<br/><br/>Often criticized by anime fans for being too ""perfect,"" Nausicaa is actually a complex figure whose ideals of peace and understanding are put to the test when foreign soldiers murder her bedridden father. The pacifistic, gentle princess reacts to this atrocity by murdering all the men in the room in a fit of rage which is stopped when the mentor character Yupa steps in. It's a great scene, one of my favorites in any movie ever, because it shows how even the most kind-hearted of people have a dark side, and it is a moment which gives this film a greater depth than it would have otherwise.<br/><br/>The man-nature relationship and gray morality would be explored to greater success in Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke (1997), but this is still one of Miyazaki's finest films. And despite Mononoke being technically better, I still prefer this movie, with its magnificent heroine and that haunting final shot."

","Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984) is otherworldly. Yes, that's the word that I find myself writing repeatedly on a paper when I am reviewing this for my blog. Out of this world, sophisticated; this film I am watching is not something ordinary. I tried to watch this film from 80s perspective because it may not be fair to judge or compare it with recent films. Not like I know how exactly people in the 80s would feel and react to it but there is not much flaws that I could criticise and I actually found out that this film is truly artistic, it is still able captivate its audience until today.<br/><br/>What is more, Studio Ghibli brought the standard for anime films to another level with this film and it deserves a lot of respect. This film is also quite beautiful for a 1980s animated film and it has strong harmony and ecological concern message. Certainly, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984) is one of the best adventure films I have ever watched! It is lovely, enriching and I am fascinated with its characters, world creations and gigantic insects! If it has a chance to be reproduced and remake in a larger scale, I think it can be as epic as Lord of the Rings series!"

","The anime whose critical & commercial success led to the formation of the now legendary Studio Ghibli, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind is a masterwork of imagination & creativity which tells the story of a young princess who believes in peace & harmony and tries to stop an impending war between humans & mutant giant insects in a post-apocalyptic world.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Hayao Miyazaki, the film also brings on surface the current world issues like war & its futility, rising environmental pollution, shifts in ecological balance around the world & the ignorance of mankind to all these important matters due to greed, power or corruption. The animation is visually delightful & voice actors have done a fine job in voicing their carefully fleshed out characters.<br/><br/>Cinematography elegantly captures its subject matter in meticulous detail, editing could've managed a few more trims, music is most impressive in the third act & its themes concerning the environmental issues are smartly presented to the viewers.

I even watched Spirited Away, and even Spirited Away did not influence me like Nausicaa! At that time i did not pay attention to the director. But Nausicaa was something different, something amazing! <br/><br/>This anime can influence anyone i think. There were many things mentioned that i cannot really write them separately. Action is not stopping, situation are only getting worser and from the start to end you are waiting impatiently how all this will end. <br/><br/>Another beautiful aspect is that Miyazaki showed us future in the anime in 1980s.

","Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is about a Princess from The Valley of the Wind who has to risk her life to save her people before it is consumed by The Toxic Jungle. Hayao Mayazaki is truly a animation genius. No wonder why he has been described as the ""Japanese Walt Disney!"" Like Walt, Mayazaki has a broad sense of imagination and his animation is simply phenomenal. Shots of Nausicaa flying on her glider are some of the most stunning animation I've witnessed that's made by anyone that's not Disney! The ending featuring a wonderful decision made by Nausicaa was simply moving. Some of the more emotional moments were a little weak, especially when the Nausicaa character is voiced by Allison Lohman, who was good in the role 95% of the time, but as a whole, Nausicaa is a wonderful film from the legendary Studio Ghibli, with an excellent voice cast, which also includes Patrick Stewart, Uma Thurman, and Edward James Olmos, a powerful and thought-provoking story that's highly original, and full of grand imagination. I'm impressed!"
"bkrauser-81-311064","7","1","2","10 January 2014"," Miyazaki's Early Masterpiece
","The name of animation director/producer Hayao Miyazaki is highly celebrated, more so than that of Walt Disney in some circles. For decades he has been proliferating the imagination of young children all around the world including and especially in his native land of Japan. Stop me if you've heard these titles: Howl's Moving Castle (2004), Princess Mononoke (1997), My Neighbor Totoro (1988), the Academy Award winning Spirited Away (2001). Every one of them has meticulous and powerful hand drawn animation, tenacious imagination, strength and gentility. While I may not be a fully realized convert of ""anime"" as an entertaining animation style, I do believe that the works of Miyazaki deserve its praise.<br/><br/>Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (1984) is certainly no exception when it comes to Miyazaki's brilliance. While it may not be Miyazaki's first animated feature, I would argue it is the first in which he let's his imagination run wild and free. The principle story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where the remaining humans live in fear of a steadily growing poison forest populated by dangerous giant bugs. Two warring civilizations fight for the remainder of cultivatable land while a young princess named Nausicaa tries to save her small kingdom from inhalation from all sides.<br/><br/>The 80's and early 90's would see a boom in ecology themed children's films and TV shows a la Once Upon a Forest (1993), Ferngully: The Last Rainforest (1992), Captain Planet and the Planeteers (1990-1996) et al. Yet Nausicaa remains probably the most interesting artistically speaking, and had I watched it young, it may very well have been the most powerful. For Miyazaki doesn't belay the point with one-sided monologues or simplistic anti-environment villains, he gently nudges you towards a world view that accepts beauty in balance; interconnectedness with our world whether we choose to see it or not.<br/><br/>It is said that the original American cut of the film was so badly edited that it had a radically different story all together and forced Miyazaki to look to Disney for distribution. It was likely an edit that lacked any of the darker elements for which there are many. The largest of the killer insects are gigantic amour plated grubs called Ohmus who charge and trample anything that gets in its way. One of the principle characters is a princess from a war-like civilization that has had limbs torn apart by killer bugs. Then of course there is the gun violence between people which makes this film a bit of a no-go for younger audiences and discerning parents.<br/><br/>Still, those who don't mind stomaching a little cartoon violence (you telling me Courage the Cowardly Dog was any tamer) should see this movie. It's beautifully and lovingly made by the best animators of any generation. In addition to making the aforementioned hits, Miyazaki would go on to found Studio Ghibli the Japanese production company responsible for other anime hits like Grave of the Fireflies (1988), The Secret World of Arrietty (2010) and From Up on Poppy Hill (2011); three movies that tested the limits of animation and introduced complex themes at a time when animated stories were becoming overly simplistic.<br/><br/>Nausicaa first put Miyazaki on the map and in the consciousness of Americans and international audiences alike. While the age of Ralph Bakshi and Don Bluth have come and gone, replaced by the likes of John Lasseter and Brad Bird, Miyazaki has stayed consistent in his quality. Miyazaki's body of work remains a testament to what is possible through animation and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind ranks among his very best and most creative efforts. I envy his imagination. Who else would send the head of Disney a samurai sword with a note reading: ""No Cuts""?<br/><br/>http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"

I literally kept my breath during some scenes, especially when the two main characters fell into the poisonous jungle without the masks. I don't know but this movie somehow reminds me of The Lord of the Rings. May be they inspired each other? Any way, it would be nicer if the two main characters had some kinds of romantic emotional development towards the end of the movie, like the couples in Princess Mononoke or Laputa. But I couldn't complain since it has many other beautiful aspects. Overall, I enjoyed watching this piece very much. And I am sure you will."

"jose-cruz53","10","1","2","29 September 2012"," A Masterpiece
","* Edit: This film should be viewed in Japanese, the dubbed voice acting is terrible, period.<br/><br/>Nausicaa is a post-apocalyptic sci fi/fantasy animated film. It's perhaps the ultimate nerd movie: a whole new world is created from Miyazaki's unbounded imagination, involving massive post-apocalyptic wastelands and the remains of civilization trying to survive in these environments. That's what I like! The film was based on the first two volumes of a seven volume epic manga series and simplifies much of the original story to fit the movie. However, since the author of the manga and the movie was the same (Miyazaki) there isn't any direct contradiction and the manga nerds cannot complain: it's like if the Lord of the Rings movies were directed and written by Tolkien.<br/><br/>In a sense, it's like an improved Star Wars, but without any of the stereotypical villains. The music, by Joe Hisaishi, while not as complex as the music he made for Miyazaki's later films, is still great and matches the atmosphere of the film perfectly. The only film score that has given my goosebumps are Hisaishi compositions, indeed, they are a major differential between Miyazaki's films and the rest of cinema, and a major factor of why I rate Miyazaki's films above the rest of cinema. The backgrounds and the designs are also breathtaking and while the quality of the animation is not on Akira's level (in this film less than 60,000 cells were used, compared to 160,000 cells for Akira) the much more compelling story of the film more than compensates for this weakness.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is nearly flawless, with only a couple of problems involving its low budget which crippled the ending. Still not enough for me to remove any points from a perfect score. One of the greatest films ever made and is one of the ultimate examples of the experiences that can be provided by cinema.<br/><br/>Edit: Upon fourth viewing I think that I would upgrade my impression of this film from ""one of the greatest ever"" to ""probably the greatest film ever made"". Why? A great film must be about a great subject and this film is fundamentally about the importance of people (and creatures) respecting each other as they respect themselves. Set in a world destroyed by war, (spoilers alert!) the film opens with last remains of mankind fighting each other and being slowly destroyed by Earths self defense mechanisms and ends with peace among man and between man and Earth. The main character, Nausicaa is an heroine of mythical proportions, a character that is very much like Jesus, in both her degree of compassion and her story through the film, as she suffers from death (her sacrifice to save her people) and resurrection though the film."

"patryk-czekaj","9","1","2","20 June 2012"," A masterpiece for all generations
","Note: I am referring here to the original version of the movie, not the poor one called Warrior of the Wind available on video. Therefore, I strongly suggest that you should watch only the real edition of Nausicaä.<br/><br/>Even though Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind came out a year before the emergence of Studio Ghibli and is not officially accredited as their production, it was later considered as the movie, which actually began the rise of this accredited Japanese animation studio.<br/><br/>At first, Hayao Miyazaki created the fantastic post-apocalyptic manga of the same name. After he saw that people were so captivated by it, he decided to turn it into an animated film. It was his first full-length movie, and it decidedly started a marvelous career of this guru of the animation genre.<br/><br/>It has it all: beautiful, sweeping, colorful and detailed animation, interesting, complex, and engaging storyline, worthwhile and well-developed characters, impressive visuals, and a complex and serious message.<br/><br/>The story happens in a distant future in a world, which was greatly destroyed by the war named Seven Days of Fire. It created a Toxic Jungle, in which strange creatures reside, and where everything is poisonous and thus deadly. There are only a few places left, where it is possible for humans to live, one of them being the titular Valley of the Wind. This is the home of Nausicaä, the peace loving, empathic, lovable, brave, and overly compassionate princess. It's also a place that looks soothingly peaceful, where people seem cheerful and hospitable. However, one day they are attacked by a group of Tolmekians, who plan on destroying the forest and exterminating all the mutants. They take the princess and a few hostages and take off. This is where Nausicaä's grand adventure starts, as she realizes that she might be the only person, who actually cares for the forest and its inhabitants, and knows that damaging their land will only have disastrous effects on the remaining Valleys.<br/><br/>Nausicaä is a true heroine that the anime genre deserves. She is a strong and talented warrior, but she doesn't use her powers in the wrong way. Quite the contrary, she not only wants to help her race, but also fights in order to protect the creatures, which seem lethal to regular people. She uses her powerful gift of communicating with the monsters in a proper way, and doesn't even seek revenge after her father's brutal murder.<br/><br/>It's a movie, which definitely wasn't designed only for children, as some may claim. It's really a first rate entertainment for the whole family, and everyone would be able to take something very personal out of it.<br/><br/>I must say that I'm very impressed (as always in Studio Ghibli productions) by the creativity of the writers and animators. They created so many original, interesting, and outstanding fantastical creatures and monsters. And from the very first moment when you look at them you know that they all come from the hands of crafty Japanese animators.<br/><br/>In the English version the dubbing, which features a few notable American actors, is actually good and doesn't downgrade the, so to say, Japanese-ness of the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, I must admit that I fell in love with Nausicaä after the first time I saw it. It took me some time to find the real version, but you can only imagine my satisfaction after I finally laid my hands on it. It's a breathtaking movie, with an inspiring tale and genuine characters. If you want to get to know Hayao Miyazaki start from here, and you definitely won't regret it."

","There have been many films released over the past few years which have environmental undertones; Avatar, The Road and Wall-E to name a few. Whilst these films have mainly used the environmental theme to create the setting for a story, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (the second film by Hayao Miyazaki) fully embraces environmentalism, creating a story which has as its central theme the relationship between humanity and the earth.<br/><br/>The film is set in a post-apocalyptic world where the Earth's ecosystem has been destroyed in what is referred to as The Seven Day War. The central character is Nausicaa, a Princess of the Valley of the Wind, which is one of the last few habitable places on earth. Large swathes of the earth are now covered by a 'Toxic Jungle' which is guarded by a variety of giant insects.<br/><br/>War breaks out when a rival race, known as the Tolmekians, invade and destroy the rival city of Pejite in order to obtain the embryo of a Great Warrior (the creature who is thought to have destroyed the earth) which recently been discovered. On transporting the embryo back to Tolmekia, the Tolmekian airship crashes in the Valley of the Wind, prompting the Tolmekians to invade the Valley in order to retake the embryo. It then falls to Princess Nausicaa to try and restore peace and harmony.<br/><br/>One of the first things that struck me when watching the film was that it was incredibly ahead of its time. Originally released in 1984, the environmental theme of the film is very relevant to the modern day and Nausicaa has to be one of the few films which may be more relevant now than when originally released.<br/><br/>Another thing which I thought interesting, was that Nausicaa contains that rarity in modern day cinema; a strong female lead character. Too often in animation and often in live action films, the lead female character (if indeed there can be said to be one) is the stereotypical damsel in distress. In fact, if you look closely at the Disney Pixar Films, not one of them even has a strong female character (the closest Pixar comes is Mrs Incredible in The Incredibles). It is therefore refreshing that Nausicaa bucks the contemporary trend and not only has a female as its lead character, but a strong female warrior who is not afraid to risk her life to protect all other species on the planet, be it good or evil.<br/><br/>The animation is lovingly rendered and each frame incredibly detailed resulting in a visual experience which doesn't feel out of place when compared to more recent examples of traditional animation. The world in which the film takes place is exceptionally complex and is comparable to the worlds which exist in Star Wars, Lord of the Rings or Avatar. Some of the different races and transportation which is used in the film clearly reference Star Wars and it is clearly one of the main inspirations behind the film.<br/><br/>Whilst the detail of the setting adds to the richness of the film, it also creates some complexity in the story. The last half hour of the film is chock full of different locations and tribes of people (such as the Tolmekians, the Pejite and the people of the valley). As the story nears its conclusion we constantly jump from one event to another, many of which often happening simultaneously, and this leads to a bit of conclusion in the plot.<br/><br/>Overall, whilst I enjoyed this film, I didn't love it. I didn't ever feel that emotional connection with the main characters which I need in order to truly fall in love with a film. Despite that I think there are enough interesting aspects of this film to warrant a repeat viewing, however I do not think its status as one of the top 250 films on IMDb (as at 20 May 2011) is justified."
"Eternality","7","1","2","25 April 2011"," A less involving film than expected.
","Only his second feature-length film, legendary Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki stunned anime lovers with an adventure story that would thematically and visually pave the way for the success of later works such as Castle in the Sky (1986), and Princess Mononoke (1997). Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, as it is called, is an interesting film, but in my opinion, it is incomparable to most of his later works. Having watched all of Miyazaki's films, I strangely feel a lack of emotional attachment to this one, though the spirit of wonderment, a hallmark of every picture of his, at least still comes across unscathed.<br/><br/>Nausicaa is the name of a beautiful and brave princess who lives in a small agrarian valley where the wind always blows. Such a natural phenomenon is important because deadly toxins from the Sea of Decay, a heavily polluted area that covers most of Earth, are blown away from the people of the valley. The Sea of Decay is one ghastly place, with all kinds of insects inhabiting it. One type of species, called the Ohms, which look like organic versions of Sentinels from The Matrix (1999, 2003, 2003) trilogy, look disturbingly creepy, but unless they feel rage, they are very much benign in nature.<br/><br/>Speaking of rage, there is plenty of that to go around in Nausicaa. The princess is angry at the warring nations that are threatening to destroy the lives of people. The Ohms want revenge against the humans for being aggressive toward them. The fragility of the Earth's ecosystem to support life hangs precariously in the balance. The pacifist warrior Nausicaa must stand up against tyranny and destruction to save her people, the Ohms, and everything in between that breathes. Miyazaki's ecological themes are obvious here, though his message of peace and harmony while strong, comes across as less affective here than in the more masterful Princess Mononoke.<br/><br/>Well-drawn and representing an early showcase of Miyazaki's creativity, Nausicaa unfortunately feels jagged in its editing, causing it to function not as effectively in its storytelling, character development, and the execution of its action sequences, many of which involve aerial battles that require smoothness in cuts to invoke pronounced feelings of excitement and tension in viewers. Joe Hisaishi, in his first of many fruitful collaborations with Miyazaki, composes a score that is part orchestral, part electronic, the latter of which seems out of place at times.<br/><br/>Some would disagree, but I feel that Nausicaa is one of Miyazaki's weaker works, at least from a technical standpoint. Even from a storytelling point-of-view, too much weight is placed on the title character's shoulders to lead the film on her own. In some of his best features, Miyazaki often pairs up or groups strong heroines with one or a few fascinating supporting character(s), with their interplay producing some of the most tender and affective moments. In Nausicaa, this is less obvious, and together with a quite unconvincing villain, these factors unfortunately lead to a less involving film than expected.<br/><br/>GRADE: B- (7/10 or 3 stars)<br/><br/>www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com<br/><br/>All rights reserved."
"ja_kitty_71","10","1","2","5 January 2010"," My top favorite Miyazaki film
","It was very hard to choose my top Miyazaki film, but I choose Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. At first, I had never seen the film until I had bought the Disney 2-Disc DVD of the film. I thought the dub-casting was excellent with Alison Lohman as Nausicaa; Shia LaBeouf as Asbel; Patrick Stewart as Lord Yupa, and Uma Thurman as Kushana.<br/><br/>The film is based on a manga made by Miyazaki himself. Set in the year 2984, a thousand years in the future, when global war had incinerate the Earth. The Earth has become an unrecognizable place. Large parts of the world have been swallowed up by forests of poisonous fungi. The remaining humans live near the fungus and it's monstrous insectoid inhabitants, trying to prevent it's spread. One of the human kingdoms, the peaceful Valley of Wind, loves its gentle Princess Nausicaä and her father the king, but their peace is about to be broken, as they are swallowed up in the machinations of their larger, warmongering neighbours. However, Nausicaä has hidden potential, and may yet change the fate of the world.<br/><br/>It's truly Miyazaki's epic masterpiece, and also a great film to show us the seriousness of global war and our environment."
"chenjira","9","1","2","24 January 2008"," A Miyazaki Must-See For All Fans - A Masterpiece
","I came to 'Nausicaa' in a round about way.<br/><br/>Upon the strength of a film critic's opinion on TV I went to my local video store and rented out 'Spirited Away'....and I was and the journey just keeps getting better.<br/><br/>I then sought out other Miyazaki works and this is the was the last of his catalogue of works for me to see and, as you never are with Miyazaki, I was NOT disappointed.<br/><br/>Nausicaa tells the story of a Young Princess on an Earth far in the future, when the world has been war-ravaged by humans and mostly destroyed. The planet, through the help of giant insects and fungi is starting to repair itself.<br/><br/>The spore of the fungi is poisonous and deadly to humans, yet there are still some remote places where it has not managed to reach. One such place is the home of the eponymous heroine Nausicaa in the Valley of the Winds.<br/><br/>Nausicaa is a wind rider who sails a futuristic glider and is one of a small number who can communicate with the most fearsome of the giant insects, the terrifying Ohmu. These are insects the size of a building that once enraged will destroy anything in their path and are almost impossible to calm. Nausicaa is one such person who, with the aid of only an insect whistle, has the power to calm the Ohmu.<br/><br/>All is not well however and Nausicaa's father is infected with the poisonous spores that are slowly costing him his life.<br/><br/>It gets worse as a plane in obvious distress crash-lands near the village with a ancient and deadly cargo that could potential destroy what little life remains on the Earth.<br/><br/>Shortly after are warring faction of humans attacks the village of the Valley of the Winds, in search of the deadly cargo that the crashed plane has.<br/><br/>They enslave the people in the village and set about preparing for a 'war to end all wars' against the insects.<br/><br/>Nausicaa has to set out to seek the help of another tribe in order to save the village and possible the world.<br/><br/>Prepare for a thrilling ride to find out whether she does. ----------------- I don't want to give too much of the story away. Primarily I am worried that I will make the story sound over-complicated, which is definitely isn't.<br/><br/>The first thing to mention about this film is that it is definitely not in style in the more well-known Miyazaki films. Miyazaki definitely has his own style and ""Howl's Moving Castle"" and ""Spirited Away"" are perfect examples of that. This film is as close to an 'anime' feel he has ever got.<br/><br/>It is simply stunningly beautiful. Landscapes of a future Earth, giant insects, war machines and characters are all beautifully drawn.<br/><br/>Then there is the story. My synopsis may sound a little confusing, but the film really is not. It's a great premise with some great under-lying themes that, considering the film was made in 1984, are even more apparent today: Humans destroying the Earth, Humans moving to live a sustainable life without further damaging their environment, learning to live in harmony with wildlife.<br/><br/>The film is faultless and also contains a great score.<br/><br/>Miayazaki has a brilliant gift as a story-teller, add that to his legendary, influential and iconic animation style and you have arguably the best animator to have ever graced the planet.<br/><br/>This is no Disney, but you would never want it to be.<br/><br/>An Epic in every sense of the word.<br/><br/>N.B. I do not know of any dubbed versions of the film, the copy I have and friends have are almost all subtitled, which for me is even better!"
"alexakarpov","10","1","2","13 November 2007"," The most subtle and deep of all Miazaki's works.
","I have to say this - none of the author's latest works can compare to the masterpiece that Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is. They are neat, they are cute, they are wondrously made, yet not a single one of them is as humane, deep and... *painful* as this jewel of a movie. It is widely acknowledged that this work has environmental motives. It does, but forget about it. It also has flying ships, but it isn't a story about flying ships, right? It is a story about fear, a story about ignorance, and a story about hate which is born from ignorance and fear. And it is a story of compassion, and a story of a great pain, which accompanies those who are brave enough to bear the burden of a true compassion - for they have to face fear, ignorance and hate of those less strong. Thus it is also a story of courage that transcends the life itself. These are the things what the story of Nausicaa is about. <br/><br/>Miyazaki's works lack the concept of God (at least in a non-Shinto way), and author himself explicitly denied that he had any Christian ideas while working on the movie (although by the time he finished the Nausicaa manga in 1994 he slightly changed his outlook), but I can't help it - this is the most profoundly Christian animated movie I've ever seen. And, unlike many works which were actually conceived as Christian, this one is genuinely free of all the clutter which frequently plagues religiously themed works."

Our friends came to borrow it for many times, but each time I went after them to make sure I got it back in the best condition.<br/><br/>We are amazed by her courage and loving heart.<br/><br/>The glider is our favourite object, keeps me thinking about how it is to fly like that<br/><br/>We just watched 3 more times in last 2 days.<br/><br/>Some movies are meant forever."
"polar24","8","1","2","2 March 2007"," A mystical, ancient story with a potent environmental message
","Miyazaki's early film captures the wondrousness and magical elements that have perfused each of his latest masterpieces under Studio Ghibli. Once again, the familiar elements include child-hero protagonists, struggling against a plundering king or queen, and heavily laden with environmental morals.<br/><br/>This film follows young Nausicaä, Princess of the Valley of the Winds, struggling to save her country from invading Ohms out to wreak revenge on humankind after hundreds of years of human's plundering the earth's resources have left it a desert. She acts as the guardian and saviour to a variety of curious and exquisite insects with the desire to keep their natural paradises intact.<br/><br/>Having been a huge fan of Japanese animation when I was young, I have had a falling out with this style since being involved in live-action film. I had not seen an animated feature in this style for quite a while on seeing Nausicaä, and at first, one can be surprised at the sparseness of animation and lack of over-textured and moving environs. But once the story grasps your senses, you wake up to a wondrous and enchanting world, and you notice many of the subtleties that define the famous Studio Ghibli. The simplicity of the animation only enforces and characters and places their concerns in the centre frame. The action sequences are thrill ride every time, and a sight to behold. The fluidity and detail in these scenes is striking and so energising; and considering the movement is all hand-drawn, it truly is a marvel to wonder at. As in most Miyazaki films, the action is always a highlight and so fun to watch. The real skill is in the storytelling and Miyazaki pulls you into this world so charismatically and vividly. Soon you forget about the details attach yourself to the world  I was wondering why we can't have more simple, pure storytelling like this today?<br/><br/>The film is quite strong in Japanese idiosyncrasies including the lifestyle, person-isms, speech, and most strongly, the humour. While I found it quite comical and amusing at times, some of the audience (many Aussies) found it quite disconcerting and even distracting, to the point I heard some doze off. This is unfortunate because if one sees the film with a very open mind you can find yourself being absorbed into all the charm of this dreamlike world. I was completely whisked away and really warmed to these distinctive characters.<br/><br/>Nausicaä's battle for the environment on behalf of these intriguing creatures draws lucid parallels to the ecological demands we face in our world today. Especially with the recent interest in our natural world, Nausicaa highlights many concerns in her struggle that make us realise that sometimes we too caught up with economic development and world conflict to realise our most precious resources are in grave danger.<br/><br/>Even with this early effort, Miyazaki's film is never primitive and only too relevant to out to the world situation today. He always tells a story so lovably and charming, and in what is primarily a Japanese animation breaks all the language and cultural barriers. It is only too easy to relate to his characters' potent themes of war, childhood intuition, and environment hazards. With Nausicaä, and the Ghibli legacy, Miyazaki proves himself as one of the greatest storytellers of our time."

","This is absolutely my favorite out of Miyazaki's great body of work. Kaze no Tani no Naushika combines all of the traditional elements that make an anime great. Romance, adventure, action, science fiction, monsters and Miyazaki always chooses the most beautiful music to accompany the soundtrack. Nausicaa and the Valley of the Wind is epic and though I very rarely watch anime in English, preferring the original Nihongo, I will sometimes make an exception in this case because the English voice of Lord Yupa is Patrick Stewart. All of these seemingly disparate things make this the most delightful piece of animation I have personally ever seen. I recommend it especially for those that are new to the world of Japanese animation as a way to get into the ""feel"" of it. It carries that ""feel"" so much better than Mononoke-hime, (Princess Mononoke) for example I think."
"elsinefilo","Null","1","2","30 June 2006"," another great environment theme by Miyazaki
","I came to recognize Miyazaki when I saw his two famous animes ""Spirited Away"" and ""Princess Mononoke"" on top 250 list.Like it or not there are still many people who don't take the animation genre seriously into account.But we should always bear in mind that anime is not exactly an animation.Its distinctive character and background aesthetics visually set the genre apart from the animation. You probably notice most animes look like hand-drawn cartoons while the animation is openly computer assisted.Not just that you can watch an animation with your kids or little siblings but you may not just expect a kid to like an anime.They are really sophisticated,profound and philosophical. As people start to recognize Miyazaki from his well-known works they can't help wanting to see more animes by him and this leads us to see his earlier great works which are relatively less known than his recent great work of arts. Pretty similar to Mononoke-hime there is an open ""environment"" theme in Nausicaa.The story takes place 1000 years after the seven days of fire,a catastrophe which destroyed the world's ecosystem.Although humans survived the disaster which they probably caused the land surface of the Earth has become heavily polluted and the people started live in clusters away from each other.Most of the world is covered by dangerous forests which house poisonous insects including the giant ""OHMU""s.The sympathetic heroine of the story Nausicaa is noted for her empathy towards animals, humans, and other beings even to those giant insects in the dangerous poisonous forests.When the surviving humanity is still in throes of some interests this girl-the princess of the Valley of the Wind finds out that the forest is actually reviving its pure ecology and the insects are actually there to protect the forest.While the people are still hanging on to personal conflicts(like using God warriors against each other)this girl's duty would not be easy. This great anime was released in 1984 long before Miyazaki's recent classics.It's nearly as good as them.Don't miss this anime feast."

Over the recent months i've been trying to watch up all of his movies and Naussica was one of the few that i knew nothing about. The thing that amazed me the most (besides the story, which was great) is how amazing the cast was. The English cast is not listed here but includes names like Uma Thurman, and Patrick Stewart, and Shia LaBeouf. Its great to watch a dub with outstanding actors voicing it, and Miyazaki's movies just seem to attract those sort of actors. I am a sucker for girl power stories. This one is a perfect example. The Princess is an amazing character that i think gets overlooked when compared to his newer movies, but as far as i'm concerned she's right up there with Chihiro from Spirted Away and Sophie from Howl's Moving Castle (two other masterpieces from director Miyazaki, watch them!!). I also like the message it sends, it makes for a good life lesson for all those little kids out there!"

","Most anime (Japanese animation) fans negatively criticized the film, Warriors of the Wind (originally Kaze No Tani No Nausicaa; translation: Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind) because of its horrendous dubbing and unforgivable dismantling (about 30 minutes was cut!; more about it later on in the review), and I must agree. However, the first time I've seen Warriors of the Wind, was when I was only eight... I thought it was the best film I've ever seen.<br/><br/>First let me critique on the animation itself. The animation was smooth, beautifully rendered, and I even thought that the Americans made the film. Now that I became a huge anime fan, I should've known better!<br/><br/>This film even rivals those of Disney and other American animation studios, with their computer generated images and whatnot, and Warriors of the Wind was made over a decade ago! I'll say it again... a decade ago! That's how good Japanese animation really is! For all you anime haters or think that animation are just for kiddies, bite me! Okay, sorry but I had to say what it should have been said before.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to what I said about the film being the best I've seen. If I said that same phrase today, the anime community would ban my ass out for praising such a hack. However when I was still eight, I did noticed the horrible dubbing that the film had. That's because the people behind the dreadful American version was re-edited by New World Pictures (source: Team Ghiblink, IMDB.com), a really horrible film production company that produces mediocre to just plain bad movies. Also New World Pictures edited and hacked 30 minutes of precious film work and the most important parts of the film!<br/><br/>Hopefully, Disney's acquisition of several Miyazaki masterpieces would give this film new life, better than what New World Pictures did to this film.<br/><br/>In conclusion (and I know you folks are getting bored just reading this whole thing) for those who haven't seen this film yet, just give it a try. Hey, you might even like it and might be a great addition to your collection.

(I don't know precisely where the two diverge, however)  Some differences are obviously independent of this, but those (like the absence of the Dorok) are excusable, because cramming too much into an (already packed) 1.5 to 2 hours has been the downfall of many an anime.<br/><br/>Even if it HAD been an adaptation of the entire manga, and not just an extrapolation of the beginning of it, as it stands it would still be the best such adaptation of a long story that has ever been animated."

However, I disagree with those who say he takes no chances with his movies--even Kiki's Delivery Service flies in the face of the Japanese policy of paying a woman to stop working once she gets married and has a child (as could be assumed through the pregnancy of Osono, who is more a less Kiki's role model and foster mother).  Just because we as Americans find something to be innocuous, it doesn't mean that in another culture it is.  For instance, I don't know how many times I've heard people complain about Japanese movies that portray a kiss as a big deal (such as in Ranma 1/2) just because in America it is not.<br/><br/>Nausicaa is flawed, yes, but mainly because it was animated by the same group who animated the Hobbit--just look at the leap forward the animation quality is between Nausicaa and Laputa, the first Ghibli film. Also, Miyazaki had only completed a small portion of the second book of the comic before he was finally convinced to make a movie version--he finally finished the comic in 1994, a full ten years after the movie was released.  To compensate, he combined two groups of people into one (the Doroks and Pejitians), portrayed only one of the royal family of Torumekia (Kushana, whose three brothers and father were constantly plotting against her), and set most of the story in the Valley of the Wind instead of the Dorok principalities.  That said, Miyazaki had to come up with a conclusion in 1984--what we get is the best we could hope for.<br/><br/>The comic, by the way, is very complex.  Nausicaa is not portrayed simply as a heroine--in fact, at the end she basically kills the old world (you have to read the whole thing to understand).  Kushana, who by the end of the anime is only starting to become a complex character, is one of my favorite characters in the comic (check out the scene where a little boy calls her a ""deeply wounded bird"").<br/><br/>Still, the movie has some great things that are not in the comic: the crumbling doll, the murder of Jhil, the handcuffs that Nausicaa cuts after the Princess Rastel dies (in the comic, she was not a prisoner), Kushana's surprise revelation in the fossilized spaceship, the more emotional visit to Nausicaa's secret room."

","Well, i own Warriors of the Wind and the original Studio Ghibli Subtitled ""Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind"" on video cd.  The legit version released by studio Ghibli is 116 minutes and IMO, is so much better, also because i like subtitles because the video remains unchanged.  The New World Video dubbed version (Warriors of the Wind) had about 25-30 minutes cut out in it, and the dub wasn't that good either. New World's license to Nausicaä expired sometime in 1995.<br/><br/>Although this is one of my all-time favorites, the Nausicaä manga was the best.

","Even compared to the rising fame of Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke, this film is by far my favorite out of his growing collection.  As old as it is, I still watch it with a totally renewed interest, sinking deeper into it's sincere message of human destruction.  And speaking of human destruction, I'm still ashamed with the dubbed version Warriors of the Wind.  Hopefully, Disney will make up for that horrible mess and release a newly dubbed (and not mauled) version here in the states soon.  Just in case you haven't seen this, DON'T see Warriors of the Wind.  Try with all your might to find the subtitled version.  I watched the butchered version and my eyes were falling out, for half the movie was cut to make it ""action-packed"", the plot was flipped around, and we have Rocky the Squirrel and a ninja turtle playing the (differently named!) characters.  (*sob* Nausicaa is such a prettier name than Princess Zandra!)"
"Chibi Riza","Null","1","2","7 May 2000"," Very moving film.
","An anime so powerful, that it was banned and boycotted in so many countries! ""Nausicaa"" is one of the moving films Hayao Miyazki has ever  done.Miyazki is often known for doing many cute movies.Even though this movie can be cute at times, it can also be dark too. Not to mention that the characters are very interesting,especially the neat princesses,these are not the stereotypical weak princesses for once! Wonderful film,alot better than many of those ""newer"" Anime films!"
"mamo-3","10","1","2","26 January 2000"," One of the most amazing animated works ever
","Nausicaa, despite its age, remains an amazing piece of animation. Although some may argue that its animation is not quite up to par with the more current Disney and Anime features, the story and themes present make this a timeless classic. An dramatic ecological masterpiece with a number of similarities to Miyazaki's more current ""Princess Mononoke"", Nausicaa is the story of a young princess in a world filled with deadly poisonous forests that slowly consume the nations of the planet. Set 1000 after the collapse of modern civilization, these nations vie with each other for both control and the survival of their peoples. The main ecological themes present in the movie are quite though-provoking and truly universal. The animation, even after more than 15 years, is still impressive, and the direction and cinematography at times is amazing. Although I have not seen the edited American version ""Warriors of the Wind"", I recommend seeing the Japanese version, as it is much closer to the original in both plot and theme. In addition, I also recommend reading the manga, which is somewhat different and far more detailed (The movie was made 11 years before the manga was completed)."
"sqrticus","10","1","2","16 January 2000"," Don't compare it to the manga
","The manga had a much superior, much darker, and IMO much more disturbing feel and outcome.  This movie was finished long before the manga was, and thus could not follow the line of the manga exactly!  Besides, it would be futile to try to fit all of the manga into a two-hour movie.<br/><br/>Keep that in mind when watching this film.  I enjoyed this movie significantly more than Mononoke Hime primarily because it was more serious and had fewer slapstick comedy elements.  I think the triad -- Nausicaa, Laputa, and Mononoke -- are all equally appealing to different people for different reasons, and I enjoy them all immensely.<br/><br/>What makes Nausicaa stand out for me?  It's a story primarily about the evils of war and about the ill effects of the destruction and manipulation of nature caused by man.  Compared to the mystical and somewhat detached nature of Mononoke (discussion of the ""soul"" being a primary focus, one which lost me also in Ghost in the Shell) or to the frivolous and shallow purpose of Laputa (ooh, I'm a descendant of tyrants, great...), Nausicaa seems more relevant to me.<br/><br/>Additionally, unlike the manga (also incredible, but for different reasons), which seems to show limited elements of beauty but always makes you remember that they're just out of reach for the characters, the movie does a better job of making the beauty of the world stand out in stark contrast to its fatal nature for humans.  Perhaps part of this is that the movie does not deal with the concept of extinction as the manga clearly does in the final 30 pages.<br/><br/>So, if you have not read the manga, you will definitely like this movie; if you _have_ read the manga, you should try to consider them as two separate stories which share some events and some characters.  It really is a closed story (unlike the Lord of the Rings movie, which just stops in mid-stride) despite the fact that a lot more happens in the manga."
"joelray","10","1","2","2 December 1999"," A beautiful tale of Man and Nature
","This is one of Miyazaki's two films about the conflicts between man and nature (the other being Mononoke Hime).  The Japanese trailers even stated ""12 years since Nausicaa"".  It is a wonderous story with beautiful music, and it is truly a masterpiece which you must see!"
"chrisdeutsch","Null","1","2","24 October 1998"," I preferred the comic
","Though seen as a classic by many anime-lovers, it doesn't even come close to the original comic. It seems that the director (the artist and writer of the graphic novel) gave up the idea of making a perfect adaption of his non-animated work after the first ten minutes of the film. Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie, but about as disappointing as the animated version of the Lord of the Rings, stopping right in the middle of the story as well. Viewers of the German translation beware: Many scenes were cut (and dialogue rewritten) in this version, as the translaters didn't like the idea of this film actually critisizing industrial pollution ! Not necessarily a must see. You be the judge."
"MeloDee","7","2","7","9 April 2006"," Weird, but pleasant.
","Considering Miyazaki was the maker of Spirited Away (which I saw in bits and pieces) and Princess Mononoke I expected to find some weird things and creatures, and of course, wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>The main theme of the movie is generally ""humans are bad, humans messed up the earth, humans pollute everything, be kind to creatures, we fear what we don't understand"" and so on and so forth. The plot itself, however, manages to use this theme without tipping the scales too far over to the ""mediocre and repetitive"" direction.<br/><br/>As for the characters, I failed to find too many problems with any of them. I liked Princess Nausica in particular. She was strong-willed, compassionate, and a leader without managing to come across as just another ""annoying princess."" The movie in general was boring in some places, but overall had a really original setting (so far as I know). A few of the battles were a little choppy/cheesy, and there was a lack of music beyond that of the ohm (sp?) song, but that I think I will have in my head for a very long time. It added a nice touch.<br/><br/>This -probably- wasn't one of Miyazaki's best works (am I being too generous by not saying 'definitely'?), but I think if you just generally crave something animated that's a blend of both sci-fi and fantasy, this may just be an OK choice."

","One thousand years have passed since the Seven Days of Fire, an apocalyptic war that destroyed civilization and created the vast Toxic Jungle, a poisonous forest swarming with giant mutant insects. In the kingdom of the Valley of the Wind, a prophecy predicts a saviour ""clothed in blue robes, descending onto a golden field, to join bonds with the great Earth and guide the people to the pure lands at last"". Nausicaä, the princess of the Valley of the Wind, explores the jungle and communicates with its creatures, including the gigantic, armored trilobite-like creatures called Ohm. She hopes to understand the jungle and find a way for it and humans to co-exist."
"DonaldDooD","7","1","3","3 August 2014"," An Early Classic - Has It Aged Well?
","Although it was Miyazaki's first original feature, I watched Nausicaä after four other films of his. Its also the first - and last - one I watched with my dad. ""What was that sh@!?"" He grumbled. :P <br/><br/>Back then, I thought it was his weakest film. I still do now, but I have more respect for it. Its the simplest in terms of plot and character and has the ""worst"" animation - but it was earlier in his career. And when compared to the typical film, it still has more beauty and soul.<br/><br/>Like most Ghibli films, Nausicaä goes great lengths to develop an original world. Its a mixture of fantasy and sci-fi, medieval and industrial. The forests are particularly unique - almost alien, with fungus-like plants and strange, giant insects. Combined with a likable lead, a serious story, and an orchestral/electronic soundtrack, it must have been quite the surprise three decades ago...too bad they butchered the English release.<br/><br/>My biggest problem is that the story is a bit too ham-fisted. Nausicaä is more or less a perfect hero. The pro-environment, anti-war message is obvious and pretty simple. Nausicaä won't win any converts, and my eyes were fairly dry. Princess Mononoke is a very similar film, but is an improvement in almost every aspect.<br/><br/>Its still fine, though. It you like the aesthetic or just want a fantasy adventure, its a good choice. And like most of Miyazaki's films, its great for children. It treats them as intelligent human beings, and it might go down as one of their favorites. You don't need to feed them blockbuster goofs every movie night for them to be happy. Make some memories~ :P"
"SnoopyStyle","8","1","3","25 March 2014"," Imaginative and wonderful
","In a thousand years in the future, the world is struggling against giant insects and a poisonous encroaching jungle. Nausicaä is a young princess of the people of the Valley of the Wind. It's a small kingdom ruled by King Jil. They are constantly defending the Valley from the gigantic Ohm insects and poisonous plant spores. Then they are attacked by the Tolmekians led by Princess Kushana. The Tolmekians are trying to reassemble an ancient Giant Warrior to burn all the jungle. When Nausicaä escapes, she discovers that the jungle may not be the source of the poison.<br/><br/>It's a wonderfully imaginative movie. It's an early full length movie directorial effort from brilliant Japanese animation master Hayao Miyazaki. The only thing is that it takes place in a world that is all too real. I wish that it is much more other worldly. Maybe if it takes place in an alien world. There is a small nagging realism question when it's trying to explain nature and the poison. However I'm willing to sidestep all of it and just feel the central message rather than trying to think too much about it."
"Al_The_Strange","10","1","3","28 April 2013"," Nausicaä review
","Hayao Miyazaki's 1984 animated film stands as my personal favorite of his repertoire. While he typically gives us worlds that are whimsical and magical, touching for both children and the inner child in all of us, Nausicaä stands as the man's bleakest and most sobering universe imaginable. The film journeys far into the distant future, where war and pollution has transformed the Earth in frightening ways. It's a world overrun with giant insects, and toxic forests that spew lethal spores, all threatening to smudge out humanity. As for the human race, little has changed.<br/><br/>With this setting, the film offers up a sci-fi/fantasy adventure that is evenly thrilling and quite unique. Miyazaki's perilous world is filled up with fantastic airships and gliders, and characters swash-buckle their way through with swords and muskets. They confront warring kingdoms, sporting tanks and planes, in addition to gargantuan insects and other odd creatures. Once the plot picks up, the action and peril becomes enthralling, without getting overly bloody or brutal about anything. The film is rarely funny or lighthearted the way other Studio Ghibli films are, but when the bullets aren't flying and the airships aren't blasting each other away, the film does take its time to breathe, and let a certain sense of wonder permeate through the characters and settings.<br/><br/>In addition to having such a strongly-developed setting, the film has a quality story. The plot is well-structured, with many layers of problems and conflicts heaped on in a coherent manner, which ultimately leads to a profound climax. Above all, the film has a very strong pathos; I've always found it very easy to relate to princess Nausicaä, who stands as the single most sensible and moral character in the film. It's especially inspiring to watch her take the pacifist stand, always willing to be selfless and sacrifice herself for a greater good. These characteristics prove to be the best way to handle the bigger issues that the film harps on: themes of war and the desolation of the environment. The film's ultimate message seems to be that rage and destruction doesn't solve anything, whereas compassion and understanding facilitates the healing process. With such profound and inspiring themes at work, additional themes of rebirth emerge as well.<br/><br/>This is an older anime film, so it does look a little rough around the edges. A few scenes clearly use cheap tricks to create the illusions of movement or action. Regardless, the film still boasts some quality artwork, especially with the settings and military hardware. Designs for all the settings, characters, vehicles, props, costumes, and everything else are pretty decent. Voice-acting has its cheesy moments, but there's nothing I found particularly cringe-worthy. Music is pretty weird.<br/><br/>While the film's fantastic aerial battles and frenetic fights captivated me initially, it was the imaginative world and the compelling characters that gives this film a deeper heart and significance. Recommended! 5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)"
"Desertman84","10","1","3","24 October 2012"," A Great Anime With An Eco-Message
","Hayao Miyazaki gained widespread attention in Japan for his complex ecological manga series, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind in 1982, which he adapted for the screen two years later in 1984. This animated post-apocalyptic fantasy adventure is written and directed by Miyazaki and it is based on his manga of the same name. The film features the voices of Sumi Shimamoto, Goro Naya, Yoji Matsuda, Yoshiko Sakakibara and Iemasa Kayumi.It tells the story of Nausicaä, a young princess of the Valley of the Wind who gets involved in a struggle with Tolmekia, a kingdom that tries to use an ancient weapon to eradicate a jungle of mutant giant insects. Nausicaä must stop the Tolmekians from enraging these creatures.<br/><br/>Centuries after war has devastated the earth, Princess Nausicaa leads the people of the Valley of the Wind. Feuding clans fight with planes and tanks as well as swords in a world that is both primitive and futuristic. In addition to her people's conflicts with other factions, Nausicaa must also contend with the insects of the jungle including the Ohmu, a race of giant, intelligent bugs that poisons the surrounding atmosphere and is spreading rapidly. Nausicaa is more concerned with harmony and communication than with conquest and revenge. Sympathetic to the Ohmu, she learns she must approach them with understanding to achieve peace and restore the dying world.<br/><br/>This film is beautifully animated and written, and the moral to this ecological fable is difficult to miss. It is in some ways a grim and serious but it mixes a sweet optimism into its horror-filled lessons.Aside from that,it enjoys a visual richness and narrative ambition virtually unheard of in animation prior to its release on screen.Overall,it is a must-see anime."

","I love this movie. I remember watching the better voiced shorter version ""Warriors of the Wind"" back in 1984. This one may have more content but it didn't make up for the lack of quality from the voice actors, who for the most part are inexperienced in animation voice acting save for a few. If they had used the old voice actors and put in the new content then it would've been great. I have the original on tape anyhow but it's always nice to have it on a DVD. I own all of Studio Ghibli's other films and I recently saw ""Tales from Earthsea"" in Japanese and can't wait for that one even though it won't be released here for a few years due to licensing. All in all I still bought this DVD so I could have a higher quality video output while listening to the original Japanese voice cast. This is a must buy for Ghibli fans and non-Ghibli fans!"

","The version of the movie I have seen is the DVD release. I watched the dub version. The voice acting on the dub is very good. Uma Therman & Patrick Stewart are in it, so you know it will be good. Included on a second disc are little featurettes. A cute one was where they showed the actors in the studio, wearing their shorts & hanging out, discussing the challenges of inflection in a translated script. Uma Therman was laughing about how she learned Japanese for Kill Bill, but still had trouble with the emphasis, since often it is reversed. The movie itself was remastered. The style is very 80s. It is sort of dated in a retro way. The creatures & settings are very well drawn and highly detailed. The thing I really like about the movie was the fact that it was not just about a young girl struggling to keep her village safe, but also about the footprint humans are leaving on the planet. Miazaki has a way of sneaking a moral into a story so subtly that you hardly notice. In this case, he really shined."

I was either not paying attention when I watched it as a kid, or the Japanese version made more sense than the English dubbing one. This movie revolves around this young princess and the valley she lives in. A peaceful place that lies on the boarder of a deadly toxic forest that threatens to consume the world. There is also wars going on between other nations and one of the wars is being taken to the peaceful valley. The war is over an ancient creature known simply as the giant warrior.

"roguefighterca","10","1","3","19 March 2005"," Base comparison
","In terms of comparison of the multiple versions of this film, I can safely say I have seen 3 versions of it. The first one being the original English dubbed version entitled ""Warriors of the Wind"". Most would tend to agree that this is the worst of the three, citing a changed storyline, poor voice acting, bad editing, etc. I feel that is not the case since nothing was really changed story wise other than a few names. Most of the plot was in tact. The voice acting was standard for the time, with a few problems with the ""mood"" of the voice and the character on screen. And as for editing, I will agree that there was too much removed from the story, however it didn't affect the flow too much, but it did remove some of the explanation. As for the original, ""Kaze no tani no Naushika"" was really no different than the new Disney version. The editing is very similar, and the story remains in its intended form. The subtitles were the only pain of that version, but such is the price to be paid to see the original in all it's glory. As for the Disney version, the only real problem I had found was the sound. In many cases, the voice actors seemed too quiet while talking, and (not to slam one of my favorite actors) Patrick Stewart was the worst one for it. Granted his character ""Lord Yupa"" was a monkish type of gent, so likely he was a very soft spoken fellow indeed, but at times I yearned for authority in his voice. Also Alison Lohman had some quiet time as well, and seemed to have had problems expressing her own voice, especially when dealing with the insects. Those minor problems not withstanding, the Disney version was the best of the three, mostly because of the cast, because the editing kept in scenes I had not remembered from the original Japanese version, and because they did not change any of the original sounds, or musical score. Bravo to Disney (for once) for retaining a classic, but most of all, bravo to Miyazaki for his wonderful story which is by far one of my all time favorites."

The music is of course captivating too; bold, majestic and eerie right when it needs to be.<br/><br/>Now for the negatives.<br/><br/>Basically everything that was wrong with Mononoke. It's a preachy parade of left wing sentiment. Now I am usually the most far left person in any given room but that doesn't mean I think anything kind of pro-environment with a female protagonist is going to be instant gold. A movie needs more substance than just political affiliations.<br/><br/>Naussicaa is not a heroine who is easy to like. She has no depth beyond being a mouth piece for the writer. She is given no room to develop or review her feelings. She's right and everyone else is wrong. She is smug, sanctimonious and condescending.<br/><br/>A message about peaceful reconciliation is fine but the movie only makes a very shallow discourse about it. Naussicaa is clearly capable of combat but her tears over the movies only victims is just mawkish.<br/><br/>No doubt some glutine free home schooling parents will enjoy this with their kids, content about how they're keeping the toxic masculinity of disney from corrupting their kids, but it's no less pandering.

","I have tried to see many more films from Studio Ghibli, the Japanese cartoon creators who have produced many magical films over the years, this was another one I found, dubbed into English, directed by Hayao Miyazaki (Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, Ponyo). Basically a thousand years have passed since apocalyptic war the Seven Days of Fire, that destroyed civilisation and created the vast poisonous forest the Toxic Jungle, swarming with giant mutant insects. In the kingdom of the Valley of the Wind, a prophecy predicts a saviour will guide the people to the pure lands, the princess of the Valley of the Wind, Nausicaä (Drag Me to Hell's Alison Lohman), can communicate with its creatures, including the gigantic, armoured trilobite-like creatures called Ohm, she hopes the jungle and humans can co-exist. One night, while the Valley's swords-master Lord Yupa (Sir Patrick Stewart) is visiting, a cargo aircraft from the kingdom of Tolmekia crashes, Nausicaä tries to help a wounded passenger, Princess Lastelle of Pejite (Emily Bauer), who pleads her to destroy the cargo ship before dying, the cargo ship is an fact an embryo of a Giant Warrior, one of the lethal bio-weapons that caused the Seven Days of Fire. Military state the Tolmekians seized the embryo and Princess Lastele, but they were attacked by mutant insects, one of the insects emerges wounded from the wreckage, poised to attack the frightened villagers, but Nausicaä calms it and guides it away on her jet-powered glider. The next day, Nausicaä's father is killed and the Giant Warrior embryo taken by Tolmekian troops, led by Princess Kushana (Uma Thurman), and Officer Kurotowa (Fright Night's Chris Sarandon) who plans to use the mature Giant Warrior to burn the Toxic Jungle. Kushana takes Nausicaä and five hostages from the Valley, before leaving, Yupa discovers jungle plants in a secret garden, reared by Nausicaä, who determined plants that grow in clean soil and water are not toxic, but humankind has tainted the soil of the jungle. The Tolmekian ship carrying Kushana and her detachment is shot down by an agile Pejite interceptor, crash landing in the jungle it disturbs several Ohm, which Nausicaä soothes, she leaves to rescue Pejite pilot and Lastelle's twin brother Asbel (Shia LaBeouf), both are swallowed by quicksand and find themselves below the jungle in a non-toxic area, Nausicaä realises the polluted topsoil can be purified by the jungle plants, producing clean water and soil underground. Nausicaä and Asbel return to Pejite, but insects have ravaged the capitol, those remaining are making plans to recapture the Giant Warrior, Nausicaä is captured, but Aspel and his mother help her escape. While flying home Nausicaä finds a team of Pejite soldiers using a wounded baby Ohm to lead thousands of Ohm in a herd into the Valley, the Tolmekians deploy tanks, their firepower cannot the Ohm, and the prematurely hatched Giant Warrior is deployed, but disintegrates. Nausicaä frees the baby Ohm and gains its trust, they stand before the raging herd and are both run over, Nausicaä is killed, but she is revived by the Ohm, she is revealed as the saviour from the prophecy. In the end the Ohm and Tolmekians leave the Valley, the Pejites remain, helping the people rebuild, meanwhile deep underneath the Toxic Jungle, a new non-toxic tree is sprouting next to Nausicaä's lost aviation goggles. Also starring Mark Hamill as Mayor of Pejite, Edward James Olmos as Mito, James Arnold Taylor as Muzu, The Little Mermaid's Jodi Benson as Lastelle's Mother, The Simpsons' Tress MacNeille as Obaba, Scooby-Doo's Frank Welker as Gol and Tony Jay as Narrator. Set in a post-apocalyptic world it is a simple story of a warrior princess forced to take action to stop economical disaster, so there is an environmental message, the story is perhaps a little underdeveloped, perhaps confusing in moments, but the cast dubbing into English are chosen well, and the animation and colourful imagination is superb, overall it is an enjoyable animated fantasy adventure. Worth watching!"

","After a holocaust in a post-apocalyptic future where there are some remaining people in some parts of the world while the rest of it is a toxic rainforest of spores that are fatal to humans but never to giant insects. There are guardians of the forests called Ohmus which are very protective creatures, a spirited but beautiful princess warrior named Nausicaa (Voiced by Alison Lohman in the English dub) is a friend to insects and trying to find solutions in curing the radiation of the world in a special valley where the air is pure to breath called the Valley of the Wind. However there is a rival house of Torumekians lead by Kurotowa (Voiced by Chris Surandon in the new English Dub) and Kushnan (Voiced by Uma Thurman in the new English Dub) who want control of the kingdom and to kill off some of the giant insects unknowingly would bring another face of doom to the world for she must prevent that from happening with the help of a boy named Asbel (Shia Leiabeouf in the new English Dub).<br/><br/>A spectacular and unique Japanese animated science fiction fantasy adventure from Hayao Miyazaki marks the debut of Studio Ghibli after his first directorial debut with ""Castle of Cogliostro"" which was a box-office flop at first in Japan and based on his successful graphic novel has turned into a phenomenon with it's critical raves and box-office success in it's country. It's a beautifully animated and creative animated tale in the tradition of Star Wars, Heavy Metal Magazine Comics's Azarak stories, Frank Herbert's Dune, Akira and Mad Max with some originality and style to it. The film came to the United Stated in 1985 from New World Pictures in a terribly edited different dub called ""Warriors of the Wind"" which featured Cam Clark (Leonardo on Ninja Turtles and the original voice of Keneda on Akira) and Hal Smith that featured some character name changes but a few kept their name like the wise Yupa character and did some different story changes while keeping the PG rating. Miyazaki was not happy with this cut back then as the film has gained a cult following here in the US thanks to that cut and the uncut fansub tapes passed around over the years.<br/><br/>I remembered when i was a kid back in 86 i rented Warriors of the Wind and loved it but it wasn't until in 97 when i was 16 that when i saw the uncut fansub tape that i realized how much Warriors of the Wind was a butchery but did also taped it. Luckily in 2005 we got a superior uncut English dub with the voices of Chris Surandon, Patrick Stewart, Tony Jay, Alison Lohman, Mark Hamil and Edward James Olmos with remastered picture and sound. The soundtrack has a good charm to it as it uses a bit of synthesizer and orchestra music at times besides the gorgeous artwork and of course there's a good eco-saving message in this movie in a nice manner. This movie is one of James Cameron's favorite movies and was one of the influences to his ""Avatar"" film as you can see here.<br/><br/>Also recommended: ""Avatar"", ""The Last Unicorn"", ""The Secret of NIMH"", ""Dune (2000 Mini-Series) and Children of Dune"", ""Star Wars Saga"", ""Star Trek Movies"", ""Akira"", ""Ghost in The Shell"", ""Starchaser Legend of Orin"", ""Heavy Metal"", ""Vampire Hunter D 1 & 2"", ""Wizards"", ""Ferngully The Last Rainforest"", ""Willow"", ""Starship Troopers"", ""Total Recall"", ""Transformers movies"", ""G.I.

"a_chinn","5","1","6","21 October 2017"," Painfully slow second act nearly kills this early Miyazaki film
","I'm a big Hayao Miyazaki fan and had not seen this one before, so I was fairly excited to watch this film on the big screen. However, I was a bit disappointed and would have to say this is the weakest of Miyazaki's films I've seen. The story of the young Princess Nausicaä, who has a connection to nature, is seeking peace between three warring kingdoms and wishing to restore the earth's environment seem like ripe Miyazaki fodder, but this film is slow moving and the pro-environmental message was preachy and heavy-handed. Miyazaki almost always has a pro-environmental message in his films, but this one seemed to hit you over the head with it. But the main problem with this film is a deathly slow second act. The film starts strong and has a reasonably good conclusion, but the middle section is pretty lifeless, which is exacerbated by a lack of interesting characters outside of the titular princess. Overall, I suppose this is worth watching for Miyazaki fans, but it's certainly not a good entry point for those new to his work."

","I adore the manga. It is easily in my top five favorite manga I have ever read. It wasn't until years later that I saw the movie. I didn't care for it. I wanted to like it, I really did. It's a gorgeous film. <br/><br/>I understand why they couldn't show the full story in a movie. To give you an idea, the movie covers the events of the first of four volumes, altered so the story can end there. If they had tried to cram everything in, the story would have been a muddled mess. So while I'm sad many of my favorite characters couldn't make an appearance and that the scale of the world is much smaller than the source material, I get it.<br/><br/>What really bothered me was the reduction of depth in the main character. The trouble with writing messiah characters is making them a little too perfect. The book was able to take it's time with the character. By the second volume she has to make her first big compromise and by the last volume she has to make a series of tougher and tougher choices. The movie just didn't have the time. The major character traits are still there, but with the exception of the duel, it shows none of the internal struggle she had in the series."
"Lobo55","7","1","7","4 December 2012"," Overrated Classic
","Through no true fault of it's own, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is an Overrated Classic. It is a film of grand, sweeping visuals, an intriguing world, and is full of many of the hallmarks Hayao Miyazaki would come to be known for later on (i.e. flying scenes, environmental messages, and strong female protagonists). However, it is made overrated by an external factor, the first of Miyazaki's two masterpieces, Princess Mononoke.<br/><br/>Every flaw in Nausicaa is addressed and improved upon in Princess Mononoke. Simplistic main character? Improved upon with Ashitaka, a character who, unlike Nausicaa, is not morally perfect but has flaws which he must deal with and address in order to lift his curse. Underdeveloped villains? Improved upon with Lady Eboshi and to a lesser extent Jigo, villains who may do despicable things but are sympathetic and complex, particularly Lady Eboshi who provides for and protects the people of Iron Town, including lepers and former prostitutes. Bad voice acting (Disney dub only, I do not speak Japanese and as such am not qualified to judge the original cast who I'm sure do a fine job)? Improved upon with an adapted screenplay by Neil Gaiman and a cast including fine actors such as Billy Crudup, Minnie Driver, Keith David, and John DiMaggio, all of whom provide better voices than even the best voice actor from Nausicaa, Patrick Stewart, and certainly much, MUCH better than the worst, Shia LaBeouf.<br/><br/>Now, none of this is to say that Nausicaa is a bad film, far from it. It is a very strong work that is well worth watching if just for the animation which is spectacular even by today's standards. The opening credits and the scene with the Giant Warrior in particular are quite stunning and the stylized vision scenes are also visually impressive. The faults in Nausicaa lie in the characters and story, both of which can be attributed to a relatively new director still feeling his way through the art of storytelling and character development. Honestly, I think the biggest reason Princess Mononoke is better is just that Miyazaki had greatly matured as a filmmaker and storyteller by the time he made Princess Mononoke. Had Mononoke been one of his first films and Nausicaa one of his later works, it is quite possible that I would be telling you that Mononoke is inferior to Nausicaa. But he didn't and it isn't. The basic story and morals are the same but they're simply handled much better in Princess Mononoke, making the issues more complex without a simple black and white answer, unlike Nausicaa whose message can be summed up with ""People bad! Environment good!""<br/><br/>In the end though, I can't say that I don't recommend Nausicaa for any fan of animation. It was a landmark film and as I said earlier, the animation alone makes it worth seeing. Aside from that it has some memorable if not terribly well developed characters and the voice acting is, on the whole, good but not great. The main standout is Patrick Stewart who is simply awesome as Lord Yupa. He's always calm and collected, but it can seem both comforting or menacing depending on the situation which fits the character perfectly, especially as you can't make out many of his facial expressions due to the huge mustache he sports. On the flip side, Shia LaBeouf is simply awful as Prince Asbel. The voice just doesn't seem to match the character and the emotions often seem forced. I don't really think it's so much that Shia is really that bad, mostly just that the casting decision was poor and that he doesn't really know how to work as a voice actor because he has shown that he is a capable (though by no means great) actor in the past. I just chalk it up to Disney trying to shoehorn in a celebrity and making a poor choice.<br/><br/>Overall, Nausicaa is roughly to Miyazaki what A Bug's Life is to Pixar. They're both films that are good in their own right but just don't compare to the other works by the same director/studio. No one would say that A Bug's Life is better than Toy Story (1, 2, or 3), Up, Finding Nemo, or the Incredibles (just to name a few) and in the same way no one should really be saying that Nausicaa is better than Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, or Kiki's Delivery Service (again, just to name a few). Is it good? Absolutely. Is it great? In some respects. If nothing else, Nausicaa should be remembered as a landmark achievement in animation and a solid first effort by an eventual legend, Hayao Miyazaki."

If she's such a badass princess (scientist, warrior, pilot, etc.) why on earth can she not remember to put on underwear?? I didn't particularly enjoy all the crotch shots of a young girl.<br/><br/>This perverse sexualization of young girls is why I'm not as huge a fan of anime as I would like to be!

","I've only seen a limited amount of Japanese animation. I had heard that Hayao Miyazaki's ""Kaze no tani no Naushika"" (""Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind"" in English) is one of the best, so I finally got around to seeing it. I understand that there was a recut version that changed the story entirely, but fortunately I saw the complete version. What an experience. The obvious point is that it addresses topics such as the environment and war. But probably the most important thing, even beyond the impressive animation, is what the characters realize at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Despite the fantasy qualities, this is not a cartoon for the tykes. There are some intense scenes here. The movie's overall point is that power comes not through force, but through mutual understanding. There's a reason why this movie is in IMDb's top 250. Everyone should see it."

"filmfan1991","Null","0","1","15 January 2019"," Miyazaki's first epic masterpiece
","""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"" is often considered to be the first Studio Ghibli film. Technically ""Castle in the Sky"" released two years later was the first Ghibli film. But ""Nausicaa"" might has well have been the first Ghibli film, because it contains all the traits that both Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki are most well known for and had this film not been a success with audiences and critics, then Studio Ghibli never would have existed.<br/><br/>""Nausicaa"" was Miyazaki's 2nd film as a director and it was at this point that he had fully developed his craft and his traits as a filmmaker. The film is beautiful to look at filled with imaginative and creative ideas of a dystopian future and the people that exist within it. Environmentalism and anti-war themes feature heavily into the plot and it balances out nicely, never feeling too preachy unlike some Hollywood films and actually enhancing the plot. Even after more than 30 years since it's original release, the film holds up very nicely with its intriguing plot and likeable characters. Nausicaa herself makes for a strong leading female character, something that Miyazaki did quite often in his films. She has a very likeable personality and is a pacifist at heart but only turns to violence when pushed too far. There are some nice side characters too, my favorite probably being Lord Yuppa, an old badass swordsman who ocassionaly helps Nausicaa. Yuppa is voiced by the ever fantastic Patrick Stewart in the English dub of the film and his performance is probably the best and most memorable in the film. The rest of the dub is great too and of high quality compared with the bad ""Warriors of the Wind"" release back in the 80s.<br/><br/>The villains in the film are not one dimensional unlike some older Disney films and have understandable motives even if you don't agree with them.<br/><br/>""Nausicaa"" was the first collaboration between Hayao Miyazaki and composer Joe Hisaishi who would continue to work with Miyazaki for decades. The music goes incredibly well with the visuals and contains one of the better openings to a film I have ever seen, animated or otherwise.<br/><br/>""Nausicaa"" is an absolute epic masterpiece by the great Miyazaki. The film just draws you into its intriguing dystopian world with its beautiful visuals and epic story that only Miyazaki could create."

","I know there's a huge fan base for anime movies like this, and especially for works by director Hayao Miyazaki, but I just couldn't engage with this film after about a half hour. I've watched other films from Miyazaki and quite honestly, though they're all beautifully rendered, they often seem disjointed continuity wise, and in some cases, quite difficult to follow. 'Nausica' by contrast was easy enough to follow, but after a while I just didn't care. One thing that bothered me about the story was the idea that civilization was destroyed a thousand years ago, but it seemed like the toxic jungle taking over the world was a relatively recent phenomenon. A thousand years seemed like a pretty long time for humanity to make a comeback or be wiped out completely, so the idea that there were warring tribes threatening the Valley of the Wind seemed like a disconnect to me. Interestingly, the very last animated film I saw was ""How to Train Your Dragon"", and it struck me how similar the basic plot of both movies seemed to be, In each one, opposing forces, human and animal, come to a realization that they were better off living with each other in harmony because they could help each other, rather than waste their energy and lives fighting at war. This film took a long time coming to that conclusion."
"Mr-Fusion","8","0","1","16 April 2017"," A soaring effort
","""Nausicaä of the Valley"" of the Wind is a movie that just seems to get everything right: how to take its audience to a fully-realized fantasy world (steampunk-tinged yet bursting with opulent color); how to tell a story with an emphatic but not smothering environmental message; and anchor it with a strong female character. I was just as enthralled with the animation as I was with the music.<br/><br/>There's an amazingly empathic heart beating inside Nausicaä and it feels like a deeply personal effort. Studio Ghibli's reputation for quality and imagination is firmly established, and this is no disappointment in that respect.<br/><br/>Absolutely worth seeing.<br/><br/>8/10"

A young warrior/pacifist/princess Nausicaa, loves to explore this toxic jungle. Then, one night, a ship crashes by the kingdom, and a giant warrior embryo is onboard. Another kingdom then takes over the valley, and Nausicaa is taken hostage. In a turn of events, Nausicaa finds a secret under the jungle, and must stop the Tolmekians from destroying it.

","I worked for the producer who imported many Japanese anime, and I'm not sure, but this may have been one of them. The Americanized version is shorter, has the usual poor dubbing, and truncates a lot of the nuances of the story's meanings that otherwise come through with the additional footage of the original film.<br/><br/>I purchased a special edition DVD when it first came out. Wow. A massive box with lots of extras, and all for a movie. I didn't mind. I also purchased the Disney publication of the same film, and watch that disk as opposed to the disk that came with a scale model of one of the critters of the film, a pouch duplicating the princesses, and a few other do-dads that I can't recall right now. It wasn't cheap, but at the time I had the money.<br/><br/>But, to the movie. It's excellent. Good stuff which shows Miyazaki's outlook on the natural order of things, and how there's no real evil in the world, just hurt souls waiting to be healed and rediscovered, or parties operating at odds with one another. That's his point of view, or POV as we say in the film bizz.<br/><br/>The animation, like all Japanese animation, is somewhat stilted at times, and some of the perspective shots are a little exaggerated or stiff, but the story and overall film making remain strong. This is an early epic sci-fi anime film that shows a female heroine overcoming challenges with charm, wit and strength, forming a holy trinity of a dynamic soul that has the hearts and minds of all involved in a warmonger's quest to resurrect an awful truth from the past.<br/><br/>As with all things Japanese there're subtle themes being played here.

Fear not, I shall be returning to films from this studio sometime in the New Year so stay posted. This is an interesting one; I found the concept most intriguing but the execution (I'm sad to say) left a little to be desired (IMO). Technically and imaginatively, it's up there with the best of them, I just found it didn't quite have the punch I was expecting. More of my thoughts after this very brief summary.<br/><br/>A thousand years after the world was laid waste small kingdoms exist on the margins of a polluted planet. One of these is The Valley of the Wind where a princess, Nausicaä, flies over the toxic forests in her glider. Giant insects inhabit the forest and she is respectful of them. She finds she is called upon when her valley is invaded by those who would unleash the monsters that had initially destroyed the world. Can she calm the beasts in the Toxic Forest before they destroy what is left of humanity? As you can probably guess, the Spoiler Police would not be pleased if I told you here In fact, I fear they would send me back to the Toxic Forest (again).<br/><br/>Beautifully animated throughout and with great imagination, I can't fault the way this film looks or the imagination of Hayao Miyazaki. To come up with a world like this must have taken a great deal of time and effort. I saw the Japanese version (with subtitles) although I have heard of a dubbed (and severely 'kiddiefied') version – beware this one.<br/><br/>I guess the problem I had with this film was that, although it's brilliantly conceived and made, it failed to have any emotional impact on me and it lacked the punch I have come to expect from Miyazaki's work. I guess the characters didn't have enough depth for me to really care about them enough. Add to that the fact that I found it way too long and I guess it's failing on two counts!

","Today, I took the kids out to see ""Kaze no tani no Naushika"" or ""Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind"" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087544/), an animated movie from Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki. Miyazaki created a series of extremely popular animated films in Japan which have slowly made the trip to art theaters in the U.S. His films all feature themes of environmentalism and post Armageddon human survival which flow directly out of his experience in post-Hiroshima Japan. The films also feature a plucky young heroine who faces trails but manages to ultimately save the day due to her connection and love of nature. My personal theory is that the heroine represents Japan itself which Miyazaki believes must find a way to live in harmony with nature or perish.<br/><br/>The themes in ?Nausicaa? are classic Miyazaki, our Princess protagonist is both warrior and pacifist. She is also an environmentalist so fervent that she actually hugs a tree during a scene when discovers that nature is slowly ridding itself of pollution by filtering them through petrified trees which underlie a poisonous jungle. Her kingdom (the Valley of the Wind from the English title) is caught in the cross-fire of two tribes. It is further menaced by ?Ohms? or armored, articulated cockroach-like roughly the size of Greyhound bus. The other insects in her world are also super-sized, products of a 7-day incineration of the earth inflicted by giants created by man as weapons of war. One of the warring tribes, the Tolmekian, is trying to resurrect on of the giants to use against Ohms, the residents of the Valley of the Wind and whoever else gets in her way.<br/><br/>Can Princess Nausicaa save her beloved valley by pacifying the Oms and by bringing peace between the warring kingdoms? Can she raise the conscientious of her people and of the warring tribes to the fact that that humankind can only survive by living in harmony with nature? Does Miyazaki recycle aluminum cans? Of course, it is ultimately a children?s movie and one with a message of being green that long preceded its adoption in the U.S."

","A thoroughly typical Studio Ghibli movie, which means that it's charmingly and expertly animated, and has an environmentally friendly message. <br/><br/>I can't place Nausicaä among my favorite Ghibli films like Spirited Away and The Cat Returns, though. Other than Nausicaä herself, the characters aren't very memorable. The story is simple and straightforward, almost to the point of being bland, and the pro-nature message is very heavy-handed, even though it's appreciated. The first half of the movie is also better than the latter half, in my opinion. <br/><br/>Still, this is a movie I like to revisit from time to time, even though it lacks some of the imagination and immersion of superior Ghibli films. It's beautifully animated, though in a way that's more utilitarian than awe-inducing. Keep in mind, that even a merely ""decent"" Ghibli film is still more than worth checking out."

","Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is a Miyazaki's animation feature based on his eponymous Manga. It is set in a post-apocalyptic future in which the land is divided in three remaining hostile kingdoms: the people leaving in the Valley of the Winds, the Pejites, and the Tolmekians. Nausicaa is the princess of the Valley, a especial young lady in tune with Nature, who respects and loves her people. The human kingdoms are always threaten by the Sea of Decay, an exuberant toxic jungle inhabited by giant prehistoric-like insects who react to human hostility with destruction, spreading the toxicity of the Sea to those who dare to provoke them.<br/><br/>Nausicaa's plot is action-packet, original, with weird creatures, lovable characters and a great lyric soundtrack. We find Miyazaki's usual animation landmarks: 1/ European landscapes and undefined time appearance (in this case Swiss-like, with a revamped medieval atmosphere). 2/ Prehistoric-like creatures (in this case insects). 3/ A female heroine who fights like any man, but always has great femininity (Nausicaa always wears her red earrings). 4/ A heavy presence of catalytic women, presented most of the time as strong, wise, common-sensed and supportive characters (only the nasty princess of the Tolmekians contradicts this). 5/ A cute animal pet that is the hero's soul-mate and inseparable companion. 6/ A clear environmental and pacifist message and 7/ a wonderful detailed animation with subdued hues.<br/><br/>The drawing is very inventive and with a great attention to the detail, especially brilliant regarding the depiction of the Sea of Decay and the underground land below it, which are utterly beautiful. The Sea of Decay reminded me very much in style and spirit of the backgrounds and Bosh-like vegetation and fauna of Planet Fantastic, but more elaborated, exuberant and compact in Nausicaa.<br/><br/>Unlike many modern animation movies, Miyazaki's movies always have a perfect equilibrium between the artistry of the drawing/animation, on one hand, and the quality of the story, on the other. That is why a movie like this, made in the 1980s, is still as enchanting, fresh and though-provoking as it was in the past. The message of the film is that even the ugliest creature and plant has a purpose on earth, a purpose per se and as a part of the whole to which it is connected. The movie tells you that if you respect people and Nature, you get respect back, and that it is easier to live with yourself and the others if one understands and respect the environment. This is not my favorite Miyazaki movie, perhaps because it is too feisty for my taste, and because I thought the confrontation between the three kingdoms needed of more explanation than the the one provided in the film.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful entertaining full-action movie, with a great environmental pacifist message, and Miyazaki's always beautiful drawing and magic universe. Please watch it in Japanese with English subtitles, as the American dubbing is too childish and far from the original interpretations."

","Nausicaa is an amazing film, I have to admit I had my expectations on it, as I usually do with this director. The movie is about a princess that has to save the dying planet she lives in, and all the creatures in it, from her people, who are trying to destroy them. The animation is amazing and the plot too, apart from the fact that it can be perfectly adjusted to the world we live in today. It is an amazing movie to watch , and it really moved me as well, it can really make you aware of how fragile our own world is.Nausicaa is very similar to Princess Mononoke, as it has the same type of environmental message in it. If you love Miyazaki's films, it's definitely a must watch."
"ambz","9","0","1","8 January 2010"," yet another stunning mood-upper from miyazaki
","Atmosphere is crucial to the success of any fantasy story, and Nausicaa's atmosphere is simply outstanding. It's what hooked me, right from the opening scenes. Set in a post-apocalyptic world, somewhat like the classic PC game, ""Fallout"" (though nuclear Armageddon is my inference), the story revolves around the struggle of the teen aged Princess Nausicaa (yet another princess protagonist from Miyazaki!) to prevent two warring nations from destroying themselves and her idyllic village caught in the crossfire. This description is already reminiscent of Frank Herbert's ""Dune"", isn't it? The influence of Dune on this movie is undeniably huge. There are obvious tributes to the Dune mythos like the Sandworm<->Ohmu connection. The major difference from Dune is that this world isn't a scorched desert, it's the exact opposite. There is too much water here - rot and rust are everywhere. Humans are totally dominated by the new masters of the planet: fungi, toxic plants and giant mutant bugs. This ""Sea of Decay"" is constantly threatening to encroach on the last few human settlements whose inhabitants (that are strongly reminiscent of the Fremen), are adapting to survive amidst a very hostile, yet also beautiful ecosystem (again like Dune). Some elements of the movie seem to have been ripped off even by 'The Matrix' (particularly the end of 'Matrix: Revolutions') - you'll know them when you see them.<br/><br/>Characters are strong and memorable. The plot is great. Visuals are not spectacular by today's standards, but were still way ahead of the pack for a movie made in 1984. The excellent graphics helped me sink into the sense of dystopia and despair arising from the downfall of human civilization. The chaos, war and destruction are very realistic. But of course, a Miyazaki movie can't be a total downer, and indeed there's a strong feel-good ending. Ultimately, hope reigns supreme.<br/><br/>I think this movie is even better than Miyazaki's ""Princess Mononoke"" - and it's hard to give higher praise to a fantasy/scifi movie. I'm amazed that he could create this kind of masterpiece so early into his career. Imo, it's much better than his recent ""Spirited Away"" (Oscar winner for Best Animated Feature - 2001) and ""Howl's Moving Castle"" (though both of these are great movies in their own right).<br/><br/>Highly recommended to all, especially to fantasy/science fiction fans.<br/><br/>An easy 9/10."

","Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is a very intriguing film, very different than many of the other works from famed filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki. Nausicaa undoubtedly has a genuine heart, but it is a film that is far more epic in scope than any other film from Miyazaki, even more so than Princess Mononoke. It also treads the line between fantasy and science fiction so finely that you truly have no idea what you're watching, but you can't help but be captivated by the story in which Miyazaki tells with so much conviction.<br/><br/>Nausicaa tells the story of an unnamed world in which the world was ravaged by wars 1,000 years prior. Since then the world has been engulfed by this poisonous jungle that continues to spread and kill all human life. One of the few unpolluted areas left within the world is the Valley of the Wind where the title character, Princess Nausicaa lives. Nausicaa is a beautiful young woman filled with determination to keep her people alive, sending her on an epic journey to fight gigantic insects and discover the secret to the pollution and how to regenerate the world.<br/><br/>Nausicaa is a film that is mythical in its style. While it still has many moments that make you know you're watching a Miyazaki film, it is as a whole very different than the rest of his works. It is far more serious in tone with very few moments of levity. I think the best way to sum this film up is to say that it is probably Miyazaki's most adult film he has ever made. The way everything is depicted within this film feels very realistic, even though the story clearly takes place in another world, Miyazaki does not overplay these characters and evokes very humanlike emotion from their cores.<br/><br/>Nausicaa is another showcase of Miyazaki's trademark themes. His pacifist views come through in the story as well does his all encompassing environmental message. As well just like all other Miyazaki films the animation is gorgeous and highly imaginative. The last ten minutes of the film are so awe-inspiring that it cannot be described in words, it is quite possibly the most beautifully animated ten minutes of any film I've ever seen. Of course the film also features a beautiful musical score, thanks to Miyazaki's longtime collaborator Joe Hisaishi. Hisaishi's music along with Miyazaki's animation just wraps the viewer inside this world and refuses to let go. On a final note the voicework for the English dub was very well done, in particular the work by Patrick Stewart and Alison Lohman as the title character of Nausicaa.<br/><br/>Nausicaa is a highly imaginative experience, filled to the brim with awe-inspiring spectacle and heart. Miyazaki's epic tale about courage and determination is what I believe to be a timeless classic.<br/><br/>I give Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind a perfect 10 out of 10!"

","I remember seeing this film on the 2005 Disney DVD and remember disliking it, probably because of the violence that I couldn't handle. But now I came to realize that the film had a great story, it is set a thousand years after most of the world was destroyed and only a few human settlements try to survive despite many wars happening. It is up to Nausicaa to make peace with her kingdom: the Valley of the Wind and the Tolmekians.<br/><br/>This is definitely one Miyazaki's best films ever made. I like the fictional aircraft that he came up with and the concept of toxic jungles resulting from the pollution in the soil. I'm just like Miyazaki, I am too, obsessed with airplanes. Joe Hisaishi has done a good job scoring the film, he delivered action, and emotion.<br/><br/>There's a particular scene in the film where Nausicaa tries to tame a baby ohmu, that always makes me have tears after that scene. The English dub I have to say: ""very well done."" I like Allison Lohman as Nausicaa, she sounds just like her, and I like Patrick Stewart as Lord Yupa.<br/><br/>If you're reading this, get the movie! You'll love the story and the characters"

","Who says animation cant be serious? One of the older entries, Nausicaa develops a wonderful insect and human world in a mix of medieval and early industrial societies along with the strange and wonderful jungles and creatures that inhabit it. Yes, don't let the fact that it was originally made in '84 deter you, this is a fantastic story of wonder and splendor. Especially interesting were the observations and descriptions of the jungle and how the pollution has perverted the plants and yet still manages to cleanse. Indeed, I found all the jungle particularly captivating and vibrant. Characters were fine if not standard. Some of the overlapping themes for subsequent movies was laid down here particularly cautions of pollution and war. Flying scenes were also spectacular, and who can forget the Ohmu - sort of the fantastic representation for nature. Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind deserves it's place amongst all other Miyazaki films as a superior fable. I've always liked Tottoro best , but this one strikes a bit more serious note and is well worth seeing - recommended."

","""Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind"" (Kaze no tani no Naushika, 1984) is often credited as Studio Ghibli's first major film, though technically Ghibli didn't exist at the time film was made, but was founded with the money the film made. However, since the people behind ""Nausicaä"" became the leading forces of Ghibli (Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata and Toshio Suzuki plus the films music is composed by Joe Hisaishi) it is often marked as Ghibli's first film.<br/><br/>The story is set thousand years into the future, where majority of the world has been destroyed in wars and the planet is covered by constantly spreading jungle, that is poisonous to humans but not to gigantic insects living in them. The jungle and insects may seem like the primary concern for the last living human cities, but truthfully the danger is brought by humans themselves, who still haven't learn from past mistakes. A small Valley of the Wind is caught between a war of two bigger nations that are set to destroy the jungle and insects. The Princess of the Valley, Nausicaä, however knows that destroying the jungle would only bring more suffering and determines to stop the war before it is too late.<br/><br/>After 24 years of its release, Hayao Miyazaki's second film (first is ""Lupin III: Castle of Cagliostro"" from 1979) has survived to this day remarkably well. The traditional animation is far more pleasant to eyes than the nowadays computer-animated-CGI-3D-whatever films that Disney and Pixar give us. ""Nausicaä"" combines all the great elements Miyazaki would use in his later film: interesting characters, multi-layered plot, Joe Hisaishi's beautiful music and of course the great animation. One of the important animators in the film was Hideaki Anno, who later directed anime series ""Nadia: the Secret of Blue Water"" and ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"". The plot of the film deals with wars, protecting the nature and flying, all things that usually repeat themselves in Miyazaki's works.<br/><br/>In voice acting department, Sumi Shimamoto (who had voiced Lady Clarisse in Miyazaki's ""Castle of Cagliostro"") could not be more perfect to voice Nausicaä. Her voice truly becomes part of the animated character we see, and Alison Lohman really doesn't stand a chance against her in English dup. Neither can Uma Thurman beat the original Yoshiko Sakakibara (who usually voices tough women like Shinobu Nagumo in ""Patlabor"" and Integra Hellsing in ""Hellsing"") in the role of Kushana, who commands one of the nations in the film. Patrick Stewart on the other hand does come close to the level of original Goro Naya in the role of Yupa. Still I'd recommend the original Japanese audio more.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind"" is a film that will keep both adults and children interested and is definitely worth of watching. The film may be just a little bit longer than it should, but with a great story, music and animation it doesn't bother so much. Disney and Pixar should remind themselves that this is how great animation is made."

Many of the remaining people seem to be at war however there is peace in the Valley of the Wind where a young princess named Nausicaä lives. When we are introduced to her she is exploring the toxic jungle collecting plant samples and looking for shells of giant insects that can be used by the villages. The peace of her village is shattered when a plane crashes, on board is a ""giant warrior"", a weapon from the original war a thousand years ago, soon the village is over run by soldiers wanting this weapon back so they can get it working again and use it to destroy the Toxic Jungle.<br/><br/>As with almost all of Miyazaki's films there are plenty of spectacular flying sequences including aerial battles and Nausicaä flying on her glider. There is a clear environmental message in the film but it doesn't feel over stated to me as it is justified by the plot.<br/><br/>This comment was based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles."

","If you enjoyed ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Akira"", Nausicaa of The Valley Of The Winds, is a welcome addition to the great lineage of epic action anime.<br/><br/>This early Miyazaki film, based on his own manga of the same name, based in turn on a Japanese myth of a Princess who speaks to insects, is a sc-fi adventure story set hundreds of years in the future where the world has become a gigantic and dense overgrown jungle surrounded by toxic wastelands. Worm like creatures hundreds of feet long and high live amongst humans like natural disasters as well as smaller similarly mutated creatures throughout the gargantuan jungles.<br/><br/>Like the best of Miyazki's anime this film is aimed at all audiences, though the violence at times seem more suited for adult films. Movies must either have new images, or die out, and in the world of animation, regardless of CGI, the only animated film maker I can think of producing really new images today is Hayao Miyazaki, until this film for instance, I had never imagined riding a a metallic glider through a mountainous jungle hunting a giant worm, and now I will never forget.<br/><br/>In honesty Nausica is'nt quite as good ""Akira"" and ""Princess Mononoke"", but it's up there with ""Howls Moving Castle"", ""Spritied Away"", and ""Ghost In The Shell"", which are pretty much the best anime (and probably the only few worth seeing...let me know if I'm off base here) there are anyway."
"jon-1318","9","0","2","19 December 2006"," The Ending...
","I'd just like to comment that I absolutely disagree with blackhawk.sc when it comes to the ending. I felt it was the best part of the entire film...<br/><br/>*Big Spoiler Follows*<br/><br/>While the film most definitely has an environmentalist message, no doubt informed from an Eastern perspective, I found the Christological elements in the film very intriguing. In the beginning of the film an old woman explains that a man dressed in blue will arise and walk across golden fields leading everyone into an era of peace and harmony. In the end of the film, this prophecy is fulfilled in Nausicaa.<br/><br/>If we analyze the particulars of the events, we note that... 1. She dies a sacrificial death in behalf of mankind at the hands of the wrathful Ohmu: ""My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"" 2. Her death satisfies the wrath of the Ohmu and they thus stop their rampage: This greatly reminds me of Christ's sacrificial death appeasing the wrath of the Father; the Son becomes the one mediator between God and Man (just as Nausicaa is able to commune with both humans and insects) 3. She is essentially resurrected by the Ohmu amidst a glow of yellow light, and fulfills the prophecy visually with her walk amongst their tentacles: Like all the Messianic prophecies on the Christ's birth, life, and death, so too was His resurrection. He then stands in the high places upon His Ascension (the visual of her literally being raised up when Nausicaa is healed was just chilling to me).<br/><br/>Am I the only one to see all of that? The story seemed to draw a bit on Dune as well, of course, and that might explain the Messianic subtext, but Herbert's treatment of the subject was much more cynical. In Nausicaa, the theme seems to be explored much more positively.<br/><br/>The ending was very interesting to me, and the rich symbolism brings a tear to my eye every time. Perhaps some might think it was too cliché' or something, but it seemed subtle enough to work for me. Then again, I know some people are just pushed off by anything remotely reminiscent of Christ altogether...<br/><br/>Anyhow, the only thing I might possibly be able to fault the film on is pacing perhaps. However, that's kinda hard to say considering that it's intentionally contemplative and reflective. The few people I've shown this film to seem to get a little bored with it, and I think that's largely due to more modern/popular approaches to film-making that appeal to lower attention spans. As with a number of Miyazaki works, you have to be a little patient with this film, perhaps more so than most of his classics."
"sol-","Null","0","4","25 October 2005"," My brief review of the film
","An early Miyazaki film, this is actually one rather different to most of his later works, which tend to feature simple characters and rather simplistic story lines. However the simplicity is part of the charm of his later works, though that is not to say that complexity is bad per se. In this case, it could however be. I cannot speak for the Japanese version, but the English dub of the film makes it seem verbose in nature with an overly complicated plot. Some of the dialogue is just terrible, especially the narration by the protagonist that simply feels unnatural. Then again, this may only be in the Disney version. The animation is great, and the memory sequences are particularly well done. There is a distinct atmosphere of the post-apocalyptic, and this causes it to be intriguing. The editing is however awkward at times, the violence is somewhat overplayed, and the main characters are not built up as well as in some of Miyazaki's future films. This is a certainly a film worth giving a go, with some wonderful music as usual and a few fascinating ideas. It is not the best place to start with films by its director though. For that, I would recommend 'Laputa' or 'Spirited Away'."

She enjoyed the first half, where she's learning about the warrior princess who will defend her valley no matter what. The last third of the movie contains the violence. Maybe I'm just protective but I think there is enough violence in most teen and adult movies, and I would rather not expose my child to it while she's young. In the last part of this film, the princess is attacked and shot with a machine gun. She is bleeding from wounds in her shoulder and foot and moaning in pain on the ground. Shortly after this, she is accidentally pushed into an acid lake, where she screams in agony as her foot is burned by chemicals. I thought that entire scene was well done, realistic, and graphic, but it is NOT for the eyes of a young child."

The main plot and the message behind are the same, but I couldn't identify myself with the characters as profoundly as in the manga.<br/><br/>For example Nausicaä: The fact that she likes the insects as deeply as she likes mankind is not enough clear.<br/><br/>Or princess Kushana: In the anime I didn't feel anything for her. She might as well have died. It's because she had only one aim: To fight the wastelands at any costs.

So brutal and dark you may think Miyazaki has a split personality. Personally, I am not that big fan of him. I think he will never be as brilliant as another anime director, Hideaki Anno. Also, his Oscar winning fantasy anime ""Spirited away"" left me somewhat cold ( 6/10 ). Non the less, he deserved Oscars at few occasions: for ""Laputa"", ""Kiki's delivery service"" or ""Nausicaa"".<br/><br/>----------------<br/><br/>""Nausicaa"" has a weird story: in the future the Earth is devastated. It's soil is polluted and giant insects rule it's surface. Nausicaa lives in one town in a oasis, outside the desert. But one day an evil princess, Kushana, occupies her town with her army in order to steal a organic titan, a weapon of mass destruction, and use it herself...against the insects. But Nausicaa wants the insects and the acid forest to live...<br/><br/>In the first half fascinating, in the second somewhat schematic and stiff, ""Nausicaa"" is still non the less interesting. Those giant insects fascinated me. In one scene Nausicaa is trying to stop a baby Ohm ( also an giant insect that looks like a fat, brown caterpillar with 8 blue eyes )from drinking from the acid lake. Also a very intense moment: when she just stands in front of a mob of angry Ohm's that runs towards her and kicks her, catapulting her body in the air. ""Nausicaa"" isn't flawless. It lacks humor and good old fun, but it somehow grows on you and is full of monumental pictures, mostly the ones about giant insects traveling by land, while the details, from the costume's up to the airplane's, are very unique. And it raises important questions: Who are we? And what are we doing with our future?<br/><br/>Grade: 8/10"

","Opposing many current animations with much computer graphics, this monumental animation film of Miyazaki shows us the infinite possibility of Japanese animation as the way of embodying imagination.

People try to burn out the jungle with using 'Kyoshinhei'(a man-made robot that has mass destructive power). People are fighting each other to get this robot that can be a big help of humans or a destructive weapon at the same time. But in fact, the poisonous jungle is purifying the land which humans have polluted and monsters are guarding the jungle from destruction. Therefore, they cannot survive by burning the poisonous jungle. Nausicaa, as a sacrifice, lets us know that what people are doing is completely wrong and they should not destroy Nature any more.<br/><br/>I guess this is a prediction of our future. If we kept polluting the land, the world would be like this. We cannot recover polluted land by eliminating them.

It isn't as good as the original Star Wars movies but it comes incredibly close. Either way it's a fine movie. Highly recommended to anyone who is looking for a good movie (animated or otherwise). Thank God the ""mangled version"" is out of print. Grade: A<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for violent/intense sequence. Suggested for ages 12 and up.<br/><br/>
P.S. According to several reliable sources, Disney will NOT re-dub this movie. Also, the Spirited Away press kit says that Disney plans to release the Ghibli movies from the Disney-Tokuma deal on DVD in ""the near future."" Don't hold your breath on that one though. Disney won't hold the rights to Totoro until 2004."

","I was first introduced to Anime by Mononoke Hime and was amazed.  Since then my appreciation has only grown.  This film now even rivals Princess Mononoke as my favorite of Miazaki's.  I strongly recommend it to anyone with a bit of an imagination.  The message is clear and beautiful and the film is set in a magical and wonderful land.  The sound track is wonderful and sets a terrific tone for the movie, which shows us the pointlessness of hate yet again.  Naussica has raised the bar for all other animated films for me and it will for you too."

","I saw this movie the first time for more than ten years ago, only half of it of course and without sound. Yet I was stunned. The visions in the movie were different from anything I had ever seen before that time and I wanted to know more. Over the years I almost forgot I had seen the movie, but the name lingered in my head. Yesterday, I got my hands on it again and what can I say, it surpassed my wildest dreams of that movie in a heartbeat. Great landscapes, great drama, exciting story!<br/><br/>See this movie. I do recommend it."
"leetyre","Null","0","1","24 October 2001"," Not as Hayao intended
","Whilst agreeing with the front page comment on this film, pitched against the comic I must say that this is a very important film in its own right. Being 'butchered' for the western market (not just the Germans!) and being targeted towards children, did not help its cause.<br/><br/>The version currently available is the same as originally released and lord knows who the characters are on the front of the case!! By the way, the dub is terrible.<br/><br/>My advice is to wait for an official release, either by Studio Ghibli or the Disney/Tokuma partnership and see the real thing as the Director intended.<br/><br/>Let us not forget that it was it was the decimation of this film which nearly turned Miyazaki against ever releasing any of his films in the West.<br/><br/>Having said that, there is much to enjoy in the animation of this release but you will have to wait for the original to get the full story."
