","This 2.5 hour long movie was wonderful! As a Korean, this movie was very emotionally moving and touching. Some people (mainly Westerners) think this movie was ""over-dramatic"", but it's actually a part of korean custom, culture and history. If you do not speak or understand Korean, a lot of the ""meaning"" is lost and cannot be portrayed in subtitles. That is a true shame. The story-line between the two brothers was heart-felt and emotional. Korea has remained divided for decades since and is subject to the possibility of a new war at any time. It was considered one of the most destructive and bloodiest wars of the 20th century with over 4 million koreans dead (2/3 of them were civilian). The Korean War will always be remembered as the ""Forgotten War"" since it came on the heels of World War II and was overshadowed by the Vietnam War."

","Let's be real; Saving Private Ryan is a better movie then Tae Guk Gi. This is movie tries too hard to be exactly like Saving Private Ryan- the action, the cinematography, the camera work... But behind all the technicalities comes a very moving and powerful character-driven story that is more riveting then Saving Private Ryan. In comparison to the incredibly gritty ""Saving Private Ryan"", Tae Guk Gi is more of a blockbuster movie that has more stylized action and drama. Still, this is a must watch."

","Nations do not fight wars. Citizens fight them, and these citizens are honorable men and women who serve their country willingly or, as history shows, by decree of a desperate government.<br/><br/>As a result, patriotism has become the unlikeliest casualty. Once welcomed in the trenches of battle, patriotism has lost its limbs, fought back from life support, and suffered shell shock. Once easily recognized, patriotism has become a bit of a chimera, an ideal more easily attached to definable characteristics than it is any single soldier. However, in the bitter end, patriotism is defined by the actions of these individuals who serve; it is rewarded by the nations who sponsor this service; and, more often than not, it is measured in hardships endured.<br/><br/>Such is the complex, ever-changing battleground of writer/director Kang Je-Gyu's 'Taegukgi: The Brotherhood of War.'<br/><br/>In 1950's Seoul, Jin-Seok (Won Bin) and his older brother Jin-Tae (Jang Dong-gun) are enjoying a strong family life of perfect happiness. Suddenly, they find their lives turned upside down as soldiers of the South Korean government seize them  all men aged 18 to 30 are taken  and they are forced to take up arms  despite their lack of training  against the approaching North Koreans. On one brutal battlefield after another, the bonds of family are put to increasingly demanding tests as Jin-Tae  originally driven by his responsibility to protect his younger brother  continues to further exhaust his physical and emotional prowess despite the protests of Jin-Seok. He learns that he is a good soldier, one with a talent for inspiring others as well as an unanticipated thirst for killing the enemy. Eventually, these two brothers  once bound by a love for family  find themselves at odds within this new brotherhood of war, and the pressures to prove one another continue to exact heavier and heavier tolls as the war escalates. As circumstances evolve, the brothers inevitably find themselves on opposite sides of a losing conflict  but can either find a path to redemption or reconciliation that can save both of them?<br/><br/>There are many elements of 'Taegukgi' that elevate the film from the status of standard war film to a message of hope set against the backdrop of war. The film's scope is grand, dealing with the far more intimate themes of family, brotherhood, and personal responsibility when Director Kang Je-Gyu could have easily opted for banging the drum of nationalism. At its core, 'Taegukgi' is the story of two brothers, a strikingly poignant analogy for the entire North Korea / South Korea dilemma. While the battlefield choreography is as frenetic as it is harrowing, it never takes the film's center: this picture is founded on relationships  the human perspective to the world outside  and it never falters. Instead of focusing on history, Kang Je-Gyu crafts every scene to highlight the thoughts, actions, and emotions of the participants of history, and, for that, 'Taegukgi' deserves countless accolades.<br/><br/>Much like exploring the heart of darkness as depicted in American classics as Francis Ford Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now' and Oliver Stone's 'Platoon,' Kang Je-Gyu forces Jin-tae to explore his own budding evil, and this journey is not without its own relative scars. Once a man has crossed over and embraced wartime madness, can he ever truly find a way out? Arguably, if 'Taegukgi' suffers from any setback, it is that perhaps Jin-tae goes too far for an audience to accept his madness: believing his brother to have been killed by North Koreans, Jin-tae turns traitor once he is captured and seeks to wipe out every soldier serving South Korea. While the story offers the motivation for so drastic a change, it's hard to believe that the man who once fought so valiantly against the spread of Communism would suddenly choose to embrace it.<br/><br/>Still, it's a small diversion  but it's necessary to bring the aspect of brotherhood full circle, to have these two unique men face their darkest hour, and to make one final statement on the role that family inevitably plays in every man's life.<br/><br/>Recently, thanks to the worldwide success of 'Taegukgi' and 1999's blockbuster 'Shiri,' Director Kang Je-Gyu has signed an agreement with Hollywood's own powerhouse, CAA, to produce his next film in America. Only time will tell whether or not this agreement will afford some of the 'Korean sensibility' to American films, but certainly having one of South Korea's premier directors breaking into the Hollywood film system is a tremendous advantage for fans of international film.<br/><br/>Only the passage of time will earn 'Taegukgi' its rightful spot alongside the other great films dealing with the consequences of war."
"chris_santner","10","242","304","17 November 2004"," Better than any Hollywood production
","I have watched Taegukgi for the first time just yesterday, so my impressions of the movie are still fresh. I have not known much about the Korean War that took place at the beginning of the 1950's, but that was a history lesson I will not easily forget. Taegukgi is really the best (anti-)war movie I have ever seen. And believe me, I have seen a lot. But no movie ever before has impressed me so much. In most Hollywood productions there is only one perspective, the winners view. Many directors tried to make a movie that shows both sides of the conflict, but all of them failed. Until now: Taegugki is showing the situation mostly from the south korean view too, but it is the first movie which shows also the ""other side"". I was very surprised, that the director showed also the crime that his own government committed to their own people at this time. That movie is the first war movie that is not glorifying war - it's horrifying, terrifying, scary - like in reality."

","That's what this movie is. Pure hell. If you're that person that screamed in agony when Shakespeare IN LOVE beat SAVING PRIVATE RYAN  find this movie and realize just how much better TAE GUK GI: BROTHERHOOD OF WAR is than just about every war film ever made. A story of two brothers during the Korean War. The movie is spectacle larger than any film made this year, but as intimate as a tale of brothers could ever be. I grew up with Sam Fuller, Peckinpah, Spielberg and the war films of Hollywood. This thing it's just amazing. I went to see it on ""Can Day"" here in Austin where you donate 3 cans of food to the homeless and see any movie you want. I saw 4 films that day, this was the 3rd  and it just completely blew me away. I instantly got the Korean Box Set  and have seen it many times since Unfortunately  the day I saw it in the theater was the last day it was showing in Austin. A BRILLIANT FILM. The film will just shake you to the core. The South Koreans are making brutally brilliant films. Amazing. Should be re-released with a major advertising campaign.

"dennisyoon","10","76","95","17 December 2004"," Some Personal Opinions Why This Film is so Beloved...
","Possible Spoilers*** First of all, major praise goes to Jang Dong Gun's riveting performance. He captured the essence of a nation divided, the immorality of war as your own folks become your enemies, and love for your brother regardless of the situation of the world and/or personal vendetta. The transformation he undergoes and the madness of war he evokes and invokes leaves quite an impact garnering notice.<br/><br/>I knew I was in for something as soon as I saw the archaeological dig of a battlefield starting the film as a grandfather's story is slowly drawn out. The flashback sequence between two brothers is heartwarming as you see the elder brother watching over and sacrificing for his younger sibling and the bond that they have. Being an only child, I wish I had a brother like that. Then the war hits and everything turns upside down as the gut wrenching begins.<br/><br/>The haunting thing about this movie is that the enemy is your own people and they speak your own language and share the same ancestors and genetics. What's more you kill your own kin because of circumstance in a situation of kill or be killed. The simmering conflict between the two brothers deserves special attention because it will hit home as the core message of the movie is made by it. The film made me think of what my parents and grandparents lived through.<br/><br/>-About Saving Private Ryan. To me they were worlds apart in situation, meaning and focus but similar in execution and structure. Just as Saving Private Ryan spoke so resounding to its audience, Taegukgi does the same for its own."
"Akzidenz_Grotesk","10","195","257","18 November 2004"," SEE IT: Superior to ""Saving Private Ryan""
","Whereas Saving Private Ryan's plot was a ""situation"" rather than a story--it's fatal flaw in my opinion)-- this harrowing film of the Korean War is a well paced and heart-wrenching tale of two brothers caught up in one of the twentieth century's most vicious conflicts. <br/><br/>The superbly realistic battle scenes are more brutal than any war movie I've ever seen...it makes you realize that combat is one of the most horrifying of all human experiences. In film it is a good thing; It is necessary to communicate and teach the horror of war.<br/><br/>By the way, ""Tae Guk Gi"" is the name of the South Korean flag. I give this movie ten out of ten stars."
"simon_booth","Null","72","92","11 December 2004"," Impressive war film from Korea
","I'm not a big fan of war films, unless the war in question was at least a couple hundred years ago or somewhere in the future, or the stars - but I did enjoy SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, if ""enjoy"" is the best word to use for such an experience. Apparently, director Kang Je-Gyu (SHIRI) enjoyed SPR too, as its influence on his Korean war film TAEGUKGI is impossible to deny. SHIRI was the South Korean film that probably did more than any other to bring the country's cinematic new wave into being, and especially into the field of view of the rest of the world at large. Its main accomplishment was, arguably, demonstrating that Korea could make a film that competed head on with Hollywood product, in terms of slick production values but also perhaps in terms of vacuous scripts Although it is rather shallow compared to other Korean films, though, I think it's safe to say that SHIRI had more depth than Hollywood would have injected into a similar story.<br/><br/>TAEGUKGI is his first film since SHIRI, and he's definitely playing the Hollywood game again - tackling Spielberg head on this time. Like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, TAEGUKGI attempts to humanise war by giving us some specific characters to focus on (in this case, two brothers played by Won Bin and Jang Dong-Kun) - and then uses our personal connection to show us that war is actually a dehumanising experience. The film also spares no effort in showing us the ability of bullets, knives and bombs to turn human beings into squishy piles of gore.<br/><br/>There's a fairly obvious political symbolism in the story of two brothers and the effects the Korean war has on their lives and relationship - I don't know if it would be fair to read the ending as a view about the conditions under which Korean reunification might occur though. The ending of the film won't come as much of a surprise, since it's basically foretold at the start with a scene set in the present day. The exact details might be a little unexpected though.<br/><br/>If you like your modern-ish day war films, and specifically if you liked SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, then there's very little doubt that TaeGukGi will impress. It's big, slick and well put together. Since it's not my favourite genre or topic of interest, I can't say I loved it like a brother, but was sufficiently satisfied with it given what it is."

","It started out like so many other movies, a short clip of the present and then a long flashback. And then it blew me away with its depiction of war and all of its complexities. The changes in the attitudes of the two brothers as the Korean War progresses helps us understand that war is not merely about good and evil. The most well intentioned soldier or commander can go astray. The Korean War turned brother against brother based on little more than time and place, conviction, or happenstance.<br/><br/>Take Guk Gi is the best antiwar movie that I have seen since Johnny Got His Gun.<br/><br/>It reminded me of the beginning of Saving Private Ryan, which I thought captured some of the reality of war while avoiding the pitfalls that Saving Private Ryan fell.<br/><br/>If the DC crowd watched the Battle of Algiers but missed the message, All Americans should see Tae Guk Gi to better understand the horror and tragedy of war."

","In 1950, in South Korea, the shoe-shiner Jin-tae Lee (Dong-Kun Jang) and his eighteen years old student brother Jin-seok Lee (Bin Won) form a poor but happy family with their mother (Yeong-ran Lee), Jin-tae's fiancé Young-shin Kim (Eun-ju Lee) and her young sisters. Jin-tae and his mother are tough workers, who sacrifice themselves to send Jin-seok to the university.

The commander promises Jin-tae that if he gets a medal he would release his brother, and Jin-tae becomes the braver soldier in the company. Along the bloody war between brothers, the relationship of Jin-seok with his older brother deteriorates leading to a dramatic and tragic end.<br/><br/>I have just watched one of the most spectacular movies of war of the cinema industry, if not the best. The stunning and overwhelming ""Taegukgi Hwinalrimyeo"" is impressive and the brilliant direction of Je-gyu Kang and his crew is among the most perfect I have ever seen, with realistic and gore battles and fights. The cinematography is amazing and the camera work in most of the moments seems to be a documentary, so realistic it is. The sad and dramatic story shakes the emotions of the viewer, with another stupid war, and worst, between brothers. Probably this is the best and most visceral anti-war movie ever made. Dong-Kun Jang and Bin Won are amazing and I felt deeply sorrow with the fate of the character performed by the gorgeous Eun-ju Lee. How can this movie be not nominated to the Oscar? My vote is ten.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""A Irmandade da Guerra"" (""The Brotherhood of the War"")"

","When North Korea invades the South, two brothers are forcibly drafted into the army. The older of the two, hoping to win a medal and ticket home for his younger brother, begins going on every suicide mission offered. This, however, puts a strain on his relationship with his brother and those in the platoon. Worse the course of the war has several nasty turns waiting for them...<br/><br/>I'm of two minds about this film. Despite the fact this is a graphic example of both the physical and psychic effects of war, the narrative is more than a bit disjointed. The film is loosely connected snapshots of the course of the war, beginning right before the invasion, then several weeks later before jumping about a month at a time to certain key events. I'm sure that had I better grasp of the history of the war I would have understood the events better. I felt lost and wished there had been more explanation. The lack of a narrative that follows all the way from start to finish hurts the film since we're moved a bit too much from place to place and situation to situation<br/><br/>But the course of the war is not the purpose of the film, rather its the relationship between two brothers. How war changes them and everything in and around them except the love they have for each other. Its a bit hokey but its dead on, just ask anyone who's ever loved their sibling unquestioningly. You understand how one brother would spend 50 years trying to find the other.<br/><br/>And then there are the battle scenes which are wonderful and frightening and seem to be the total chaos that war really is. People die horribly and the experience is far from fun.<br/><br/>Is the movie worth seeing?<br/><br/>Yes. Its not perfect but its a kick in the pants.<br/><br/>8 out of 10."

","First off, I would like to state that war films are probably my favorite genre of film. I have seen all the greats, from Paths of Glory to Platoon to Apocalypse Now and many in between. However, this movie takes the spot as number 1. Never before have I been so moved by a film in my entire life. It was the only film along with Ikriu (1952) that brought me to tears. To call this a film is a travesty, it is more of an epic journey of two brothers drafted and the tolls that war have on them. This movie makes you feel like your on the battlefield with these soldiers. It's harsh realism only heightens the emotion. It is undoubtedly a masterpiece. Without giving too much away I truly can't see somebody not being affected by this movie. Just remember to keep the tissues close by for this one."
"joonbug_214","10","16","19","17 February 2004"," A Korean Masterpiece
","The best war movie ever, period. All the Saving Private Ryans of this world pale in comparison to Taegukgi. Don't be deceived by the fact that this movie took only $13 million to make (expensive by Korean standards but pocket change in the world of Hollywood), I dare say the visual/sound effects in the movie surpasses any multi-million dollar Hollywood blockbuster. If you thought the Omaha Beach sequence in Saving Private Ryan was amazing, prepare to be blown away, this movie is about to rewrite history books. Outside of Hollywood, Korea is the ONLY country that is capable of making movies that are this good-looking and well polished. The scale and ambition of this film is massive, and even with all the risks involved in making films such as this, the director nails it on the head everytime. The amazing war sequences aside, the dramatic elements shine out as well, supported by an amazing cast of talented actors. It's a very tragic and moving story, more than few tears will shed where I watched the movie, and you will all cry too, when you're not staring in awe at the action sequences that is ^^ Anyways, a breakthrough film, the best movie of 2004 overall so far. I am shocked and surprised as to how much Korean filmmaking has progressed in a few short years, if this trend continues, within 10 years time, even Hollywood would be cowering in fear and begging for mercy. Korean movies ARE the future, this film is a testimony to that. See it for yourself, and believe it."

I am not Korean, so I cannot say the general feeling that Korean people had when they watched this movie, or if everything was exactly how it happened, but in my personal opinion as an outsider, this movie is very good and well recreated, showing what I imagined when I read about the Korean war. (It cannot be a bad movie, if it became one of the biggest successes in Korean film history, eh?) I can only imagine how painful it was for brothers, sisters,mothers and fathers to be separated during and after the War, and watching movies like this one, makes you think about how pointless and horrible a war really is."
"ruby_fff","8","18","22","10 October 2004"," A powerful epic from South Korea. It's a tear-jerker for me, through and through, from the very start.
","The nostalgic sepia-toned segment of Seoul 1950, depicting pre-draft happy moments the two brothers shared with friends and family, is touching and heartwarming. But director does not linger there - in fact, the pace of the storyline of ""Taegukgi"" (South Korean name for their national flag) is more than tight, it's one event after another, never stops. We see the characters, main and supporting cast, managing the situations as they come. Korean filmmaker, Kang Je-gyu (of ""Shiri"") provided a powerful epic film experience. The war scenes of soldiers at camp, in combat, on the move, literally covered a lot of grounds, physically and historically timeline-wise. <br/><br/>Yes, it's quite melodramatic. Very much like a Korean opera. An emotional wringer we go through watching the changing situations between big brother Jin-tae and younger brother Jin-seok, the sad tragic scene of Young-shin, Jin-tae's fiancée caught between the political muddle of Koreans killing Koreans over suspecting communists involvement (she did nothing wrong other than getting food for family members' survival). Big brother was too sad and furious to continue gloriously fighting for 'country' as he felt the impact of lives loss, went over to the North Korean army, contradictorily fought for the enemy side. Fate did play a hand at every turn. Young brother escaped burning fate, as he's about to get back home to mother and family, he learned of his brother at the opposing war front. He realized how much he has wrongly alienated his big brother. Sigh! No one should be judged for what they do during war - circumstances in war time can change one's psyche and outlook.<br/><br/> From ""The Power of Myth"" PBS series, in his conversations with Bill Moyers, scholar and teacher Joseph Campbell talked about the [ritual of] people joining the army, putting on a uniform, giving up personal life and accepting a socially determined manner of life in the service of one's society. In times of war, they're acting not as individuals, they're acting as agents of something above them to which they've given themselves. ""To judge them as though they were individual human beings is totally improper."" To all soldiers, defensive or offensive, they are courageous souls who sacrificed their precious family ties and all, risking their lives coping with the unknown. It is humane to respect both the living and the dead.<br/><br/>The two leads are engaging: Jang Dong-gun is the big brother (he was detective Kim in ""Nowhere To Hide"" 1999) and Won Bin is the younger brother (he's a young popular TV star in South Korea). The multitude of extras for the battle scenes is part of a grand production with effective cinematography, score and sound effects enabling the film depictions being devastatingly real. The layers of plot and the 'all encompassing' facets/effects of war included in the mix may be too much for some - somehow, 2 hours 20 mins. of ""Taegukgi"" just came and absorbed. I understand the release of this film in South Korea coincided with the fiftieth anniversary of the country's truce with North Korea. The film was very well received (a blockbuster) at home. <br/><br/>Other noteworthy war-related films: ""Sergeant York"" (directed by Howard Hawks 1941), with Gary Cooper's incomparable portrayal of WWI American hero Alvin C. York. ""Hong Kong 1941"" (aka ""Dang doi lai ming"" directed by Leong Po Chi 1984) the Chow Yun-Fat movie of the indelible friendship of three during Japanese occupation, how people react and act due to wartime situations for the sake of survival, saving a dear friend - it's dramatic, gutsy and romantic, too. ""Grave of the Fireflies"" (aka ""Hotaru no haka"" directed by Isao Takahata 1988), the impressive Japanese animated film which is very much about the effects of war - a beautiful story, nevertheless, through the eyes of a young boy and his little sister - however difficult a situation, there is magic in life and in death."

","It is not often that the chance comes by to watch a remarkable film, however, I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to watch a screening of this film in Seoul with English subtitles.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is an experience well worth seeing, not only for its portrayal of conflict on the Korean peninsular during the time (1950's), but also for the relationship that develops between the two main brothers.<br/><br/>There are, of course, some distractions from this great film - one of them, the overly ""shaky"" camera movements, particularly during action scenes. Another, the under-developed English subtitles. I sincerely hope that the English scripting will be improved if this film gains international exposure. As a ""foreigner"", I felt a real lack of emotion and feeling from the subtitles. Quite rightly, Koreans will feel much more from this film than others, as they know too well the effect of North Korea on the South.<br/><br/>The only other piece of criticism I could provide would be that a couple of times when it really felt like a scene was developing nicely, it was cut and we ended up in a completely different scene. Perhaps there were good reasons for this, but I felt that some scenes needed just a little more time to develop fully.<br/><br/>Overall, however, an impressive film that is probably not one for the kids, considering the level of violence.

This movie is done in the style of ""Saving Private Ryan"", which was a very good movie, but I believe this was one up.

I'm used to (/tired of?) seeing war films about wars involving western countries, mainly the Vietnam war and WW II and this film made me like war films again, if only for a brief moment (I know western parties are involved in the Korean War as well, but the main characters here are Koreans). <br/><br/>Taegukgi shows the audience a great (Korean) insight in the Korean War and besides this delivers it in a great story as well. The story of two brothers growing apart during wartime may seem a bit typical (and it would have been), but the director really takes his time getting into the story what results in a great compassion created by the viewer. Before seeing the film I knew little about the Korean War and when I visited Korea, my Korean friend insisted I'd watch this one and I'm happy he did. <br/><br/>This film was a big blockbuster in Korea and I can understand why. It is a great film but above all the Koreans are really proud of their national history. Taegukgi does a great job putting a part of that history on screen for the world to see.<br/><br/>Besides this I would like to point out it's very interesting to see JSA and Welcome to Dongmakgol. Those two films (in addition to Taegukgi) give an even better insight in how the (South-) Koreans experience(d) the Korean war and the effect it had and in some way still has on the people of Korea.<br/><br/>I give it 8/10"
"DarkestOperator","10","5","5","23 December 2007"," A heart and gut-wrenching war movie
","This has to be one of, if not the best war movie I've ever seen. It has all the usual elements of a war movie, the characters trying to get home, the personal struggles, the depiction of the enemy as heartless and souless. However, what sets this one apart is that it perfects all of these usual clichés. Being one of two brothers in real life, I understood the struggle of the two main characters very well. In terms of realism, the movie was very realistic, it definitely had the feel of a war movie to it as the makers captured the feel of Saving Private Ryan very well. The sound and score were very well done and fitting. Finally, this doesn't usually happen, but I actually cried in this movie. Being one of two brothers like I previously mentioned and Asian, I really felt Lee Jin-Seok's struggle. Really good, possibly the best war movie I've seen in my entire life. This one will put a lump down your throat, send a few chills down your spine, and really make you think about what war can do.<br/><br/>10/10. They need to make more war movies that center around Asian conflicts. How about one depicting the war between the Chinese and the Japanese in World War 2?"

And well the war scenes... they are just out of the world ... take my word for it... they are brilliant... the movie is far superior to Platoon or Saving private Ryan...... I have never seen Dong-kung Jang in a movie before but let me tell you ... he has given the greatest performance of his lifetime as Jin-Tae. every scene in this movie is brutally realistic... however it does get slightly hollywoodish at the end....Apart from this minor flaw it is two and a half hours of adrenalin pumping experience......It features some of the best close range combat scenes.....It covers the entire Korean war.....Recommended viewing .... superior to any other Hollywood war film i have seen"
"liud2005","10","10","12","20 March 2007"," Underrated soon to be Korean War classic
","The Korean War is thought of as the ""forgotten"" war in the U.S. because it came on the tail end of WW2. For Koreans it symbolizes a conflict that never ended, a civil war between a nation divided that has never been resolved. If you watch the movie in this context then the symbolism of the protagonists and the name has a much deeper meaning. Viewers have criticized the melodrama involved but there are events in war similar to the ones in the film that have happened. The film steps away from glorifying war and shows it as brutal and unforgiving and sometimes turns family members on each other. It is a state of complete breakdown of human rationale and consequences There is no real ""happy"" ending like in many Hollywood films and the violence is not glorified. This movie is a testament to Korean War veterans all over the world. It is to South Korea's credit that they could make such an important film for future generations."
"calvin0272","Null","10","12","3 October 2004"," An Epic
","I never liked subtitled movies, until this one. Just watched it last night and couldn't stop thinking about it.<br/><br/>The movie started with the life of two brothers before the war, a life that was almost perfect until the war shatters all. Everything goes downhill from there. Despite all their best intentions, the two brothers helplessly watched their fate sinking and themselves drifting apart, with only dotted moments of hope and triumgh, when unconditional love and human spirit break through the darkness.<br/><br/>Comparing to ""Saving Private Ryan"", this movie gives characters a more human touch. ""SPR"" seems to moralize too much, no flaws, just hero's. The result is the characters came off plain and two-dimensional. Agree with Saturday-3's comment on SPR posted on 9/13/04 that ""SPR almost seems like nothing more than a visually stunning, flag-waving movie"". By the way, I am a big fan of Steven Spielburg and Tom Hanks, so there wasn't any bias there. On a side note, ""Band of brothers"", on the contrary, is very very good.<br/><br/>What I don't get, is how a mediocre subtitled movies such as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Hero"" gets so much marketing effort and a truly amazing one like this gets nothing. By the way, I am a Chinese currently living in the States. So I guess that wasn't a very patriotic thing to say. IMHO, ""Hero"" is just a compilation of beautiful pictures. ""Crouching Tiger"" is even worse. (It's probably because I was able to understand the original dialogue and can tell how little effort was put into anything other than making the pictures look pretty.)<br/><br/>Hats off to Koreans for making such a great epic. ""Tae Guk Gi"" is a reminder of the difference between art and entertainment, a reminder that wars, as well as movies, are not about bang-bang actions and special effects. They are about human beings.<br/><br/>The only complaints that I could think of are: 1. The music during the beginning of the movie seems a little too sentimental. 2. The camera shakes too much during action scenes, probably deliberately, to create the chaos with a limited budget. But I don't have a problem with the length of the movie. The two and half hours felt like 1.5 hour when you were drawn into the intensity of the film.<br/><br/>If you are still wondering if you want to see this movie, go watch the trailer on the internet. Make sure you watch the one starting with the announcement of ""ShowBox"". Oh, hell, just watch the movie. Chances are you won't regret it.<br/><br/>As for myself, I am going to pre-order the DVD. I can't remember when was the last time that I want to see the bonus material of a movie so badly.<br/><br/>If you like the movie, I would also recommend ""When trumpets fade"" and ""Band of Brothers""."
"gorgonite","10","7","8","19 September 2008"," Brilliant Blockbuster!
","Brotherhood really deserves a 10, but a more accurate rating imo would be 9.8<br/><br/>War films do not usually appeal to me. However this film is exceptional because it is beautifully shot, has magnificent performances from the two lead characters and also encapsulates past and present issues concerning North and South Korea.<br/><br/>The plot consists of two South Korean brothers from the 1950's who are drafted into the army to fight against the North Korean communists. The elder brother tries to protect the younger brother from danger, whilst simultaneously leading the unit to victory.<br/><br/>The film has many brilliantly shot battle scenes and also an underlying theme of melodrama throughout concerning the relationship between the two brothers. This ultimately provides the film with an identity and portrays the true meaning and costs of war. Some war movie fans may see this melodrama as unnecessary, however I see it as absolutely necessary and indeed found the film very moving.<br/><br/>Pros - Cinematography, Score, Magnificent acting, graphic battle scenes<br/><br/>Cons - Film is somewhat formulaic in the beginning<br/><br/>Overall - One of the best blockbusters"
"andyrookjohnson","10","7","8","1 August 2008"," A hugely affecting, moving, brutal war film
","I hadn't seen a Korean film before, but Brotherhood has proved to be a brilliant, if harrowing, introduction. The plot is epic, and incredibly moving throughout. The acting is superb, and one of the most striking things is the realism of the costumes, weapons and pryotechnics - Kang Je-gyu has an amazing eye for detail which shines throughout the film. Even though it is quite long, Brotherhood doesn't drag but rather continues to soar throughout its length - this is a hugely impressive film that should be seen by more people - another example of how Asian cinema continues to be innovative, thought-provoking and well-crafted. I shall definitely be looking out for more films by Kang Je-gyu as well as more Korean films generally. Seeing Brotherhood has been an inspiring experience."

","South Korea puts Saving Private Ryan to shame with this amazing war movie. Taegukgi (or Brotherhood of War) is probably the best traditional war movie i have ever seen. The battle scenes are intense and brutal, even more so then Spielberg's classic film (which is a movie i really like, too.) They also kick in at unexpected places. They are sitting around eating and suddenly bombs are exploding and limbs are flying. The acting is incredible and emotional even though i watched it in subtitles (dubbed English voices are horrible). The facial expressions said it all. The story is a heartbreaking tale of two brothers who are drafted into the Korean conflict in 1950. By the end, i came this close to tearing up. And i am a tough guy. Or so i think.<br/><br/>Now i know a lot of people in America tend to overlook foreign movies because their afraid of reading, or can't read, but i am finding more and more that foreign flicks are a lot better than recent Hollywood movies. Hollywood needs to take a lesson and make more creative stories.<br/><br/>This is truly a masterpiece of modern cinema, a milestone in war movies, and one of the best films i have seen in a long time.

Eventually they drift apart and become enemies, only to reunite in the end. Breathtaking battle scenes, intense action. My only gripe is the cinematography. Many of the action scenes were shot from very close perspectives and left you dizzy or confused. After watching the movie i realized what its true meaning is. The two brothers are metaphors for North and South Korea. Tae Guk Gi is an impactful, spiritual, and deep-seeded journey through the horrors of war; to find family."

","This review is based on Korean premiere on 5th Feb 2004, and I dare to say this flick will rock sometime out of Korea. I do not know when its premier will be in North America and Europe but could not argue more that this will be a gemstone in the world of war films. Director Jacky Kang is well-maneuvering between spectacles and dramas, and most certainly preserving historical accuracy. It is hard to say this film is totally free from the fragments of old legendary war films such as 'Saving Private Ryan', 'Thin Red Line', and 'Dear Hunter'. However, Director Kang shows his craftsmanship to overcome the limits of previous war flicks and creates another dimension of his own style and paragon of action-packed, humanity-based combat scenes. This film is the most luxurious production in Korean film industry so far and the first war movie that scoped on the life and death of normal Korean people during the Korean War, which will be very good source for understanding contemporary Korean society and war history. Probably a must-see for serious viewers but possibly a goof for narrow-eyed couch potatoes."

($12M) But let me say this, a money well spent, this film resonates to all kinds of audiences: intelligent, dumb or whatever, the feeling is pretty universal. Taegukgi avoided to prioritize politics and retell the 38th parallel war over and over again, it focuses on us... human beings who are directly affected by the cruelty of war, not the society as a whole or the rest of the history but the unbearable pain it causes to every individual, families that have been separated by war. It talks about dehumanization, agony and yet the courage of the human heart to accept fate... The movie is very brave, sincere and emotionally wrenching.

","Korean wartime epic ""Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War"" belongs to that brand of sweeping, conflict-era drama epitomized by ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Gone with the Wind"" and TV miniseries ""North and South.""<br/><br/>What makes ""Tae Guk Gi"" such an extraordinary film isn't its solid, family-based core or the choreographed chaos of its battle scenes--although both contribute. Instead, writer/director Kang Je-gyu dedicates himself to the human side of a grand tale, to people who've been uprooted by history.<br/><br/>When brothers Jin-tae (Jang Dong-gun) and Jin-seok (Won Bin) are forced into the South Korean army in 1950, an officer tells older sibling Jin-tae the only way to send his baby brother home is to win medals and fame. Thereafter, Jin-tae volunteers for the most brutal, dangerous missions (caught on film with hand-held ""Saving Private Ryan""-style cinematography) with little regard for his life."
"vancolver","10","9","11","20 July 2004"," Best Asian film for a long time(contains SPOILER)
","The is not a ground-breaking film. It threads on themes already familiar with audience who have graced such war-related masterpieces such as Saving Private Ryan and it doesn't shy away from it. Yet the perfect balance of the various elements: action, love, history and the good acting, makes this film stand out head and shoulder above the pretentious mass.<br/><br/>To comment on the show without referring to its contents is inadequate. So there will be some spoilers.<br/><br/>The show is based on the Korean War. While many know about World War II, the younger generation (thats including me) usually have minimal knowledge regarding the Korean War or the Vietnam War. I think the show in a way raises awareness on how a clash of ideology can cause so much suffering among the innocents. Some soldiers in the film were forced to fight and it is obvious that they did not have a choice. They are but pawns for the political regime they were physically in. Even within the South Korean regime, a federation was formed to eradicate suspected communists by killing any suspects, including a massive number of innocent civilians.<br/><br/>The backbone of the show is the brotherly love between the two main leads. The film alternates between intense action scenes and scenes where they display their inner emotion, their physical and mental struggle. The brotherly love is deep and uncompromising, so much so that it eventually caused severe tension among themselves. The emotion is deep and thought-provoking, and its the kind acted with chemistry, the kind that will make you shed tears, not the kind of cursory love that you see in Pearl Harbor. Simply put, the performance by the actors and the scripting is superb.<br/><br/>The action is extremely intense. Although one may feel its a simple rip-off from Saving Private Ryan (which it is), it is still immensely powerful and strikes the fear and urgency of battles deep into you. As a realistic war film it is bound to have some gore in it, but it isn't excessive and doesn't take the focus of the show away. Strangely, I was particularly impressed by the scene where a huge (really huge) number of People's Liberation Army rushed over to join their North Korean counterpart....their dramatic entry to the war was a great blow to the South Koreans and US who were about to grab victory. Again...these are history stuff.<br/><br/>I will recommend this to anyone, not only for its deep emotional and entertaining value but also for its historical value."

","I cried from beginning to end. There were few protracted scenes that could have been left on the editing floor, but the positives far outweigh the negatives for me to recollect now. Acting was superb, the music was poignant, and the action sequences were very realistic.<br/><br/>This film also very well demonstrates the depth and breadth of sentiments and values that govern a conventional Korean family, and in a larger scale, Korean society.<br/><br/>The Korean War is not the focal point of this film; rather, it is the reagent that serves to show the evolution of the individual's morale, social structure, and familial piety.<br/><br/>The ending was particularly touching to me because Jin-Tae serves his duty as a ""Hyung"" (""Older brother"" in informal Korean, young male perspective) until the end. He switches sides one last time, shooting at his own Communist Flag Unit, to ensure the safe passage of his younger brother, a non-Communist soldier, to safer ground.<br/><br/>I think it's important for the world to know that for Koreans, this war was not about North Koreans vs. South Koreans. Rather it was a war between Communist-aligned and unaligned civilians. Ideology affiliation among Koreans did not fall in clear geographic areas as Western historians preach. <br/><br/>As for the comments on certain dialogue and acting being ""over dramatic"" or ""too melodramatic""; well, I don't think it was Won Bin's overacting. Hyper-sentimentality is an aspect of Korean culture of which many obviously were not aware. The dynamics between the family members and brothers accurately depicted the closeness that is evident in Korean culture.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to everyone, and I think it should be re-rated to PG-13."

Excellent acting, well-written dialogue, and a beautiful story of the chaos and horror that war entails, both through death and, sometimes even worse, survival.<br/><br/>The plot is one that cannot be easily summarized without giving away important details, and this is very typical of the best Korean films today. As an American, it is hard to find film that doesn't cling to such formulae as have become common enough to be named and studied. No, films such as this one take you for twists and turns, and don't let go of you until they are truly ready.<br/><br/>Action sequences are like nothing you'll ever see in American cinema, and yet that's not even what the film is truly about. Just as The Thin Red Line was about the effects of war on the human spirit, as well as the natural landscape, Taegukgi focuses on the effects of war on the human mind and body, as well as the social landscape of those involved.<br/><br/>Do not let the claims of cliché deter you. These things are supposedly cliché because they really did happen. A lot. This film is about every single Korean man and woman who was a victim of that terrible civil war, not just the main characters covered in the plot.<br/><br/>I mentioned The Thin Red Line earlier. Probably a great way to spend your night would be to watch Taegukgi, let yourself get collected afterwards, then watch Thin Red Line to have a truly enlightening end to the experience.<br/><br/>Anyone who does not understand Korean culture, or at the very least the basic culture of East Asia in general, will have a hard time understanding this film. I suggest that you do your research before you ruin your opinion of the film by not understanding it properly.<br/><br/>Besides that, this is a journey you will not forget."

","Tae Guk Gi educated me about the Korean War. After saying that, I realize that this is a strange statement, since most war movies are happy-go-lucky representations of war that glorify fighting and dying as a noble cause. Thankfully, Tae Guk Gi kept far away from this attitude, and showed me the true side of war. Most war movies turn war into a game, something set, orderly, and noble. Tae Guk Gi shows the true chaos and damage war can cause, and does so brilliantly. The only war movie i've seen that transcends this one is Apocalypse Now, and I believe Tae Guk Gi to be one of my favorite Korean movies out. A great war picture, recommended for all audiences, some scenes of violence and gore but a family film at heart, brilliantly acted and thankfully keeps to the fact that war is indeed hell."

It depicted the gruesome aspect of the war... however, that movie lacked one key aspect that this Korean movie was able to capture so well...<br/><br/>That aspect is the pure horror and evil effect it has on people. The older brother is the central figure in this as he changes 180 degrees in who he is as his originally sound reason to send his younger brother back becomes a nightmare and changes him into a devil.<br/><br/>The movie captures the essential element of any war: the horror of it. Saving Private Ryan tried to capture the heroic efforts of the people... this Korean movie tried to capture the evil of the war. Being able to understand Korean fully helps a lot to capture the essence of the movie... and also having known previously the history of the Korean War.<br/><br/>So I would say that I come out on top of the most of the reviewers here in terms of background... but come out the same in how we are all affected by the movie. Sure it tries to be Hollywood-ish but it is far more than that... so much more that it made me write my very first movie review for IMDb! <br/><br/>Just note and keep in mind that this movie is NOT for the faint at heart... and I don't just mean the picture aspect, but rather what it draws inside of you."

You will be entertained and you will be amazed, again and again, not forgetting the whole story, drama-wise.

The whole soundtrack is just fantastic though the composer Dong-jun Lee is unfamiliar to me, but hopefully I'll be hearing some of his music in the near future movies as it sounded so good in this one. I'd give this movie 9.5/10, but as that is ""impossible"", I will sadly have to drop the number to 9. It probably deserves more than that, but this is the decision now.

The UK schools shows films for sex education and even films showing animal slaughter, which drove my sister, and I'm sure a lot of other young people to stop eating meat. This film does the job very, very, well for illustrating the immeasurable 'pain' of war.<br/><br/>This was my first Korean film and I was extremely impressed.

","I saw this movie when I went to Korea to visit my grandparents. Despite my bad Korean skills, I was in awe over this movie. Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo is an amazing movie! The movie is a movie about two brothers who fight in the Korean war and their love for each other. The action scenes are amazing, very good plot, and amazing casting. I can truly say that Taegukgi Hwinalrimyeo is absolutely the Best Korean movie I have ever seen! I would give it 5 STARS and Two thumbs up!!!<br/><br/>MUST SEE!!!<br/><br/>By the way, this movie is NOT AN ADULT FILM!! I am very puzzled to see that the movie is under this genre. It is rated PG in Korea. I urge IMD to change the status!"

","I've seen this movie in my hometown, and i was left in complete awe for no less than 10hours. It's a smash box-office hit here in south korea, and i do hope that this amazing film will become a n international hit as well.This film is the most accurate potrayal of the korean war, and the emotional depth is almost overwhelming. the two leading stars, jang dong gun and won bin are both popular hearthrobs in south korea, and this was the first time when they have shown what real acting is supposed to be.Both of them are mesmerizing. handsome as they are, they really got into acting so much to care about their good looks, and the results are terrific. The two actors have reportedly sacrificed their bodies and souls for this movie, during the marathon 8-month shoot, they have lived on nothing but rice cakes(think sushi without any relish)and mr.jang even broke his leg while shooting an intense battle sequence. The movie itself is fascinating, the plot is a complete mixture of historical facts, fiction, with such emotions like love, hate, madness, brotherhood and tragedy perfectly blended in. You really have to watch the movie at least twice to appreciate its full value, and millions of Koreans are watching this film over and over again. I'm so proud to be a Korean, wow this movie is even better than Private Ryan or Band of Brothers. it is a sad part of history that this film shows us, but the fabulous director Kang has done the great job of letting the world know what we've all been through, Koreans and Americans alike. The movie's complicated, but the message is simple. There is nothing such as a good war."
"anhedonia","8","9","12","26 March 2005"," Flawed, a bit clichéd, even manipulative, but still good
","Clearly inspired and influenced by ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998), ""Tae Guk Gi"" is, in many ways, the film Steven Spielberg's war epic wanted to be and should have been. Kang Je-Gyu's often brutal film about the Korean War owes much to that visceral WWII film, but I found it more engaging, moving and emotionally powerful than Spielberg's highly praised movie.<br/><br/>""Tae Guk Gi"" isn't perfect. But its attributes outweigh its flaws.<br/><br/>What works are its two main characters. Jang Dong-Kun (as Jin-tae) and Won Bin (as Jin-sock) are utterly believable as two brothers who dote on each other and find themselves in an untenable situation.<br/><br/>Director Kang Je-Gyu knows how to orchestrate action sequences, as he proved in ""Shiri"" (1999). Here, again, he fills the film with terrific action. He gives the film a sense of grittiness that would make Sam Fuller proud and choreographs a shoot-out sequence that clearly pays homage to the great Sam Peckinpah. And Peckinpah would have been proud. The battle scenes are as graphic and emotionally devastating as one could get in a movie.<br/><br/>What's interesting is that ""Tae Guk Gi"" doesn't take sides. Kang Je-Gyu depicts the insanity of war and how innocent people can get sucked up in its vortex. Here, the South Koreans are as ruthless and vicious as the North Koreans. He also takes great pains to show how patriotism can warp people's sensibilities - a lesson for all of us in these jingoistic, warmongering times in the U.S., where critics of the Iraq War and this administration are quickly dubbed as being unpatriotic and war hawks wrap themselves in the American flag and excuse unconscionable behavior.<br/><br/>The flaws of ""Tae Guk Gi"" could easily be linked to the film's Hollywood trappings. In his attempt to emulate ""Saving Private Ryan,"" Kang Je-Gyu adopts some of that film's storytelling techniques, such as a framing device.<br/><br/>The trouble with framing devices such as this is that when a film begins with a central character at a later age and then flashes back to his youth, it's impossible to put us on tenterhooks when that character is in danger. We know he survives because we've seen him as an older person. ""Tae Guk Gi"" would have worked fine without the prologue. The director should have just kept the coda, which is moving and believable.<br/><br/>In fairness to Kang Je-Gyu, he doesn't tell his story from the wrong person's point-of-view as Spielberg did in ""Saving Private Ryan."" Also, unlike in that film, the characters in ""Tae Guk Gi"" don't come off as conventional stereotypes. We care about the two brothers and what happens to them, even though one brother's character arc seems abrupt and a bit too convenient.<br/><br/>If ""Tae Guk Gi"" proves one thing, it's that Hollywood's influences stretch worldwide and infuse themselves into the work of foreign filmmakers, too. The flaws of ""Tae Guk Gi"" are that some moments represent the hokey trappings of war films, clichés we've seen in countless other war movies and ones we hope filmmakers would eschew.<br/><br/>I'm sure every battlefield had its sitting-around-the-fire moments of camaraderie. But anyone who's seen war movies knows exactly what will happen in those moments. We know who will survive, who won't. And in these moments, ""Tae Guk Gi"" doesn't do anything differently than a typical Hollywood war movie.<br/><br/>Even though the film runs about 10 minutes too long, ""Tae Guk Gi"" has much going for it. Thanks to the characters and some sensationally well-done sequences, the film manages to overcome most of its clichés and soap opera moments to give us a strikingly powerful film."

","I am from Turkey and one of my relatives has joined to Korean war..I know how it was..even thousands Turkish soldiers died there for South Korea. We remain with them as brothers. I expected in this movie to mention Turkish troops too but after watching the movie i understood that this is not the point. There is a nation which speaks ""same"" language, shares same ""culture"" and have same ""blood"" and they kill themselves for what? for ideologies that most of them doesn't even know what is it. in the movie in some scenes its emphasizing clearly. They are blaming Jin Seok for his brother has joined Comminists and this is a bad propaganda and Jin Seok answers ""My brother doesn't even know what is communism!"" In once a North Korean soldier attacks yelling you American imperialism dogs. But the soldier he was attacking to, doesn't even know what is American imperialism. The atmosphere, the scenes, the sounds, the story everything was wonderful. And i honestly must say that Saving Private Ryan ""was"" the one of my bests but after seeing this movie it just replaced with it. I am a person who hardly cries on movies.

","We didn't know anything about ""Tae Guk Gi"" when we rented it, but we were blown away. The plot centers on two South Korean brothers who have to join the army during the Korean War. But what you really notice about the movie is the way that it portrays the carnage of the war. Even if you know absolutely nothing about the Korean War, this movie will truly shake you. You feel the violence in the same way that you do in ""Saving Private Ryan"", but unlike that one, ""Tae Guk Gi"" never idealizes anything; it shows that when you get right down to any issues, there are no good guys in wartime.

","All too often the Korean War is called the ""The Forgotten War"" and in a sense I suppose it's true. Ask the young ones of today and they'll most likely have the vaguest of ideas. The amount of films about this particular war as opposed to the enormous succession of Vietnam and WW II movies is staggering. This movie is by all means a must see first and foremost because it details a brutal conflict that the world hasn't truly paid tribute to. The acting is sensational and all the more I find myself South Korean cinema. It certainly feels like a high budget epic of a war film, and rightfully so.<br/><br/>Like a true masterpiece, the film displays the sickening effects of the war on ideology on both sides. One Jang Dong-gun's character is molded by the tide of the war, becoming a mere shadow of who he once was. Won Bin is also excellent, not to mention Lee Eun-joo. The atmosphere is one displaying how turbulent the times were and how the atrocity destroyed lives. The score by Lee Dong-jun is also quite magnificent, bringing many emotions to the film. I highly recommend this movie."

M-1 rifles, trench warfare, close-up bayonet combat, flying mortar shells, everything we love about war films of that era. Then they added a wonderful (not cheesy, just real) story of 2 brothers caught up in the war, plus their love and sacrifices for each other. How such an ordeal can change people and how it can bring them together, brothers or not, is perfectly addressed in this movie. Plus, it highlights the overall glories of war and the people who fight to win them. I recommend it for anybody who loves Korean films / is about to ship out."
"dougjn","10","3","3","27 January 2007"," War particularly civil war has a terrible cost but is sometimes still necessary.
","(No spoilers until after the all caps word ""spoilers:"" below.) Those writing comments here, and there are many, who say this is an anti-war movie simply didn't understand it. Try watching it again with an open mind.<br/><br/>It is not, any more than Saving Private Ryan is, an anti-war movie. What both movies do is make viscerally and unforgettably real the horrible costs of war. They celebrate the sacrifices of fallen comrades even while they note that sometimes unwise actions on their part, sometimes inept decisions above, and sometimes partly unfathomable altruism was directly responsible.<br/><br/>They are both absolutely at their core movies about not taking a decision to enter war at all lightly. (Which can of course mean they inform a view that wars are often not worth their cost, such as many reasonably feel, the present one in Iraq.) However in both movies the director is plainly and unmistakably saying, for those with any ability to see things outside their own ideological prism, that the wars that each were portraying (WWII and the Korean war) were for their country's and their citizens' well being, unquestionably necessary and worth it.<br/><br/>The title is brilliant and couldn't have been better chosen. In addition to, as I understand it, making reference to the S. Korean national flag, it sums up after you've seen the movie, both the reasons for fighting, and the tragedy of the divided brother nations that resulted.<br/><br/>While S. Korean fanatics both within the army ranks and outside of it are shown as sometimes acting as unnecessarily brutally to civilians as the Communist north, there is no question that the director's overriding message is that fascistic brutality is systematic and pervasive on the Communist side, while more episodic and triggered by rages of revenge for the most part on the Southern one. SPOILERS: The truly lunatic extremes to which the older brother is given once he has crossed over to the N.Korean side in the belief that both his brother and fiancé have been killed by anti-Communist fanatics in the South, is a nice allegory for the then and still now fanaticism of many citizens of the Communist north. His final flipping to fight against the soldiers of the North in his dying moments is clearly an emotional expression of the Southern hope and belief that at some point and somehow their brothers to the North can and will regain their sanity  even many of the lunatic true believers among them.<br/><br/>What this movie clearly does is take the anti-war sentiment that is and especially at the time of the film's release was gripping the young in the South, acknowledges the partial validity of the sentiment, but then moves to show why their fathers were heroes in fighting back against the invading totalitarian North, and why despite the terrible costs it was nonetheless worth it. It's easy to see why it's the most viewed movie in S. Korea ever. It's a moving and fascinating film for non Korean Americans as well. It's an intimate look at people who we see as both similar to us in many essentials, and quite different as well in some others."

I should have purchased this the first time I saw it, along with multiple copies to give out to friends and family.<br/><br/>I read one comment that said this was better than Saving Private Ryan. I am not willing to go that far, but I will, without hesitation, agree with anyone who says that it is as good. However, those who have not seen this yet should avoid thinking that they are just going to see a SPR with Korean actors. The similarities stop at war and aesthetics. This is a completely different story! I won't go in to the plot though, anyone interested can read the films profile if needed.<br/><br/>What I'd like everyone to know is how emotional this story is. I am not an ultra sensitive viewer, but this picture had me wiping tears off of my cheeks. Usually, I just get teary eyed. This was different. I dare anyone who thinks that they are stone-cold to view this show and not shed more than a few tears in the process.<br/><br/>Anyway, I gave it a ten out of ten because I believe it deserved it.

"Buddy-51","8","3","3","1 August 2005"," very powerful war film
","The Korean film ""Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War"" stands as one of the most unsparing and harrowing films about men engaged in armed conflict to come our way in many years.<br/><br/>""Tae Guk Gi"" shows us the Korean War through the eyes of two brothers, Jin-tae and Jin-seok, both of whom are pulled away from their family and conscripted into the army right at the start of the conflict. Jin-tae feels very protective of his younger brother and devises a scheme to get himself a medal so that Jin-seok will be able to be sent home. Thus, Jin-tae begins to volunteer for dangerous assignments, much to Jin-seok's great fear and consternation. Over time, however, Jin-tae comes to savor his hero status, eventually becoming so desensitized to human suffering that he begins to commit atrocities of his own both on and off the battlefield. The film raises the issues of what it means to be a ""hero"" and of where loyalty to family as well as to country truly begin and end.<br/><br/>Alternately horrifying and heartbreaking, ""Tae Guk Gi"" is a war film done on an epic scale that, nevertheless, rarely loses focus on the intimate human drama at its core - even though the plotting leans a bit towards the artificial and the melodramatic at times (further heightened by a musical score that is far more soupy than it needs to be). Still, with battle scenes that are every bit as graphic, realistic and unflinching as those in ""Saving Private Ryan,"" the film effectively captures the unrelenting savagery of the ugly business we call war.<br/><br/>The performances by Dong-Kun Jang and Bin Won, as the two literal brothers-in-arms, are moving and authentic, and the action scenes have an immediacy and scope that help the film override some of the weaknesses in the script. Astutely directed by Je-gyu Kang and superbly edited by Kyeong-hie Choi, ""Tae Guk Gi"" is a powerful film about war and the men - be they heroes or common soldiers - called upon to wage it."

A true gem has graced us and I must say thank you to the fantastic actors and crew involved in one of the top three (perhaps the best) war films I have ever seen. The transformation that occurs in this film both among the characters and the country are portrayed better than I could have imagined. I also was blessed by the fact that I was confused about which brother was being portrayed in the present day, which I hope was the directors intention not my own mistake."
"Dare_Devil007_","Null","3","3","2 October 2004"," Speak to me, Brother. [Spoilers.]
","There are a few things you, the reader, should know about me before reading on: 1. I am Korean and proud of it. 2. I don't know a lot of Korean history. 3. I am very emotional and sensitive. 4. I don't like war movies.<br/><br/>Okay, now that's out of the way, let's get started shall we? ""Taegukgi"" is a Korean war/drama about two brothers who are forced to join the Korean army after the North Koreans attack the border and try to invade South Korea. Over the course of the war, the two brothers find themselves drifting farther and farther apart as the older one quickly moves up in rank in the army. It starts in the present when archeologists find the skeleton of the older brother and they call the younger brother about the discovery of his brother's body.<br/><br/>While the fighting style, the guns, the explosions, the missing limbs and the overall bloodiness of it reminded me so much of ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Taegukgi"" concentrates on the characters more than the actual war. In the beginning, both of the brothers are happy-go-lucky guys living a normal life in rural Korea. As the war progresses, we can see the psychological change as the older brother becomes more focused on gaining more for himself from the war rather than hoping it would end. I cried several times during the movie, especially at the end (yes, I know I'm a complete sap.).<br/><br/>""Taegukgi"" isn't meant to be taken as a war movie that only focuses on the war itself. It's much like ""Pearl Harbor"". It's the story of two brothers and the war is just the current that pulls us along with them on their journey throughout the three years of the Korean War.<br/><br/>At the end, when we are brought back to the present, the younger brother's anguish and grief is expressed in one small speech he delivers (I cried when he said this, too): ""I waited 53 years, brother. I shouldn't have left you there. Say something. Speak to me, brother."""
"csong","Null","3","3","26 July 2004"," Powerful war drama
","Taegukgi uses the bitter Korean war as a backdrop to uncover the horrors and atrocities of war, and how common, peace-loving folk are affected by such adversities. The title means ""Waving the Korean Flag"". In some other territories the film is marketed as ""Brotherhood"" which tends to make the movie sound more a drama rather than an intense war film.<br/><br/>Director and writer Kang Je-Gyu crafts this film with an assured hand. The battle sequences are as intense as any seen in modern war films, with shaky cameras, explosions, mutilations, blood and all. Thankfully, the director has wisely chosen not to go for the sanitized ""Pearl Harbor"" route, which would have made the film less truthful about the horrors of the Korean war.<br/><br/>Unlike most other war films, Taegukgi has a surprisingly powerful dramatic element that tells the story of two brothers who are forcibly drafted to fight in the war. Embroiled in the horrors of warfare, the brothers mature, conflict, and inner demons arise... heart-wrenching to watch. The wonderful performances by Jang Dong-Gun and Won Bin bring these characters to life. Their brotherhood is developed and performed on screen in a very straightforward manner, which is different from what is done in the arguably more ""artsy"" films like ""The Thin Red Line.""<br/><br/>The realistic set pieces are brought to the forefront by the cinematography, as the war moves from the southern countryside of the Korean peninsula, to the snowy regions in the north. The intricate reconstruction of 1950s South Korea just before the surprise invasion by the North, and the chilling war-torn streets of Pyongyang and Seoul is amazing. One can imagine what the Korean people would feel when they see these places of the past.<br/><br/>The editing, although choppy at times as it shuffles between personal moments to huge battle sequences, is evenly-paced. There is never a dull moment throughout. The score by Lee Dong-Jun opens the movie with a patriotic, yet emotional theme, and continues to aid in the delivery of the storyline throughout, although some parts of the score are more upfront and manipulative than necessary because many of the scenes are powerful in their own right. The sound effects are a high point for Korean cinema, and the CG work is subtle that not many realize its use.<br/><br/>The cynic might not find anything new in this movie that has not been done before, including blood and guts scenes, and shaky cameras reminiscent of those in modern war films like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Black Hawk Down"", as well as the melodramatic moments of the storyline more commonly found in dramas.<br/><br/>But with truth and emotion, Taegukgi masterfully melds the gut-wrenching realities of warfare, the personal battles of the soldiers, and the pain of a family separated by war, into a tight and compelling whole. This film delivers on so many levels that it will stay as one of the most unforgettable films I have ever experienced. Highly recommended."

Jin-Tae is a hardworking shoemaker and Jin-Seok is his younger brother, who is about to attend college.

I actually got round to watching it the other day, and have to say it the the best war film I have ever seen in my life. The sub titles don't effect the magnificence of this truly superb film. It makes Private Ryan, and Full Metal Jacket look like weedy, and this film should have attracted major advertisements here, as foreign films very rarely get a look in here. The photography is brilliant, along with the acting and music. I was moved to tears watching it, which is something that has never happened to me watching a war film. The battle scenes are very graphic, but they are there to show just how vile war is. Fir those who haven't seen it,please do so. You certainly won't be disappointed"

","Since the comparisons to Saving Private Ryan are inevitable, I will admit that I liked SPR a lot better. This movie, on the other hand, was easily a contender. First off, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE DUBBED IN English. Thank you. Not only does it ruin the film, but it cheapens the acting performances that you need to hear to fully get the movie. With that being said, here is my review: The fighting scenes were absolutely gorgeous. They even broke that cliché where every artillery shell must be a gigantic fireball, and instead used dirt spray, which is more like reality. There was something about this movie that was absolutely terrifying. It was the same feeling that I felt while watching SPR, that's hard to get in many other war movies. Not only were the characters great, but everything felt chaotic.<br/><br/>One complaint about the movie is that it is over dramatic. This may be a cultural difference with respect to film. It also helps us understand more about the characters. This leads me to the absolute best point of this film - its reflections on death and war. A great movie is one where you feel the horror of an impending onslaught, like when China charged the S. Korean base and all of the men where basically in a frenzy. Then, the film shows a gigantic wall of incoming soldiers, almost like an ""omg!"" moment. Unreal.<br/><br/>I hated the ending, however. I believe that it cheapened the film. Though none of the soldiers would have really cared about one measly S. Korean soldier running around in the heat of battle, it was a little stupid that he found his brother in the middle of the fight and they got into a Hollywood-ish fight. A better ending would have definitely helped this film out a lot, like, for instance, the brother being killed by his own men. Other than this, great film.<br/><br/>9.5/10"
"grumbleshake","9","5","6","30 March 2006"," Awesome
","This movie was fantastically amazing! I have never been one for reading subtitles, but I bit the bullet on this one and do not regret a single syllable. The cinematics were stunning. I would go so far as to say better than Saving Private Ryan. In fact, I was stunned to see that Ryan had a higher average rating than this film! Taegukgi surpasses Ryan in all fields in my opinion, including, dare I say?, lead man. The conflict within the film extends far beyond that between North and South Korea. Its truly a tale of two brothers' fight to stay alive and their motivations to do so. Taegukgi is hard to get your hands on, but, if the opportunity presents itself, BUY IT! Especially if you are convinced Saving Private Ryan is the end all be all of war films. You, my friend, are mistaken and need to educate yourself."
"m-ferrier1","9","5","6","23 March 2006"," Refreshing telling of a lost war
","I am starting to become a fan of world cinema and with good reason.<br/><br/>Having recently seen City of God and before that Brotherhood of the Wolf I have started to see through the shallow pool that is Hollywood.<br/><br/>I can't remember how I heard about Brotherhood (easier to say than the proper name) but I am glad I bought it on the off chance.<br/><br/>I really had no idea what the Korean war was all about and my ignorance was totally shown up from seeing how large scale the war was and all the tragic circumstances surrounding it. Are we humans only good at killing each other? it seems we can't live without killing, a flaw I believe that will finally see us wiped off the planet in the maybe not so distant future.<br/><br/>Brotherhood does not try to be clever or over complicated. It is a simple story of brotherly love and the horrors and consequences of war. You see in true colours the effects a war has, physically and mentally. I found it realistic that the elder brother turned his back on his country as it showed as we know that blood is thicker than water (South Korea in this case) as all he believed in was a lie, or a lie from what he saw which was subjective but what was he to know.<br/><br/>A moving film which had me guessing till the end which brother was it that was discovered (shown at the beginning of the film) 50 odd years later in a shallow grave.<br/><br/>Great stuff - I highly recommend it if like me you are not fazed with reading subtitles while watching films, I grew up watching kung fu movies so my eyes are masters when it comes to foreign films.<br/><br/>Buy it."

","After watching this film I was totally astonished with the story line and clarity of the characters in this film. I loved this film from the beginning through the epic battle scenes to the dramatic conclusion. It has the drama of 2 brothers that get caught up in the sweep for soldiers that the South Korean Army needed to help hold until the United Nation forces could mobilize. Snatched right out of the fleeing refugees heading South away from the North Korean advance. It has a lot of I will assume Korean subtitle text (dates) that are confusing but don't take away from the movie. The movie uses historically correct weapons and equipment which is a big relief to a history buff such as me. I will not spoil the movie for others so take a look a see that foreign film makers can make a super quality product that can rival anything we've made in years."

","This movie had amazing war scenes, but it also told the story of a bond between brothers. The movie made the relationship between the brothers seem so real. It wasn't always a happy relationship, in fact many times it was tested and became tense, but somehow still endured after seeming to have died many times.<br/><br/>In the final segment of the movie I actually cried. I never cry when watching movies and I rarely cry on other occasions, but this movie....<br/><br/>When a movie draws you in so much that you feel true emotion, it really is an accomplishment. The movie does this subtly, at times you would think that there was nothing left to feel about, but I was surprised to see that there was. I think thats the best review a movie can get.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the closing scene as well, I saw the end twice and the first time I saw it I thought it would have been better to end at the climax, but the message of hope in the final scene gives some relief from the bitter sorrow."

"karousokarl","10","5","6","1 November 2005"," great actors and great director
","this movie rocks because the two brothers are one heck of good actors. specially the younger brother. whenver you see him, you feel how he feels. he projects all the emotions, from the greatest joy to the saddest anger. the director knew exactly what to do in any scene there was there is one problem though, the actions sequences were a bit too shaky for my taste. true you have to take the viewer to the unsteadiness of being under fire and the craziness of war, the crudeness of the soldier's life. still, i believe that this is one of the best war movies around. not only from the Asian cinema, but from the whole world."
"Macbeth2354","10","5","6","20 August 2005"," After all, a story of brotherly love
","Great movie, if I were to quote someone ""it's better than Saving Private Ryan"". Not suffering greatly from the theatrical touch of the Asian cinematography, the twists and turns are stretched to the limit, one more and it would be annoying, the drama is just a bit too much, the realism of the war scenes is pretty much as it should be, except some scenes that tend to disappoint (see the Chinese reinforcements or the flag unit's attack) due to the theatrical display and behavior. As opposed to Hollywood, not only the hero survives, and that's nice to see, it's a good change. The movie has so few drawback's that his strong points do make the impression, at least on me. I find it very easy to follow the story, not predicting the next scene as in other cases. In the end, all the violence so directly shown simply fades away in face of the strong message that's being sent to the viewer, blood connections are impossible to break. Brotherly love never dies, there's never a too big sacrifice to make for your own family. In fact, a delicate story, about some very delicate feelings, mounted in a very rough frame, but such conceived that it doesn't alter the contents. Simple, efficient, not very complicated, thing that might bother a few, but simple things are beautiful and effective. See it, it's worth the time."
"The_Void","7","5","6","14 August 2005"," Brothers. At War. In Korea.
","I have become so dismayed at the recent crop of Asian films that I have taken to going into them expecting to be disappointed. You can imagine my surprise, then, when this film; Brotherhood, actually turned out to be quite good! Despite an opening that massively rips off Saving Private Ryan, and more than it's fair share of clichés throughout the running time, the film is an emotional account of war that works more because of the relationship of it's characters than the plot itself. The film centres around the Korean war, which sets it apart from other war dramas almost immediately because there aren't many that focus on this particular war. The main theme of the movie is relationship between the two characters (hence the title). We have this central brotherhood, which is surrounded by the horrors of the Korean War. The way that the film plugs you into their plight is skilfully handled, and despite the fact that sometimes the film goes over the top a little with the sentiment; it's usually well meaning, and since the character actions are well explained, it's easy to care for them.<br/><br/>Despite, essentially, being a war film; the actual war takes a back seat to the 'brotherhood'. However, that doesn't stop director Je-gyu Kang from adequately showing the horrors of war. The action in the film is gritty and realistic, with some of the violent sequences actually managing to be out and out disturbing. Scenes that see prisoners of war brutally slaughtered stand out among the top of the disturbing sequences. The acting from the support cast is genuine and feels real, which helps to add to the overall realism of the picture. Of the two leads, Dong-Kun Jang stands out the most. He looks the part throughout his character ark, and his range of emotions impresses throughout the movie. Bin Won stars opposite him and gives a far more one-note performance. Of course, this could be blamed on the writing and the character; but he overacts every emotion and, at times, it brings the movie down a peg or two. Most war films profess the horrors of war, but this film only does that in an indirect way. Brotherhood is more about how war changes people than the actual 'horror' of it, and it's nice to see a different take. I wont close this review with any clichéd comments like ""better than anything Hollywood have done, ever"" or anything; but I will say that it's good."
"ippu2004","9","5","6","26 July 2005"," This film is about two brothers who get drafted into the South Korean Army in June 1950. They fight a grueling war, measured with a myriad of human loss.
","I think this film clearly shows the atrocity of war. A peaceful and joyful life was brusquely ended by war, and instead an abject, painful life was in store. The absurdity and meaninglessness of war was clearly shown by the two brothers' struggle. I also think that the lead actors performed very well and realistically.<br/><br/>The extreme hardships and terror that soldiers and civilians went through during the Korean War was well portrayed. Not only did the troops at the front suffer enormously, physically and psychologically, normal civilians were rounded up by the so-called police responsible for arresting ""reds"" and ""red spies"". The film clearly showed the enormous human loss of life suffered in the Korean War, soldier and civilian, North Korean and South Korean, Chinese and UN."

","I don't get why people keep mentioning Saving Private Ryan, to me the only similarity is the war theme. Go watch it, don't see any trailer, don't read any review, just go see it, you will be glad you did. Be warned tho, its a war movie, so it'll be gory at times.<br/><br/>Why I loved this movie? I've watched a lot of South-Korean movies (30+) ever since i saw My Sassy Girl, and got the fever. But honestly I only enjoyed a very few of them, and this is one of them. I enjoyed the gore, the action, the war-theme, the various emotions it provoked from me (can't remember last time i was about to shed a tear watching a movie) and it taught me few things from the Korean war as well. Only minor flaw would be some overacting."
"Danherb","9","5","6","2 June 2005"," Great and haunting Korean war drama
","When I watched this film, I didn't know what to expect from a Korean war movie, for Korean and Asian films in general, that I had watched before have always been kind of special, not to say strange in style and story (f.ex. Oldboy).<br/><br/>But ""Taegukgi"" doesn't rank behind any American war film. Far from it! <br/><br/>""Taegukgi"" even improves and enriches the genre of war films. The battle scenes don't have to hide behind ""Saving private Ryan"", several scenes are even more drastic and pitiless and take away the spectators' breath. ""Saving private Ryan"" is probably the one American war film mostly similar to ""Taegugki"", but I liked ""Taegukgi"" even better, because it does not only show one aspect of war. Films like ""Schindler's List"", ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Der Untergang"" only show one aspect of war, either the brutality and absurdity of war itself, or the political motivation of the adverse parties or the fate of the people. <br/><br/>""Taegukgi"" perfectly combines all those aspects into a haunting and touching story of a Korean family whose happy situation is destroyed by the cruelty of war. We get to know two Korean brothers that live together with their mother, one brother's girlfriend and her brothers and sisters. At the beginning life is enjoyable and hopeful,one brother works on his dream to own a shoe shop of his own and the other brother is very gifted prepares for his studies. The family is full of hopes and plans for the future, which are destroyed by the sudden irruption of war. The spectator gets a much better feeling for the cruelty of war, because he is really involved by the family's fate.<br/><br/>Apart from that, we also learn about the (lacking) motivation of the south and north Korean nation respectively for their behavior. The merging of all those elements lets the spectator conceive what war is about. This is the main advantage of the ""Taegukgi"", it perfectly conveys the absurdity and brutality of war to the spectator. The only weak point of the film is that it gets a touch too solemn at a scene at the end, but that is nothing compared to single-handed heroic deeds in American war films. <br/><br/>""Taegukgi"" is not only an Asian alternative to Hollywood war films, it is a greatly acted and brilliantly pictured touching war drama,that never slides into clichés and tells of a mostly forgotten war and the fates and lives it claimed."

It would be interesting to see more of the ""red"" side of the story. The ""flag"" group on the ""red"" side seemed to me that they were on drugs!? This film made me search for the Korean war on the Internet and it is a strange war like the others in Asia (Vietnam etc). Many opinions.

"carry_thezero","10","8","11","28 August 2005"," If this film didn't move you, you have no heart...
","I went into this movie with high expectations already and f*** did it deliver. I absolutely LOVED this movie; it made you hate both sides and then that feeling is taken away and replaced by a deep saddening of what the side effects of war do to human beings. I like it because it brings attention to a war that is dubbed by Americans as the ""Forgotten War"". I think that is not only incredibly f***ed up but also insulting to the people involved because a war is never something to be forgotten. Going through the American high school system firsthand AND being of full Korean descent, I found it a little unnerving that both the Korean war and the Vietnam war were not covered in history class at all; maybe two pages in the textbook and that's it. Not that I want it glorified but I want people to acknowledge that this happened and form their own opinions about it. The end of the movie was more than I could handle (maybe because I'm a girl ^_^). I'm happy to see that the Korean film industry is making some headway and this film definitely helped the cause. I hope that anyone that is even just a little curious about this movie should without a doubt go pick it up at a local Hollywood video."

","This movie is definitely the most excellent, touching, and moving war movie that I have ever seen. It portrays the Korean War in a heart-breaking, heart-touching story of a young boy an his brother who are drafted into the war.<br/><br/>This movie is unique in that it shows not only the North Koreans as ""bad"", but also shows the war-time crimes that South Korea also committed. In every way possible, it captures the sorrow and the frustration of the Korean people.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this is a movie definitely worth watching. Myself being Korean, I know that the story in the movie is not fiction; there are thousands of stories as heart-wrenching as these that occurred during the Korean War. The acting in this movie is some of the best I've seen, with excellent direction under Kang Je-gyu. Jang Dong-geon and Won Bin perfectly portray a close brotherly relationship, and the intimate role of Young-shin is played superbly by Lee Eun-joo. The supporting cast is definitely the best I've seen as well.<br/><br/>(User's Opinion) Taegukgi is definitely not a rip off of the movie Saving Private Ryan, as many people seem to think. The topic of the Korean War is not one to take so lightly. I must stress that this story could be anything but fiction. Although Saving Private Ryan was indeed an excellent movie as well, I think Taegukgi surpassed it. This movie surveys a million words and truly touches your heart.<br/><br/>10/10 Rating."
"ian-791","10","6","8","15 August 2005"," Brotherhood
","I can see how comparisons with Saving Private Ryan have been made, and like many others, I was slack jawed in the cinema watching SPR in all its brutal glory, but I have to say that this film was superior in terms of character and storyline. The plot in SPR was naff and the ending lame, but here we have an intelligent and well structured story set in a civil war involving 2 brothers, who are innocently carted off to war, (in much the same way as many farmers and fishermen of the North) If war is tragic, then civil war is tragedy in the extreme.<br/><br/>The film does not avoid anything in its treatment of men at war. the sense of brotherhood in hard times, the de-humanisation of self and enemy, and the recognition that, in the end we are attracted and ultimately addicted to forming tribes and looking for conflict. It descends into real paranoia, so that it's difficult to sense a real message (but then again we haven't had any resolution to warfare over the last 2000 years) It should be remembered that the clash of ideologies and paranoia portrayed here, was reflected in the McCarthyism centred in the same Hollywood which spawned Saving Private Ryan. This is a superior film, and one no less enjoyable to western audiences by the subtitles (remember Das Boot?) Watch it."
"heretic000","9","6","8","5 August 2005"," The best foreign film I've ever seen
","Even for an enthusiast of war movies, this film was stunning. I have to say at the beginning, though: if graphic violence bothers you, do NOT watch this film. It is among the most violent movies I have ever seen, even more so than Private Ryan. That said, the story is truly engrossing and the acting excellent. Dialog was good also; however, I suspect that much is lost in translation. And since the story is told from a Korean point of view, it takes for granted many aspects of Korean culture, with which the European or American viewer might not be familiar. Also, you have to have at least a passing familiarity of the 1950-1953 Korean War; otherwise the film will make little sense to you. I have seen very few films about the Korean war, which makes this unique in its own right. So much the better that it is well-directed, well-acted and poignant. One cannot help but be moved by the story of two brothers, at once thrust together and torn apart by a truly vicious war (do a little research; Korea was no picnic, even by the standards of modern warfare).<br/><br/>If you like war movies, don't miss this. Even if you don't, it's still worth a look."
"abisio","10","6","8","22 June 2005"," Best war (or antiwar) movie ever
","If anybody, after Apocalypses Now and Saving Private Ryan or even worse, the very little but depressing information we are getting about the Iraq work, still thinks that war is an adventure, I recommend him (or her) to pick up a gun and take the first plane, boat or car to go there and send back one of the thousand soldiers that do not to want to be there any more. As I sure many war supporters will not do that, just because supporting the war with a car sticker and from our comfortable home is, well, just comfortable; at least spend two and a half ours to see one of the most touching and realistic war movie ever made.<br/><br/>The most important, and sad thing is that this movie is from South Korea, a country that lived a hard civil war and they are still fearing it. The sad part, is because American audiences hate to read subtitles, but if your mind needs more than Hollywood FX and repetitive shallow stories; then this movie will touch you very very deep.<br/><br/>This is the story of two low class brothers, the elder overprotecting the youngest, recruited (against their will) in the 1950's Korean War. In order to get this brother out of danger, the older must became a con-decorated hero (or probably a con-decorated dead hero), so he embarks in any suicidal mission or risk situation possible.<br/><br/>As he became famous, his personality changes and becomes more a beast than a human being, killing every enemy in front of him (armed or not). The movie carries us very realistic on the destruction of war (the carnage is but as enormous), but clearly state that the real damage occurs inside these poor people minds. We see how they are used (and abused) on a purely political fight and constantly betrayed but their own governments and superiors.<br/><br/>The last act of the movie, after and unexpected twist, is somehow unnecessary and predictable, but the immense acting skills of the two leads make for a very touching ending.<br/><br/>In terms of production values and script, TAEGUKGI (Brotherhood at war) competes and surpasses many Hollywood productions even Spielber's SPR.<br/><br/>Advice; rent the movie or buy the DVD but DO NOT MISS IT."
"saturday-3","10","8","12","13 September 2004"," Influenced by Saving Private Ryan, but much better
","Tae Guk Gi is a Korean movie (so it's subbed) about the Korean War. And it's probably one of the best war movies I've seen in a long time. You can immediately see Saving Private Ryan's influence, but in my opinion, Tae Guk Gi blows Saving Private Ryan out of the water.<br/><br/>I remember when I came out of Saving Private Ryan, I had liked it, but I was also a bit disappointed. It was semi-revolutionary for its time for its accurate portrayal of war, with the realistic gore, audio, visuals, etc, but the overall story was weak, and seemed more like a collection of battles and hotspots tied together by said story. Overall, it was a bit too cautious story-wise (yes it was graphically risqué for it's time, but story-wise, it was mild at best). If anything, SPR was at best an introduction to people who hadn't quite grasped how bad war is, and for that, sure, SPR was an excellent eye-opener. <br/><br/>Tae Guk Gi on the other hand, uses its time much more effectively (and is shorter than SPR at that) and doesn't skimp out on story, while maintaining, if not raising, the audio/visual bar. It addresses the horrors of war much better than Saving Private Ryan ever did (for example SPR barely mentioned the Holocaust) and is simply much more encompassing. It doesn't skirt away from ethical issues, raising them quite often actually, down from the infantry level, all the way to the government level. Compared to Tae Guk Gi, SPR almost seems like nothing more than a visually stunning, flag-waving movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, great movie, I'm very satisfied, which is rare. The one major complaint I can say I had was movie length, but your mileage may vary on this one. After the Lord of the Ring giants, I just snapped with long movies. Tae Guk Gi goes through most of the multi-year Korean War, but it does it well, and weighs in at less than 2.5 hrs (note SPR is 2 hrs 50 min).<br/><br/>There are a few other minor complaints but they aren't worth mentioning (their magnitude relative to overall satisfaction is too little)."

The combat scenes are simply amazing. they really do make you think about this war in a whole new perspective.

The characters in the film are human and flawed, believable and in turns likable and infuriating. Overall, though they are real and you can feel their pain throughout the film.

When Jin-tae learns that a general won a medal and sent his son home Jin-tae try's his hardest to win the medal of honour, so that Jin-seok could be sent home and stay away from harm, the soundtrack really fits the mood of the film, the images of war are upsetting and graphic, and the director really knows what he is doing.

Bin Won's performance would rival any of today's leading men Hollywood has to offer. If you don't particularly care for war movies, as I typically do not, please do NOT pass this up. The story of the two brothers is heart warming, heart breaking and everything in between. <br/><br/>This is a most see for any one who enjoys a great story and superb acting."

","Stunning, beautiful and heart rendering.<br/><br/>This fantastic movie based on the perils of war and division, that falls upon the nations that is North and South Korea is a mind-blowing journey of two brothers caught up in the fight between the cross fire that are these two great States.<br/><br/>With absolute breathtaking realism, the action, the battle scenes, is sheer brilliance. We are subjected to pure tension and dynamism that has to be continued throughout this two and a half hour ordeal. This movie will have your emotions on a roller coaster ride till the very end; to say that Taegukgi will leave a lasting impression is saying only a tiny amount, this movie will try for your jugular, then it will rip out your heart.<br/><br/>Besides the very beautiful musical score, by Dong-jun Lee, that are the wheels of your roller coaster, driving us to the highs and lows of our journey, there is the stunning and very effective Cinematography of Kyung-Pyo Hong that it the visual dialogue for our journey into the chaos of war.<br/><br/>Not so much a war movie, but a movie based around war, to make us understand that in this World of ours, there is evil that lurks in the shadows, to place the breaks on our roller coaster and to propel us to fight Common Man against Common Man, for the sake of a better ideology, regardless of circumstance and casualties.<br/><br/>Taegukgi is not a story of the Brotherhood of war, but how families can be torn into desperate, unwanted and uncontrolled terror, to debase us, to become non-human, to kill, and having the will power to survive the atrocities that fall at our doorstep and to recognise this difference.<br/><br/>Taegukgi is truly a heart-rending story of two brothers and the pact of the elder to protect his younger sibling, for the sake of their Mother, this movie will have you in shock at the horror of war, and at the same time, in emotional turmoil.<br/><br/>Truly astounding and moving, till the very last turn of the wheels.<br/><br/>Watch it. Feel It."
"pinkston","9","4","5","1 February 2006"," It's NOT Saving Private Ryan
","Taegukgi, a film displaying events during the Korean War, has been drawing a lot of comparisons to Saving Private Ryan, and rightfully so. However, in no way should anyone believe that this film blatantly copies or steals from Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>Obviously, the use of the shaking hand held camera is taken from Saving Private Ryan, but this is because Ryan's trend setting use of the camera style became the new wait to exhibit realism in a War film. Just as the CGI boom and certain action styles was seen in many action after the Matrix and other films, without using the hand held camera, the audience won't believe in the film. Also, people cite the use of gore and violence is too similar to Saving Private Ryan. But, the director of Taegukgi often makes violent action films. And, did Saving Private Ryan establish that warfare was a violent and bloody event? I don't think so.<br/><br/>Instead, Taegukgi does something which Hollywood War films often do not. The great character development and story of the two brothers and their family is above and beyond any Hollywood character development. Yes, we know the characters in Saving Private Ryan, but the direct statement of the film is the importance of the mission. We learn snippets about the lives of each soldier, but they could be any fill-in, really. In classical War films, each platoon was always filled with someone from the ""big city"" (New York), small town America and a minority character (usually either Jewish or Hispanic). Hollywood still does this, although not at the same degree. But, Taegukgi is really a film about a family and how they are effected by a war, not really about the War itself."
"basula07","10","4","5","15 January 2006"," An emotional, heartbreaking portrayal of war
","Taegukgi: Movie comment (Pardon my poor English; I'm an Asian and haven't been learning English for long) Tae Guk Gi distinguishes itself from other war movies in the sense that rather than glorifying war and portraying it as a symbol of heroic patriotism, it actually demonises war and looks at it through the eyes of someone who WAS actually in the war: a gory, harrowing and mind bending experience.<br/><br/>This movie is somewhat similar to Saving Private Ryan in that they both involve family ties. SPR focuses on someone who believes in patriotism for his family; that is, SPR's message is that being fighting for the country instead of coming back for the family would do the family proud (and makes going to war look like something that is admirable). Tae Guk Gi takes a different approach in that it portrays war as a dehumanising, psychologically traumatic experience that tears families apart and causes nothing but immense grief for both sides. <br/><br/>However, where SPR fails to depict the pain of 'losing everything' in a war and instead views it as something that is honorable, Taegukgi is much more emotional and goes through the painful story of how these brothers, once best friends, became traumatized and poisoned by the sheer violence and horrors of the war, and as a result, became different people. Hence, where SPR fails, Taegukgi shines.<br/><br/>Many people have told me how this movie left them crying for hours. In fact, I was pretty close to crying too. In this movie, war is being heavily condemned -- it costs millions of innocent lives; it rips people off their sanity and it divides brothers and turns them against each other. Although the story is not told from an objective point of view (rather, it is told from an emotional point of view), it still manages to portray war in a different way to other war movies.<br/><br/>Another distinguishing feature of Taegukgi as a war film is that it does not look at war at one point of view; rather, it also depicts the evils within the protagonists' country (e.g. the scene where the protagonist's fiancée was killed). This movie seems to convey a message that 'In a war situation, your allies are your enemies at the same time'.<br/><br/>Taegukgi itself has its own share of surreal, gory battle scenes and surgical violence. I doubt that the scene where maggots were found crawling on top of a soldier's belly won't leave its viewers cringing in disgust.<br/><br/>I can see why this movie had been a box office hit in Korea. (In fact, this movie attracted more than 10 million audiences) It gives you an entirely different perception of war, taken from both the good and bad sides of the view, complete with beautiful setting and top-notch acting.<br/><br/>10/10."
"siderite","8","4","5","10 January 2006"," Hard, good war drama.
","It seems no matter the nation or ideology, you put a bunch of men together and madness occurs naturally. In this movie, the horror, but most of all the stupidity of war is made obvious, while telling the story of two brothers forcefully drafted into the army and that are trying to survive taking care of each other.<br/><br/>The movie is very well made, even the special effects, the actors play very nice, even the extras, while the story itself is captivating and emotional. After watching this movie you will probably hate war with all your heart.<br/><br/>There is no point in revealing the plot. In itself it is not very surprising and the big story is pretty clear from the beginning. The details, though, make this movie and I highly recommend it to people of all ages. Some scenes are too theatrical, but they are only an exception.<br/><br/>The only warning I give is that this is a rather long movie and being highly military it will probably annoy or bore the average woman. Try watching it by yourself or with the guys. It is worth every minute."
"zv300","8","4","5","3 January 2006"," Absolutely EXCELLENT!
","As usual, I won't bore you with the plot summary, just my review. This movie in short was excellent! The story was excellent and full of un-expected plot turns, and the 2 lead actors were very good, but actually this movie is a victory for technical achievements. I've seen the best war movies and this movie ranks right at the top, if not better than ANY war movie I've seen. The sound effects were spectacular, and the cinematography was far and above anything I have seen here in the States. It's that good. Not ONE effect looked fake, from the bullets whizzing by to the blown-apart limbs, everything was top-notch. I feel kinda silly about American movies now, thinking I had seen it all and we are the best at this game, we are not. The Koreans have made an amazing technical achievement of a movie at probably a 1/4 of what us Americans could do it for, and they made a BETTER movie at that price. My hats off to this amazing flick, don't miss it."

It let me contemplate,what's the war is?<br/><br/>I know nothing about Korean movies,I just have watched two movies which produced in Korea.And the 'Taegukgi',of course,I can never forget it!"
"markbeardslee","9","4","5","2 December 2005"," It's not a forgotten war in Korea
","This epic film about the Korean civil war of 1950-1953, despite some typical historical inaccuracies, is such a powerful portrayal of Korea's greatest modern tragedy that I feel almost unqualified to review it. Yet I shall try.<br/><br/>The protagonists in the film are characters named Lee Jin Tae and Lee Jin Seok, brothers who are recruited into the South Korean army in 1950 just after North Korea invades the south.<br/><br/>The film opens in modern day Korea, with a team of archaeologists digging up remains of troops killed in that horrible war from half a century earlier. Jin Seok is still alive as an old man, and he hopes for news that his brother's remains have been identified, so that he can properly mourn the loss of his brother. Yet there remains the possibility that his brother still lives, that he either defected to or was captured by the North Koreans and became inculcated into the odd sort of ""communist"" society that was created by that regime. Throughout the bulk of the movie, a two-hour flashback which highlights the horrors of various Korean war battles, Jin Tae and Jin Seok try to remain together and hopeful in the face of desperation, starvation, destruction and maddening violence. As the elder brother, Jin Tae is determined to earn a medal, whether or not it kills him, so that Jin Seok can go home. The preservation of the life of at least one son for every family is a central theme, not unlike that which centered ""Saving Private Ryan.""<br/><br/>This film, this ""Tae Guk Gi"" (translated as ""Brotherhood of War"") goes where no American film has yet dared, into the trenches and hills and valleys of a terribly gruesome war which the US would rather forget. But the war is not forgotten among Koreans, as this film deftly demonstrates.<br/><br/>The cinematography, the editing and the direction of ""Tae Guk Gi"" are superb. Location settings enliven the visual quality of the film. The editing, particularly during the battle scenes, is ingenious. Horrid images of war violence run rampant. In many scenes, such stomach-turning events as a soldier's face being blown off are presented. But the editing only allows the viewer to see such horrific gore for a fraction of a second. As a viewer, one does not see the beheaded body falling to the ground. These scenes are presented this way to allow viewers to see how the soldiers must have seen them. A soldier who is fighting may see a comrade get shot in the face, but he is not likely to approach the scene of the crime to dwell on it. He is more likely to move on, with the terrible images of such brutality left lingering at the edges of his mind, for he has his own life to defend and his own duty to attend. Only in retrospect can a soldier's mind recall such horrific scenes, and they are probably as sketchy and brief, however unsettling, as this film portrays. <br/><br/>""Tae Guk Gi"" roars with frighteningly graphic and gruesome images of war violence, including scenes of civilian slaughter. A bomb exploding from inside a booby-trapped dead body is one of the films most disturbing scenes. It is not for the squeamish. While the US lost about 50,000 troops in its so-called ""Forgotten War,"" millions of Koreans were killed in their brutal civil war. This film allows no one to forget that. And if the American audience of ""Saving Private Ryan"" can discover a sense of understanding about the incredible events of D-Day and the subsequent battles for Europe, the Korean audience of ""Tae Guk Gi"" can gain a sense of understanding about the realities of the terrible conflict which ended up defining their last two generations.<br/><br/>The film bursts with so many shocking moments of dialogue that it is nearly impossible to try to present any of it. I'll refer only to the scene when a soldier jumps up and announces, ""We're all alike! We're all alike!"" in a recognition of the lack of difference in the way both North and South Korean armies were treating prisoners and civilians. But the resonating phrase holds more than that. It speaks directly to the hope, held yet today, that the people of both nations are, indeed, alike enough to create one nation after all.<br/><br/>As for plot, Jin Tae finally earns a medal for his bravery during the South Korean battles against the Chinese in what is now North Korea. However, the prevailing suspicion of communists in the midst leads to an extremely tragic scene for Jin Tae, whose betrothed dies in his arms amidst scenes of thousands of falsely accused communists being shot down like unwanted pets.<br/><br/>Eventually, Jin Tae becomes lost to his brother and to the army, and he is suspected of defecting to the communists, bringing Jin Seok himself under suspicion. I will not reveal the payoff, in which it is finally revealed to Jin Seok precisely what happened to Jin Tae.<br/><br/>Brutal, horrific and realistic, this film was masterly crafted by writer/director Kang Je Gyu. Kudos go out to director of photography Hong Gyung Pyo and editor Park Gok Ji, without whose talents this film could have turned out to be a disaster. But it would be a greater disaster for anyone interested in quality film-making, especially films about war, and especially films about this so-called forgotten war, not to pay attention to this riveting, gritty, heart and gut wrenching film, written from the Korean perspective, about that country's most horrible modern tragedy."
"finalfantasy113929","10","4","5","14 November 2005"," Best Movie Ever
","This is one of the best movies ever. The plot is so well-drawn it moves the viewer so much. The part of Young-shin's death was very emotional and very touching. The reunion on the battlefield is one of the biggest climatic points in the movie. Each small detail is so presice to make this movie a masterpiece for the years to come. As a Korean-American, it really brings out the pain and suffering of war. I would watch this movie 50 times in a row if I could. Anyone who says this movie is unrealistic isn't understanding the point of this movie: war is wrong and has major impact on everyone. That is why this movie has been made. If this system allowed it, I would give this movie a 20 out of 10."
"nobbytatoes","8","4","5","13 October 2005"," excellent war drama
","Jin-tae and Jin-seok are brothers. Jin-seok is set college and carries the hope are dreams of his family. Jin-tae works fixing shoes, creating income to help support his brother. They had their lives plan until all hell breaks lose; North Korea declares war on South Korea. Jin-seok is drafted but Jin-tae volunteers to protect. Tae seeks to find any loop hole he can find get his brother out of the army. But when they both enter into the world of war, their bond of brotherhood is stretch beyond its limits.<br/><br/>At first you could be mistaken to think this is just another war movie, but this is so much more. Mixing in the drama of brotherhood raises this to higher levels. Though this still holds the universal themes of war movies. The effect on society, the physical effects of the soldiers and more importantly the mental and emotional effects any war can have. during the war the brothers change and they start to see other sides of each other, which ultimately they would rather not have seen. When one brother suffers from Stockholm syndrome, can the bonds of brotherhood survive any hurdle, or once broken is it unfix able.<br/><br/>Just like 'Saving private Ryan', Brotherhood of War is not ashamed of throwing you deep within the confines of the trenched and the no-mans land. Director Je-gyu Kang throws the violence right at you during the action, and doesn't relent till its over. But whats more powerful is the emotional drama. The end is such a tear jerker. If you cant handle heavy drama i recommend you have tissues ready.<br/><br/>If you love your war movies, this is a must see."
"the-shaman","9","4","5","21 September 2005"," What a gem of a movie
","What a gem of a movie, it's very rare that I'll watch a subtitled film but I'm so pleased I took the time for this one. There are no well-known actors, and you've probably never heard of the Director, the Yanks don't save the day (and then bore us to tears with a patriotic 10 minute speech), and it's about a war that has practically been ignored. What it is though is a moving tale of a family ripped apart by war, seen through the eyes of two brothers, and of one brothers' 50 year vigil waiting for the other to return home. The ending, without giving too much away was very poignant, how a pair of shoes, made but not finished, by a much loved brother, can carry so much emotion is just brilliant."
"csgtmaj9","10","4","5","27 August 2005"," I would recommend this movie, especially for those who were in the Korean War .
","I probably have a certain bias since I was an infantryman who fought and was severely wounded in the Koreas War. Those involved in the making of this movie are to be commended for their accuracy in following history as it was. However, I don't think Koreans would be mentioning ""TV"" in 1950. Also there was an excellent depiction of 1950s South Korea. I was somewhat dismayed when the first mention of Americans participating in the was was when it was stated that the Marines had arrived in Korea. Actually several US Army units were already engaged in fighting the invading North Koreans and fought alongside the South Korean Army. When I first heard of this movie I thought that it was certainly a movie made on the heroic stand of the 9th Republic of Korea (ROK) Division on White Horse Mountain. This was probably the most famous battle fought by the ROKs and certainly their biggest victory over the enemy (mainly Chinese forces). The 9th Division was renamed the ""White Horse"" Division.<br/><br/>Although many of the combat scenes may have been over extended it may have been my uneasiness in watching them (when it comes to killing I get the point real quick). All in all, the Korean staff that produced this movie done a first class job and who says we didn't win the war? One other thing I might add. Some commentators refer to Tae Guk Gi as an ""anti-war"" movie. I disagree. I will agree it depicts sheer horror and doesn't that describe any war?"
"Skipper-2","9","4","5","6 April 2005"," Quality filmography
","This film reaches boundaries but doesn't breach them. From Paths of Glory and Platoon to Saving Private Ryan, as well as John Ford and Sam Peckinpah to Oliver Stone, your attention is kept by memory. But as we all know copying is the greatest form of flattery, so watch this film with no reserve. It will meet your expectations. The acting of the two main characters is well done (pun appropriate) but for today's Korean cinema...perfecto (a bit exaggerated with no disrespect). Great fight scenes from the choreographer. Direction was not a concern as fans of Shiri will understand. I was especially surprised that at times it was bit tear jerking. Mifune would have been proud to have played a character in this well done epic."
"neo177117","9","4","5","23 October 2004"," Counter Comment to Disappointed Ones.
","Let me start this off with the fact that I'm a Korean who currently lives in US. I can't say that this movie was the best movie ever made. However, I can say that it is a good war movie. Yes, I understand that it has the same old feeling and narrative style that has been used before (i.e. Saving Private Ryan). I read some reviews of others and I was very disappointed at their knowledge of Korean War. The two of the most terrifying wars in recent history are Korean War and Vietnam War. Yes, more people have suffered from WW II. However, WW II soldiers didn't have to point the gun at themselves. Both Korean and Vietnam War, soldiers had to point the gun to themselves, killing their brothers and sisters in the mid-point of the Cold War conflict. What is more horrifying than battling for survival against your friends and family? In Tagukgi, it tries to display that pain of facing your own people. One review said that how is it possible that Jin-Tae became rambo without proper training. The movie shows a scene of ""untrained soldier"" accidental shooting his team on the heat of the bombing. It shows that they weren't trained. According to the history, Korean War broke out as an invasion on a Sunday morning. Many unwilling men were drafted and received almost no training because they needed reinforcements right away. Shoeshine boy Jin-Tae became ""rambo"" not because he had skills, but because of his courage and heart to send his brother back home. It is a proved fact that a man can out-performs his average limitations in a critical situation. And of course he had to have some luck to dodge all those bullets. (Come on, this is a movie!) See the history and the pain behind the movie. If you take that pain of the movie away from it, this is just a Saving Private Ryan rip off with some cheesy CGI effects and some bad acting. Overall it is a good movie."
"miclodee-1","10","5","7","9 February 2007"," Excellent!
","I truly believe that this is THE best war movie ever made, and also, it isn't an American controlled propaganda film like other war movies, such as Apocalypse and SPR. Not that I am saying that SPR isn't good, it is up there in the top ten also (for me). Brotherhood has an edge, it is more realistic and a moving piece of cinema.<br/><br/>Although the two movies, Brotherhood and SPR both start at the same place, in fact they start with al almost identical storyline. I believe that Brotherood takes the story line through a more exiting, thrilling heartwarming story about curage and love, about a family, two brothers torn apart by beliefs."
"johnkim1104","10","5","7","30 August 2006"," Great, Human & Korean: THE BEST Movie about the Korean War
","By the time I finished watching this movie the first time, I really cried my eyes out. This movie has beaten the record of ""Titanic"", the most successful Hollywood movie (worldwide) to date, in South Korea. This movie was that good, and that ""Korean"". <br/><br/>The Korean War ended in 1953 and there were a flux of Korean movies in memory of it recently. This was one of the leading movies where Jang Dong-Kun, the most popular Korean actor, starred (not as a war hero, but as an ""ordinary Korean"" during the War). I'd like to give the readers a little bit of historical background to better appreciate the movie. The followings are related to many scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>Beginning: The war broke out on the very early morning of June 25th (Sunday), 1950 without a declaration of war. Kim Il-Sung, the then North Korean leader broke so many people's heart and eventually divided the whole nation in two for more than 60 years (and counting). Many of those war generation people, my grandparents for example, are still wondering if their brothers and sisters are still alive on the other side of the borderline, praying for re-unification of the Korean peninsula. When the War broke out, nobody expected (much less, prepared) the North Korean forces would storm the South so aggressively; they took over more than 90% of the South within 3 months. Before the War there was no balance of the military power between the North and the South; while Kim Il-Sung had been raising his army under the supervision of Joseph Stalin, the South was mainly into economic development. For most South Korean people, a war between the North and the South, shortly after the liberation from the Japanese imperialists (resulted from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima & Nagasaki in August 1945), never crossed their minds. The South Korean government moved to Pusan (or Busan), a harbor city at the southernmost part of the peninsula. The last resistance line, and therefore the heaviest battle fields were around the Nakdong River, only two hours' drive from Pusan.<br/><br/>Middle: Then there was this general from the U.S., Douglas MacArthur, who came up with a brilliant plan to break into Inchon, the second largest harbor city of South Korea, which is only one hour away west from Seoul. That was September 28, 1950, three months from the breakout of the war. The so-called ""Inchon Landing Operation"" was extremely successful mainly because, this time, the North had never expected such a crazy plan; they had already taken over Inchon three months before. The aim of the operation was to cut the enemy's supply line, which it did, and the North Korean army fled back north while receiving heavy resistance from the South. They fell apart quickly, and the allied forces of the U.N. (including the U.S.) and South Korea almost reached the ""Abrok"" River (near the North Korea - China border) by the end of the same year. South Koreans clearly had a chance to take over the entire peninsula and establish a ""united"" democratic republic.<br/><br/>End of Disc 1: Then the Chinese forces intervened out of nowhere, again without a declaration of war. The Chinese and North Korean forces recaptured Seoul on January 4, 1951 (Koreans call it ""1.4 Retreat"") and since everything changed overnight. The Chinese forces used ""Oceans of People"" (or ""Human Wave Attack"") strategy, a tactic they used to repeat in their civil war (1946 - 1949) against Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists. In short, the Chinese soldiers greatly outnumbered the joint forces of the U.N. and South Korea. Many of the Chinese soldiers were actually not heavily armored - because of the very nature of the strategy the majority of the Chinese soldiers were only meant to be human shields or bullet wasters for the joint forces. Some historical records even indicate that the number of the Chinese forces was even larger than ""the number of the bullets"" that the South Korean and allied forces carried at many of the battlefields.<br/><br/>End of Disc 2: In this movie Jang Dong-Kun plays a very symbolic role representing the ideological dilemma and the emotional pain of Korean people during the War, which started as a civil war but soon escalated into a ""Third World War""; the Western Allied forces of 1.2 million fought against the equivalent number of communists, the Chinese forces alone being close to 800,000 (The Allied Forces consisted of the U.N. Forces with almost 20 countries including the U.S., the U.K., France, and others from as far away as South Africa). Obviously the War was another ideological power game between the U.S. and the Communists (the Soviet Union and China), but the Korean peninsula unfortunately happened to be their playground. <br/><br/>The last battle scene where Jang turns the heavy machine gun around (literally 180 degrees) and shoots his own ""North Korean comrades"" in order to protect his younger brother (Won Bin), a soldier from the South, reminds me of the movie ""Taepung"" where Jang (as ""Sin"") swore to kill all the South Koreans because of the tragedy that he and his sister suffered after the South Korean government rejected their family's request for asylum (because of the sensitive diplomatic relationship between China and South Korea in 1983). That last battle scene symbolizes the main theme of this movie that ""ideologies do not matter when it comes to families, brothers and sisters.""<br/><br/>This movie includes a number of controversial scenes including the one where the South Korean soldiers execute the North Korean POWs in retaliation of the communists' massacre of innocent Korean civilians. These days the South Korean filmmakers enjoy making controversial movies in which South Koreans or Americans are not always good guys (and North Koreans are often good guys or poor victims with no better choice), which reflects their artistic and political matureness.<br/><br/>A touching story, spectacular scenes, great music, excellent acting... this movie is a true masterpiece."

","Perfectly filmed action scenes. Tough realistic story of brotherhood. A history lesson for many of us. The filmmakers did make a very personal film.<br/><br/>""Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo"" has several intense war scenes (perfect cinematography) which just go on and on. They leave bloody under-taste in your mouth. No stupid intermissions, no mumble talks, no background humour - only blood, gore, pain, and broken lives.<br/><br/>Some say that the main characters are kept alive in an unnatural manner. Well, war is also unnatural and some fantastic things happen (during the bloody wars in the 20th century quite a lot of unbelievable but true stories of survival took place). As to the gay topic - come on, it is ridiculous. How can such thoughts strike a viewers mind? When a boy buys his younger brother an ice-cream - is it supposed to be gay-like behaviour? One should refer to ""Brokeback Mountain"" for such topics.<br/><br/>There were no tears in my eyes at the end of the movie but it did leave solid and strong impression.<br/><br/>One of the war masterpieces - 10 out of 10 (deep respect to Korea).

"solomania2005","10","5","7","19 February 2006"," Comment
","I saw this movie and I have to say, this is pretty damn good for a Korean movie. Prior to watching this one, I have hated Korean movies especially their war, horror, and, sci-fi movies because a lot of them were cheap, and low budget movies with corny special effects (although I do admire that those movies have tried to avoid use of CGIs). Tae Guk Gi is unlike any other Korean war movies. I have never, EVER seen anything like that in Korean films. It's the best Korean film I've ever seen in my life (all my friends who saw this movie would agree with me). I thought it was better than Pearl Habor (Sorry Michael Bay). And that's true. Although I would rate them the same for special effects, but Tae Guk Gi also has a better storyline (the love story in Pearl Harbor kind of makes me sick witch Ben Afflek, Kate Beckinsale, and Josh Hartnet.) The story is very interesting. First, it starts off in present day with the hero's brother looking at his remains then, it goes back in time to when he and his brother were younger. Then they're recruited by the army as the war begins. It's interesting how the story evolves as well as how the characters evolve with the storyline. I love the fact that there are a lot of twists and turns and a lot of surprises in the movie. It makes the movie interesting. The special effects were great too. I have never ever seen anything like those kinds of special effects in Korean movies, explosions, large battle sequences, airplanes...etc. If you are not interested in the storyline, at least you can be dazzled and still be entertained by the special effects (lol!). Anyway, I would highly recommend this movie to both Koreans and non-Koreans alike. It's big ""must-see""."

","""In the powerful tradition of Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers comes this box-office hit from Korea."" Don't let the opening comments on the back of the DVD case fool you; there's no comparing Tae Guk Gi to either of the aforementioned productions. Tae Guk Gi is far more potent and moving.<br/><br/>Tae Guk Gi is the story of two brothers who were drafted to fight in the Korean War. The plot centers on the relationship between the two, as well as the evolution of an individual under the conditions of war. Jin-tae, the older brother, has one focus in life: to make sure his younger and often sickly brother, Jin-seok, can further his education. Jin-seok is viewed as the future of their family and Jin-tae will do anything to ensure his brother's safety.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, of course, characters and motives change. People are torn apart, reunited, etc. Emotions run high and we're shown that bonds of blood and family can survive anything.<br/><br/>It sounds like your average war movie, and it probably would be if Tae Guk Gi wasn't so well-crafted. Everything from the cinematography to the execution of the plot itself is simply fantastic. As can be expected, the movie has its fair share of violence and bloodshed. However, it is done in as tasteful a manner as any war movie can be done. The director, Je-gyu Kang, does a fantastic job of showing the actions of both the North and South forces in fairly equal light- which is ironic considering that for one character, Jin-tae, the enemy is simply anyone who poses a threat to his family rather than an intruding army. And for anyone who is a twentieth-century history buff, the accurateness of army attitudes and events won't disappoint.<br/><br/>There isn't much else to say except that I highly recommend Tae Guk Gi to everyone- even people who aren't fond of war movies. I do have one warning, however: even the most cold-hearted bastard might need a box of tissues on hand. It normally takes something like divine action to make me cry and this movie had me sobbing like I would if I'd just watched my dogs get hit by a car."

","This was such a great movie, recommended by my brother no less, I was one out of two people in the cinema which was nice for me but a disgrace to British cinema goers, c'mon guys give a foreign film a chance!! I cried like there was a world ban on honey for the last fifteen minutes of the film, 'it's your little brother... answer me.' as he kisses the skeleton... sod an ancient Matt Damon at a pristine grave site, this movie pulled no punches, and plainly shows you war is truly hell. All the characters have flaws, and the ideology involved is not one sided or preachy, it really does allow you to observe the events rather than tell you how you should feel about them, where he blames his brother for the death of his fiancé, you clearly see both sides of the argument at the same time. Powerful stuff, culminating in the ultimate sacrifice, for the love of a brother and family."
"soldaten116","8","5","7","22 March 2005"," I gave it an 8 because...
","It had all the hallmarks of a foreign film. Overacting, soap opera storyline and cheesy ending.<br/><br/>I gave it an eight because despite the above, it was a fine depiction of the horror and violence of the Korean War. I like how it stuck with the Korean side and resisted the temptation to show Americans: A very risky move. Having more American involvement would have given it a broader appeal in the States. However the movie is well made enough that it could and did stand very well on it's own merits. The effects are the equals if not better (in some cases) than contemporary American movies. The cinematography is wonderful and the props are largely gear is authentic This is not a masterpiece. To see one of those, please view Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, The Winter War or Stalingrad. Some serious overacting and some cheesy scenes that have you reaching for the fast forward button, hold it back. Some of the scenes, I have to say, are down right painful to watch. Fortunately the movie does not dwell on those scenes and it moves along fast. For every cheese ball scene there are plenty of powerful and well-scripted scenes.<br/><br/>What this is, is, a very good representation of the brutality of the Korean War and how it was much more of a Civil War than a war between nations. It is a great ""anti-war"" film that has the ability to bring out very strong emotions despite some overacting and over the top melodrama. You hate both sides equally at different times and you are left with the keen sense of the utter futile waste that war is. For that, the movie deserves a well done/Bravo! It deserves an 8."
"dcdave1","10","5","7","7 September 2004"," Hollywood polish, but much better.
","This was far and away the best, the most powerful, the most moving war movie that I have ever seen, and I have seen quite a few of them. The only ones that come close are the great David Lean epics like Bridge on the River Kwai and Lawrence of Arabia. <br/><br/>Those critics who have compared the movie to Hollywood efforts like The Deer Hunter and Saving Private Ryan could not be farther off the mark. Tae Guk Gi is what war is really about; those movies were not. War is not about endless, irrelevant, pointless games of Russian roulette, and it is not about top brass going all touchy-feely at the expense of their mission because one family seems to have paid too high a price for the war. It is about simple young men being swept up into desperate situations that they had nothing to do with creating, about the horrors they face and the horrible choices that they are often forced to make, and about survival.<br/><br/>The Deer Hunter's characters all seemed too old and jaded for their roles. They were not at all like the typical American rifleman in Vietnam who averaged 19.5 years of age and typically could not have found Vietnam on a map if his life depended upon it. I didn't care about any of that movie's characters. They might have possessed the requisite ignorance, but not the innocence. The characters in Private Ryan were all cardboard, with the possible exception of the reprehensible sniveling coward.<br/><br/>Not only was Tae Guk Gi ten times more moving on account of its realism and its character development, but it was a movie with several important moral messages, messages about which one can reflect for a very long time. The Deer Hunter seemed to me to be simply a slow, dull movie about some Pennsylvania blue-collar types that had very little to do with the real Vietnam, not at all like the French movie Indochine, for instance. I couldn't see the point of it. The only message that I saw in Private Ryan was an extremely pernicious one, that is, that war crimes are fine if Americans commit them against Germans.<br/><br/>Remember the episode of the captured German who is released because the patrol is behind enemy lines and they can't take him with them. The choice is to kill him or let him go. He begs his way out of getting shot and they release him. He ends up killing the main American hero in a gun fight after he, the German, has rejoined his unit. He gets captured again, and the coward then summons the ""courage"" to shoot the disarmed man dead in revenge, even though they are no longer behind enemy lines. The audience is supposed to be happy at this act of vengeance and to regret that the Americans didn't kill the stinking German when they had the chance, when, in fact, the German has behaved honorably throughout and has done nothing to ""deserve"" his fate. A movie like Saving Private Ryan could easily override any lectures on the Geneva Convention that a young American soldier might get in boot camp.<br/><br/>War crimes also occur in Tae Guk Gi--on both sides--as they did in that nasty internecine conflict known as the Korean War, but the victims are made real and the audience recoils in horror. Chalk up one important positive message.<br/><br/>Tae Guk Gi is also very instructive, not just about war in general, but also about the Korean War in particular. It does an amazing job of outlining the history of the war and capturing it as Koreans experienced it from a number of different angles. It also provides great insight into the strong bonds in a traditional Confucian Korean household, the sense of obligation felt by the oldest son, and the sacrifices that a family might make to advance the anointed intellectual ""star"" of the family, a carry-over from the Chinese scholar-official system. <br/><br/>One aspect of this family system gets lost in translation. Throughout the movie, in the English subtitles, the two brothers address one another by their respective given names. In fact, in the spoken Korean the younger one always calls his brother by an honorific expression that means ""older brother."" The nearly illiterate shoemaker might be the intellectual inferior of the star student, but he is, and will always remain, ""older brother.""<br/><br/>This truly great movie deserves that kind of respect, and I think it will get it as time passes."
"bstrt2002","Null","5","7","3 September 2004"," a Masterpiece
","Obviously, this movie deserves a spot as one of best war movie ever made regardless popularity.<br/><br/>The budget to produce Tae Guk Gi is $13M while Saving Private Ryan spent $25M only on advertisement. W/ $13 M of the budget, they wouldn't hire any of Hollywood experts. But this movie really has a good quality, some of which are no shorter than Hollywood technique. <br/><br/>Obviously, this movie has one of most difficult story line to depict as a war movie. If it had been reviewed by Hollywood movie writer, there should have been many revision as it would be very unusual to its standard. If you recall ""Saving Private Ryan"", there is no strong character development as movie progresses. The main characters have very simple rock-solid heroic image, which entertains audience and is directly related to success of the movie. Two main characters in TaeGukGi have dynamics transit among every possible role as movie progresses. In many cases, these types of rapid changes in character image can cause much of confusion to audience who especially not familiar with supporting background. It would specially cause a big confusion to those (western viewer) who called the Korean war as forgotten war. In fact, Korean war was never a forgotten war to Korean, which makes this movie simplify many supporting scene. and western viewer need more background to fully understand.<br/><br/>1 out 3 Korean( including those in elementary school who can't see this movie) in South Korea saw this movie. However, to a surprise, the critics and grade of this movie by South Koreans is not too high ( 8/10) compared to other true Hollywood blockbusters. The historic value of this movie is not so significant to Koreans but only a lot to those who calls it the forgotten war. Then what is it? It is obviously emotional value of this movie, which most Western view will think melodramatic. Brotherhood is very common and important virtue to Korean Family. It is very common for older brother to take care of his younger by his sacrifice. Choosing brotherhood to describe Korean War is more than extraordinary.(Obviously, there is not much of relation with ""Saving Private Ryan"" as ""saving private lee"" is based on completely different value system.) The brotherhood has very strong symbolic depiction of North and South Korea. Melodramatic appeal on this movie is also perfect as it is more realistic to Korean who went through horrible civil war 50 years ago. If American Civil War happened only 50 year ago, then many of civil-war Hollywood movie would use melodramatic appeal as the audience or society can digest as the very reality.<br/><br/>Another big value of this movie is Korean War movie made by Korean. Maybe if compared to Vietnam war, which is easier for many people to understand, think about Vietnam war made by Vietnamese not by American. To eye of Vietnamese, the platoon would be a just stupid-Americanized movie far from the reality...(don't get me wrong, it is a great war movie!).<br/><br/>Overall, TaeGukGi won't be a blockbuster outside of Korea even this movie is one of masterpieces in war movie class and many will talk about years after years. However, if Korean war wasn't the forgotten war to the rest of world, then without a doubt, it would be international blockbuster.<br/><br/>PS There are about 5 Million Koreans died out of 20 Million.<br/><br/>There were more bombs used in this forgotten war than in whole WW II.<br/><br/>When Chinese invaded, they said, ""There were more Chinese soldiers than the number of bullets S Korean or UN have""<br/><br/>J from DC"

","Brutal, unflinching & absolutely devastating, Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War tells the story of two brothers who are forced to join the army to fight in the front at the outbreak of the Korean War. The film puts up a gruesome display of combat on the screen while also capturing the deterioration of these siblings' relationship as the film progresses which ends with a heartbreaking conclusion.<br/><br/>Superbly directed, especially the battle scenes, the film is unforgiving in its depiction of the horrors of war and presents it with supreme quality.

This movie focuses on two brothers that gets forced into fighting a war against the North Koreans. I am not sure if this is based on a true story of a certain survivor. But the direction this goes makes it believable that it could have happened. It's the director's first war movie so some flaws can be understandable, but the cinematography is very choppy at times to the point it can get annoying to watch sometimes. And not choppy in a way where it brings out the chaos of war but it just seemed choppy without adding certain elements that make shaky cam work SOMETIMES. But overall the battle scenes are well shot with the low budget they had for a movie of this kinda scale. The two main protagonist and brothers in this movie is played by Jang Dong-Gun who is the older bro and the younger bro is played by Won Bin. Who are two very popular actors in Korea and they fit the role very well and believable as brothers. Lee Eun-Ju is also in this and she was good as the fiancé to Jang Dong-Gun's character and was good at showing her sorrows and desperation. It's a shame how a pretty actress like her decided to commit suicide. Overall if your in the mood for a war movie that is well crafted, this is one I can recommend.<br/><br/>9/10"

The younger, Jin-seok, is the pride of his family, a peaceful, quiet student. His older brother, Jin-tae, has a good heart but a more fiery temper and is willing go to any length to protect Jin-seok and send him on his way home as soon as possible. The trials that this war inflicts on both men will transform each of them in different ways.<br/><br/>This above would be Tae Guk Gi in a nutshell, although the film covers a lot of ground and is quite epic in its scale. Many reviewers have mentioned the influence Saving Private Ryan may have had on this movie and although I this this has been exaggerated, I can understand where they are coming from. The battle scenes do seem to borrow stylistically from SVP. They are quite intense, very big yet intensely up close and personal at times. They plunge the viewers right in the middle of all this chaos and can be quite gruesome. There are quite a few battles throughout the movie, and they unfortunately make less of an impact as time goes by due to some repetitiveness.<br/><br/>Having said that, despite the epic scale and quite a few characters being depicted, the bulk of Tae Guk Gi focuses on the two brothers and how war affects them. It is here that the movie scores its better points but also where it fails at times. The changes they both go through are well depicted but unfortunately, from beginning to end the movie is wrapped in melodramatic overtones that make for an awkward viewing at times. Cheesy dialog, overacting and a downright silly score that accentuates it all are all part of the experience.<br/><br/>The movie is nonetheless an intense experience, features likable if flawed protagonists. The characters surrounding them are also interesting and you wish you got to know some of them a little better. The movie gets props for portraying evils done by both sides during a conflict. Around the midway point of the movie, things start becoming interesting as it becomes evident nothing is black and white in war but unfortunately, the script doesn't make the best of this.<br/><br/>This is a recommended war movie as well as a fine film on blood ties and how they cope when everything is on the line."

"BureauCat","9","2","2","19 February 2008"," To make this a hit with USA audiences
","This is a very moving film, and unlike most war movies, it illustrates the amount of incompetence, along with sheer evil, that takes place during war. I give it a 9.<br/><br/>To make this a hit with audiences in the USA (and presumably in other countries aside from Korea, the distributors should do several things.<br/><br/>(1) They should coordinate the subtitles with the English soundtrack. The subtitles seriously disagree with the English soundtrack. Of the two, the English soundtrack seems to be far better than the subtitles, which sound a lot like manga captions or video game text.<br/><br/>(2) In one way or another, they should provide some historical background. The Korean War went back and forth to a greater degree than any war I have ever read about (and I've read about hundreds). That makes the film seem more disjointed and disoriented than it is. * Precede the film with a two-minute feature showing a map of Korea, and explain the stages of the war; or * Put up some title cards at the appropriate points, saying things like, ""This is when the US came into the war, and the tide of war turned completely"" * Enclose some liner notes including maps with the DVDs.<br/><br/>The time-line that the explanation should explain:<br/><br/>(i) The 38th Parallel. North Korea invades pm 6/25/50 to try to reunify Korea under its Communist regime.<br/><br/>(ii) No American or UN forces were in South Korea, and the ROK (Republic of Korea) lost 80% of its territory, to the Pusan Perimeter.<br/><br/>(iii) US forces crossed from Japan and invaded at Inchon. The North Koreans lost 90% of THEIR territory.<br/><br/>(iv) China became afraid that the US forces were going to cross the Yalu River, right into China, so China invaded with massive forces and drove the ROK and US forces all the way south again.<br/><br/>(v) The US/UN/NATO forces regrouped, built up forces, and pushed north to near the 38th Parallel. This time, they stopped, and there was stalemate, and eventually cease-fire.<br/><br/>Other things for it to explain: * When each side captured an area, they ruthlessly purged it of collaborators, probably including people who were denounced by their neighbors for ulterior purposes (e.g., someone just didn't like the neighbor, or wanted to take over their house, so they'd make an accusation and get the neighbor killed) * When each side left an area, they tried to leave nothing behind but a wasteland<br/><br/>The poor civilians were over-run again and again, and treated ruthlessly each time. Between over-runs, they'd starve because the troops would sweep up all the available food.<br/><br/>As far as I could tell, the film only shows ROK and North Korean forces, never US/UN or Chinese forces. It might be good to explain that, also, because sometimes it's hard to tell the sides apart.<br/><br/>Finally, the scenes of hundreds of planes passing over are cheesy, and from what I've read, inaccurate.

","A delicate and detailed description of common people's plight and fate in war-time: shattered dreams, separated family, hopelessness, fight for the loved ones that people can never forget, especially Koreans. In actuality, the Lee brothers exist in every war-torn country throughout the entire human history: ordinary people with dreams about their future and without much sense to political or national matters, yet they are dragged into turmoil and dilemma with Hobson's choice. Many in Iraq now.<br/><br/>Does Jin-tae know or care about the differences between the communists and the democrats? Negative. What he cares about is the safety of his more talented younger brother Jin-seok (sending him back to war-free zone), his family and his fiancée. ""Is that for the country or your brother?"" he was tongue-tied to this question about his fearless fights in the battlefields.<br/><br/>The forever truth is that besides people with power, no one else cares about or wants to have war, neither internal nor external ones. And, at that precious and long-gone ""age of innocence"", we did have many brothers like Jin-tae Lee and Jin-seok Lee, in reality, the German Sophie Scholl and Hans Scholl is one of the versions of less violence.

"imxo","7","3","4","1 June 2008"," TAE GUK GI: The Yin and Yang of Movie-making
","TAE GUK GI: The Brotherhood of War contains not only some of the most effective images of war over filmed, but also some of the most stereotypical elements of movie-making.<br/><br/>First, the positive elements in this film. The scenes of combat are absolutely extraordinary. This is not your typical Hollywood sanitization of mutilation, death, and destruction. In this film the flesh and bone explode, metal fragments rip to pieces anything they touch, and dirt and rock fragments cover and lacerate everyone and everything. The realism of these scenes is astonishing.<br/><br/>It is also unique that the film depicts the horrors that both sides perpetrate on each other; both the North Koreans and South Koreans execute even their own civilians. Men, women, (and maybe children, too) are summarily murdered for politics, even if those politics were forced upon the populace by the enemy. This is total war between political ideologies; war without mercy. I can almost guarantee that this film could not have been made in South Korea during the years of the Pak Chung Hee dictatorship of the 1970's.<br/><br/>This film also portrays the heroism and fear of the infantry soldiers who must run into a storm of fire, metal, and explosive death, sometimes willingly, but often because their own officers and sergeants will kill them if they don't. This may be the Korean War of the 1950's, but it could just as easily have been the trench warfare of World War I. Just as bad, the film reveals that the military on both sides sanctions, tolerates, and even encourages the brutalization and murder of Prisoners of War, civilian hostages, and just ordinary people. (Sound familiar? Ever hear of someone on the winning side of a war ever being charged with a war crime? It wasn't likely then and, as we know, it isn't likely now.) <br/><br/>However, in contrast to the stunning battle scenes and the film's exposure of the horrors of war, the film also contains some really lackluster elements, especially in the musical score. The music is just Hollywood-style, manipulative, tearjerker stuff. The movie would have benefited from less music and by music that was more subdued and transparent. The movie also suffers from - at least to my western eyes - a soap opera quality in the relationship between the two brothers who are the main protagonists of the film. In the first place, I think the actor Won Bin was too ""mature"" (in his mid-20's or so) to play the 18-year old schoolboy younger brother. This is somewhat mitigated later in the film, as the horrors of war tend to age everyone involved. Secondly, there was too much speechifying between the brothers. Every one of their meetings seemed too dramatic, if not histrionic. Toward the end of the movie the histrionics bled over from the merely verbal and spread into the previously excellent action scenes. There seemed to be a palpable shift from the very plausible to the rather unlikely.<br/><br/>All in all, though, this is a very worthwhile film. It's eye-opening about war, provides insights into brutality that many of the powers that be would rather we not have, and evokes in us feelings of anger and sadness. This Korean-made film is a very fine effort."

","There have been many epic war films Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, Letters to Iwo Jima Paths of Glory and Full Metal Jacket to name the top. This however with much thought and analyzed breakdown I would probably crown over the rest.<br/><br/>Sure Apocalypse Now was brilliant in showing the insanity extremities of Vietnam war veterans. Saving Private Ryan played out world war II like a all star with Tom Hanks leading the cast and Steven Spielberg working his wand. Platoon will always have that gripping moment when William Dafoe was running out of the jungle as they where taking off with the helicopter. Letters to Iwo Jima gave us a glimpse of the harsh view of the Japanese soldiers as well as the epic loose hand grenade scene. Paths to Glory and Full Metal Jacket by Stanley Kubrick will always stay in our hearts as the movies that changed our vision of war films during that era. Paths of Glory showing us the tracking trench camera scene and Full Metal Jackets treatment of our beloved Sergeant.<br/><br/>All scenarios of epic war films and now we have one more to add to the stockpile this epic Korean film about a tale of two brothers. I haven't cried for quite sometime but after watching Tae Guk Gi I couldn't help but shed a tear. It is emotionally gripping, makes you sit up if your lying down kind of movie that has not been done in awhile.<br/><br/>Although this is a war movie at near perfection just short of the crown when it comes up against Shindlers list it has been a highly underrated film. I cannot emphasize the necessity of why people should watch this film if they love movies. The turret scene near the end had you counting every single bullet to the sweet orchestrated music. Strong, Powerful view of war and its tragedies this film like Old boy makes a mockery of the American film industry.<br/><br/>After watching this I believe there should never be another epic war movie we have to many.

Tae Guk Gi very well demonstrates what awful thing the war is, and the importance/and the unbreakable bond between family.<br/><br/>The last part, in particular, is definitely a punch (Although it may be easily predictable for those that are keen in guessing the plot) I would have given this movie a 10/10 if it weren't for some obvious CG graphics of Corsair at the end. Besides that and the kind-of obvious ending (yes, I am a HUGE fan of unexpected endings), it's a FANTASTIC, well made movie that easily surpasses some of those cheesy money-drenched Hollywood movies.<br/><br/>DEFINITELY worths watching.

","""Tae Guk Gi"" (Korean, 2005): Set in 1950 South Korea, as the war begins between their North and the South, we follow two brothers  and best friends  who are ""drafted"" into the Army, and forced into lives they never expected or wanted. This is a dense, draining, monumental Epic of a story about love, hate, honor, violence, context, and forgiveness. GREAT War films are never about war they are about humans facing extraordinary circumstances, and having to deal with them one split second at a time. The acting, lead by Jang Doug-Gun and Won Bin, is superb. The photography reminded me of the gritty hyper-reality of ""Black Hawk Down"". The scoring sweeps over some scenes - sometimes like an immense Vulture, sometimes like an Angel. This is a very violent film, but never gratuitous. 148 minutes. In Korea, ""Tae Guk Gi"" (""The Brotherhood of War"") won Best Picture, Best Cinematography, Best Art Design, and Best Sound Effects."

","This movie gives a historical and very human account of the Korean war. I am no expert on this (or any) war and so found some details difficult to follow. I am, however, a big fan of War films. This annoys my girlfriend no end but, she enjoyed this one as much as me.<br/><br/>The human side is represented by the story of two brothers who are drafted to fight for the south. The personalities of these two are very different even though they are family. As a result, the effect that the war has on each one is very different. Despite the differences that grow between them they remain dedicated to protecting one another.<br/><br/>The gruesomeness that other comments have slated was something I rejoiced in. Not because I enjoy seeing blood and guts but, because I hate when realism is glossed over for the sake of mass appeal. It is true that not everything in the film was realistic but it beats a Hollywood blockbuster hands down.<br/><br/>Be warned that you'll need over 2 hours to spare but it is very engaging once it gets going. Highly recommended!!!"

Pushed hard, South Korean forces conscript every available young man, and that's how Jin-tae ends up on a train to the front. Jin-tae, still a student, and the hope of his family, is very close with his big brother, Jin-seok. And when Jin-seok can't break Jin-tae free, he might as well join the army and look after his little brother. Together, they face the horrors of war. But Jin-seok, told that if he perform tasks of bravery, and beyond the call of duty, might ask the commanders to send his brother home. With that in mind, Jin-seok, rushes into mission after mission, soon becoming somewhat of a hero. But war changes men, and Jin-tae aren't sure he likes what his brother is turning into.<br/><br/>Comments: A statement about war. It isn't pretty, in fact it is full of horrors. This movie seems to take the responsibility to depict the war truthfully seriously, hence there are a lot of unpleasant scenes. The backdrop of the Korean war is interesting, though a little confusing sometimes, if you don't keep up when the tide is changing. But it is the story, the connection between the two brothers, that add the sparkles to this movie. The cast do a great job, and the movie had me captured from beginning to end. Though, if you're no fan of war-movies or dislikes pictures of blood and gore, you should probably avoid this. But if you do like war-movies (and don't mind the blood that much) this is a movie well worth seeing.<br/><br/>It did remind me a little of We were soldiers with Mel Gibson.

","Not perfect, due to specific melodramatic moments (sepia-hued flash-backs of better days and sharing an ice lolly with bro), a lack of subtlety (almost operatic with some seriously hammered-home political statements)and grandiose score (bombastic and sweeping with violins which wail in homage to Saving Ryans Privates), but compelling viewing nonetheless. Stunning and horrifically violent battle scenes with an epic scale the likes of which aren't even matched by recent, and obvious, Hollywood epics.

This movie has all that anyone who like war movies, plenty of action and great special effects, the acting is great. It is a very moving movie and you will be glued to your seat. It is similar to The Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan in quality and I don't think Steven Spielberg could have done a better job. The movie is true to what it was like during the Korean war as my father fought there under the United Nations. What you see was what really happened but I do not know if this a true story about this family as I cannot read the Koreen language. Yes the movie is not in English which is a great pity as it will put a lot of people off who can't or don't like reading subtitles but I have always preferred to watch movies in their original language as long a the have the sub-titles.

","As I had posted at the Armchair General Forums (www.armchairgeneral.com): Now I know someone had a thread on this but I can't find it. If you come across this movie at the Video Store (My local Family Video didn't have it but the Hollwood did) I suggest you rent it. It is very very powerful. Its an excellent insight to the South Korean side of the conflict. Its a bear of a movie though at almost 3 hours but considering it goes from civilian life to the Pusan Perimeter, up to the invasion of Pyonyang, and then farther North and then the Chinese counter-attack, it makes sense. Some of the action may seem a bit over the top but its mainly for a reason thats proving a point about one of the characters. But, the battle scenes in my opinion make SPR, BoB and even Full Metal Jacket pale in comparison, the wounds stick into your mind really easily since it isn't a quick glimpse and the mêlées are chaotic and absolutely hideous (in appearance). It raised the question how men can almost get into a possessed fervor like that and kill each other with bare hands or rocks, or bayonets. I HIGHLY recommend it and honestly I can tell you it had me emotionally wrecked at the end. But then again I lost it when I finished Band of Brothers the book. A bit too emphatic towards the experience of war I guess. (Too much reading)<br/><br/>The acting is phenomenal and puts an excellent human side to the conflict, even listening to the movie in Korean.

"huuphu-nguyen","10","4","6","27 July 2006"," The mixture of good script and acting..Brilliant exposition of Korean tragedy.
","The focal point of the film is the development of brotherhood between Jin-tae and Jin-seok. The two brothers were played by Giang-Dong Gun as Jin-tae and Won Bin as Jin-seok. They began as two innocent suburb boys, and ended up in two rival soldiers.<br/><br/>What i most impressed by the film is the argument of the director on brotherhood. During the movie, Jin-tae - the elder brother, had acted consistently in the name of brotherhood. The brotherhood gave him the order to protect his younger brother - easy to understand for asians as the eldest brother inherited the role of decease father. The order brought him bravery and triumphs in battle, that eventually even awarded him the Medal of Honor which enabled him to send his younger brother home. But it costed his own soul. Jin-seok even denied him as his brother when witnessed the bloodthirsty animal within Jin-tae. However, their brotherhood was something unchangeable under any circumstances. Jin-tae was a hero of South Korea army, then, turned into the hero of its very opposite - the North army. Jin-seok was a South soldier, then, a surrender to the North army. They changed their position in the war quite rapidly without thinking of the war itself, but of their brotherhood. Their inner sense of brotherhood made Jin-tae feel not guilty when killing people both South and North soldiers; made Jin-seok unashamedly fight back and even betray his own army. This sense seemed to be driven both by instinct as expressed by Jin-tae and by sensation as expressed by Jin-seok. At the end of the movie, both motivations get its peaks - both Jin-tae and Jin-seok got mad when facing each other in their own fight. The moment when they nearly killed each other, the brotherhood woke up and brought them desire to get out of the war. It was like a tragedy that they tried their best to escape. Jin-tae even thought of surrender and fired against his own men, Jin-seok retreated to the South with a naive hope to reunite with his brother. Indeed, they was lost in their own thought of brotherhood, of reunion, of family and of post-war life. Though both brother fought bravely in the war, none of brothers ever talked of the war, its motivation or its end. The war did not bring them anything good, but the lost of brotherhood, the first time is the spiritual lost when Jin-tae exchanged his human soul for Medal of Honor of the South army, and the second time, the physical lost when Jin-tae passed away by the North bullets. It is the Korean tragedy. By emphasizing on their actions in vain to retain their brotherhood, the director made us understand of Korean struggle to regain the brotherhood at large again; as well as a dream that it will come, at the end."
"liviutzu822003","10","4","6","1 July 2006"," far better than Saving Private Ryan...
","I just saw this movie and , believe me, it proved that could exceed everyone's expectations; I know that last years south korean movies were worldwide recognized and many times acclaimed, but even so ,this one was a pleasant surprise. I don't know much about the historical conformity, but the story is fluent and not too predictable , the action and the tension is growing gradually and the director knew how to concentrate a lot of viewers attention and emotional participation at the end of the movie. Everyone will be touched, in the way that sequences like Schindler's List end could touch. In my opinion, it is far better than multiple awarded Saving Private Ryan, that I really liked , but which seems now over-appreciated and commercial after I saw Brotherhood...I don't know why, but as I watch it, it reminded me about Spielberg's war-flick . The both leading actors can show us what an excellent performance means during the entire movie, both in emotional parts and in action sequences - by the way, also excellent directed, more than you can expect from a movie without Hollywood's money. I watched an original copy and I think that dubbing would spoil a lot of this wonderful movie - try not to be lazy and watch it with subtitles and original dialogs in korean, it will worth it. And in general, , a good movie does not deserve to be dubbed... Worth every minute spend to watch."
"JoeytheBrit","Null","4","7","23 May 2008"," Good and Bad
","As others have duly noted  and it's a point I'll try not to belabour  Brotherhood is clearly influenced by Saving Private Ryan and, while at times its ferocious battle scenes surpass even the equivalent scenes that shocked us all so much back in '98, overall I don't believe Je-gyu Kang has succeeded in the way that Spielberg did.<br/><br/>Brotherhood is really two films in one. Separate the battle scenes from everything else and you have one very good film and one very bad. The brothers' everyday life prior to being essentially press-ganged into the South Korean army is shamefully over-sentimentalised, and the overwrought departure scene in which their mother tearfully chases their train as they head for battle is something that even Griffith might have though twice about back in 1916.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are powerful stuff though, planting the viewer right in the thick of the action and creating a violently deranged landscape that reeks with the stench of spilled guts, blood, severed limbs and gunpowder. That one brother can repeatedly skip unharmed past a heavy barrage of bombs, guns and bayonets<br/><br/>in his pursuit of the medal of honour he believes will return his brother to the safety of their mother's bosom is just one of a number of inconsistencies that we have to swallow in the midst of these insane conflicts.<br/><br/>Although they are good, the battle scenes number too many so that, despite their rawness, a kind of insensitivity begins to set in. Everything  even the most incredible  becomes ordinary if you're exposed to it too often, and that's what happens here. As a result, the story has to fall back on the (weaker) strand of the decaying relationship between the two brothers and, at times, the conversations between them descend into overwrought melodrama. In this respect, it's difficult to understand who would be entirely satisfied with what we have here (although its rating on this site suggests most would disagree): fans of bloody war films will be dismayed by the regular injections of sentimentality and overwrought emotion while those looking for some depth to the brothers' relationship and the stresses placed upon it by the extremest of situations will also come away feeling short-changed."

","My summary (above) isn't meant to trivialize this beautiful film, but it was the first thing that came to mind.<br/><br/>I remember two things only about SAVING PRIVATE RYAN -- the opening beach assault and the tank sequence. The bracketing story was undone by its false sentimentality.<br/><br/>TAEGUKGI, which follows the basic structure of RYAN, uses RYAN's failings as a lesson and is a superior film for it.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are adroitly staged, but this Korean epic stands out because it places its personal drama in the foreground and makes that drama constantly interesting.<br/><br/>Two brothers are drafted as the South's conflict with the North escalates into combat. One brother volunteers for suicide missions in order to win the Medal of Honor and get his younger brother discharged. Out of this premise the drama unfolds.<br/><br/>The poetry and chaos of Mallick's THIN RED LINE is also referenced here.<br/><br/>The combat is bloody and realistic and the hand-to-hand conflict is a refreshing focus for a movie of this scale.<br/><br/>Performances all 'round are above-par, the score is reminiscent of American epics and the cinematography is terrific.<br/><br/>Pretty much flawless cinema.<br/><br/>Only the initial scenes of the brothers in their pre-war life feel a little forced and oversentimental. They reminded me of early sequences from John Woo's masterful BULLET IN THE HEAD.<br/><br/>That film, of course, fell apart in the last ten minutes with its out of context car chase. This film commits no such sin.<br/><br/>It is amazing."

","Inspired by the high rating (8.5 at the time of writing) and some rather enthusiastic user comments, I went on to see this movie.

Apart from some splatter, realism is clearly not a priority. I would have expected to see some UN forces, but that didn't seem to be covered by the budget. The plot skips forward jerkily.<br/><br/>Consider this a South Korean movie about a conflict that's still not resolved.

If you are expecting a realistic depiction of the Korean War, you will probably be disappointed by Taegukgi. <br/><br/>From the 8.2 rating is seems that some people really enjoy this movie, so I better explain myself. The movie is competent technically, and the fighting scenes are well done. But the story is where it falls short. If you are used to more realistic war movies such as ""A Bridge Too Far"", then Taegukgi will appear cartoonish and contrived. I am not a soldier, but I really can't image that people will fight like that in a war."

","This is not only the best movie of the year but easily one of the best war movies ever done in history of cinema until today and beats most modern Hollywood productions.<br/><br/>This movie simply incarnates everything war is about and it perfectly shows the madness of the Korean war and even its impact on modern life in Korea. The film is about being separated from family, saving someone you love at all costs, getting used and abused by political propaganda, going through changes and identity crisis, fighting for your life on a blood-red battlefield, seeking for peace and vengeance, meandering between madness and relief.<br/><br/>The acting of this movie is absolutely outstanding from the two gripping and profound main characters over their desperate family members to the cynical politicians and soldiers. Don't even try to find one, there is no bad actor in here and every actor or actress delivers one if not the best job of his or her career on here.<br/><br/>The movie is perfectly filmed and features impressive fighting scenes with realistic special effects, stunning landscapes and outstanding choreographies with dark or vivid colour and light effects. The scene with the slayed bodies in an abandoned North Korean village, the fighting scenes between prisoners in a bloody and inhuman game, the assassination of the so-called traitors, the arrival of the hordes of Chinese soldiers on the battlefield and the final battle of the movie are only a few breathtaking examples for the high quality filming.<br/><br/>The story is as hectic, twisted and unbelievable as the whole madness of war and features many ups and downs, many gripping changes and a few little twists. Some people might find this aspect a little bit exaggerated but I think the opposite as it perfectly portrays the extreme feelings everybody is going through in wartime.<br/><br/>At the end, this movie is also highly emotional. In the end of the film, I just couldn't help and was about to cry because the whole story is an emotional drama of a rare high quality. The final scenes where you see one of the characters as an old man who learns the truth about the past is one of the most touching movie scenes I have seen in quite a while.<br/><br/>If you care about war movies, this one has to be your new bible and you should watch this at all costs as it easily beats all modern Western war movie productions that appear pathetic, repetitive and superficial next to this masterpiece. This film should get more international recognition and should be used in any school of the world to show children the true madness of war. This is a work for the ages, so don't hesitate to check this out. I might watch this movie at least once a year and will probably never get tired of it which speaks volumes for the movie's impact on me and many people seem to feel exactly the same. Trust the highly favorable ratings by critics and fans and don't miss the chance to watch this film."

There were couple of scenes which seemed staged or pretentious, even though this is a movie - other war movies have this natural, continuous flow, but this movie's abrupt, condensed, etc. between fighting scenes.<br/><br/>There's this scene where the S Koreans captured a city, & at that exact celebratory moment, American planes fill the sky & make booming noises, etc. while people cheer. I mean, doesn't this sound fake? At the radio's comment on U.S.'s aid for S. Korea, S. Koreans begin to make a celebratory cheer & pat each other & laugh... This shouldn't be a news for them. They knew that U.S. would help them from the first place.<br/><br/>They should be more creative in making battle scenes. Just men bayonetting each other to death is kind of boring. I don' think the planes used in the movie are historically accurate. Where did the jet planes go? Other than several cruel scenes, I really loved the romantic & philosophical part of the movie (not romance), like brotherhood, friendship, justice of war, etc.<br/><br/>Again, a lot of things were coincidental & just practically impossible, like the two brothers meeting each other again."

","Jin-tae and his younger brother Jin-seok both look after their mother and Jin-tae's wife, with the former shining shoes to support them. However when North Korea attacks the South, the Government calls up all available men to join the war. In a sweep of the town square, Jin-seok is taken by the army. On his return to the square, Jin-tae boards the train to try and get his brother off but only succeeds in both of them being taken to the front. Jin-tae appeals to the commanding officer to send his younger brother home and, in doing so, learns that others have won the right for send another home by performing heroically and beyond the call of duty. Jin-tae decides to win his brother's freedom.<br/><br/>Having seen Swiri a few years ago I was already aware that Je-gyu Kang was good at taking Hollywood influences and using them within his Korean films. In this case his influence is clear and, as many others have noted is Saving Private Ryan. In both the scale of the battle scenes and in the narrative revolving around a more personal, small-scale story of brothers the film does seem to have been inspired by this Hollywood film. Others have compared it ad nauseam, seemingly without the ability to view this film on its own terms, so I will try to avoid doing the same. As its own film it is both impressive and deeply flawed. The impressive elements come in the intense battle sequences which are convincingly chaotic and filled with death. Kang has done very well to pull them off .<br/><br/>Ironically the weakest part of the narrative also manifests itself in the battle sequences  specifically where Jin-tae seems so invincible throughout. I know this is the point of the film but the regularity in which he survives the most intense battles and closest combat is a bit distracting. Despite this the narrative still deals with the two brothers well, seeing both of them change across the duration of the war, with the brutality and death taking its toll on them both. This is well brought out by Jang and Won, both of whom are engaging in their characters and deal with the changes well. The support cast round out the unit well and add to an ensemble feel as well as giving emotional attachments beyond the lead two.<br/><br/>Overall then, a solid and engaging war drama. The plot asks us to accept Jin-tae's invincibility to the point that it is not always easy to swallow, but aside from this the story works pretty well. The battle scenes are difficult to follow and the violence comes so quickly that it is hard to follow but then that is the point  for the action to be overwhelming and confusing. Not as strong as it needed to be on the story level but still an engaging war movie that will be of interest to those who liked (if that's the word) Saving Private Ryan."

This film in Italy has not had much publicity and one of the things that struck me was the spectacle of the fighting comparable to that of the great American films d war. The love between two brothers sowing hatred but many times the war brutalizes the man in fact one of the two brothers is concerned by the monstrosity of war while the other remains Qasi immune. An anti-film par excellence, this shows that there are not only great films of American origin but that other nations are capable of producing excellent blockbuster.

","I will say that this is one of the most inspiring movies that I have ever seen. Granted it was all in Subtitles, and I watched it on a tour bus while visiting the JSA in the DMZ. I was simply dazzled by the music and theme. The Korean War is a sad tragedy that continues through today. It was a great movie that showed such a deeper insight on what happened. To think that it still can happen even today makes me sad, and depressed. Visiting the DMZ and seeing just who I might fight one day was totally surreal, but it has ever so more made more determined to stay the course with these wonderful South Koreans. They have so much to sacrifice, and loose. I wish only the dictator up north would come to his senses and open the DMZ, and call an end to all hostilities. But that is a dream that unfortunately will never be realized for years. I pray for the citizens of North Korea, and hope that one day they too will see true freedom. One day they will sign a peace treaty. I only hope that it can be in my lifetime. This is the 2d time now that I've been stationed here. Both times during the current nuclear situation. I proudly stand shoulder to shoulder with my South Korean Brothers everyday. We have just as much to loose as they do. Great Movie, and I suggest all see it."

","Even if some of Brotherhood is lost in translation it remains a quite astonishing piece of work. Pulling no punches in its depiction of war's many destructive facets the film explores humanity and inhumanity in equal measure, blurring the two in many scenes as characters take paths with unforeseen consequences and, as in all wars, casualties. Of particular note are the battle scenes, as graphic as they are. For several minutes at a time the action becomes almost impossible to follow, death and chaos reign on screen accompanied by a battleground cacophony. Although I have never been involved in trench warfare it certainly looked and felt as horrific, brutal and unglamourous as I believe it to be. After two and a half hours I was just about emotionally exhausted when the scene we all knew was coming - the grandfather at the graveside - just about finished me off. Outstanding."
"d3f1anc3","10","2","3","2 September 2005"," Quite possibly the best movie I've ever seen.
","It is possible my review / comments has spoilers in it, you've been warned.<br/><br/>I just got done watching this film, and I felt the need to tell other people how incredible it is. This is the most gripping, intense, touching, and real war film I've ever seen, and for that matter, probably the best film I've ever seen. I was drawn in from the start, and I was in tears by the end of the film, and most films don't make me emotional in that matter.<br/><br/>The film takes a unique path of telling a war story, by placing two very close brothers in the Korean War through uncontrollable circumstances. This film might seem like your traditional war film at first, but I assure you, it isn't, it's the most unique war movie to date to my knowledge.<br/><br/>The viewer truly gets a sense of how dedicated the two brothers are to each other throughout the film, starting with their first engagement, or slaughter, so to speak. I must warn you, while this is a stunning film, it's also very vividly violent, I mean VERY violent, it's not for the faint of heart. This also helps the viewer to see what really happened, to experience it almost first hand. While most people think violence of this degree isn't necessary in films, I believe it is in films of this nature.<br/><br/>While the emotional tie between the brothers is virtually indestructible, things begin to occur which really make the film amazing. Betrayal, heartbreak, and many more things. This film has all the element for greatness and it delivers, time and time again. Perhaps more importantly, it truly conveys what happened during the Korean War, all the anguish, destruction, and malice. I was shocked at how much disdain and hatred people could have for one another... just because of their different ideals. We see it all the time in our world today but something about this film touched me.<br/><br/>If you're able to get your hands on this outstanding film, I highly suggest you do so, all dialog is in Korean, but it has English subtitles, trust me, it's highly worth it. You won't ever see another emotionally charged, intense, and touching movie, ever.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Tae Guk Gi(The Brotherhood Of War) is an A+ movie and easily one of the best war movies I have ever seen. This is the story of two brothers and their harrowing journey on the battlefields of The Korean War. The film does not have much political dogma and as such portrays war itself as a tradgedy and the relationship of the brothers as a metaphor for the war itself. While having a ton of epic battle scenes, the film pulls out all the stops for realism and the lasting effects of warfare. The violence is very grisly as is the aftermath, with blown apart bodies, charred corpses, heads, arms, limbs blown off,etc. Tae Guk Gi is a very moving and emotional journey and is very effective at showing both sides of the conflict could be just as bad as the other in committing wartime atrocities. Everything here was done really well and I guarantee after watching the film you cannot walk away unaffected. Tae Guk Gi is a extremely powerful film that doesn't come along very often. Incredible Korean film."

The motivations of the two brothers aren't consistent through time and the whole winning-a-medal-to-get-his-brother-home thing seemed very contrived and implausible.

"Leofwine_draca","7","1","1","19 December 2015"," Grisly, emotive, Korean war movie
","This South Korean war movie was internationally distinguished after its popularity made it the most successful Korean film of all time...and it brings with it a reputation of gravitas and emotion that is not entirely without merit. Told in flashback, it's a tale of how two brothers are torn away from their family and forced to join the South Korean army. After engaging in lots of terrible missions, the elder brother becomes desensitised to the violence and turns as brutal as the enemy. When his fiancée is shot and he thinks his brother is killed, he transfers to the North Korean army, and the conclusion is set for an inevitable confrontation between the two siblings, who now fight on different sides.<br/><br/>This film is very well made, exquisitely shot and with some very good acting from the cast; the supporting actors and actresses are all good, but the real focus is on the two main brothers, and both are fine. Won Bin has the larger role as the younger brother who grieves over the disappearance of his sibling, but the best performance comes from Jang Dong-Kun, who gets to run the gamut of emotions from A-Z, starting off as a headstrong youth, become a valiant hero, turning embittered and entirely ruthless, and ending up as a crazed, almost possessed evil killing machine.<br/><br/>Much of the film is taken up with fighting, and the battles are as realistic and brutal as in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Crystal-clear camera-work throws you into the trenches as earth flies through the air from mortar strikes and bodies are repeatedly torn to pieces by the incoming gunfire. These parts of the movie are visceral and horrifying, recalling such films as BLACK HAWK DOWN; certainly the horror of warfare is brought across. The bodies of massacred villagers are booby-trapped to blow, hands and legs are blown off by mines and bullets, and in some cases, heads literally explode. Certainly the level of blood and guts makes this one of the grisliest war films I've watched.<br/><br/>The only real problem with this film is the nature of the narrative, which keeps jumping forward in time, offering visual scenarios of key scenes in the lives of the heroes. As such, the main character's transformation from South Korean hero to North Korean butcher is glossed over, and doesn't come across as believable. Some of the emoting is also a little bit over the top – I'm thinking the train sequence here, as the characters repeatedly cry for their mother. The director would have done well to hold back just a little. Some of the CGI work is also a little bit fake – I could deal with the landscapes, but the CGI aeroplanes are too much. Still, BROTHERHOOD is a great war film, equalling similar US-themed movies and teaching the west about a war that is sometimes forgotten about by those of us living outside of Asia."

"mister_figgins","Null","1","1","28 May 2005"," Important!!
","Alothough I have not seen this film I was in South Korea for it's release and was able to observe the effect it had on the Korean people. Essentially this film shows the horrors of a senseless war, a war that literally pitted brother against brother to achieve nothing. The North and South parts of Korea have been in a cold-war style stand off ever since and while successive governments on both sides refuse to take peace talks seriously the man on the street(s of either part of Korea) believes that the country should be united again.<br/><br/>It is seriously worrying to the Koreans as a whole that a conflict in which over 3 million lives were lost can become the ""forgotten war"" and that successive governments can profit financially from perpetuating a farcical situation that has the potential for nuclear holocaust.<br/><br/>The south Korean perception of recent history is strongly influenced by US films, in fact an intelligent Korean friend of mine had no idea that Britian was involved in World War 2 as he had only seen US made war films. Despite this there is a unanimous feeling among the populace that Korea deserves to be whole again and that families can live together in peace. As the generation that fought the war dies off they wish to reconcile with their family over the border.<br/><br/>It is important to note that the continuation of the situation is largely due to American interference. I know this sounds clichéd and Michael Mooreish, but it's true. The division of the country first occurred as a result of the US lead fight against communism through the 50's. The cold war then got tense and a heavily militarised border developed between the two countries. Amazingly enough a large part of the South Korean military budget (of several billion US$) goes straight to US based companies (notably Armalite, makers of the M-16 rifle and the guys that make Hummvee). !So now we know why North Korea is on Bush's axis of evil list! Taegukgi is an attempt to record the horror and stupidity of the Korean war before the generation that fought it disappears. I sincerely hope that unlike Private Ryan this film can depict a war without leaving the audience believing that war is honourable or sane. To Korea the battle wounds are still raw, this film is a lesson to the youth and an attempt at healing.<br/><br/>""those who ignore the mistakes of history are destined to repeat them"""

","I have to admit, I went into this film with very high expectations. I had just watched Oldboy, another film from South Korea, which blew my freakin' mind. It was incredible. I went looking all around for another South Korean film, but for months couldn't find one. And then this, a Top 250 movie, pops up on the shelf at Blockbuster. Boy, was I excited.<br/><br/>It's too bad, then, that the movie should turn out to be so painfully simple. The film makers assume you, the viewers, are idiots. There is an annoying abundance of authorial shots (a shot where your eye is lead to something so you don't miss it). These shots are okay when they are used to clear up a confusing part of a movie, but if you can't keep up with (if not get ahead of) the storyline of this film, well you, my friend, need help. The use of authorial shots is to make sure that you understand the theme; that good and bad are not so simple in war. A good theme for a film, which is ironically oversimplified.<br/><br/>I have heard many people say that this film depicts war in a realistic way that has never been seen before. Really? Like in the many Rambo scenes where Jin-tae takes on an entire army, miraculously dodging the cross hairs of, oh, so many soldiers? I have also heard that the North Koreans were, for the first time, depicted as humans. After watching this movie, I have to assume that movies before this depicted North Koreans as hamsters.<br/><br/>This movie mostly disappointed me because it was so Hollywood. It's everything I've come to expect from bad American movies, not from Top 250 foreign films. Go see Saving Private Ryan if you want a good war movie. Go see Oldboy if you want a good South Korean movie."

The characters are soulless puppets, no, I'm wrong, they are dumb flat sketches, invented by a mass culture bungler, a sneer on a human being played by the actors who might think that an amount of grimaces shows inner feeling of a person.

"cherold","7","4","10","2 September 2004"," flawed but effective portrayal of the corrosive effects of war
","There are a fair number of movies out there about the horrors of war, but they often portray war as a necessary evil.  That's why a movie like Saving Private Ryan isn't an anti-war film; they are presumably fighting the good fight.  But Taegukgi portrays war as an evil that poisons everything it touches.  War is not noble, both sides do awful things.  War twists soldiers into monsters and leaves only the peace of death.  <br/><br/>While often searing, with jittery, suspenseful scenes of battle, the movie can be a little hokey.  The two brothers fighting together is a bit too pat. The swelling orchestral score is a bit too emotional.  Worst, towards the end both brothers have the sort of superhero fighting skills common in old war movies, where someone like John Wayne could singlehandedly take out a regiment.  This is so utterly ridiculous that I found myself growing impatient with the movie by the end, and a little puzzled by the lack of criticism at this site for such obvious flaws.  It's an effective, absorbing, powerful movie, although there's nothing in it as stunning as the opening sequence of Private Ryan, but even though it is Korean, it is too found of hokey Hollywood devices to be a truly great film."

YOU'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE. You've seen it all before in RYAN, in THIN LINE, and done at least 50 times better in BAND OF BROTHERS. Heck, even the TV movie LOST BATTALLION has already done this! So where does that leave TAEGUKGI? Well, not much ground to cover, that's for sure.<br/><br/>And here's my biggest nitpick with the film: if these soldiers got tossed into a train and drove immediately to the battlefield (i.e. NO BASIC TRAINING!!!) how the heck did they learn to fight, shoot, and even lay mines??? I mean, one guy is a shoeshine boy! The rest are just regular civilians! How the heck did these guys go from shoeshine boy one day to Rambo the next??? It doesn't make sense. And NO ONE has mentioned this.<br/><br/>Hey, maybe I've just seen all this before, but don't try to sell me hype and tell me to like it. I've seen this film 100s of times before.

I also relish films from other cultures, especially Asian, which give me some insight into our differences and similarities.<br/><br/>Here, there are occasional interesting glimpses into the hardships of the young men enslaved by the respective armies. The battle scenes are powerful and well-constructed but they take up too much time since (a) they're repetitive and (b) the focus is supposed to be on the brothers' relationship. The hardships faced by the civilians is only hinted at. The dialogue was, overall, boilerplate (you can imagine such scenes in a run-of-the-mill US Civil War film). What bothered me the most was the ludicrous dialogue and the mystifying actions of the brothers. It's clear what the author/director was driving at in terms of attitudes and motivations, but they're reflected by extreme, unnatural, out-of-character (insofar as character was depicted) behavior when more natural and believable conduct would have yielded the same effect.<br/><br/>I hope another Korean filmmaker undertakes a version of the North/South conflict - and doesn't try to make it a Hollywood soap opera."

","I was anticipating this movie because I'm a big fan of Jang Donggun and I also like Won Bin. I like war movies too and I have seen a lot of them. This is the first movie about Korean war that I've seen. I watched it in CGV Myeongdong with VIP tickets. <br/><br/>The production was good, acting was good, the story itself though is quite thin. The music is overbearing specially in dramatic scenes. There were only two or three scenes in the movie that moved me... first, while their mom broke down as their train went away... second, the boxing scene with won bin and the north korean soldier and third, the scene where the old won bin talked near his brother's grave.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were shot ala ""Saving Private Ryan"" (this movie is wayyyy better than ""Taegukgi"")... but shakier. Anyway, if there is one Korean movie i'd recommend, it has to be ""Old Boy"" or ""Peppermint Candy""... those movies are masterpieces."

","""Tae Guk Gi"" is a fine tale of two brothers forced to fight in a war that neither understands. The older, less literate is protective of his younger, college bound sibling, so much so that he makes a deal with his commanding officer: If I perform bravely enough to receive a medal for heroism, then my younger brother shall be free to return home. His daring, and its effects on the younger brother is the driving force of the movie. Additionally, the longing of the older for his fiance is a secondary, yet pivotal storyline in the movie.<br/><br/>The preface to war, were we see the two young brothers, is very wonderfully done. The war brings about an aging to the characters, and they do look older. The action is fun enough for any action fan, but the story of the brothers commands the most attention.<br/><br/>The DVD extras are very nice. One short has interviews with the director, writers and actors, along with real-life survivors of the war. It's interesting to see the South Koreans viewpoint, as opposed to the American view.<br/><br/>For movie making buffs, a comparison of the story board to the filmed action is very interesting. A still photography section gives a nice capture of the film, something I'm usually not very impressed with for most movies.<br/><br/>I would suggest those who don't like subtitles watch the movie a second time in Korean. You'll remember the jest of what they are saying, but get a truer feeling for the actors than in the dubbed version."

This was a very different war film, concentrating more on the relationship between two brothers - being very close prior to war and then having nothing in common once at the war front. Make no mistake, this was brutal, graphic and disturbing. The film so effectively shows how war changes people, as one of the brothers rises from ordinary man to the nation's hero, and how it affects those around him.<br/><br/>The Koreans make the best war films by far, and this film is undeniable proof! The battle scenes are incredibly well done and very realistic. The final battle scene is fantastic! This is a very sad film, though, but my goodness, this was good!"

","I think that the director Je-Kyu Kang gives us a great and exempt argument and is therefore not politically correct and does it in a way that deserves my applause because he reports the war crimes of both sides of the conflict with a huge lucidity. This film had a budget of about 12 million USD, of the highest I have seen in South Korean production, which, at least in this century, has provided us with fantastic, creative and original films, of the most varied genres, made with little money, compared to what goes on in Hollywood. I imagine if this movie were made in the US, the budget would be around $ 100 million. This is just to say that you do not need huge budgets to make great movies.

","Movie: Taegukgi (15)<br/><br/>Rating: 5/5<br/><br/>Films with excellence like this one are rare to find nowadays. TAEGUKGI is in every aspect a masterpiece; I can confidently say it's flawless. While watching the film, I was totally absorbed into it. I was left speechless, moved and emotional by the time the end credits started to roll. Undoubtedly, it's one of the best South Korean films I've seen till date. <br/><br/>Director Kang Je-kyu binds us emotionally into the tale with perfection sprinkled all over; the unfolding is so convincing that I felt connected to the brothers (played by the very excellent and unbeatable actors Jang Dong-gun and Won Bin) right from the beginning. Jang delivers a perfectly neat act and you feel for him since the very beginning, while Won makes you cry along with him. This is seriously an award deserving performance from both the actors, and undoubtedly the film won a lot of awards and love from people all over. Rest of the actors too add glory to the film's victory.<br/><br/>The technical aspects need to be heavily praised, as not for a second it's felt that the film has a low quality or production values. The scale is pretty high, and the production values are rich. The war/action sequences are extremely well choreographed and are enjoyable enough to be seen again. The cinematography is splendid and the lens doesn't capture a single shot without perfection. <br/><br/>The screenplay and editing are very well dealt with, as even at a long duration (I have seen the director's cut) the film doesn't bore for a second. The moment you think it's over, it goes on to deliver some chilling portrayal of human emotions and continues the narration with utmost sincerity. The climax is very well done, and the last few minutes had me constantly crying. Every emotion could be felt. <br/><br/>TAEGUGKI is undoubtedly a major triumph for the South Korean cinema. When I finished watching the film as well as shedding tears, I was left silent as well as asking myself a question again and again, ""Why didn't I see this gem before?"""

","The film tells the story of two brothers whose normal life changes when a war breaks out. Lee Jin-Tae is the older brother who runs a shoeshine stand in order to make money for his brother's education. Due to the sudden war between North Korea and South Korea, the two brothers were forcibly dragged into the battlefield. Visually, it's a wonderful war movie. This film has too many characters like all other war movies and it's hard to figure out who is fighting during the war sequences. The two lead actors were excellent in their roles and Like any other Korean movie, the emotional scenes were right on the money. Anyway, the film has high standards of an epic war film and slightly inspired from 'Saving Private Ryan'. Overall, it's a solid movie from the beginning to end and it's a must watch."

No, not the sheer amount of violence that it depicts, the clear and very sharp anti-war message that it delivers very powerfully and skillfully. I knew the Korean war was a merciless and bloody affair, but was not prepared to the utter array of scenes and blood-chilling battles the film showed us. What is more and the most important here is the straight-ahead and transparent message of ""war is all hell"". The story of two brothers taking part in this bloody war makes the whole thing more personal and even intimate, thus telling us how people could change in the midst of carnage and massacre. Jang Dong-gun as Lee Jin-tae and Won Bin as Lee Jin-seok, Jin-tae's younger brother are great protagonists and their personal tragedies make this awesome film eve more subtle and wanton at the same time.

","There's a chaos that surrounds the film - this is a war movie that revels in the insanity and confusion of battle - but the chaos strikes hardest in the first half hour. It's here that the locals, caught off guard by the invasion, are shuffled into refugee status in what plays, rightfully so, like a nightmare. The nightmare only grows when soldiers drop by and force all men of the proper age to enlist, no exceptions. The film grips us hard in these scenes, these terrifyingly real scenes, and our heart breaks as we remember that the army doing the forced draft is on our side. Just as American movies have at times reminded us of the dark pages in U.S. history, so now does Tae Guk Gi remind us of the darker actions of the Korean War.<br/><br/>From here, the plot places itself on the brink of meandering for two more hours, and yet while the movie pushes its epic length with no clear ending in sight, it's a meandering that's kept well in check; there's not a scene here that drags. Even with the screenplay pushing out your usual war movie cliché's - some unfortunate sap shares pictures of his family, never a good sign in such a film - there's such a gusto behind the project that even the most familiar of characters holds steady. Yes, this is a story about two brothers sharing the experiences of war (a literal 'band of brothers'), but the paths the plot takes stretch the limits of the formula in exciting, compelling directions.<br/><br/>Carrying the film through are two dynamic performances. Jang Dong Gun (sharing more than a passing resemblance to a young Chow Yun Fat) is quite remarkable as Jin-Tae, the young man who grows colder as the war rages and he evolves into an exemplary soldier. And as Jin-Seok, Won Bin provides the right mixture of confused youth and troubled brother. Both leads are quite memorable, helping solidify the story, keeping the sheer weight of the movie from bearing down too hard on the viewer."

","Hi! In case you haven't read up on your World History, we're still at war with North Korea. We basically signed an Armistice Treaty, back in 1953 to stop shooting each other point blank in the face and on the news of current events. This Instant Classic War Movie, TAE GUK GI (The Brotherhood of War) succeeds in showing us the ""true grit"" of what urban open head exploding (like watermelons) street by street warfare looks like. Directed by Kang Je-Gyu, this bullet loud numbing graphic war celluloid piece freely tells a heavy one sided story from a South Korean point of view (the North Communists are seen mainly as a small but evil empire). I'm painfully reminded (as an American), in the major scene where the Chinese Army joins the bloody fray with North Korea, that this force multitude of hundreds of red enemy assailants scouring over a hill like army ants, must have been dead similar to what the lone guard Brave Texans (standing tall next to the likes of Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie) saw coming at them while defending The Alamo in 1836 against Gen. Santa Ana's 3000 plus Army.<br/><br/>TAE GUK GI focuses it's blood smeared camera lens on two Brothers Jin Tae and Lee Jin Seok. One struggles to maintain his humanity and sense of universal justice, in the midst of battle, while the other Brother mentally transforms himself into a fear-no-bullet ""Super Saiyan"" (like Dragon Ball Z) on the battlefield, in a desperate bold plan to get his younger Brother sent home early (to help survive the Family Name). Other talented Supporting Characters ""fly in and fly out"" like rice thrown in your face, but they stick in your memory, with their longing eyes, funny remarks, and cold blooded commanders. The Mom, the Wife to be, the soldier comrades, the wry weary Captains, and the Kids, all evolve and revolve around the two South Korean Brothers.<br/><br/>On a technical military note, it was interesting to see propeller driven Pre-Jet Age Allied Aircraft ""raining down death"" with their WWII mounted machine guns (probably still oiled up from fighting the Japanese approx 5 years earlier). And you don't even see the American Allied Army until 2/3rds into the action. What we're fed here is a steady dose of humane mental anguish and desperation to stay sane while absorbing the fateful costs of hunger forced made decisions. All of which bring us to today's Armistice with North Korea. We still look at each other, everyday, with loaded modern guns on each side of a barbed wire fence at the 38th Parallel. How many lives would change, in this generation, between Brothers, Family, and Friends, if one side decides to ""open fire"" all over again?"

","The film's title is the name of the pre-war flag of the People's Republic of Korea, the flag of the Provisional People's Committee for North Korea as well as the current flag of South Korea. Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War is one of those war films that no matter what's the ideology or cause, these soldiers are fighting to keep their love ones alive. The movie is the story of two brothers, shoe shiner Jin-Tae Lee (Jang Dong-gun) and his 18 year old student brother, Jin-seok Lee (Bin Won) forced to fight in a war that both don't want to be in, when North Korea invades the South. Now the brothers are forced to fight along with each other, and later against each other as both men are tested by the horrors of war, and the deadly effects of it. The movie is very powerful and well done. Like other modern war drama, it's also reached a dramatic and tragic end. Its shows the true message about war. There are no winners in war, all that are forced to fight lead to nowhere, but self-destruction. The movie is a bit brutal, as there is no rest between the never ending violence and battle scenes in the film. When there are some rest, the movie turns the dramatic up to the point that the audiences watching this film still feels on edge. The movie is very gory, and there were some scenes that makes you want to look away due to its harsh realism of war. There were a bit of bad CGI, with the American Airplanes, but most of the action scene felt real. I feel it's a little too unrealistic when the brothers keep switching sides throughout the entire war from fighting with North Korea to South Korea and so for. I doubt that happened too often. Like I said before, there is no clear picture of whom good and who's evil. The movie is little about patriotism, as it is more about taking care of your family. Both nations are portray in gray with both armies doing many cruelty acts, that makes you wonder whom are we rooting for. The brothers characters are both equality flaw are both sink more and more into the madness of war. Still, the movie makes Jin-Tae Lee seek a little bit unstoppable. His bravery actions were kinda over the top, Rambo at times to the point, it lost it's realistic. He get a bit lost in the war. The other brother, Jin-Seok Lee developed from a young teenager into a harden soldier by the end of the film, but throughout the film, when something bad happens to him or his friends, he takes it out on his brother Jin-Tae Lee to the point where he can be a bit annoying. The supporting characters are introduce and kill off so quickly that they barely had any back story or development throughout the film. Honestly, I couldn't tell the different between them and the other background soldiers getting blown up, or killed off. Still, the movie has a good soundtrack and its opening and ending scenes reminds me of both, the films Saving Private Ryan and Letters of Iwo Jima. If you going to watch this film. I would choice to watch it with sub-titles rather than the English dub. My heart goes out to those anybody forced to fight in a war. This movie made me think a lot about war. Is war really necessary? So many blood-sheds and deaths of the innocent. When a war movie makes thinks about that. Then it's doing something right."

","I'm glad I took advantage of the opportunity to see this film on cable TV, but I wish I had seen it letterboxed. The cinematography was quite good and I'm sure it lost quite a bit in the pan-and-scan version.<br/><br/>This is a heartfelt film and a well-made one in many ways, but overall I found it rather tiring and melodramatic with some strong and memorable scenes here and there. Much has been said about the battle scenes being similar to the ones in ""Saving Private Ryan."" That in itself is OK, but -- although I'm not a huge fan of that film -- I thought SPR's battle scenes were more focused and involving. In this film, the mayhem just felt relentless and mind-numbing, which, I suppose, is what it can feel like when you're in a war. But for me it had a distancing effect after a while -- I simply got tired of the film. I also felt that the emotions were pitched too high and that the film could have benefited from more subtle writing and performances. For me, the most moving moments were the framing scenes at the beginning and end involving one of the characters as an old man. Those scenes had a quiet gravity that was missing elsewhere.<br/><br/>Besides the echoes of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" I also felt the director was influenced by American war movies like ""Platoon"" and ""The Deer Hunter."" Again, all movies are influenced by earlier ones, but the fact that I was thinking about this while watching the film is an indication that I wasn't very involved in the plot or characters. <br/><br/>All in all, though, it was interesting to see a movie about a part of history that's mostly been ignored in films. And despite its shortcomings, the movie does at times capture the utter folly and sadness of war. I wish I could have liked it more overall, but maybe I'll give the letterboxed version another try someday."
"Atavisten","3","10","46","10 April 2005"," Please save me
","from the melodrama. 'Taegukgi' employs the 'Saving Private Ryan' storyline with a personal tragedy in a great war. Oh my oh my how the two brothers look like they've just fallen in love (in the beginning of the movie), I for one have never seen brothers like that. In style also this is very similar to SPR. Lots of blood splashing everywhere, enemy is portrayed as only evil, music very dramatic and story very tear dripping. For those who would see this Oscar nominated: Why? To show that Korean movies cant do better than to copy one of Hollywood's biggest recent successes? Korean film is so much more than that.<br/><br/>The films core messages lies in that they are one people and its crazy to fight ones own people. If so, then I find it confusing as to why the North Koreans are totally faceless except for the ones who deserted from the south. When one South Korean is killed, we see 20 North Koreans get blasted into bloody bits and I thought that the North Korean army was so much more powerful at that time. And the systematic killing of the civilians who enlisted as communists to get food when the capitalists couldn't give them anything, what was that about? To show that South Korea does not tolerate freedom of thought or have compassion? If it was to criticize the South Korean governing at the time, as with the drafting of both brothers, then the film shouldn't be so stereotyping the enemy. Honestly I don't think the Koreans were so black and white only five years after the divide, which most Koreans didn't care much about since they were one people.<br/><br/>The two main actors need to mature a little. Jin-seok especially is not the same character throughout the movie, most of the time he is thinking about the family at home and disliking his brothers medal hunt, but at the hospital for instance, he seems to be happy like he spent the last year on honeymoon at Cheju island. Jin-tae seems more on a quest for glory than for sending his brother home, then why is he so celebrated for the effort? Of course his brother loves him, but the changes come without proper motivation. Like close to the ending, he went nuts and ..? I am sorry to be so grumpy when I see so many people appreciate this movie so much and were really moved to tears by it, but I think it was to messy, tried to achieve to much with succeeding in little and too sugarcoated, Hollywood style. For a Korean audience who don't know American movies so well this may be a very well made movie and seem exotic, but for me this is not what I seek out as Korean cinema. See 'Silmido' instead."
"zzzpssshzzz","5","5","19","18 March 2007"," A good try, but utterly repetitive.
","I had high expectations for this movie, maybe a bit too high. Hearing that it rivals Saving Private Ryan I had to see it for myself. First things first, it brings along a talented cast, the actor who played Jin-Tae gave a strong performance. The special effects are also a plus. Though not all was great in this film.<br/><br/>The number one killer for this movie is repetitiveness. I got the fact that the brothers cared for each other, but there was way too many repetitive scenes. After so many scenes of arguments among brothers, the character Jin-Seok starts to be just downright bratty and annoying. All that overacting doesn't help either. Those were not the only repetitive scenes though, check out the mêlée and fist fighting scenes, dragging out so darn long it became a bore, just watch the last scene where the brothers fight. Not only do they hit each other about a couple dozen times with their fists, they start hitting each other with the end of a rifle butt, but yet they still stand and do the same for the next 5 minutes. Right.....<br/><br/>The battle scenes themselves were well done, despite its repetitiveness. Again, there's only so many different ways a person could jerk every time hes shot, punched, or blown up.<br/><br/>Overall its a good movie, but nowhere near perfect. I especially hated the fact that years pass in every other scene, not to mention that they come up in such a sudden fashion. One scene has the brothers sitting down and talking about their home, and then SUDDENLY its 1951 and they are yet AGAIN in the MIDDLE of a battle. Now I understand that for the movie to play out with their script, they would have to do that. Still, this story would be best told through a mini-series, not a film.<br/><br/>Movie Moment: Jin-Tae pulling a grenade pin with his teeth with ease. This is technically almost impossible giving the fact that it requires a large amount of force and a strong grip. Of course, it looks cool right?"

","This movie is positively weird. Literally. It begins just like any other grand war movie - little irony, not much social commentary. For instance, there's no talk of the ROK authorities, about Li Sung-man's *slightly* corrupt power wielding and so on. On the other hand, the truth is all there: after all, the protagonists don't represent some imaginary underclass, but exactly the typical South Koreans. One brother works so that the other may learn. Then, the war begins, and the elder brother decides to save his younger kin by joining in the same unit and embarking on a struggle for top distinctions. But he is mistreated - his fiancée is proclaimed communist (because she took part in some communist meetings - ""for food""), and when he and his brother stand up against the ruthless anti-communist court, they also become communists in the eyes of the authorities. The elder brother, convinced of his younger brother's death (his girl has already been killed) joins the KPA to fight corrupt ROK (it isn't stated but that's how it can be read). When he recognizes his mistake, it's too late and he pays for it with his life. Now, the problem is that the story itself is very hieratic - big words and all. Yet, there is a curious underpinning to it all. What if we see Jin-tae's death as something that was a given from the beginning? That he was dead already when he joined ROK forces? That his struggle for a medal is supposed to help his brother is good enough, but quite soon it becomes a struggle not for the brother, but for himself. What we see in his actions is an uncommon amount of hatred - where did it come from? Maybe it's the war: that KPA's attack had him leave his fiancée, spend the prescribed day of their wedding on the front line? Or it's him, his powerlessness - he was constantly paying with his life: for his brother's education, his family's well-being... That this tension is unresolved bears on the movie heavily, but without it, it would be utterly worthless, a simple revision of the same old war story. What I liked in the movie was that the communists have no faces. The only communists we see are the officers - or the South Koreans compulsorily enlisted in the KPA after the invasion. This gives the war an unreality: it is not a struggle between men, but between men and an impersonal mass - ideology itself? The war is shown ruthlessly, though I'm afraid the authors of the movie overstepped the actual history quite a few times. I'm not so sure it wasn't the UN forces that took Pyongyang; also, I thought there was no battle for the communist capital, as the KPA has already withdrawn, lacking strength to push the allies back. Although the Chinese and the Americans are in the war already for some time, the final battle is solely between Koreans - is that how it turned out? One of the truths about this war is that most of the significant battles were fought by foreign armies, not by Koreans. This is not to say that there were no Korean soldiers, but they were used to less compelling tasks. Another thing - isn't an F-86 a jet fighter? Because in the final battle, we're told that ""F-86 are ready,"" and the ones that come are propellers. Anyway, this isn't bad, but there are a few things to consider before it's marked as a ""masterpiece"" - which it (sadly) isn't."
"RolandCPhillips","7","2","5","31 May 2006"," Simple but impressive
","There were a great many mixed reviews for Kang Je-guy's film. Several in England lambasted the film as being incredibly melodramatic, overacted, insistent in use of music and visual style, clichéd and manipulative. Less vitriolic ones praised the production values and physical qualities, but again said that this extremely populist film was sentimental and also all-too-obviously riffing on Western war films (in its nervy action scenes and framing narrative), such as Black Hawk Down and, in particular, Saving private Ryan.<br/><br/>I think this is a much better and more interesting film than a lot of people have allowed. There are detracting factors. It's long, self-consciously 'epic', features an OTT, bug-eyed performance from Jang Dong-kun, has a few ropey CGI effects and also has a rather simplistic metaphor for the Korean peninsular (the brothers being divided, natch).<br/><br/>But for all that, this is still a really impressive film. Amazingly shot at times and wearing its heart on its sleeve, it interesting to see commercial cinema be so committed to elucidating a trauma such as the Korean ware.<br/><br/>I think it is manipulative and a touch hypocritical in the way rejoices in its ability to blow stuff up, entertain but and then throw in some anguished scenes of family strife and depict atrocities against soldiers and civilians alike. However, the way it views South Korea as HOME, under attack from forces way beyond the sight of ordinary people is really persuasive; they may be off-the-shelf characters, yet they deserve out sympathy. Also, the way it depicts the Korea being thrust into a cruel modernity and onto the international stage, when all people want to do is prosper and be happy, is intriguing. Yes, its to progress, but did we really have to drub the hell out of other to do it? <br/><br/>The film's attitude to consumerism, capitalism and Westwern powers is mostly positive, but a touch ambiguous. The early scenes that depict a poor but healthy, industrious and extremely optimistic South Korea are a bit boring because they signal the carnage to come, but the film mourns this lost world, before politics and death intruded upon them.<br/><br/>This really is a film about ordinary people, and I like that. It may not be original, but the way it insists upon their situation at the mercy of ideologies, politicians we never see and almighty battles gives some idea of why it was so phenomenally successful in Korea: there's no grandstanding, just trying to survive. This is not historical film-making and history buffs won't benefit because there's no real analysis of the conflict's origins or development.<br/><br/>Taegukgi is extremely commercial, and hence bland at times, shallow even - because while it may show acts of murder and torture from both sides, it only shows those crimes and does not interrogate them.<br/><br/>But it's worth seeing for the scale of its vision, production values and for such a layman's view of fighting. At the very least it's an instructive lesson in bayonet-fencing: the scenes of trench-fighting are brutal as hell."
"shiwalogo","Null","2","5","8 November 2004"," Hollywood style, local movie
","Though it is true that this movie has a lot of Hollywood. It is based on the historical event of a civil war. There is a deeper meaning to the corny story line and the over dramatized scenes. The movie cannot be watched in the context of a war movie, only. The whole allegorical point of the movie is the fight between the brothers which alludes to Korean history. In the movie, they first fight shoulder to shoulder, as Korea fought Japan, later fighting each other, as in Communist north versus Democratic south.<br/><br/>Contemporary Korean movies are known to be over-done versions of Hollywood. This one is no different. Technically, it is as good as a Hollywood movie, but the content cannot be limited to ""war is bad."" I would suggest studying some Korean history, just a little bit, before watching this film."

","Americans like to tell World War II stories where they won, and Vietnam war stories, where the Americans lose but the pacifists in America won (because America withdrew from Vietnam, making it an American Victory).<br/><br/>North and South Korea are separated by the world's largest minefield. These 2 countries, with the same history, culture and language move further apart now during the cultural war.<br/><br/>So delving in to the Korean war for Koreans is no easy matter. Until recently North Koreans were always seen as the enemy. Completely alien to south Koreans.<br/><br/>This movie delves into the Horror of the Korean war. There are no good guys and bad guys, no real heroes. What we see is the story of 2 brothers forced into the South Korean army when North Korea invades in 1950. (The South were also thinking of invading the North, but didn't get organised in time) The story passes through the terror of the early stages where North Korea was able to invade right down to Busan in the south of the Korean Peninsular, to move north when the Americans daringly intervened and the bitter deadlocked battles that resulted from China's intervention.<br/><br/>You see the terrible atrocities on both sides, the indifference to people and the stupidity of hatred. Brother will fight brother, but there is always hope. For in Korea, family is the basis of society, and that at the end of the day, North and South are brothers.<br/><br/>Perhaps the action is a little over the top (Hng Kong actions movies have led Asian audiences to expect this), but here is a movie that finally makes me feel that war has no redeeming characteristics."
"paultd","5","4","17","22 May 2006"," Great battle scenes, underwhelming otherwise
","What we have here is a thoroughly captivating movie with noticeable flaws. Despite the great battle scenes, there were just too many battle scenes. We only need to see a bayonet go through someone so many times. Also, there are preposterous Superman worthy combat heroics that detracts from an otherwise gruesome and very realistic wartime setting that surpasses even that of Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>Besides the action sequences, the other parts seem overly melodramatic, playing loosely like a Bollywood movie (without the crappy dance interludes, for which I'll give it credit). This movie tries, really hard, to make you cry, really hard. Manipulative music that wrestles you to submit to your emotions is played not once or twice, but all the way through. An alternative would be soft notes or even total silence in the crucial scenes. That would have really hit the message home harder.<br/><br/>Lastly, the character shifts occur too whimsically. There is no reason for the two brothers to take on such a fast array of different behavioral costumes. One moment they feud, and the next moment they forget all about it. The older brother's reckless insanity was way over the top.<br/><br/>That might seem to indicate that I hated this movie, but I don't. It was done very well within the scope it provides itself. It is rewarding, touching, and insightful for anyone, more so those unfamiliar with the Korean War. Just don't expect a real accurate history lesson, but the general gist is provided along with heavy feel-good (or is it feel-bad?) factor. The film-makers understood this film's formulaic purpose and really weren't too interested in pushing the envelope."
"asda-man","9","1","2","16 April 2015"," Well that kicked Private Ryan's arse!
","When I slipped in the disc for Brotherhood I expected a really good war film. I didn't expect to be sitting on the sofa with my eyes filled with tears by the end of it, and convinced that I'd just seen one of the very best war films ever. My love for Korean films is unabashed. Whilst Korean horror is what I go for most, I have also tried and loved some of their explosive thrillers like, The Man from Nowhere and A Bittersweet Life. War films aren't really my thing though. My favourite war film is probably Inglorious Basterds, but even that isn't really interested in showing us battle sequences.<br/><br/>What's fantastic about Brotherhood is that it puts its characters first. In fact, this is what the majority of Korean films tend to do and I think that's the secret to their brilliance. With Brotherhood, I was gripped by every battle sequence because I cared about the people who were in them. It's a real epic which spans across the entire length of the Korean War, as well as briefly showing us before and after events take place. If someone said to me 'oh, this is a movie about the Korean War' I'd immediately switch off because war movies just don't interest me. Brotherhood makes you interested right from the very start. The first half an hour is dedicated to events before the war. We see two fantastically likable brothers who are devoted to their family. Some may find it overly sentimental, however for me it worked. I immediately cared about these characters and was totally gripped from when they're whisked away to fight in the war.<br/><br/>The battle sequences are brilliantly intense to watch. The camera does shake a little too much for my liking, but it's really not that much of a distraction. They're intense because you care about what's going to happen to the characters. When a comrade dies you almost feels as much pain as the other characters do. The special effects are also very convincing (apart from the shoddy CGI planes towards the end) and manage to put you right there in the firing line. <br/><br/>What's most interesting though is watching the two brothers slowly grow apart from each other. At its heart, Brotherhood is a tragedy. One brother turns into a cold-hearted and ruthless leader, whilst the other remains compassionate. This arc is done gradually and realistically throughout the film and it's what keeps the film so emotional and absorbing. The ruthless brother could've easily come across as a caricature, but thanks to the fantastic writing and acting we're left with convincing character development and remain involved with the character.<br/><br/>Various shocking events unfold which have the power to move, however it's the relentlessly melodramatic final twenty minutes which really hit hard. Again, many will find this finale too melodramatic and sentimental, but for me it totally worked. I'm not one to cry in films (the only ones I've shed tears for are Dancer in the Dark and Amour) however, there are several moments towards the end where I had tears REALLY filling up in my eyes. It's incredibly emotional and ultimately powerful.<br/><br/>Brotherhood isn't a perfect film, but it's a damn near one. I was never bored for a minute of its hefty 140 minute runtime. I cannot urge people enough to check this out, even if (like me) you aren't into war films. At its core it's a character-driven tragedy with the Korean War used as a mere backdrop. It's ten times better than Saving Private Ryan and if you aren't moved by the time it's over then you truly do have a heart of stone. Brotherhood is a spectacular triumph which needs to be watched for its sheer emotional power."

"rooprect","8","1","2","11 January 2013"," Sheesh. spoiler alert in IMDb's plot outline
","This is a very good film, but whatever you do, don't read IMDb's plot outline (as of today Jan 12, 2013) because it pretty much ruins it.<br/><br/>The beauty of this movie is how it takes unexpected turns, beginning as a run-of-the-mill war story but slowly morphing into a complex epic of intense personal and political conflicts. That's all you need to know. And you certainly don't need to know how it ends!<br/><br/>So let's not talk about plot. Instead I'll focus on the overall presentation. Like I said, it starts out very straightforward, seemingly predictable, but stick with it because things heat up. ""Tae Guk Gi"" gives a glimpse of what war is really about: not necessarily honor and good vs. evil, but more realistically it paints a Machiavellian perspective where survival and individual interests are the real guts. (Oh and speaking of guts, you can expect to see a lot of them. Lots of realistic violence, so be prepared.). Anyway as I was saying, this film uses an interesting trick of painting both sides as either ""good"" or ""evil"", thus reducing the ideology of war to irrelevant. No one really cares when bullets are flying. At one point, a character reveals that a decorated war hero ""doesn't even know the difference between communism and democracy!"" And that resounding statement is what makes this such a powerful film which makes an effective anti-war statement.<br/><br/>Many great films have commented on the madness of war. Among the best are ""None But the Brave"" with Frank Sinatra, ""Welcome to Dongmakgol"" another excellent Korean War picture, the Russian masterpiece ""Ballad of a Soldier"", the Brando film ""The Young Lions"", and now I'm happy to add ""Tae Guk Gi"" to my list of faves. Each of these films has its own unique angle. This movie's angle is particularly unsettling, and that's why you must see it."

","I know very little about director Je-gyu Kang. He made three films overall and quite interestingly none after 'Taegukgi' from 2004. His creation is very different from the one coming from the other famous Korean director Ki-duk Kim, or from the Korean commercial cinema (horror or science fiction films) which is somehow known in the world.<br/><br/>'Taegukgi' can be considered to a large extent a replica to 'Saving Private Ryan' by Spielberg. It's a war story involving two brothers caught in the turmoil of the Korean war, with very different personalities and destinies. One of them is the strong character and his initial purpose is saving his younger and weaker brother, sparing him the rest of the war and sending him home. In time his destiny changes and his character seems to head towards the apparently inescapable brutality and insanity of the war. The film becomes at the same time a realistic rendition of a civil war in which the borders between good and evil slowly disappear, as well as a metaphor of the tearing apart of the Korean nation, with the two brothers ending by fighting on opposite camps. The final sacrifice reestablishes the balance but the reconciliation and the peace never come, only death puts end to the life long waiting and desire for getting back together.<br/><br/>Much of the screening time is filled with the war scenes, some of the best I have ever seen, and Spielberg's movie comes again in mind as the obvious reference. It is hard to say whether the story of the two brothers happens on the background of the war, or it is the war that catches the center of the attention and the story just flows with it. The effect is however strong, the story is moving and for the non-Korean viewer this is an opportunity to learn something about the history and feelings of a nation that is still divided."

"Antagonisten","7","1","2","6 August 2007"," Above par
","The Korean War is somewhat overlooked in cinema i think. I guess it's because it happened between two big and traumatic American wars, WW2 and Vietnam. Seeing a movie made from a Korean perspective is not surprisingly also more interesting than it would be to see an American movie of the same thing. Having said that, the differences between this movie and a Hollywood-production are few except the language.<br/><br/>Korean movies have come closer and closer to western movies both in quality and design. This is a very well-made war movie with high production values and good special effects. The story is pretty straight-forward with two brothers being drafter into the army at the same time. One of the brothers try to gain commendations so he can have the other one sent home to continue his university studies. But somewhere along the way he loses his perspective and forgets why he's fighting.<br/><br/>The refreshing (and surprising) thing here is the way that South Koreans are not pictured as saints. Usually in modern war movies it's common to try and humanize the enemy, but considering that the conflict between North and South Korea is still ongoing (albeit in a ""cold"" form) i didn't really know what to expect. But this is fairly balanced, although of course told from a South Korean perspective.<br/><br/>The acting is fairly good here, with several faces you recognize from other recent Korean movies. The story is fairly coherent and aside from a few scenes i found impossible to understand this was a straightforward affair. That's one of the larger complaints that i've always had with Asian movies, the fact that the story is often not very coherent. Also the characters often feel illogical in their actions and motivations. But in this movie, they avoid this problem more or less completely.<br/><br/>In the end this is a rather straight-forward war movie that's very similar to most western equivalents from later years. In that regard it might not be revolutionary, but it is well made. Character development and story arc are above par for Asian movies, and in general the movie looks expensive and well done. It's entertaining while it lasts. I rate it 7/10."

There is a lot of realistic violence, however, there was also a whole lot of shaky camera as well, which made it hard to appreciate everything that went into each scene. If the cinematography were more steady,?like Saving Private Ryan or even A Very Long Engagement, I think the artistry of the film would've been more appreciable.<br/><br/>Actually, part of the film's structure is very similar to Saving Private Ryan in that it has a prologue and epilogue set in the present (sort of). But it's really a single-minded story about brothers, although there are a lot of nice?complications folded into the story and commentary about the divide between the communist North and the capitalist South. There are multiple very Korean moments of strong melodrama as well (which is predictable and not unlike a few Mel Gibson epic films as well). But I think the story went a little too long and was a little too single-minded to be great.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it's a visceral and intense film and recommended for those that can stomach the brutal violence. 8/10."

The early scene introducing the two brothers and the scene where the brothers tried to get the last glimpse of their mother from the train before leaving for the frontline are some examples jumping into mind.<br/><br/>But I also have to say that I found myself crying a little at the last scene, when the elder brother's dead body turned to a set of skeleton. So overall, I think the movie does deliver what it sets out to do. A poignant story complemented with many excellent action sequences that show the war as it was. For ordinary people, it's not about ideology or even national pride. It's an extreme manifestation of deep lying human instincts of violence and survival."

The acting is very good and the actual war scenes are realistic enough without being too much in your face, yes you see the horrors of war, blood, dismembered limbs flying about but often they are just out of the central view or a frame too fast, so you are not too freaked out. This film in essence realises the horrors of war not through a play-out of scenes but rather emotions.

From the script point of view it's just a big drama with a lot of gore. Probably I miss the context not living in South Korea and it's an advance over previous war movies.

Of course this led to him becoming deaf and blind, incapable of recognizing his own brother while being face to face with him over the course of a few minutes while tapping into his inner killer.<br/><br/>If you're a sucker for movies that bring out forced upon emotions through irrational behavior and bonds portrayed pathetically by a pen or handkerchief, then this movie is for you.

This kind of film-making brought us masterpieces, but it can also be too much sometimes, given that many moviegoers are rather inexperienced concerning Asian cinema. I was a little bit distracted by this in Je-gyu Kang's ""Taegukgi hwinalrimyeu"", because it made this otherwise very realistic film a bit unrealistic. That's a general problem, that I think this story would have been better material for an opera. The characters are given clear qualities, there are enough conflicts between them to keep the viewer interested a running time of 143 minutes. The sequence of the film I remember the most is when the South Korean ""traitors"" were mass executed. It just felt like another form of violence than in the rest of the movie.

Those are classics movies, no doubt.<br/><br/>I don't hate Taegukgi, it had a good storyline but it just wasn't as polished, heart-wrenching or grander in terms of scope and magnitude compared to better War films. A riveting war film must have all these elements to engage the viewer and I'm afraid this is what Taegukgi lacked. Another gripe I have with the film is the 'goryness' just for the sake of being gory which doesn't really add to the storyline except grossness. For instance, scenes of dead bodies and limbs are filmed up close and held for very long time, I thought I was watching a documentary of a hospital surgeon performing an operation on a table! Another gripe I have is that some of the scenes are unrealistic such as dodging bullets by running. It's not Rambo! <br/><br/>Anyway, I can't say anymore because I would be spoiling it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet.

"ExpendableMan","6","3","15","20 September 2005"," Brutal and unflinching portrayal of a nation at war
","The easiest way to sum up Taegukgi is the rather lazy tag of ""The Korean answer to Saving Private Ryan."" It certainly delivers the same epic feel as the Spielberg movie, showing us several years of raw human combat condensed into two and a half hours running time, with plenty of bloody battles filmed with cameras that shake with each artillery detonation. Rather unfortunately though, it also comes with some over-the-top melodrama as well which seems geared to tugging the viewer's heart strings, but instead comes across as rather clichéd and funny, which somewhat spoils the mood.<br/><br/>Take for example the early scenes of the film. Brothers Seouk and Tae living carefree lives and running happily on the streets together. Seouk is close to finishing school, whereas Tae runs a shoeshine business and is on the verge of getting married, while their mother runs a noodle stand where business is just picking up. All the while, there is upbeat, 'triumph of the human spirit' style music playing in the background and everyone has smiles plastered on their faces. At one point they even remark how happy they are, their idyllic lives being so overplayed you half expect somebody to say: ""Gee, wouldn't it be bad if a big war suddenly came along and ruined everything?"" Later in the running time, Seouk sits in a war hospital a changed man. He has seen his brother driven to the point of insanity by war and his friends dying around him. He is scarred and haunted by what he has seen and his thoughts instantly return to his earlier life, the family scenes from earlier playing in a montage over more highly-strung, sentimental music. The effect is meant to be poignant, instead, it is utterly hilarious.<br/><br/>Thankfully though, the film still has much to commend it. For one thing, the director is in no way driven by the same patriotic grandeur that guides many a Hollywood war. In place of triumphant flag waving, we see atrocities committed by both sides. In fact if anything, the ones who come across as worse here are the South Korean army, despite the fact they are the main focus and it's hard not to forget the scenes of young boys being forced into action and the secret police wiping out their own civilians.<br/><br/>What's more, when not hampered by the overwrought melodrama, the relationship between the two brothers is handled very well. Tae's decision to take on as many suicide missions as possible in return for Seouk being sent home results in a friction between the two that escalates over time. This is portrayed in an admirable fashion by the two lead actors, both of whom provide terrific performances.<br/><br/>Backing this up is a series of spectacular battle scenes. One rather dodgy looking CGI plane aside, the overall result is a startlingly realistic portrayal of combat. Explosions rock the land, dirt and body parts fly in all directions and there are numerous hand to hand battles which could stand alongside Private Ryan's opening beach landing in terms of brutality. War has never looked so horrific.<br/><br/>As a conclusion then, Taegukgi is a film of two halves. Two fantastic lead performances and some stunning battle scenes certainly leave an indelible impression on your mind and the film has much to commend it. If you can look past the fact that it sometimes feels like a catalogue of war movie clichés, you will find a highly enjoyable vision of a conflict that has gone largely unnoticed in cinematic history."

","I've only seen this film once, and I intend to make it that way. This part of my ethnic country's history was one of the most painful, and everything it depicted nearly broke me to pieces after I was finished watching it.<br/><br/>Anyways, good film. It showed how Korean films are improving. Story was not too shabby and acting was purely brilliant. Jang dong gun obviously steals the charisma and power as the brother and Won Bin dominates his own character as well. That girl was pretty good playing the ""about-to-be-married"" wife of Jang Dong Gun (Sadly the actress committed suicide. God rest her soul in peace""). The movie in its entirety was a decent war film in my standards. The mood and the environment captures the moments. Not only did it show the emotional family connections during the Korean war, but it also showed the conditions and horrible consequences of this war. Dead bodies in the street and ruined cities are just a way to give a little helping. I don't know what this film was intended to do, but either I hated the Communists or the South Korean government after watching this film.<br/><br/>HERE IS THE BAD<br/><br/>Now this IS a decent war film, which means it wasn't bad and it wasn't great. I won't go off saying how it was almost so similar to Saving Private Ryan. The style itself is all the same, not the story. The first bad thing I've noticed was the progression of the film. I absolutely HATED how the director just skipped scenes like they were nothing. There would be a quiet scene where Jang Dong Gun talks with his brother and all of a sudden, you hear a loud bang and it immediately cuts scene to the battles. He did that every time, and I was just horrified at the effects. The scenes just kept skipping past, leaving the audience in a state of confusion. The battle sequences were long. I'll have to say, I love war movies BECAUSE of the battles and violence, but this was just too much. There were so many random battles that took place. Like the average amount of battle scenes I've seen in war movies were 3. This one had like 16. I got sick of all the battle sequences it had. Random battles, and it just leaves the audience in the dust. Another bad I've seen which most other war films had, but this overdid it: the main character is the invincible, godly warrior who has laser for eyes and hack like he's in CS. He literally saves the battle from going wrong. While others are dying while hiding and struggling to move forward, the main character becomes the Rambo and with a gun in hand, nearly kills 100 people while charging at them, yet he doesn't get shot. There it is. That's just ridiculous right there. People may say, sure, it's pretty boring to watch someone just duck, cover, and shoot, but it's also pretty dumb watching the main character take on 100 enemy soldiers and winning without getting a scratch. If this movie wants to show how war actually was, then SHOW it, not make some superhero who can never die. That part literally made me mad. No, I don't believe the brother can be THAT smart and sharp and kill all those people. He grew up as a civilian, not as a inborn warrior. Hell, he's better than the sergeant who leads the group. In the end, he takes on like every South Korean soldier and when he turns away against the North, he just kills like hundreds of them with one machine gun. NO. Please, that did NOT happen and one guy can never be that good. <br/><br/>So, I'd say Taegukgi was decent. Make it accurate as you said it was, then it'd be OK."
"wandering-star","6","2","10","11 February 2007"," two brothers caught up in the Korean war
","I picked up Tae Guk Gi because I've never seen a movie about the Korean War, and thought it would be interesting to see one made by Koreans.<br/><br/>Tae Guk Gi surprised me in that the effects were great! - exploding shells in trenches, crossfire spitting up dirt on the lip of foxholes, realistic wounded, etc. So was the acting of the two brothers - I thought they were genuine performances.<br/><br/>I was really surprised though, that at the time of writing this, 43% of people gave this film 10 out of 10. I mean, come on! Do that many people actually think no war movie since, or in the future, will be better than Tae Guk Gi? A couple of the problems I had with it: 1) The Rambo-esquire scenes with older brother repeatedly getting ""lucky"" dodging enemy fire were a little over the top - I mean, I can believe you can be lucky like that once, but not repeatedly. 2) The two brothers stopping for dramatic dialogue in the middle of two battalions in hand-to-hand combat was a little hard to believe. 3) a couple of the scenes felt forced, for example, all the soldiers in their unit spontaneously introducing themselves clearly for the benefit of the viewer, and I promptly forgot three-quarters of their names anyway.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I liked the film and would recommend it to others - but it didn't blow me away. No matter what the hype says, 10 years from now it will not be regarded as highly as titans of the genre like Apocalypse Now, Deer Hunter or Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. But, I realize that at least some of the 10 million Koreans who went to see it will probably disagree with me."
"FilmFlaneur","7","2","11","23 December 2004"," A Korean Private Ryan to savour
","Taegukgi Hwinalrimyeo (aka The Brotherhood of War) is the most expensive film ever made in Korea and the biggest home hit this year. It is directed and written by Kang je-gyu whom some dub the 'Spielberg of South Korea', and indeed his film has a framing device which is very Private Ryan-ish, and although most of the ensuing film is concerned with the reuniting of a family, it is to a different point. One suspects that home audiences are less concerned by this indebtedness than Western ones might be. The film uses the 'two brothers go to war' storyline, but the peculiar nature of the North-South conflict ultimately gives the family dilemma a wider meaning, their travails reflecting the national estrangement and the recovery of the missing - a thematic reference growing as common in Korean films as is the shadow of nuclear disaster in Japanese.<br/><br/>Taegukgi contains very violent, extended war scenes full of those realistic effects which marked out Private Ryan, and has a similar epic feel. Its well shot and, even at 160 mins, (Director's Cut length: a shorter single disc DVD set is also available) never boring. However the film suffers rather from a melodramatic storyline, elements of which seems too contrived to entirely convince, including some amusingly telegraphed business (e.g Enemy commander in HQ bunker, by which the hero is waiting and listening, having fought his way through the lines heard shouting : ""Men! If they succeed in taking this bunker then we are all finished!"") and hoary clichés like the extended train-side farewell, participants running down the station platform to say a tearful goodbye and all. In contrast, one or two other moments were very moving (one standout is the climactic reunion sequence) and the extended, successful staging of the action scenes, full of devastating modern effects, will make this viewer revisit it again soon. Not among the very greatest war films, principally because of these plot weaknesses, and its sentimentality, even if it makes a brave try - but well worth seeing and I think is still the best war film of 2004."
"qonder","7","1","5","24 September 2005"," War really is brutal.
","One of the reasons I enjoy watching foreign films is that it gives me a taste of different cultures and viewpoints. I live in the USA. Obviously this film takes a Korean slant on the war. This film is a story about the Korean War and its effects on two brothers. The film starts in the present, but then flashes back to pre-war life and times of the two brothers. I like the strong sense of family shown in the film. The willingness of each family member to sacrifice for the betterment of the others. This part of the story touched my heart.<br/><br/>The war scenes are horrific, no blood or guts are spared. The heroism is remarkable, as is the driving force behind the hero. I can't speak to the historical accuracy of the war scenes, but they were very impressive. The war scenes were about as brutal and chaotic as I could have imagined, and then some. The film seemed a bit long, but that may have been part of the effect of the duration of the war. The film is not ""Saving Private Ryan"", but worth seeing just for the war scenes alone."
"samwzhang","6","0","4","7 July 2008"," A film of epic nature revolves around the unlikely ""love"" between two brothers
","I am literally torn between my sensible realization of how technically superior this film is to a horde of war films before it, and my raw human urge to cry out what an over-melodramatic cliché I've just witnessed. Films like this, I suspect, are toned to a rather specific audience, and recent turmoil in South Korea has led me to temporarily set aside my belief in the standard of good films, established over years of watching critically acclaimed (mostly American/ European/ Chinese/ Japanese) films, and assume that a different standard does exist for the Korean crowd, whose psyche must be vastly different from that of ours. And this film should have met those standards to have won Korean critical acclaim of such gigantic magnitude. I will therefore, attempt to separate my personal view from the obvious, so that readers can decide for themselves whether this film is right for them.<br/><br/>1. The lead actor is apparently a big deal in Koran soup opera, being instantly recognized by my Korean soup-opera savvy friend. Although I've always doubted the effectiveness of soup opera stars in a demanding role of a feature length movie, and Bin Won's two dimensional portrayal of the troubled younger brother seems to have confirmed my view, my friend was genuinely satisfied with Bin Won's performance. Her actual comment was ""look at how handsome Yuan Bin (his Chinese name) is!"" <br/><br/>2. The plot is the most puzzling part. A film of epic nature revolves around no other but the unlikely ""love"" between two brothers. I won't go into details but this ""love"" went out of step of my ""narrow"" understanding of human nature and psyche, and looks ridiculous especially when being placed before the backdrop of a brutal conflict (Or was the brotherly love a backdrop for the war?). Naturally my friend disagrees with me, and I don't think she is alone in thinking her way, and I quote: ""The plot is really engaging! So moving! Except for the bloody parts! I hate those"" <br/><br/>3. The technical achievement of the film is truly astonishing.<br/><br/>4. Side-characters are interesting, likable and sympathetic, another thing the movie does right.<br/><br/>5. There seems to be little political contempt in this film since every political agenda has been cast aside to serve the main plot (the unlikely love between two brothers), and although on a mechanical level both sides of the Korean war had been shown their fair share of ""evil"", the one-sided portrayal of the ROK soldiers as representing everything human and sympathetic leaves neutrality in disarray, and much more for the audience to wonder about the dilemma between the current South Korean public attitude toward their northern counterpart and a strong public desire for reunification."
