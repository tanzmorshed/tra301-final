"jmbellin","6","117","144","29 June 2009"," Decent Proposal
","Well, if I could split the movie into two, I would say that the first half is a superb Proposal and the second half is fairly traditional Hollywood pablum. In the first half, the wonderful comedic timing and chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds was terrific. The writing was first-rate intellectual, snappy sparring, even throwing in some literary references in the put-downs. Kudos to the Director, Anne Fletcher, and the Screenwriter, Pete Chiarelli.<br/><br/>The completely different tone in the second half, I surmise, could only be attributed to the studios/producers stepping in and stating that the film must appeal to a wider audience. We, then, get lots of family characters thrown in, with a great reduction of Bullock and Reynolds mutual screen time. And when they do share time in the second half, it's more about slapstick/physical humor (cue studios/producers needing appeal to wider, a.k.a, younger audience). Maudlin music comes in on the soundtrack, letting us know that this part of the movie is supposed to tug on our heartstrings.<br/><br/>I don't buy the inevitable resolution either. I don't believe that it is supported well or justified by what came before it.<br/><br/>The 1st 45 minutes is WELL worth seeing. I wish the filmmakers could have pushed and maintained the pace and feel for the entire movie. Reynolds and Bullock are so good, they could be this generation's Tracy and Hepburn. I'd like to see them in another project that follows through all the way.<br/><br/>BTW, this film was actually shot in Boston and (the Alaska scenes) in Manchester by the Sea and Rockport on the North Shore with digital effects adding snow capped mountains. You might even recognize Motif No.1, a famous small building on a wharf in Rockport which has been the subject of many famous painters' and photographers' work. It was also fun seeing some of my local Boston area acting colleagues doing background work in the film."

","The Proposal isn't going to win any Oscars, nor will it become your favourite movie of all time. However, it does exactly what it is supposed to do; that is to entertain you. The Proposal is the story of a tough editor Margaret Tate (Bullock) who forces her assistant Andrew Tate (Ryan Reynolds) to marry her so she can stay in the U.S. (Interestingly, in the movie Bullock plays a Canadian and Reynolds an American while in real life, the reverse is true). What happens next will not surprise viewers but they will get many laughs along the way. Reynolds and Bullocks are very funny and also very believable. Betty White (from the Golden Girls) almost steals the show as Andrew's 90 year old ""Gammy"". The beautiful Alaskan setting doesn't hurt things either. Overall this is not a unique movie or even a unique role for Bullock but it is a very funny (and fun) way to spend an afternoon."

","Although the movie is predictable, like most romance comedies are, nevertheless it was sweet. Sure a bit unrealistic in terms of the time line of the whole plot takes place but this is why we have movies like this, so you can escape into the fantasy of romance and humor. If you are looking for realism then watch a 3 hour drama, but if you want to escape for awhile and just enjoy a movie you don't have to think too much about then it's worth your time. If you don't want to pay to go see it in the theater, then wait for it to come out on DVD. I saw it during a private screening as part of the ATL Film Festival, for close to two hours I thought of nothing else and laughed and even cried a bit. I would definitely see it again. It may not be the best romantic comedy I have seen but the movie still holds lots of charm."

","Okay, I had been really excited to see The Proposal ever since it came out. I was hyping it up a lot when I knew it wasn't going to be a masterpiece, but I just love Sandra Bullock and Betty White and couldn't wait to get my hands on this film! When I did, it definitely lived up to my expectations.<br/><br/>The thing with The Proposal was you could predict the ending and predict some events that would be happening throughout the film and some of the main problems were cliché, but I wasn't basing my opinions on this movie to be,""Is it going to be predictable, because if it is, I won't like it!"" No, I wasn't like that, because I knew this film was going to be predictable here and there, but I was looking to see if they made it enjoyable and at least brought some fresh, new material to the table, which they certainly did that! I thought some scenes were just so wonderfully done and the whole movie itself was constructed perfectly for the type of movie that it is.<br/><br/>I had a really good time watching The Proposal and thought it was great entertainment with insanely lovable characters; I wanted to shriek with joy every time I saw Grandma Annie; a lot of incredibly humorous scenes at times, my favorites were when Margaret and Grandma Annie were dancing to the spirits which got the biggest laughs out of any part of the movie from me and when the dog was picked up by an eagle and Margaret was chasing it around trying to get her phone back; both hysterical, and some questionable, yet sweet and charming dialogue; Near the end in the office was cute and original, and the credits were funny as well with the dialogue in them. This movie while being cliché, as I've stated many times, did still pack a very powerful punch and made me laugh, cry and enjoy it tremendously, so therefore it succeeded in what it was meant to do in the first place and that was to entertain. I loved it for the light-hearted, pleasant and fun comedy that it is...."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","66","100","19 August 2009"," Refreshing and affirming
","My jaw is still aching, almost an hour and a half after the credits rolled. I don't recall when I last laughed this consistently and heartfelt at a new production. Yes, this is pretty formulaic stuff... if you've seen one mismatched couple romantic comedy, you've seen them all. This never claimed to be anything other than that. It definitely delivers what one expects from the genre, without any of it being phoned in or taken any less seriously. Not every film needs to revolutionize the craft, and shape cinema for decades to come. If everything was excellent, it would become the norm, and it would cease to be special. And I find it incredible and immensely positive that a movie with this kind of humor(observational, and largely derived from typical situations that happen to everyone) can still be made, and be nicely received. Humiliation and pain are not actually funny. They get a schadenfreude reaction, ""thank goodness that didn't happen to me"", and thus we move further apart, isolate ourselves all the more. This does the opposite, letting us get closer to each other, share the little things that we've forgotten are silly or ""off"" in our everyday lives. It does go a tad too far on occasion, to get the audience going, but those instances are few in number. The acting is great all-round, and the two leads have chemistry, and play off each other well. There are countless memorable sequences, jokes and gags in this. This contains ""moments"" between Bullock and Reynolds, as well, and they genuinely work. You feel for them. The characters are just about invariably well-written, interesting and credible. In general, the script is well-done. The music is pleasant and well-chosen. This ought to entertain nearly everyone, of any age. There is a little strong and/or risqué language, and a couple of usually mild sexual references, and this tends to be inoffensive. I recommend this to all who think they may enjoy it. Chances are that you're right. 8/10"
"Willwoodlen","8","140","226","14 June 2009"," better than expected
","We went into this movie more or less out of despair; the cinema offerings seemed uniformly lousy and we simply wanted to see a movie that looked like fun. This one looked stupid: I'd seen Betty White promoting the movie on Jimmy Fallon's show and the scene shown was idiotic, though it did have a couple of amusing lines. Well, we were all pleasantly surprised. The outcome of the plot might be predictable, but the road getting there is surprisingly sharp and entertaining. There are quite a few witty lines and exchanges, and the delivery and timing of the two stars and, of course, of Betty White are just about perfect. Both of the lead characters have surprises in their backgrounds to reveal, and the settings are beautiful. There are one or two scenes that are clunkers, but even the dopey episode with White's Grandma Annie doing a ritualistic dance in the woods ends up having some relevance to a later plot event. The movie is well thought-out and well executed, and the actors create characters who engage us, even if we don't know anyone quite like them in our own lives."
"adelmosj","9","131","227","7 May 2009"," Enterprising young assistant takes on hard-nosed boss - romance ensues!
","Producer/star Sandra Bullock turns out what looks like another box office smash. Typical of most ""chick-flicks,"" the trailer tells you just about everything you're going to see. Unexpectedly, though, the surprises come from behind the scenes. The film looks gorgeous (and not just the two lead actors): the prettiness of the interior sets is matched by the choice of locations. While much of the film is set amidst the beauty of a seaside town in Alaska, even New York City is made to look like something out of a story book. It hasn't looked this good since the era of Doris Day. Typical of such a film, the costumes, even on the extras in the background, are so well-coordinated with the locations that the whole thing feels like a ""realist fantasy."" <br/><br/>Likewise, the plot itself is reminiscent of the romantic comedies of half a century ago - complete with their morality, albeit updated enough in a post-feminist era for Ryan Reynolds' masculinity to function credibly in ""the Doris Day role."" This he handles extremely well, although Sandra Bullock deserves most of the praise. As a producer, she knows her on- screen strengths and weaknesses, and, most importantly, she knows her audience and, despite the hard-nosed ice-queen she chooses to play here, everyone will continue to love her. Frankly, I was surprised to see so many empty seats at the sneak-preview last night in Boston, but I hope that doesn't get the filmmakers down. The audience loved this film and it's going to get positive word-of-mouth from whoever sees it - young or old. It's going to be around for a long time."
"EUyeshima","6","31","48","19 October 2009"," Starts Off with Snap and Verve But Moves Soon Enough Into Predictable Rom-Com Territory
","Even though it so clearly apes the set-up of David Frankel's ""The Devil Wears Prada"", I think the first 25 minutes of this 2009 romantic comedy has genuine snap enhanced by the sharp comedy interplay between stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Once the story leaves the Manhattan publishing house for the pastoral wilderness of Alaska, the story reverts into a formulaic sitcom bearing more than a passing resemblance to Bullock's break-out vehicle, 1995's ""While You Were Sleeping"", including an escalation of comic deceptions and a heart-tugging wedding confessional. Give credit to the fortyish actress/producer for not giving in too much to standard ingénue behavior this time. In fact, she plays the alpha dog with Reynolds relegated to the traditional leading lady role. The result produces enough contrived shenanigans to please Bullock's die-hard fans thanks to by-the-numbers work by director Anne Fletcher (""27 Dresses"") and first-time screenwriter Pete Chiarelli.<br/><br/>The storyline has Bullock playing vituperative book editor Margaret Tate, a workaholic careerist who instills fear into her entire office. As her bullied assistant Andrew Paxton, Reynolds caters to her every whim in the hopes that she will help boost his publishing career. As is typical for an opposites-attract rom-com, a complication occurs when Margaret, a Canadian, finds out she is to be deported because her visa application has been denied. Instead of facing immediate termination, she manipulates Andrew to let her superiors know that they are getting married. This moment of desperate deceit leads to an awkward visit with an immigration agent who senses a green-card arrangement and requires proof of their relationship. In order to avert suspicion, Margaret accompanies Andrew to visit his close-knit family in Sitka, Alaska, where it is revealed his family is quite wealthy and in fact, run many of the businesses in town.<br/><br/>They continue their charade of being engaged, which of course, fans the flames of his family's enthusiasm for a wedding. The rest of the film is pretty much you would expect save a strange episode of Andrew's grandmother performing a native dance in the woods. It's funny to see how Bullock cleverly uses the same prickliness she displayed effectively in her near-cameo in Paul Haggis' ""Crash"" in this film's establishing scenes as Margaret. In turn, Reynolds shows smart timing as put-upon Andrew, and their interplay has a nice edge. Note how well they perform during the best scenes early on when Margaret baldly lies about their upcoming nuptials at the office and in front of the immigration officer. It's just when they move into more traditional rom-com territory where their chemistry feels weakened and the sparks doused. Chiarelli's haphazard screenplay doesn't help them as they have little beyond one bedtime confessional scene to make us think they may belong together. Craig T. Nelson plays a familiar role as Andrew's disapproving father, but their subplot weighs down the proceedings unnecessarily.<br/><br/>Except for one brief face-off with Nelson, Mary Steenburgen is wasted as Andrew's always-smiling mother. Betty White is a welcome sight as feisty Grandma Annie, although I wish the creators could have made her more like Sue Ann Nivens (""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"") and less like Rose Nylund (""The Golden Girls""). As the girl Andrew left behind in Sitka, Malin Akerman (""Watchmen"") is actually left stranded by the script, while Oscar Nuñez (""The Office"") grows increasingly tiresome as store clerk/male stripper Ramone. His absurd club performance, along with a nude run-in between the principals, just shows how little faith the creators had in the material to sustain the plot. Standard extras come with the 2009 DVD: a decent commentary track from Fletcher and Chiarelli (but sadly not the actors), seven minutes of outtakes, two deleted scenes of little interest, and an alternate ending which really just switches the locale versus the resolution."
"Jackpollins","4","57","95","21 June 2009"," Entertaining, but not good
","This is yet another predictable romantic comedy. The only difference is that Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock make it tolerable, and even a little entertaining. Ryan Reynolds stars as Andrew Paxton, a servant to Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock). They hate each other. But when Margaret figures out she's being deported since she's not an American citizen she turns to Andrew. They say they are getting married. Andrew's Grandma Annie (Betty White, the best part of the film) is turning 90, so they go to Alaska, where Annie and Andrew's parents live. We then enter the cliché parents. Grace (Mary Steenburgen), his wacky mother, and Joe (Craig T. Nelson), his uptight dad. This is not very entertaining. The laughs mostly come from Ryan Reynolds' calm personality. He just has a way of making me entertained. There's also Oscar Nunez, who plays Oscar on TV's The Office, playing Ramone. He will remind you of an aspect of Local Hero. This is not a good movie, but it might just be worth renting just for the mild entertainment. On second thought, you can just skip it."
"Chris Knipp","5","51","85","20 June 2009"," No laughs in Alaska
","The moment when pushy boss Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) suddenly forces her unsuspecting, docile, but ever-so-hunky young assistant Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) to tell her superiors they're to be married so she won't be deported back to her native Canada, there's a certain awkward amusement. But it's more in the way Ryan Reynolds plays it than the situation, as written -- our unease, and the actor's. If there is such a thing as ""reality,"" this ain't it. What's a Ken-doll type like Ryan Reynolds doing in a job like this? The answer is, waiting for this moment. Otherwise, if you had the sort of guy who might really be doing this sort of job, you wouldn't have a romantic comedy, and that's what the makers of the elaborately lame The Proposal are reaching for.<br/><br/>It's not just that the assistant would probably be gay, or a young woman, as are Meryl Streep's in The Devil Wears Prada. Well, yes, it is, in a way. The author of the Prada book had worked for Anna Wintour. This ill-conceived book editor is feared by everyone on the floor just like the editor of Vogue. But although she seems ready to fire anyone she doesn't like, she does nothing but read unsolicited manuscripts while riding an exercise bike and coax well-known authors into doing Oprah. Her assistant, who presumably takes care of everything else, is an aspiring writer and editor, but he still looks like a guy who spends most of his time at the gym.<br/><br/>The standard Forties material -- sparring guy-and-gal fall in love -- has to stand the test of 21st-century role-reversals, boss-lady, servile man. But the real problem is the serious lack of chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds. This is role for Katharine Hepburn, who could be imperious, overbearing, elegant, but very feminine. If only Ryan Reynolds were Cary Grant, but needless to say, he isn't. He's not suave, merely fresh and pleasant. The best you can say for him is that despite his bulky muscles he looks okay in a suit. The wardrobe department are the unsung heroes of this film. But it's not that Reynolds or Bullock does bad work, just that the writing sucks.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't manage to establish Margaret's dominance or Andrew's competence before the plot gets its sendoff. Instead, off they go to Alaska to meet his family on a weekend when the Paxtons plan to celebrate the ninetieth birthday of Andrew's Grandma Annie (Betty White). Clearly, Andrew realizes he now has the upper hand. Margaret threatens to fire him if he doesn't cooperate, but she has more to lose. And so he sets out to make her experience in Alaska hell.<br/><br/>But the new venue takes over and the comedy gets lost in the surprises Andrew's family offers. The Paxtons turn out to be by far the richest people in the remote town of Sitka (no, not Sitcom). This is the lazy way to handle the situation, so long as the filmmakers have the budget for it, which they do: poshness is so generic, so Hollywood. On hand are Craig T. Nelson from The Family Stone and Mary Mary Steenburgen from a couple more raucous but equally bad family comedies, 'Step Brothers' and 'Four Christmases.' And veteran Betty White, whose energy at 87 is admirable, but whose eccentric old lady role is annoying and cloying.<br/><br/>Anne Fletcher lacks inventiveness and finesse in staging the standard situations. When Andrew has to jump into bed with Margaret in the morning when mom brings in breakfast (the Paxtons are rich, but they still do all the work in their mansion, except at party time), the sequence is drawn-out and unfunny. When the still-unfriendly couple accidentally fall on top of each other while naked, it's more clunky than cute: they're like big icky wet statues. It's better not even to talk about the omnipresent Ramone, played by Oscar Nuñez of ""The Office,"" who apparently somebody thinks is funny enough to be a waiter, a general store manager, an erotic dancer, and the minister for a wedding ceremony. The erotic dancer part is excruciating. Only in Sitka, not, hopefully, in any other movie. Did the filmmakers bring in an actor from ""The Office"" to make up for how poorly they developed the office scenes earlier in the movie? <br/><br/>Oh yes, and there's other fun stuff like an eagle chasing a puppy and then flying off with Margaret's cell phone instead; Betty White chanting around a fire with a rug; Betty Steenbergen looking harried; and Craig T. Nelson driving biodegradable golf balls into the bay. When the two would-be lovebirds return to New York and tell the immigration officer they're in love for real now and willing to undergo his scrutiny, he says ""Let's do it!"" <br/><br/>Let's not."

","This movie surprised me, I have to say. While I did expect to be entertained, I did not expect to find a new favorite movie. What started out as watching it since my friend yelled at me, turned into me loving every moment of the movie. With characters that are both attractive in personality and looks, this movie stays on the track of the plot-line and has loads of character development. Each scene is planned carefully, and chemistry between the two is seen at the very start. The movie is in no way slow, and compliments it's attributes quite nicely. There was no moments where I believe the movie fell short. Their comedic scenes definitely cracked me up, which is very tough to do. Overall, I loved this movie, and I think it was done very nicely. I found myself watching a couple scenes over and over."
"Simon_Says_Movies","6","49","83","12 August 2009"," Hard to admire, easy to enjoy
","The Proposal is a hard film not to enjoy but it's an even harder film to admire. Aside from the two exceptional lead performances from Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock and the humour they create, the story is dowsed in clichés and left to drown. I need a film to at least be thoroughly realistic if not authentic, and the tired screenplay often delves into slapstick and camp when it should have let the leads carry the film.<br/><br/>Bullock and Reynolds ooze charisma in all scenarios here, and their chemistry is what anchors the film firmly in watchability, even elevating the film at times to outright excellence. And to The Proposal's credit for every cliché it puts forth, we often get a quick rebuttal of charm, but which ultimately asks the question, why in the first place? I am almost tempted to follow in critic gene Siskel's footsteps and swear off watching movie trailers, because all the best line are in the promotional material; I don't mean they are the only good lines, simply that they would have made the film even more enjoyable had they been fresh. Directed by Anne Fletcher, who has already had rom-com success with Step Up and 27 Dresses, takes a chance with Bullock in my opinion as most would have good with a younger, hot-at-the-moment star. She does not disappoint and in her role as boss, Bullock is certainly suited; imagine that, a character that looks their supposed age.<br/><br/>The plot is certainly one of contrivance, as are with most romantic comedies today, with the stern manger of a publishing firm (Bullock) essentially blackmailing her younger assistant Andrew (Reynolds) into marrying her so she can save herself from deportation and stay in the U.S. It just so happens of course, that it is Andrew's grandmother's birthday that very weekend and is heading up to Alaska for the celebration. Trapped in secluded north, will this faux engagement become something real? The worst scenes of the film take place in the office, with the underlings of the tyrannical boss quite literally diving for cover upon her arrival. We have surely seen in films like Office Space and The Devil Wears Prada that a work scenario can combine humour with realism without the need for the employees to act like Looney Toones characters. My first impression of the time frame in which evil over bearer and ambitious assistant fall in love was that of annoyance as such feelings would never form so quickly. However I may have initially judged too harshly, as is nicely illustrated, Andrew and Margaret only have each other. Andrew is ambitious and loyal, knowing everything about Margaret, and in turn Margaret is so dedicated to her job without any semblance of a personal life, he is her only true confidante and slowly the scenario becomes slightly less preposterous.<br/><br/>The Alaskan scenery is beautiful, and the supporting cast including the delightful Betty White, Mary Steenburgen and Craig T Nelson make for a well rounded and talented cast. My absolute favourite member, which perhaps not coincidently my favourite part of the film, is Malin Akerman as an old flame of Andrew's. It was so refreshing to see an ex portrayed as a nice, honest human being instead of a vengeful witch and it is these intermittent moments of true human emotion that wouldn't make me turn this film off if I happened by it again; even if I wouldn't seek it out on my own accord.<br/><br/>Read all my reviews at www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"

See, I don't get it, we have a ""romantic comedy"" script, no one changes anything, just the actors, every cliché in the book and somehow people fall for it. There is a needle in a haystack when it comes to a romantic comedy being actually funny or entertaining, but with the positive reviews that the IMDb users had been writing, I was actually thinking maybe this might be a good movie YOU IMDb USERS, how dare you?! Shame on you that you fell for it once again, I'm going to point out how my puppy could have written this script after I tell you the story, even though I'm sure you can figure it out for yourself.<br/><br/>Margaret Tate is the executive editor-in-chief of a book publishing company, Colden Books. All of her workers, including her assistant Andrew Paxton hate her, and she fires a senior editor, Bob Spaulding. After learning she is being deported to Canada, she forces Andrew to marry her, as his future is tied to hers. When the government investigates, Mr. Gilbertson informs them that they will undergo rigorous testing to prove that the marriage is not fraudulent. Andrew grudgingly accepts, under the condition that he is promoted to the position of editor and his manuscript be published. The two are forced to spend the weekend with his parents in Alaska in order to sell the lie. Margaret is very unreceptive of Alaska, and is shocked to learn that Andrew's family owns most of the business in Sitka. Andrew announces that he and Margaret are getting married. But as most romantic comedies, we know where this is all going as Margaret realizes the true value of family and Andrew realizes that Margaret is human as well, blah, blah, blah.<br/><br/>So tell me how in the heck is this original or funny? For God's sake we even have the clichéd run to the airport before the girl leaves. The big kiss in front of a huge crowd that starts the slow clap. The crazy family that break down the ""emotionless"" woman into making her think that they're wonderful when really they all belong in a mental institution. The only thing The Proposal was missing was the clichéd gay best friend or the bitter best girl friend! You have to understand, I try, I mean I really really tried to be nice and enjoy the movie for what it was, but how can I when I know exactly what they are going to say or what would happen next? How is it that in every romantic comedy the most opposite of people who brutally hated each other then all of a sudden fall in love in less then 2 days?! Why?! How?!

"Danusha_Goska","3","56","103","22 June 2009"," Cast: First Rate. Script: A Crime
","""The Proposal"" has a stellar cast and a suicidal script. The script begins brilliantly: Margaret (Sandra Bullock) a master-of-the-universe publishing exec who also happens to be very beautiful, has a younger, very sexy assistant – Andrew (Ryan Reynolds) – whom she forces to marry her because her visa has expired and she's about to be deported. Sandra Bullock is fabulously, convincingly, hateful in her opening scenes. She makes the Meryl Streep character from ""The Devil Wears Prada"" look like a shar-pei puppy in comparison. You really want to see this character put through the wringer, that is, to grow and change in response to challenging events. Ryan Reynolds is, as ever, handsome, suave, understated, smart, and a very interesting actor. As buff as he is here, and he is very buff, (preparing for the lead in the next X-Man sequel) it's Reynolds' intelligence and acting chops that are most arresting. Reynolds is as good as the romantic comedy leads from the Golden Age; he just needs the right script to be part of a classic. The rest of the cast, with the exception of an obnoxious stripper who should have been left on the cutting room floor, is similarly brilliant: Mary Steenburgen, Craig T. Nelson, Denis O'hare and especially Betty White are all solid professionals who've been fantastic in other movies.<br/><br/>There is so much promise here – the pressures and pleasures of an older man and a younger woman; the erotic frisson of a woman boss and a hunky, male assistant, working with symbiotic intimacy over high-stakes projects, the blossoming of love in an impossible situation as two people who both love books get closer to each other, the changes a champion witch might go through as she falls in love. Andrew is given a hometown love interest, the young, blonde, Gertrude. Why did Andrew leave her and his hometown and move to New York City to work for an impossible person like Margaret? Because he loves books and literature and writing and the life of the mind, that's why. The movie could have given us ONE SCENE that showed Margaret and Andrew bonding over their love of literature – and it didn't give us even that. What a horrible wasted opportunity. As discussion boards show, many viewers felt that there was no chemistry between Andrew and Margaret. That's all the fault of the script.<br/><br/>Rather than pursuing the potentially fascinating routes set up by the opening scene, the script takes a nosedive into the utterly crass. A sleazy Hispanic male stripper? Margaret confessing her faults in a way that unnecessarily compromises Andrew forever in the eyes of those who mean the most to him? Several false endings that spill over into the closing credit sequence? What's going on in Hollywood? Why can it produce game, top-notch actors who are also stars and not one coherent romantic comedy script since Norah Ephron?"

","This film was put together well, directed well, edited well, had some reasonably good acting, some funny parts, and even had some heart and believable chemistry. But it was Green Card lite. As usual far too many contrivances, conveniences and coincidences were crammed into a 72 hour period and simply undermined the story. There were also a couple of over the top and unfitting slapstick pieces including Betty White having to perform some Indian Earth chant that leads to Sandra Bullock performing an even sillier rap. A typically good Betty White was an otherwise believable spunky grandma, but was suddenly recast as a cartoonish loon. Ramone the wacky mr-do-it-all was an even worse distraction, while the ex-girlfriend was an unxplored sub-plot gone missing. I can only presume that the meaning and utilisation of this character was left on the editing room floor."

Only the last few minutes of pleasantness and romance during the credits. Hardly shows why they should fall in love at all.<br/><br/>The cast tries hard but some aren't suited to the roles. Bullock is looking a bit old for romantic comedies. Don't think she can do too many more. Betty White is energetic. Craig T Nelson looks a bit vagrant like. Mary Steenburgen is a bit too elegant for the boonies. Ryan Reynolds is not quite leading man - maybe his over boyish voice and behavior.

The key is how do you get there?<br/><br/>Maybe it's not fair to compare characters in one story to characters in another, but I'm going to do it anyway. Sandra Bullock's Margaret Tate, a boss who is despised by her inferiors, is reminiscent of Meryl Streep's Miranda Priestly in The Devil Wears Prada (2006, dir by David Frankel). But where the latter was given exemplification throughout to back-up the claims of hatred, the former fails. First-time screenwriter Pete Chiarelli doesn't take the screen time, nor story time, to put his characters on display. Very quickly we find ourselves in Alaska, admittedly a visually pleasant device in the film, where everything unfolds within a single weekend. And apparently a 4-day weekend.<br/><br/>Betty White enters as the energetic, but somewhat senile, grandmother to provide some life to this otherwise plain romantic comedy. Also, fans of ""The Office"" will recognize Oscar Nunez, whose character provides a few bright moments as a running gag.<br/><br/>Yes, I laughed. At best, there's some fun slapstick moments (of course it's always more fun when you are surrounded by 150 laughing audience members in a theatre). But when the humor starts to fade into the supposed climax, the realization of how awkward it is sets in. The characters on the screen say they are in love, but I'm not feeling it. Yes, they have learned something about each other and care for each other as human beings, perhaps with potential romantic interest, but not the sort of love that enables two people to spend the rest of their lives with one another. And because of the legal situation that sparks the inciting incident, these two don't even have a chance to let their relationship truly form. Essentially they've just jumped directly into marriage without any idea of what to expect from one another.<br/><br/>For a comedy film, that's a dismal conclusion to arrive at."

","I wish that I could say, Welcome Back Sandra Bullock, but that's not going to happen. I think the major issue with this movie is the genre it got stuck with. This was not a romantic comedy, but more of a movie about one's relationship(s) with others; specifically one's parents. So this movie was more of a Ryan Reynolds' vehicle than anything else. And if we stay with that premise, then I would have liked to see a lot more back story of why and how the father and son were so at odds with one another and some resolution, or at least know why the dad changed his mind (other than his own wife telling him to get his ^%$# together or the grandmother having to fake a medical emergency to get them to get along). That was much more interesting than the stale premise of a guy who deep down really loves the harpie he works for, or any of the (physical) comedy antics (which were not funny at all) Bullock tried to pull off. So much of this movie just was not plausible (the IM-ing at work and that she would never know about it comes to mind). But what really made me roll my eyes was the scene where Bullock is naked (you can so tell there was some body stocking, or something, going on there and that she was not naked) and she's covering herself up in front of a little dog. Please. We could have done without that totally, and just have her dash out to get a towel and run into Ryan. SB needs to move on, like some many other actresses her age, to roles that fit her maturity. Maybe that will happen with The Blind Side. Keeping these fingers crossed."

","I rented ""The Proposal,"" which I'd been wanting to see, at one of those $1 kiosks. If I'd paid real money, I'd be disgusted with myself. With a cast of very good actors, including Sandra Bullock, whose movies I never miss, it didn't fly. I gave it a 4 because the actors were good, except Bullock, though they had little to work with. Dialogue was annoyingly trite as was the plot (or lack thereof). Ryan Reynolds made this movie happen, supported by ""Gammy,"" Betty White, who was hilarious. The character Bullock played was unlikable through nearly the whole movie. In one scene she tries to get an eagle to snatch the world's cutest puppy so the eagle will give her back her cell phone!! How can anyone have thought that a funny scene? And she pretends to be terrified of the puppy as well, which is not realistic. She cannot bounce back from the beginning which shows her as a much-hated editor at a big publishing firm. That simply does not change, despite the fact that she professes a change of heart towards the end of the movie--the writers have made the change too drastic and sudden to be believable. Weak, weak, weak. . . except for Reynolds and the supporting actors. Even Bullock couldn't do anything with this dialog. Reynolds, on the other hand, was a pleasure to watch, giving the only zest to the obligatory nude scene, which was as contrived and trite as the rest of the plot. I'd give this one a miss!!"

This is a predictable annoying little trifle and Sandra Bullock is getting to be really annoying. At one point I said to myself ""If she clears her throat once more I leave the theater"" and within 4 seconds, I swear, she cleared her throat again. I didn't leave however. I wasn't alone and my two nieces (10 and 11) where laughing so I didn't want to spoil their afternoon. Ryan Reynolds, I have to admit, is really charming and has the comedy chops for a far better comedy. Where are the writers? Please! Bullock trying her hand as a sort of Miranda Pristley from Devil wears Prada, is totally unconvincing. Mary Steenburgen wasted in a non part and Betty White's age is exploited for some very low comedy. Her Indian ritual is unforgivably bad writing. I'm rating it with a 5 and not a 2 as a tribute to Ryan Reynolds because I would love to see more of him, hopefully in a script written by the writers of ""Tootsie"", ""Death Becomes Her"", ""Barbershop"" or someone channeling Preston Sturgess."

"lossowitz","4","6","8","19 March 2012"," Bullock is no Streep
","An ambitious young person has to deal with an arrogant, strict, unhappy, over-ambitious and mean boss and deal with her every whim. Sound familiar? The Proposal is in a way a copy of The Devil Wears Prada, be it that instead of a mother-daughter relationship, this one has romantic possibilities. <br/><br/>Sandra Bullock, however is no Streep, and that's what makes this movie so much less entertaining to watch. To play mean is not to be mean, and instead of deploying all the wonderful techniques that the lady with the three academy awards has to her disposal, Bullock just is a bitchy whiner. She never really is scary or powerful. She seems reluctant to be perceived as mean by the audience, and that takes any venom out of her remarks or actions.<br/><br/>Ryan Reynolds does not make up for that lack of credibility by never being really terrified. Bullock's character just tires him. <br/><br/>The plot has enough twists and lines to make the movie take flight, but it doesn't happen. The grandma could be the one that makes us laugh, but Betty White is no Streep either and just plays the clown, which is almost never funny. If you create a scene where an old lady thanks the Godmother in the woods dressed in a rug, the actress needs to take that ritual as serious as possible. Not act as if she is dressing up for a family play.<br/><br/>Comedy is the hardest form of acting, and this movie is proof of that."
"Turfseer","2","6","8","7 August 2010"," Deluded masses fall for Bullock's 'straw man'
","For those who haven't seen 'The Proposal', the plot is rather simple. Faced with being deported to her native Canada, publishing business career woman Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock), proposes to her assistant Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) that she marry him, in order to save her job and offer him a chance at promotion. The film has been compared to the 2009 dramedy 'The Devil Wears Prada'. Ostensibly, they both are about smug career women who are universally hated by their employees. But Meryl Streep's Miranda Priestly is a multi-dimensional portrait based on a real person and Sandra Bullock's 'Margaret Tate' is a dopey caricature.<br/><br/>Many internet posters have condemned 'The Proposal' for its predictability. Sure enough, Margaret Tate eventually comprehends the error of her ways and finally softens up; but it's what happens before the predicable ending (the 'softening up') that relegates the film to the trash heap.<br/><br/>There was a time when Sandra Bullock actually showed some talent as a comic actor. Consider Miss Congeniality—the film was humorous due to the cleverness of the fish out of water premise. Sandra's FBI agent character had to adapt in the prim and proper beauty pageant world. And we were attracted to Sandra since her character was realistically tough and confident.<br/><br/>Not so in 'The Proposal'. You would think that a tough as nails editor-in-chief would know how to handle herself, especially in the rarefied world of the Paxton family—both Tate and the Paxtons are quite well off. But no, Bullock plays Tate as a buffoon, someone to laugh at. Somehow, being in the more rural atmosphere of Sitka, Alaska, is supposed to turn Tate into a total klutz. Not only is she unable to efficiently move her luggage or climb down a ladder but she also can't swim! While Miranda Priestly was arrogant and sometimes petty, she also had an aura of competency that made her an attractive and interesting character. Until her sudden epiphanies toward the climax of 'The Proposal', Tate is completely petty and never shows any sign of competence. Take for example, the idiotic scene where the family dog is snatched by the eagle; eventually Tate saves the dog but she's more concerned about her cell phone, after the eagle flies away with it.<br/><br/>It's easy to understand why Bullock would be attracted to the 'straw man' character of Margaret Tate. As the dictionary tells us—a straw man is a ""fabricated or conveniently weak or innocuous person, object, matter, etc., used as a seeming adversary or argument."" The shrewd businesswoman that she is, Bullock realizes how the masses (the film going public) despise such characters as Tate, since most of us have encountered such arrogant people one time or another during our employment history. In reality, such people never realize the 'error' of their ways and usually are rewarded for their amoral behavior (take Miranda Priestly in 'The Devil Wears Prada' as the perfect example). Since the masses can't face reality, they would rather indulge in wish fulfillment by cheering on the comeuppance of a straw man. And that's exactly what Bullock has done here—provided a buffoon that the masses can sneer at—while she knows full well that a real tough as nails editor-in-chief would never be anything like a Margaret Tate who ""hates shopping and sightseeing"" and hasn't had sex for a year and a half!<br/><br/>Before 'The Proposal' gets all mushy with the failed marriage ceremony and Ryan Reynolds rushing back to NYC where he convinces Bullock that he's truly fallen in love with her, numerous bloggers and internet posters have taken note of many other unfunny scenes in 'The Proposal', that crop up before the sentimental denouement. A few that come to mind include: Bullock and Reynolds clumsily falling over each other while in the nude, Bullock being entertained by an amateur Hispanic 'Chippendale's' stripper and Betty White playing the grandmother dressed up as a Native American, performing a bizarre Native American dance for Bullock (followed by her equally bizarre hip hop dance in response).<br/><br/>Despite Ryan Reynold's sincere performance as Andrew Paxton, the character also doesn't make much sense. Paxton supposedly holds himself up as being true to himself (as well as being an anti-materialist) when he rejects his father's demand to come back home and take over the family business. But at the same time, he's willing to compromise his values by accepting Tate's illegal (and immoral) proposal, in order to further his career.<br/><br/>Even if one's 'heart strings' are pulled by the sudden transformation of the lovers' affection for each other at the film's climax, the bulk of 'The Proposal' is 'comedy' of the lowest sort. And Bullock too has hit new lows by agreeing to be part of this enterprise. The next time around, she should look for more excellent screenplays. One is named ""The Devil Wears Prada""."

Too bad, frankly speaking, word of mouth should have kept its mouth shut, THE PROPOSAL is just as bad as anything Bullock has ever done in the past except that now her looks are starting to go as well and by now she looks like she's Ryan Reynolds' aunt. Then there's lovable granny who takes Sandra to a strip joint for a never ending private dance and the love birds taking off their clothes (unaware of each other's presence), walking in reverse and ending up accidentally embracing each other naked in plain daylight (I guess the true odds of that were a bit remote).

","The Proposal is one of the most clichéd and routine movie formulas in existence. A comically unlikable boss forces her assistant to marry her so that she can sort out a visa problem. This seems to be moderately popular and plenty of people seem to like it. Why?! Just why? Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds do have plenty of chemistry. They're good in the movie and although they don't seem to star in that many great movies perhaps they deserve to. It has mildly amusing moments involving dogs, getting fired and various awkward situations. It's not aimed at me at all, but the best films can be enjoyed even by those who aren't that bothered about that kind of movie. I hated this movie. I don't know quite why I hated it, I just hated it. The premise is awkward to begin with and seeing it get dragged out over 2 hours when it's better off for a skit on a comedy show is agony. The script is absolutely by the numbers and makes the film feel like a landfill of clichés, unoriginality, stereotypes, stock characters and formula.<br/><br/>The direction is very routine and cinematically the film isn't interesting at all. It just doesn't have a lot of charm or brains, and it's so insistent on sticking to formula that you know every single thing that's going to happen 20 minutes before it does. It's just awkward situation after awkward situation but it's not funny it's just... awkward. This is an example of how stale romantic movies have become in recent times, although to its credit it's so formulaic and bland that means you don't need to watch any other romantic films as every single cliché in the book has been summarized in this. It isn't funny and it just feels annoying and the excess of awkwardness removes any real charm or surprises from the movie. Just don't bother with it if this isn't your sort of thing.

I don't pretend to make any excuses for why exactly I made the decision to see it. I knew exactly what I was getting myself into by RSVPing to an advanced screening, especially after being spoon fed the trailer before one out of every three movies that I've come to attend in the past month. I even went as far as to make an explicit promise to my guest and self that there would be zero badmouthing in between scenes. As much as I would hate watching the excruciatingly sappy, formulaic storyline unfold, I would keep my lips sealed and my opinions to a minimum. This time, I would give a movie of its kind a fighting chance.<br/><br/>Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock, Premonition) is nicknamed ""Satans Mistress"" by her co- workers. She is the epitome of shallow, cutthroat, bitchy book editors. Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds, Mr. Brooks) is her hard working, slave of an assistant whose personal life is second only to his bosses grueling work ethic and demanding hours. When Margaret is unexpectedly faced with the reality that she is to be deported back to Canada due to a mix up with her Visa, she decides to fake an engagement to Andrew despite his awkward and intrepid hesitation. <br/><br/>In fear of their ploy being discovered by immigration services, they elope to Andrews' hometown in Alaska to ""meet the family"". Mom (Mary Steenburgen, Clifford) and Dad (Craig T. Nelson, Coach) as well as Grandma Annie (Betty White, The Golden Girls) are more than surprised by their son's sudden plans of marriage, but they more or less accept it and from there it is up to Margaret and Andrew to keep from killing each other until the weekend comes to an end. <br/><br/>From the get go, Bullock and Reynolds' chemistry is something to be marveled at and is sustained right on through to the end of the film. This is due mostly in part to their impeccable handling of a tricky character arc. One minute they're at each other's throats, the next they are slowly and subtly falling in love. No easy task, but juggled perfectly. In a scene which takes place in the bedroom, Andrew on the floor, Margaret in the bed, she proceeds to reveal some of her inner most secrets, and it is then that we realize, she is human, she has feelings like everyone else and there is a clear cut reason for why she has become what she has become. Therein lies an emotional, heartfelt and extremely touching moment. In recent memory, I cannot recall the last time Bullock has brought such exposition and beauty to a role, so much to the point of reinvention. Reynolds, once again, shows that he has a gift for impeccable comic timing and plays off his leading ladies quirks and nuances perfectly. <br/><br/>It is clear from scene to scene that director Anne Fletcher (27 Dresses), a former choreographer, uses her past experiences to bring the characters of Margaret and Andrew to life, while at the same time giving them both a chance to breath by utilizing very simple shot selections and minimal technical glitz. The end result is similar to a dance in which each character plays off one another in moments that border impromptu and stark realism, yielding a variety of very funny, laugh out loud scenes.<br/><br/>Alas, ""The Proposal"" does have it's occasional blunders, one of which takes place between Grandma Annie and Margaret in which they dance around a bonfire in the woods singing their rendition of Lil Jon's ""Get Low"". Needless to say, it felt misplaced and brutally over the top. The same goes for one, which appears earlier on, involving an overweight male stripper. I could practically hear studio execs forcing it into the script for a few last minute laughs, but it falls flat and feels oddly manipulated. <br/><br/>For what it's worth, ""The Proposal"" defied my expectations and emerged as a pleasant surprise heading into summer blockbuster season. It is a small, unpretentious movie with a whole lot of heart and doesn't thrive to put a demand on your think tank. If there's one thing one might come away with from such a film, it is that the one person of the opposite sex that you loath the most, may just be the one you end up spending the rest of your life loving to hate. <br/><br/>In theaters June 19th, 2009."

We don't bother pointing out the thousand other legal options and loopholes in the plot, because by now it is obvious the characters are too dumb to take our advice anyway.<br/><br/>But let's get this straight for American muttonheads who believe that a ""Resident Alien Card"" (aka Green Card) process involves exams where you are quizzed like a schoolkid regarding which side of the bed you sleep on: there IS no such quiz! Take it from someone who suffered five years through the process: even if you're faking the marriage, an interview like the one Gerard Depardieu fails in GREEN CARD (1990) only involves parroting facts - the real horror of the Green Card process is the stark raving inefficiency of the Immigration and Naturalization Service itself. As Margaret correctly asserts, the INS only assign investigators to check on ""terrorists, not book editors."" Margaret and Andrew would have been lucky to get a Hispanic lackey who made them wait only four hours before mispronouncing their names calling their case. Instead, they get an officer who threatens to ""check on them"" at microbial levels, as if the INS has officers with that amount of time to waste. All they want is to ensure you insert yourself into the American economy, to generate income, to take it from you ""legally"" through taxes and other swinish practices.<br/><br/>The story takes Margaret out of her comfort zone of severe skirts and pumps so high her backside looks like a baboon in estrus, and plants the couple in Sitka, Alaska, to meet Andrew's parents. Though we know the filmmakers are trying to show Margaret's witch heart melting in this beautiful landscape, they only highlight more failings of the plot - the chemistry between Margaret and Andrew is non-existent and none of Andrew's family notice. His mother (radiant MILF, Mary Steenburgen) and grandmother (87-year-young Betty White) are so buoyant and welcoming, I don't have the heart to tell them they're in a bad romantic comedy.<br/><br/>They're portrayed to be such loving, stable people that they ""accept"" Margaret no matter her clinical coldness toward their son, who reciprocates with clinical coldness of his own. Either they're not mentioning the couple's detachment because they're sensitive - or they can't see it, in which case, they're mildly retarded.<br/><br/>Craig T. Nelson is the only realistic character, as Andrew's unrelenting, unforgiving father - until he has to cave to the unrelenting Romantic Comedy Arc of ""finding his heart."" Oscar Nunez as Ramone is an entertaining diversion as Sitka's resident caterer, store manager, minister and stripper.<br/><br/>Malin Ackerman shows off her beauty as Andrew's smalltown ex-girl, but unfortunately, does no stripping.<br/><br/>The two funniest scenes involve Andrew caught off-guard, thinking on his feet: when Margaret announces she is marrying him, as her boss breaks the news that she has to leave the country; and when both Margaret and Andrew relate the story of How They Met to a roomful of people, each taking up the story's slack from the other as they realize the other is making them look ridiculous in the story. Of course, the scene that this movie's target audience find the funniest - Margaret and Andrew colliding with each other nude - is contrived, idiotic, brainless and utterly hot for chicks.<br/><br/>Written predictably by Pete Chiarelli and directed adequately by former choreographer Anne Fletcher, THE PROPOSAL is one of those films where we know what's going to happen: two people start out by hating each other and end up liking each other. Which is an ironic twist because I went in liking the movie and ended up hating it.<br/><br/>--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania)."

","With a run-of-the-mill romantic comedy plot, ""the only male stripper in Alaska"", some crude jokes involving a granny, The Proposal wasn't on my watch-list in the beginning. After some terrible experience of Made of Honor or this kind of rubbish, I totally refused to see this movie.<br/><br/>However, when the chance actually come I saw it, and thought all the clichés are still right there, but in a forgivable way. With some good, layered performances and some honest and sweet scenes near the end, the movie is actually watchable, and with some good messages.<br/><br/>There were some reasons that I totally despised the idea behind the movie. A female manager in her 40s propose to a subordinate in his 20s to realize a fraud wedding? That would be disgusting. Not to mention Andrew(Ryan Reynolds) is principally what we call a big kid, that he had dysfunctional relationship with his father and could more relate to powerful females. In the movie, the justification that Andrew really loved Margaret is in their 3-year employment relationship Andrew already allowed Margaret to grow on him. Knowing all the ugly sides in the life, Andrew would be the best candidate for Margaret's husband. Right there, I got the message the movie wanted to send, that a family should be forgiving enough for the family member no matter how much they deviated from the traditions. Sometimes the point is not to accept the choice your family members made, but to accept the fact that they have the freedom to make their own choices. I, like Andrew's father, still have 1000 reasons to disagree with Andrew's marriage, but I got the message. Unfortunately these messages have to be watched very closely and heartedly to be found. That is quite a challenge if you hold the movie as a cliché to the very end.<br/><br/>All that was realized by Sandra Bullock's performance that in some sense worth an Oscar nomination. Her transition from the cold, mean manager to the broken soul exposed to Andrew's family was very convincing, especially in the last 15 minutes. Also, she was able to totally cover Ryan Reynolds' pale performance. Thanks to the detailed character study, the movie surpassed my expectation.<br/><br/>7/10."

","Was this supposed to be a great movie? Of course not, but was it supposed to be funny and sweet? Well, I think anyone can answer that. Just in case you have not seen the advertisements, The Proposal is about an executive, played by Sandra Bullock, for a publishing company who is startled when she finds out she will be deported from the US due to a technicality. Quickly she finds a solution, that solution is her secretary, played by Ryan Reynolds, his next job will be to marry the woman he is working for. This beginning sets us up for yet another bland and predictable ""romantic comedy"" to come out in recent years.<br/><br/>The acting in this film was about as good as it could get in a romantic comedy. Reynolds was actually quite likable as he seems to bring a nice and appealing charm to the screen. Bullock played her character to same type of tune she has done over the past decade or so, an uptight and ill tempered woman hiding her true feelings of loneliness and insecurities.<br/><br/>The writing which is just essential to a comedy as the performance of its characters just didn't work. Jokes that have rehashed and overused were applied in this movie just as well. Was this surprising? No, it was not but could it have been better applied? Yes, there was a lot of room for improvement here. Its not necessarily a bad thing for a movie to be predictable but it is a bad thing when the execution of the story falls apart within itself. The film is just to implausible and is sloppy in the way it is put together. This is a poorly handled script that is choppy and just can't sustain itself after the first five minutes. <br/><br/>Would I recommend this movie? It seems like a no but if you enjoy movies like this there is no reason why you should miss this film, especially based off my critique or others like mine. If your looking for an escape go watch this movie, but other then that I don't see a good reason to spend $11.50 to watch this."

The acting is very good, but can't be saved by this awful script. You kept wondering when the story was going to advance, but ended up sitting through scene after scene of the ""we don't really like each other but we had to get married because (fill in plot device)"". Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz nailed this routine in ""What Happens in Vegas"", a hilarious movie,and the same actor in ""Just Married"" with Brittany Murphy.<br/><br/>Betty White, in her mid-80's, is the one shining light in this film as the grandmother. She dominated the funniest scene in the film. Likewise, the epilogue that runs alongside the final credits is great.

","From the opening moments of sitcom-inspired office hi-jinks in this plinky-plonky rom-com, the outcome is never in doubt. When we first glimpse our leads - beautiful people Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds - the inevitability of how this film will leave us is cemented even further. There's a set formula to these kinds of movies, and knows well enough just how the target audience it so aggressively pursues wants to be left feeling. The key to a decent rom-com is having a funny script; one that will have you laughing and hoping the mismatched couple will finally realise their love for one another to care about how predictable the whole things is. Anne Fletcher's The Proposal does none of these things, and instead betrays the likability of its leads by having little zip, and keeping them apart for what seems like a large chunk of the movie.<br/><br/>Margaret Tate (Bullock) is executive editor-in-chief in a successful New York-based publishing company. She has an icy reputation in the office, and her panicked underlings frequently alert the others of her arrival via group e-mail. Her dedicated but overworked assistant Andrew Paxton (Reyolds) is the only one who tolerates her, and that is because he hopes to win himself a promotion through his loyalty and hard work. Margaret also happens to be Canadian, and after a minor violation of the terms of her work visa, she finds herself facing deportation and without the job she has worked so hard to get. In a panic, she announces that she has been seeing Andrew for the past year and the happy couple are soon to be married, much to Andrew's dismay. Sensing foul play, U.S. immigration agent Mr. Gilbertson (Denis O'Hare) keeps a close watch on them, forcing Margaret to accompany Andrew to a family get-together in Sitka, Alaska.<br/><br/>Despite never really convincing as a couple, and neither really having moments of clarity that will help us understand when the script starts to push the two closer together, the two leads are a joy to watch. Bullock is now a legend of the genre, and Reynolds demonstrates the cheeky charisma he wouldn't be allowed to fully embrace until 2016's Deadpool. It's solid proof that the fault lies with the material they're given. Once in Alaska, The Proposal becomes a sickly loop of increasingly bizarre comedy set-pieces, including a moment where Margaret must fend off an eagle attacking the yappy family dog. It's a sea of white, middle-class faces, and the only person of colour seems to be the Hispanic Ramone (Oscar Nunez) who, in a slight racist twist, works just about every job in town from store-owner to stripper. There's also the dull sub-plot involving Andrew's father (Craig T. Nelson), who wants his son to ditch his New York adventure to join the family business, which exists solely to give Andrew something to do away from Margaret. The stars deserve much better."

It myth sound somewhat original, but this movie still carries the exact same typical formula you'd see in all romantic comedies, I don't even understand why these movies are made without the writers trying to make an effort at being original and at least making a few scenes that are genuinely funny.

","For anyone thinking we'd see an end to the long string of insufferable movies that make up much of the romantic comedy genre (like ""He's Just Not that Into You"" and ""Ghosts of Girlfriends Past"") I present ""The Proposal"", two hours of stupid fluff directed, written, and performed without the slightest care toward making a watchable movie. ""Knocked Up"" this is not. More like ""Knocked Senseless."" <br/><br/>Sandra Bullock returns to being a romantic lead as Margaret Tate, an executive editor-in-chief of a book publishing company. She's tough as nails and because she's a strong woman in a high position, its only natural that every one think her Satan. Or so it goes in most stupid movies like this one. Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) is her long-suffering assistant. When Margaret's visa expires and she faces being sent back to Canada, Andrew and her hatch a deal to get married in order to keep her here. She gets to keep her job, and he finally gets promoted to editor. Just when the government starts investigating the relationship, Andrew must bring her home to meet the family in Alaska in order to sell the ruse. <br/><br/>Sitcoms usually start in this way and considering that, its no wonder the sitcom is dying. The screenplay by Peter Chiarelli moves along in predictable fashion and actually finds a way to dumb down a genre that doesn't really need to try that hard in the first place. The couple bicker, then feel guilty, then somehow fall in love. Some family melodrama (involving dad, played by Craig T. Nelson, wanting Andrew to be apart of the family business) is tossed in for good measure. It's a good movie for anyone who find surprises distracting, think that a romance should work just because, and who get kicks out of weak one-joke premises, the joke being that the couple is reluctant toward being stuck in this fake relationship. It's a tiresome idea that, at best, leads to cheap laughs like a scene where the two mistakenly run into each other naked or weak payoffs like when Andrew feels emasculated during Margaret's telling of how he fake-proposed. And director Anne Fletcher hasn't met a desperate attempt at comedy that she can't force to the point of stark awfulness. A scene where Margaret is given a lap dance by an out of shape exotic dancer or when she must chant and dance around a camp fire with Andrew's grandma just come off as eye-rollingly tedious. <br/><br/>I'll leave Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds alone here. They're both trying hard to make some of this funny and this relationship worth caring about but neither Bullock's turn as a career-oriented ice queen or Reynold's knack for sarcasm is enough to contend with this very paint by the numbers romance. Betty White, as the sort of movie-grandma who likes to poke around people's sex lives and divulge things about her own, gets a few little laughs here and there but for the most part ""The Proposal"" is no marriage in movie heaven and might as well just be left standing at the altar."

","This is a funny, enjoyable movie with alert directing and good facial acting. The chemistry between the Bollack's Margaret and Reynold's Andrew is fun to watch as they worm their way through the predictable consequences of an immigration scam. <br/><br/>The story is that powerhouse publisher Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is in immigration trouble and blackmails her secretary Andrew (Ryan Reynolds) into marrying her so she can stay in the country. To make the lie believable she goes to Alaska to visit his family. As they get to know each other, the movie draws toward the inevitable happy ending. <br/><br/>There are several good scenes including the dress fitting, Ramone the exotic dancer, the eagle stealing the cell phone, and just about all the office cubical scenes.<br/><br/>ON REALISM: Margaret is a self-centered bully, and she treats people terribly -- early in the movie this is funny as a spoof of office life, like ""Devil Wears Prada."" In reality it is unlikely that Andrew would see anything in her. This plot is not-at-all realistic, and it is an excuse to set up the comic situations of the movie. The Proposal is good because of the dynamics between the characters within the context of the ridiculous circumstances. The movie is more believable than ""Star Trek"", ""The Hangover"", ""Up!"", ""Terminator Salvation"", and about as believable as ""The Solist"". <br/><br/>This is light comedy with no redeeming social value, but it is well-done, and most people would enjoy it. <br/><br/>MORE: They showed too many jokes during the preview. <br/><br/>EVEN MORE: The end is OK, but they should have been more creative.<br/><br/>YET MORE: Sondra Bollack looks great for 45 years old."

The movie offers nothing new, and doesn't even execute a mildly-interesting concept well.<br/><br/>There's really not much to criticize here; the characters are done-to-death Manhattan Movie Clichés, their motivations confusing and unexplored. The plain fact is that you cannot spend 95% of a film dressed in desperately hip clothing, trading sarcastic barbs and reveling in the awkward pause, and still expect the audience to be ""touched"" when a few contrived confusing moments of what we're told is sincerity are stuffed down our throats in the final 15 minutes. <br/><br/>Too many scenes begin and stay flat for their entirety. Too many lazy attempts at the ethnically-diverse office mates, the ""crazy, liberated and offensive"" grandma, close-minded dad, and other tired characters that we've seen over, and over, and over. Also, a woman doing a small handful of amusing or not-quite-antagonistic things, and revealing a very shallow brand of vulnerability for five uninterrupted minutes, does not True Love create.<br/><br/>The worst part about this movie is that it has all these easy romantic-comedy staples, but oddly it tries to preserve some semblance of homegrown dignity by ignoring the punchline, and the result is tame jokes, bored acting and unconvincing heart, all wrapped up in some excruciatingly-long scenes. <br/><br/>Watching this movie felt like the writer and director took a trip to Alaska and had a profound and rejuvenating experience, but when they decided to tell us about it, the story ended with, ""Well I guess you had to be there."" <br/><br/>Some discipline in the editing room might have gone a long way for this movie, but I doubt it.

","Boy meets girl. Girl meets boy. They hate each other. They are forced to spend time with each other. Despite a few obstacles, boy and girl realize the other isn't as bad as they initially thought. Boy and girl grow to like each other in an unrealistically short amount of time. Just when they are about to be together, another obstacle is tossed in their way. Boy and girl overcome obstacle and kiss. The end.<br/><br/>That is essentially the formula for pretty much any Hollywood studio romantic-comedy and ""The Proposal"" is about as Hollywood studio as it gets.<br/><br/>The trouble with romantic comedies is that even before the screenwriter can type ""Fade In"" on his script, he knows the audience already knows the ending to his story. So he has to make the journey enjoyable and, more often than not, the journey doesn't quite work or fails miserably, as is the case in ""My Life in Ruins,"" for instance. True, ""The Proposal"" is not nearly as disastrous or dull as the Nia Vardalos film, but that isn't saying much now, is it?<br/><br/>The journey in ""The Proposal"" is awfully clichéd and unwinds almost exactly how and when one of those hackneyed screen writing gurus would want the plot to unfold. However, what eventually saves ""The Proposal"" are its two stars - Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Together, they don't have much chemistry - you wanna see real on-screen chemistry in romantic comedies, watch Carole Lombard and William Powell in ""My Man Godfrey"" (1936) or Lombard and Fredric March in ""Nothing Sacred"" (1937) or Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn in ""Bringing Up Baby"" (1938) or Grant and Rosalind Russell in ""His Girl Friday"" (1940) - but, individually, Reynolds and Bullock have charm, charisma and an innate ability to keep us interested.<br/><br/>This material is beneath Bullock. She can play these roles in her sleep and, I suppose, the lack of success of her more dramatic films - some have been utter duds and ""Crash"" (2004) does not count because she was just part of a huge ensemble and not the lead - forces her to continue seeking romantic comedies. After all, she is the woman who turned down ""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004) so she could star in ""Miss Congeniality 2"" (2005).<br/><br/>Bullock has a nice knack for comedy and does admirably here, given the limitations of the script. It's nothing we haven't seen from her before and perhaps it's that familiarity that brings about a semblance of charm to this picture. Reynolds tends to be a bit of a one-note player but, here again, it's an engaging little note. In his defense, he does have a fine sense of comedic timing and can turn an otherwise conventional line into something funny. Malin Akerman shows up in a throw-away role that she tries valiantly to make bigger.<br/><br/>You are not going to see anything in ""The Proposal"" that is unpredictable or you haven't seen in countless romantic comedies before. But Reynolds and Bullock bring an energy to the film that made me like it much more than I thought I would. It made me cringe in some places, when I saw screenwriter Pete Chiarelli trying so desperately to eke out laughs because he couldn't drum up anything original.<br/><br/>There's plenty of terrific comedic stuff to be mined here - immigration, older woman-younger man, workaholic bosses and much more - but Chiarelli is thoroughly content on sticking strictly to convention. And, given the lack of sizzle between Bullock and Reynolds together, he entrenches his script in formula. So we are treated to forced-funny moments - a ""remedy"" screenwriters seek in romantic comedies that rarely works - of seeing the wonderful Betty White doing some sort of American Indian tribal dance in the woods and Bullock hamming it up, and the over-use of Ramone (Oscar Nunez), making him the film's most annoying and unfunny character. We also get needless subplots, including a father-son conflict. I told you: It's as if Chiarelli kept referring to some screen writing handbook. <br/><br/>Anne Fletcher's direction is an uninspired as her previous effort, ""27 Dresses"" (2008). On the other hand, ""The Proposal"" is a more enjoyable film than ""27 Dresses."" <br/><br/>What's ultimately disappointing about ""The Proposal"" is that despite having essentially smart characters, it gives them nothing smart to do. What a pity. It was, however, refreshing to see an older woman-younger man relationship on film. After sitting through Catherine Zeta-Jones falling for Sean Connery or Nicolas Cage in bed with Jessica Biel or Harrison Ford romancing Anne Heche or Clint Eastwood hooking up with Rene Russo, it's about time we saw the flip side. And as for the well-choreographed - and much talked about - nude scene in ""The Proposal,"" there's one thing you can certainly say: Bullock: has one heck of a body."

The significance of Ryan Reynolds rises. The immigration agency will be checking every detail of this possibly fraudulent marriage so everything must look kosher -- Reynolds' family in Alaska must have met the bride-to-be and so on.<br/><br/>The elements of an amusing plot may be there but the inspiration isn't. Amusing incidents aren't that amusing. The dialog says nothing remotely memorable. The scenes slow down for laughter but little is likely to be forthcoming.<br/><br/>Here's an example. After Reynolds drags Bullock off to Sitka to meet the family, we have the mismatch between the city mouse and the country mouse. She's wearing heels and has to climb down a ladder in order to enter a boat. It seems to take forever, while the boat crew watch her waving her shoe around, searching for the next lower rung. ""I'll help you,"" says Reynolds from below, placing a hand on one of her buns. ""Hand off ass,"" snaps Bullock.<br/><br/>The whole affair is pretty predictable. (I'll let the experienced viewer guess the ending.) Award for most engaging personality and best performance goes to Betty White, who must be in her late 80s and can still cause a grin.

More formulaic than just about any film that I've ever seen.<br/><br/>After awhile, I started getting the same feeling that I did when I saw Prom Night: I was calling out what was going to happen next thirty minutes before it happened. It got quite annoying. There's a scene for an obvious setup for a gag in which Bullock and Reynolds end up in the same room without seeing each other and both get naked to take a shower. It's such an obvious setup for ""hilarious misunderstanding"" that I wanted to turn off the film. And the film is *so* predictable. They force themselves with each other but then *gasp!* they start falling for each other. I mean, *who* could have seen *that* coming?!<br/><br/>As for the performances, they were nothing special at all. I thought Reynolds did okay, but his character was entirely uninteresting to me. As for Bullock, she was bad. She wasn't Kristen-Stewart-bad, but she was still worse than I've ever seen her before. She just seems so lazy with it, as if she didn't really care about the picture. Sandra Bullock played an executive type character who will be kicked back to Canada from whence she came, so she must marry to stay in the country and with her job.<br/><br/>But here was a *huge* problem I had with the movie: why did that guy *care* if they were really in love or not? A marriage is a marriage, dude, so calm down. It's not like they were forging the marriage, so what is going to matter if she just does it to stay in the USA? I did not like The Proposal much at all. Of course, I liked Betty White, but that's because she was Betty White. And even she was subjected to some really lame setups.<br/><br/>The Proposal wasn't total crap, but it's devotion to formula is what made me so frustrated by it. It might have had some potential if the filmmakers had bothered to do anything new with the film, but they didn't bother. No effort put into story, so no effort by me to be entertained.<br/><br/>3/10"

","The resident dragon lady at a New York City publishing house will be deported back to her native Canada if she doesn't marry her male secretary, who despises her. Woebegone romantic material from screenwriter Peter Chiarelli, who flails away with the most obvious gags. For the first hour, Sandra Bullock (who also served as executive producer) and Ryan Reynolds testily badger each other, culminating with Bullock threatening her would-be fiancé with castration (that joke never was very funny). The final 47 minutes suddenly turn warm and fuzzy--nothing surprising about that, though the two stars are obviously more comfortable with this territory. Chiarelli is so hung up on his laugh-lines that he never does get around to creating engaging or appealing characters; despite a friendly cast, the emphasis is not on the people but on the jokes. Setting the entire second act in Alaska (during summer solstice with constant sunlight) doesn't really work, either...it's too disconcerting for an assembly-line comedy. The two protagonists attempt to fool the assistant's large, bustling family with their sham engagement...and wouldn't you know it? His parents decide they should get married right then and there (in the barn--it's a tradition after all!). ""The Proposal"" is a continual cop-out without an ounce of wit, coasting on Bullock's built-in good will and even reprising some of her former movie highlights (like a Greatest Hits package). It's a laughless affair. *1/2 from ****"

","This film has its moments but it is really quite predictable and i personally was expecting much much more from it. Ryan Reynolds totally stands out and Sandra bullock looks very clumsy and quite old. Malin Akerman looks very pretty and Oscar Nuñez is really terrific and very funny. The movie overall is just about average with nothing special to offer. It just does not stand up to all the hype that was created.It could have been better if it had a better ending,there weren't even any twists or any immensely funny moment in this film.

There's the twist at the end where they part but then, WOW, they meet up again in some unbelievably cheese ridden scene complete with soft music in the background and crowd applause when she mutters the inevitable tired lines, and they all live happily ever after. And we all go 'awww'. Give me a break! <br/><br/>RIGHT, positives....umm....Sandra Bullock looks great for her age?

","This movie is probably one of the most generic and dull romance comedy I have ever seen. It's just way too predictable and the humor and morality is like from a very very long time ago. I got a few chuckles from some scenes but that is about it, the film was just not funny for me. As a matter of fact the only people that I saw laughing was old people, and I am not trying to be biased against old people or anything and I seen plenty of old people that enjoy rude and crude comedy, but this film was just way to old fashion and just tries too hard to be cute. I am not saying a movie that goes about it with cute humor is necessarily a bad thing, but it just isn't funny and it's very dull and generic. There is also a scene where Sandra Bullock comes out of the shower almost naked which almost makes you wanna gag. I guess it was trying to be one of those sweet comedies, and lot of old people and some girls may enjoy this movie and probably worth a rent when watching it as couple.<br/><br/>4/10"
"rfreddy","1","7","13","20 June 2010"," Stupid movie!
","One of the worst romantic comedies of recent times. I have absolutely no idea how everyone gave good reviews for this god-awful movie! I thought the theme of the movie is very very clichéd. But that's not a big problem. Because you can make a good movie with clichéd themes, but only with good treatment. This one lacks that. The story is told in the lamest and boring way possible. The biggest fault seems the casting of Ryan Reynolds opposite Bullocks. She is evidently much older than the hero and more than that, they just don't make a good pair. It's pathetic! Secondly, the whole Paxton family behaves so odd and crazy that one wonder why they're not living in Antarctica instead of Alaska! Thirdly, there's no specific reason shown for the transformation of 'hatred' to 'love' between the two lead characters. If seeing an elderly woman nude is a reason enough, then I don't have anything more to say! Stupid movie!"

","In New York, the Canadian Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is the successful self-made chief-editor of the Ruick & Hunt Publishing and loathed by her coworkers. Margaret lost her parents when she was sixteen and is tough with the employees of the office. Her executive assistant and aspirant editor Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) has been working with her for three years without any recognition. When Margaret has problems with the immigration due to an expired visa and is threatened of deportation, she blackmails Andrew to accept to marry her; in return, he would be promoted to editor and she would publish his book. Meanwhile, the skeptical clerk of the immigration department Mr. Gilbertson (Denis O'Hare) schedules an interview with Margaret and Andrew after the weekend. The couple travels to Sitka, Alaska, to celebrate the ninetieth anniversary of Andrew's grandmother in their real estate and Margaret is welcomed by his warming family. Along the weekend, she gets closer to Andrew's family that asks her to marry Andrew in their barn, since it is a tradition in the Paxton family. And the tension increases when Mr. Gilbertson appears out of the blue in Sitka promising to charge Andrew for fraud.<br/><br/>""The Proposal"" is a delightful entertainment and the story is very funny. Last week, a friend of mine recommended this romantic comedy and my wife and I really enjoyed it. The shape of forty-five year-old Sandra Bullock is amazing and her difference of age with thirty-three year-old Ryan Reynolds Ryan is not visible and does not affect their chemistry; they form a romantic pair that really works. However, Betty White and Oscar Nuñez steal the movie in the roles of the adorable grandma and the versatile handyman. I saw this movie on DVD and I liked much more the alternative ending in the credits. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""A Proposta"" (""The Proposal"")"
"sdquinn2-1","2","6","11","19 October 2009"," Long In The Tooth
","Sandra Bullock is really getting a little long in the tooth for this type of role. This type of role has passed her by 10 or 15 years ago. It is time for Sandra to start seeking new material. This movie would have been more appropriate for a woman 30-35 years of age. Say, Reese Witherspoon. There is a scene in the movie where Betty White gives Sandra Bullock a fertility blanket, I suppose to help her procreate. Well, that blanket really has its' work cut out for it because at the time of this movie Sandra Bullock was 45 years old. The movie itself was no great shakes, been there, seen that. It is mildly disconcerting how readily Ryan Reynold's character is ready to commit immigration fraud. Ho-Hum, any law I disagree with I can readily flaunt. It is also disturbing to see elderly actors/actresses like Betty White used in such a sleazy manner. We get it, ha-ha, an 87 year old woman goes to the strip club, how trendy. How would you like to be the stripper for a room full of 87 year old women? All in all it was a mediocre story, mediocre acting, and nice visuals. About 2 is all I can give it."

","Cute, entertaining, great cast with predictable story line. It's nothing new, but they're all nice to look at and there are a few moments where the situation is treated almost realistically. During the screening I went to there was lots of laughter, but I seemed to be the only one who gasped when Bullock's character talked to people the way she did. I guess these characters weren't really supposed to be the kind of people you might work with. Come to think of it, the more I analyze it, the more I take away from it. Just go and put yourself on autopilot and don't try to figure out whether it could really happen. Enjoy the Ryan Reynolds eye candy and try not to wince at how skinny Sandra Bullock has become."
"jazzfreak","3","24","63","5 May 2009"," Good trailer, awful movie
","What is the best thing I can say about The Proposal? Two word: Ryan Reynolds. The movie will further cement the actor's rep as a very likable and talented, soon-to-be full-blown movie star. (Especially with today's news that he will be the star of the next X-Men feature.) That aside, this movie is one major disappointment.<br/><br/>Full disclosure: I'm a fan of the rom-com genre and, as such, I tend to cut them a lot of slack. The Proposal, however, just doesn't cut it. If not including every cliché in the rom-com handbook, it certainly covers a slew of them.<br/><br/>Predictability is one thing. Poorly written and badly directed, with several irritating lapses in logic (that are not even plot-driven, which makes them all the more irritating) this is a movie to be avoided at all costs, especially for fans of Sandra Bullock and Betty White."
"g-w-jones26","2","5","9","1 August 2009"," What a disappointment
","This film needed actors like Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn to deliver the slapstick, say the lines and recreate the scewball comedies of the 1930s, to get us through today's depression. Alas the two leading actors were dull and plodding. Mary Steenburgen and Betty White were wasted. The Director, Anne Fletcher, certainly made it look like her first film, cobbling together TV-sitcom type scenes with no linking and drive. It was a fake film, not even shot in Alaska. If this is good romcom, then the rest must be awful. What are the top three romcoms of recent years? We need to know so we can escape back to the surefire comedies of yesteryear."
"popawoody","10","14","35","15 June 2009"," Doesn't Get Any Better Than This
","I was prepared to dismiss ""The Proposal"" as just another mildly entertaining, ""formula"" romantic comedy. I confess I completely underestimated this film. We saw this in a week-early pre-release screening. Even a week before release the buzz must have been good since the theater was sold out to the last seat. I swear everyone there was rolling in the aisles for the entire film. Bullock and Reynolds have great chemistry and both have pitch-perfect timing. They're supported by an incredible cast that includes Mary Steenburgen, Graig T. Nelson and Betty White. White, in particular, is a crack-up as the feisty 90-year-old Grandma Annie.<br/><br/>This is not one of those exasperating comedies that uses up its four good jokes in its trailer. I've seen some commentary describing this as a cross between ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and ""Green Card"". That is a fair description of the plot but it does this film a disservice. ""The Proposal"" is very much more than that. The writing here manages to be both wicked-smart and belly-laugh funny and the entire cast sells it in every scene. These guys really hit this one out of the park! A nearly perfect film! 10+ **Stay for the credits, by the way.**"
"travel-lightly","1","6","12","13 December 2009"," Are you kidding me?
","The emotional connection between the main characters is not believable. They simply do not have enough conversations in which we see them get to know each other, leaving it hard for us to believe a relationship can realistically be developing between them. <br/><br/>This movie relies on slapstick type humour to the extent that it literally 'slaps two naked coworkers together'. Slapstick humour can be funny, but I don't recall laughing much during this film. The film really is more of a ""comedy"" based on an unrealistic situation, than a romantic comedy.<br/><br/>I cannot deny that this movie really disappoints, even though I am fans of Sandra and Ryan!! I have to wonder if this film was rated highly by some individuals who could not see far enough past their love of these actors.<br/><br/>The Ugly Truth was at least a little better ... See it or buy that one for someone for Christmas instead if you need to get a romantic comedy... I simply cannot believe the Proposal is getting better ratings. <br/><br/>Your time is better spent doing anything other than watching this movie."

","The Proposal (2009)<br/><br/>Well, I love Sandra Bullock, and the theme sounded good, and so I made myself enjoy those aspects of this film. But it' s formula flick. It has great laughs and some groaning moments and some clichés and silly parts that are forgettable. Not such a great film, as films go, but fun, as fun goes. That's not so much to scoff at.<br/><br/>Oh, it's a romantic comedy, probably falling in some ""chick flick"" category, and on that score it works. Bullock is frankly terrific--she plays an unlikable character and you like her anyway. She got her kudos recently with ""The Blind Side"" and deservedly, but she has a whole slew of other films, most of them pretty slim affairs, where she is alive and spontaneous and remarkable anyway. Her love interest here is a flat but charming Ryan Reynolds, who often plays these kinds of parts (and has a way of making it natural, but never quite inspired). <br/><br/>The director, one of a whole host of young women directors finally going mainstream, did ""27 Dresses"" previously, which put her on course here. It would be nice to see her not settling for a routine money maker, but use her ability to create a easy, funny, natural mood for something a little less superficial. That might just take better raw material.<br/><br/>But this is what it is, and if you're in the mood to not work too hard or be too involved, this might just pass the evening."

","In The Proposal Sandra Bullock finds herself in real dilemma. A workaholic executive in the publishing business, she's Canadian by birth and has failed to renew her visa. As she says, that's practically being an American anyway. Not good enough says immigration official Denis O'Hare and Bullock's boss Michael Nouri agrees. Sandra's got to do something fast.<br/><br/>Enter Ryan Reynolds her hunky young executive assistant who for better or worse has his career tied to her's. What's a guy to do, but go along with those other for better or worse words as she announces to the world that her young assistant is also her fiancé. It's not the most romantic of proposals, but he'll go along at least temporarily until INS stops looking and then they can get a quickie divorce.<br/><br/>But then to go along with the gag, Bullock and Reynolds fly to his home town which is Sitka, Alaska and at that point The Proposal becomes a combination of The Devil Wears Prada and Northern Exposure. Enter Reynolds family which is parents Craig T. Nelson and Mary Steenburgen, grandmother Betty White, and a former girlfriend in Malin Akerman and a host of town characters that look like some of Rob Morrow's former patients. Bullock who lost her family early on and has none to speak of gets really comfortable with them and very comfortable indeed with Reynolds.<br/><br/>Sandra and Ryan certainly make a nice pair of leads. But I think acting honors go to Betty White who's pretty close in real life to the 89 year old granny she plays here. They also go to Denis O'Hare. He's a great example of a smarmy and officious bureaucrat people hate instinctively.<br/><br/>Ironic isn't it because Sandra Bullock is not a terrorist, in fact she's contributing quite a bit to the American economy here. The Proposal takes a strong look at our immigration laws which are incredibly out of whack in this country. Our strength as a nation was the immigrants who came here for a better life. Now we seem to discourage that.<br/><br/>As for Reynolds, it might be a wise career move he's making, but as it turns out these two really get to know each other and it might just work out after all.<br/><br/>The Proposal is a really nice romantic comedy, don't miss it while it is still in theaters."

","The Proposal is a fun little romantic comedy starring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Both actors were believable in their roles and played realistic characters. Much of the fun revolved around some of the minor characters; one being Ramone and the other character played by a true American treasure, Betty White. Betty was very funny in this film and kudos goes to the casting director for getting her in this picture. It was also great to see Mary Steenburgen and Craig T. Nelson.<br/><br/>For you guys who want to bring your lady to a decent romantic comedy...one that you can sit and watch without having to puke, this one is worth a try. Your girl will be happy you went to this film with her and you should be able to have a few laughs as well.<br/><br/>The basic premise is that Bullock, who is Reynolds' boss, will be deported back to Canada unless she marries an American. So she orders Reynolds to marry her and they embark on a trip to Alaska to visit his family. The romance and the comedy then unfolds. A fun little film acted very well. Rating 7 of 10 stars."

","The story might have made more sense with another alien citizen than a Canadian. Maybe an Indian or a Chinese. That's because there are more work around for Canadian willing to work in USA on the long-term. Even truer since Nov. 2008 where NAFTA TN Status has been upgraded to 3y, renewable with undefined limits. Anyway the movie is neither boring nor good. If you like movies with lots of talking but not much actions then it might be for you. It all relates to a setup marriage to avoid deportation. When the immediate family get involved it cause more troubles than solve issues. Father, mother, grand-mother, ex-girlfriend, etc. Just a useless mess.

"Lejink","5","1","1","13 September 2010"," Decent proposal
","For at least the first half of its running time, I found this a reasonably amusing rom-com. Unfortunately, the plague of sentimentality sets in for the second half, reducing the laugh count and increasing the cringe factor to the movie's overall detriment.<br/><br/>Those early scenes, almost exactly mirroring the opening shots of the similarly plotted ""The Devil Wears Prada"", raise a good few smiles as Sandra Bullock's hard-nosed career-obsessed uber-bitch walks all over her winsome P.A., country-boy-in-the-big-city Ryan Reynolds and everyone else in the major publishing house until she gets a call from the Immigration Service on her right to stay in the good old U S of A. Cue her impromptu solution, an immediate engagement to nice-guy Reynolds and their visit to his native Alaska, ostensibly to celebrate his grandmother's 90th birthday but ultimately to break the news of their sudden engagement to his nearest and dearest.<br/><br/>The funniest scenes are those where ice-maiden Bullock gets her iceberg chipped away by the dottiness and homeliness of Reynolds and his family - her meet-up with granny Betty White in the woods chanting out her alternative mantra is hilarious as is her encounter with the only male stripper in town at a girls' night out organised by her to be on-laws.<br/><br/>Of course given that this is a Sandra Bullock starring vehicle, I should have accepted her thawing out to reveal a marshmallow centre that Reynolds unaccountably warms to - his still-interested old girl-friend seems a much better match for him, plus of course Reynolds gets to sort out his difficulties with his stubborn old dad along the way.<br/><br/>The acting is pleasant enough, Bullock, better when she's playing the toughie than the sap, Reynolds nicely underplaying in the fashion of his near lookalike predecessor in films of this type from a previous generation, Ryan O'Neal. Mary Steenburgen, whom I've loved since her introduction to me in ""Tender Is The Night"" about 30 years ago, is the best looking female in the film however; although she doesn't get much to do, I'm pleased to see her still getting parts in big Hollywood films.<br/><br/>As I said, it's a pity that the film lost its way for me on its path to the inevitable happy ending, but as modern-day family entertainment, this wasn't bad at all."

"jboothmillard","5","1","1","9 May 2010"," The Proposal
","I had seen the trailer for this chick flick, and I knew exact;y what to expect, I was expecting it to be near the same quality or theme as While You Were Sleeping, as it had the same star, and I was technically correct. Basically pushy boss and chief-editor of Ruick & Hunt Publishing, Margaret Tate (Golden Globe nominated Sandra Bullock) finds out that her visa has expired and she may face deportation back to her home of Canada. To avoid this, she says to the men that threaten this that the man that happens to walk in the office, employee Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds), that he is her fiancée. To make it an official engagement, convincing both immigration officer Mr. Gilbertson (Denis O'Hare) and the whole family, Margaret, who has no family of her own, has to meet Andrew's family, and he will only go along with it if he is promoted. So they head to Sitka, Alaska to spend the weekend meeting Andrew's mother Grace (Mary Steenburgen) and father Joe (The Incredibles' Craig T. Nelson), and celebrating the ninetieth birthday of Grandma Annie (Betty White). At first Margaret and Andrew are not very keen on spending time with each other, especially close, but slowly they are beginning to get used to each other's company. By the time they really have to think about whether a wedding is happening, they have truly fallen for each other, and they can't keep the truth from everyone, but don't worry, they sort it in the end, nearly. Bullock is a little more feisty than normal, maybe that's why she was picked for her Oscar winning performance in The Blind Side, Reynolds is okay, and the supporting cast are alright, and even though the film is a very predictable story, there are small moments to giggle at. Worth watching!"

","After she is discovered as being a Canadian without a working visa, this bossy she devil of a woman black mails her young assistant into marrying her so she can stay in the U.S. Hilarity would then ensue as they try to fake this engagement to his family.<br/><br/>This rom-com did pretty well at the box office, I'd have to say that it is because of the comedic chemistry of the two main stars. Both Reynolds and Bullock do very well in the film and since they are actual friends in real life, their comedic timing is great when they work off one another. The film is set up nicely and it works until the obvious romantic comedy ending comes into play. It's almost as if there is an unspoken rule that must be followed, every romantic comedy must end the same way. I was praying for this one to throw the audience a curveball, but that never came. I find it harder and harder to enjoy films like this where you can map out every single plot point and turn in the film.<br/><br/>The supporting cast really held the film together for the most part. Betty White steals every scene she is in,. Mary Steenburgen and Craig T. Nelson are Reynolds parents, they fit their roles nicely, but could have been used a bit more. Steenburgen is playing a nicer version of what she did in Step Brothers and Nelson is playing a meaner version of what he did in The Family Stone. These two talents are used nearly enough in this film. I'm still wondering what the purpose of having Malin Akerman in the film was, her character seemed to be complete filler and after seeing this film people may never look at Oscar from the Office the same ever again.<br/><br/>The film hits every romantic comedy cliché it possibly can, everyone it hit I died a little bit inside. I wanted this one to be different. Of course they start off not liking each other, of course while they fake it they unknowingly start liking each other, of course she feels bad at the end for doing what she is doing, of course their plan backfires and everyone finds out, of course there is a mad chase to get the girl before it's too late, of course he professes his love for her that they think is real and of course the audience begin rolling their eyes. Spoilers? I don't know, it seemed pretty obvious from the beginning. Can I fault it for following the same formula that every film before it does? Yes, of course I can.<br/><br/>I suppose to you are into those films, ones that you know exactly what is going to happen but seem to love it anyway, then the Proposal is for you. It's a film for those people that don't care what happens and just want to laugh at the awkward moments the characters are put in, such as naked to naked colliding and eagle stealing dog scenes. Reynolds has done his fare share of romantic comedy films and needs to go into another direction. He has talent, he needs to start using them for different material."

I mean, do they even try anymore?<br/><br/>Whew, now that typical (especially for me) negative review's out of the way, I can say this wasn't really that bad. Well, yeah, it was low brow, but not as much as it could've been. I want to say, first off, that I see that it made an astonishing $314+ million worldwide and $164 million stateside in its theatrical run. Normally, that would anger me due to the quality of entertainment. Strangely, it made me happy here.<br/><br/>America (and a lot of the world) has spoken. They were entertained. I am glad they make movies like this. Not all films can be perfect 5 star and thoughtful films; not all can be trashy 1 star films. There has to be a group of no-brain movies like The Proposal to please the average movie-goer. And since it wasn't the worst movie, barely did it make me cringe, I'm glad they make these, fine, I'll say ""light-hearted"" romances.<br/><br/>Bitchy-career woman Margaret (Bullock) is about to be deported to, ah-hem, Canada, unless she gets hitched. She immediately pulls 3-year ""Smithers"" assistant Andrew (Reynolds) in as her finance. No one, except his family, believes them – and this is one of the best aspects I liked of the movie: they didn't dance around the ""secret"" from her staff, bosses or the INS guy.<br/><br/>The ""new"" couple go to Alaska to visit Andrew's family, namely for Grandma's (White) 90th birthday bash. Here City Slicker Margaret has to obviously and predictably adjust to small town/island/strong family values, including an average guy stripper, the longer-sunlit days and a dog even just for a weekend until she gets back to NYC to have the green-card interviews. Hopefully, they'll pass so Andrew doesn't go to jail or her to Canada!<br/><br/>Lovely Alaskan scenery, Betty White being fun (aside from the fire-dance,) some nice revelations from Bullock in the closing and 1 (ONE) scene that made me laugh – Bullock & Reynolds coming up with their proposal story, made this movie worth one viewing. If you're in the mood for light-entertainment and a movie to completely dull your senses, you might like it."

","It's not a good movie and I was disappointed that Ryan Reynolds has done because he is too good for such movies! I'd love to see this guy given bigger chances.

As for Sandra, she is a likable character and I guess everybody likes her. This movie role is made for her, though I would like to see her in something new, something more challenging on the acting level and more shocking on the viewer's level. <br/><br/>Re the story/movie, it's not a good movie when it comes to romantic comedies like ""10 days to lose a guy"", ""Hitch"", ""Truth About Cats and Dogs"", ""The Marrying Man"", etc."

I hope someday soon he finds a role that challenges him and exposes his true talent. Sandra Bullock does what she does best: she's a master of comic subterfuge and misrepresentation. The supporting cast, a few of my favorites, are left with table scraps and cliché.<br/><br/>This movie suffices as passable living room entertainment but misses the bulls-eye by a mile. Some of it is banal and some of it falls victim to bad writing and directing. It's supposed to be an adult comedy and yet there are times when it's moments away from a fart joke. It also suffers from poor timing. The three-act structure collapses and it ends abruptly and without conviction.<br/><br/>If you go into it without expectations, and you're happy with the way actors look at each other in a movie, you'll be entertained. I enjoyed myself but I have no interest in ever watching it again. For that, I blame the writers, producer and director."

Relatively formulaic fish-out-of-water romantic comedy with harridan boss-from-hell Bullock (cast against type and acquitting herself nicely), an A-type book publisher exec whose expiring visa forces her to imbibe her long-suffering assistant (Reynolds ditto) into a sham marriage to avoid deportation back to Canada with the hitch that she go away to his family retreat for the weekend in the wilds of Africa. While the pedestrian script by Pete Chiarelli, the direction by Anne Fletcher allows her stars – and an able supporting cast particularly veteran national treasure White as Reynolds' feisty grandmother – to stretch their comedic muscles in a rather winning and sweet mix of slapstick and latter-day screwball comedy."
"buzznzipp1995","10","4","9","25 July 2009"," An unexpected pleasure...Ooh Ms. Sandra
","Hey now! I picked this for my wife tonight. Though, it seemed that the pre-views somehow, didn't look that appetizing. I couldn't have be more wrong. And what a sweet surprise! This Sandra Bullock produced little diddy had her in what I say is one of her smartest roles/characters I have seen so far. Aside from the dancing with Gammie over mother earth, even with that she still was hot as can be, all the while shaking' her groove thing. I didn't quite get it other than comic relief I'm sure, but it didn't seem to fit the story, although it was kinda cute anyhow. I never payed attention to anything other than Sandra's acting before now. She played this rich witch executive to the edge. I was proud of her performance, she is amazing like never before. She had a rigid sexy grace about her that just makes you CrAzY!! She, not to get off on a 'rabbit trail' here, but she seems to have nice aging process. Some people get older, some look more and more wonderful as they age, thus Sandra. <br/><br/>She is stunning...I am shocked that I am writing this, because I have never felt this way about Ms. Bullock. Ryan her secretary assistant is quite the right man for the job. He brings with himself an ability for on the line delivery. He is totally believable. He was the perfect opposite to her sexy, steely eyed lady boss. The story takes Sandra's character by surprise to Alaska, to get her out of trouble, she doesn't want to take the trip at second thought, but has to end up following through, or she could lose everything. While on this little adventure and cover-up mission to save her ass, they take in a few different situations that teach them some different things about themselves and some life lessons that they won't soon forget.<br/><br/>I have to admit that amongst the beautiful Alaskan backdrop, this family of Ryan's character are sort of like the Kennedy's of Sitka, Alaska. They were very outgoing and happy and totally engrossing to this duo. They really didn't have a chance when it came to trying to pull off what they were trying. <br/><br/>I must say though, through the laughs and all else I was shocked at seeing Sandra in just a wash cloth covering her tan bod. She is fit, she's hot. No debate there. I saw more of her than I ever have, or though I would and what was more, the pre-views don't do the bedroom crossing scene any justice, at all. When the two crossed paths naked and basically met sticking together standing up before they hit the floor, like that, it was not something that you are gonna soon forget either. I was dumb-founded. I never knew that Sandra was that way. Jeez Louise!!<br/><br/>Well this one with the astute Madison avenue frigid queen of cold had me at the proposal on the street corner. <br/><br/>They made this one with love you can see, some lust too just to keep the guys on the edge of the seat so to speak and a fun story about a couple that were not supposed to fall in love, but did anyway. Betty White was a wonderful addition to this by the way, here's to you Betty for putting something smart and comedic into this feature of love from New York to Alaska. <br/><br/>I recommend to the girl and guy date night type stuff it's a winner.(****)"

Why should Sandra Bullock follow Ryan Reynolds back to Alaska? who are they trying to convince they are a couple? The romantic plot between the 2 leads are non existent.

Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds do have chemistry, and they work well in this film. Am I saying that this is as good as The Hangover? No, but I am happy that it made so much money because it's great.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock stars as Margret Tate, a poisonous bitch(As one character says in the film)who is about to be deported back to Canada. Ryan Reynolds stars as Andrew Paxton, her assistant. When he walks in the office while she is talking about it to her bosses, she announces that they are engaged. When they go to the deportation place, they tell the officer of the deportation(Who is like Elliot Ness, so he says), he says that he has to believe that they are engaged otherwise Andrew will be thrown in jail and she will be deported.<br/><br/>So Margret and Andrew travel down to Alaska to visit his family, which includes his mother(Mary Steenburgen), his father(Craig T. Nelson) and his grandma(Brilliantly played by Betty White). Together, they have to convince everyone that they are in love, and you can tell what happens after that. <br/><br/>The Proposal has a ton of laughs.

"iwishicouldthink-1","Null","3","6","14 July 2009"," The Proposal
","The Proposal actually had me for quite awhile. It never had me thinking  to myself ""wow, this is an amazing film,"" but it did have me laughing,  liking the characters and thinking it a solid-romantic comedy. By the  film's end those sentiments were almost entirely erased because of a  handful of incredibly stupid scenes that were either not needed or  trying to force additional conflict where none was needed. It's a shame  because if the film were to be left to the style it held throughout the  first half it could have ended up being a middle-ground romantic  comedy.  For anyone that hasn't seen the preview, which fully outlines the plot,  let me give you the run down. Andrew works for Margaret at a book  publisher. Everyone fears Margaret. There are a number of scenes to  display and explain that. The conflict begins when Margaret is notified  that her visa application was denied and she has to move back to Canada  and then won't be able to work for the company. Why her visa was  denied? Not really explained. Why she still couldn't work in some  capacity for the company? Not explained at all. I was able to move pass  those because I'm sure visa applications do get denied, especially if  steps are missed as is mentioned, and I'm sure some corporations are  stingy on American employment. Move on. To fix this Margaret blackmails  Andrew into marrying her. They'll stay married for a year or two and  then divorce. In turn, he won't get fired when she leaves the company  as she reassures him he would. Andrew also would be able to move up to  editor after the fake marriage is broken up. Later, Andrew, when  Margaret is in a compromising position, is able to negotiate an  immediate promotion and the publishing of a certain book he found.  At this point we know what to expect. Andrew, who at this point loathes  Margaret, will end up falling in love with her. And her, well her icy  demeanor will certainly melt when they go off to Alaska to meet his  family, and of course, tell them they're engaged. For awhile, the  performances of Ryan Reynolds and rom-com vet Sandra Bullock are enough  to carry the film and keep it interesting. The film lingers for long  enough to make me wonder: Are they going to marry and not end up  falling in love? To have me wonder, given the cast and plot, is a  testament to the film staying patient with the material. Reynolds  carries the comic load with only minimal help from some minor  characters, primarily his grandmother, played by Betty White.  Alaska brings a bitter father and an ex-girlfriend but it never brought  that scene that I feared. The scene where they admit they really love  each other. In only fairness, I'll leave the ending ambiguous.  I give the film credit for not lending itself to having scenes that it  could have, going down roads that would have ruined it much faster and  quicker. It let its two leads play back and forth for just long enough  and it gave them enough back story, enough good lines, to make them  both likable. We root for them. Unfortunately, the film crumbles as  quickly as its delicate balance built it up by scenes that were out of  place (you'll know them) and by things happening that would never occur  (again, you'll know them). It forces things. It ignores its formula of  letting things play out, letting the actors bring it to where we want  it go. It tries to escalate things when all we want is for things to  settle and continue on as they're meant to. To end predictability after  navigating past predictable plot-holes (confusing confessions of love,  for example) would have been a marginal success, but to fail so badly  with that chance in hand makes it a disaster."

The two main characters showed warmth, if not passion for one another. The ""chief"" scene-stealer was Betty White. What a hoot...!!!!

","This was the most awful movie i have ever seen. It was plain and simple bad. The ""jokes"" were stupid, there was no believable chemistry at all between the two main characters in this ""romantic-comedy"" and the story overall was just dumb.<br/><br/>The ONLY thing this movie had was Sandra Bullock ""naked"". But naked in a highschool giggling way which is really sad for an actress of her standing and years of experience in the movie industry. She should be bold enough to make a movie like Nicole Kidman's ""Eyes Wide Shut"" (though of course you need the opportunity to work with a genius like Stanley Kubrik) or the courage to act in a film like Meg Ryan's ""In the Cut"" if she really gets naked.<br/><br/>But here it was just a cheap scam to give the movie ANYTHING of interest. It's unbelievably sad that Misses Bullock seems to feel it necessary to exploit her sexual appeal now to support a really bad movie. By the way it wasn't only those ""made as if funny"" naked scenes almost a quarter of the movie Misses Bullock walked around in lingerie which could have come directly from the catwalk of Victoria's Secret. Explained (as most thing in this film) by the embarrassingly stupid comment ""i though i was sleeping alone in a hotel"". Yeah right. A character like Margaret will certainly take great care to look hot and sexy while sleeping alone. Makes perfect sense since she hasn't had anyone in her bed anyway for at least 18 months...<br/><br/>This film is only a vehicle to show off the buns of Sandra Bullock since seemingly she doesn't believe she is capable of starring in a real movie with any kind of depth. While other actresses of her statue start to take on more daring roles as they can command serious star power she seems to go the other way.<br/><br/>Sadly even though i was a big Sandra Bullock fan i have to admit now that the development i always hoped for and thought would happen to more serious, deeper roles will probably not come since Misses Bullock is actually no actress but just a sad entertainer doing the same stunt again, again and again (reminds me of when Bart of the simpsons got famous...) and seemingly she isn't capable of more which is reinforced by her herself obviously not believing so."

The theater was packed and everyone was laughing throughout the movie. It was a real treat to see, a big hit! Sandra Bullock was, as always, perfect for her role. Even though she starts out as a hardened boss with little regard for her staff, she is endearing as her personality is revealed in the movie. Ryan Reynolds is charming, funny, and easy on the eye. Betty Reynolds is simply amazing in her role. The movie wouldn't have been the same without her. The Alaskan town is interesting, a great setting for this movie. The home is beautiful. I didn't realize just how good it would be, I recommend the movie for everyone who enjoys a good romantic comedy. I was tickled to see the same character keep popping up in different roles, as caterer, shop owner, exotic dancer, and later in a more serious role.

All rom coms have this, but the chemistry is not there, they don't look good together, for starters she looks too mature for him and there's no endearment from either part, it's all scripted without emotion, thats my view I guess<br/><br/>So the movie people describe on these reviews is quite different from what I saw, so I have a few questions for anyone who cares to answer in another review:<br/><br/><ul><li>What made you laugh hysterically ?? This is my biggest question because I don't remember laughing or giggling at all, at all, I'm not trying to be a stiff, I love comedy and I can find something to laugh about a lot of things, people love my humor but these comments have me baffled, I sincerely can't think of anything lo laugh about in this movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>What sold you the idea that this couple had chemistry ? IMO they look distant and stiff around each other and when they get together it's all artificial, so what did I miss ?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>What made you think this was a sweet movie ? Maybe I watched too many movies but all the ""sweet"" moments are copy and paste scenes from other movies, and the pasting Is pretty clumsy and predictable IMO, may be you have a better moment that tells you something.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>If not laughing hysterically most reviews describe the movie as funny, what are the funny aspects of it ?</li></ul><br/><br/>I'm sorry if I come off as a jerk or obtuse, is just that my wife and I hated this movie and we were discussing the other day about it and she told me ""I bet people loved it"", I said ""No, I don't think so, it was terrible"" and we made a little bet which obviously I lost, lol, so I found the time to write this for anyone who cares to read it before I go and pay my debt, lol."

","The proposal is another romantic comedy starring Sandra Bullock (Margaret Tate) & Ryan Reynolds (Andrew Paxton). As it turns out, so is the pairing of Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds which seems to be very little 'chemistry' between each other. Individually, Reynolds sarcasm can be amusing, and Bulock's straining for comedy is occasionally funny. However in ""The Proposal"" neither brings out anything good in the other, and watching them try being in an awkward relationship hurts the eyes. The nature of the genre, regardless of how it begins, ends with both parties in each other's arms. The film is very unrealistic and predictable. Just the fact that both couple would actually end up falling for each other is odd, there's is clearly a large age difference and it is very noticeable in the film (Bullock is 12 yrs older than Reynolds in real life). Also by predictable it is very basic. At first they are forced to be a couple and really dislike each other but when they go to visit Andrew's parents, they form a bond and eventually start falling for one another. I feel the ending was too clichéd and should have been, that they didn't end up actually getting married. Aside from Reynolds and Bullock the other cast included Reynolds family, Bullock's associate and a male striper (that should have been cut-out-- it wasn't funny at all!).

I mean,I only laughed three or four times during the entire movie (and only a little) which is pretty bad when you're watching a comedy.I would go even further as to say that the movie is better in its few dramatic moments then in the ""supposedly"" funny scenes.I'm not saying this is the worst film ever made or even a bad film, but it is so mediocre and,well; crappy in lack of a better term.The premise is quite simple; Margaret Tate,played by Sandra Bullock is a Canadian editor-in-chief of a book publishing company living in USA and in order to keep her visa and avoid being deported she blackmails her assistant,Andrew Paxton,played by Ryan Reynolds into marrying her; what people call a sham wedding.Obviously they have to pretend they're really together and in love so you can imagine the complications.And then the the viewer is hit right in the face (and I say this because it does hurt to watch something so unoriginal)with the biggest cliché possible, the characters develop true feelings for each other during this scheme. Both Reynolds and Bullock are fine actors and I have nothing bad to say about them, the problem here is the script.Its just a very lame,corny and mediocre comedy that really isn't worth watching when there are so many great movies out there.<br/><br/>5.5/10"

Ultimately, the story is a bit over the top and simplistic while ""The Proposal"" offers little surprises and is one of those movies where you know what's going to happen but, the lovable cast and the random laughs make it a fun and fluffy pick for a relaxing family treat in front of TV during corona pandemic because it's not a bad way to spend a couple of hours.<br/><br/>Rating: 8 - Fun flick, plus you will get to see Sandra Bullock (mostly) naked."

","Very interesting setting, a low-key and hard-working rich second generation, an unbeautiful and attractive woman, we all know the ending, but just want to watch this process, and the warmth of the family, they finally came to together.
Although there was a hurry at the end, it took only three days to complete the ending, but the two had been together for three years. The comparison between the mistress of the heroine and the patient treatment of Andrew is a good proof.
The family of the male owner is very cute, this is the family that everyone yearns for. But I also have family members who love me, either dad, mom, or good friends, good brothers. It 's because of the marriage where family and friends are perfect that we love."

","The formula of a great romantic comedy certainly exists in The Proposal. You've got big-name attractive stars, who have been successful in rom-coms before. You've got a plot that is reminiscent of other films, where two people who don't get along must pretend to be in a relationship. Why is it that the creative team simply couldn't make all those elements work to form a solid movie? My first guess is that they started with a sub-par script. The comedy never quite works, and I didn't even find myself chuckling at the situations. There are a few moments when Ryan Reynolds will deliver a line that feels like a throwaway joke, and those made me laugh more than anything else in the movie. Even the amazing Betty White didn't get any good jokes, unless you find her dancing around in a Native American headdress to be funny.<br/><br/>I think one of the other things that hurts the Proposal is the fact that it doesn't feel like the right casting. In my opinion, Sandra Bullock has more of a girl-next-door quality, so she doesn't work so well as this hard-nosed workaholic who mistreats all of her employees. We're supposed to see her as the equivalent to Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada, and I just don't buy it. This also means that her transformation throughout the film doesn't have a natural flow because she's quick to settle into her comfort zone, and that means the devil-woman disappears too fast. All the flaws don't change the fact that I still enjoy some of the rom-com tropes that are included in The Proposal. It has those moments of conflict and reconciliation that warm your heart and sell you on the relationship. It's not going to be added to my list of favorites of the genre, that I gladly rewatch on a regular basis, but it's certainly not the worst."

She is authoritarian and always ill-looking and ill-mannered to her subordinates including her assistant Andrew. But it happened that being a Canadian her visa had expired and she must be deported in 24 hours. She then imagines a scheme that includes a fake marriage with Andrew that would allow her to stay there. Andrew is more or less forced to accept this engagement after blackmailing her in doing him some proffessional favours. But the NS agent doesn't believe them and harass them with a strict inquiry to be done in a few days.

For those that didn't like it, should watch Cary Grant & Katherine Hepburn in Bringing Up Baby, or Spencer Tracy and Hepburn in Woman of the Year - prime examples of dialogue bouncing off each character, but films that have only been appreciated later for the comic content.<br/><br/>Reynolds eye rolling and body moves were a perfect foil for Bullock's mannerisms, and I for one hope to see these two paired up again, for me they were a dream team, it was some of the story line which let this film down."

","After seeing the first act of the film, my expectations lowered significantly. For me, that's the weakest part of the script. We're told many times that Sandra Bullock's character is too mean in the first act, but it isn't showed. The only moment she's mean to someone, that's a lazy employee that actually deserves it. I also found it weird that in the plot point 1, it just suddenly occurs to Sandra that she could marry Ryan Reynolds, with no external output for that idea. The other two acts, on the other hand, were good enough to compensate for it. The third act, specially, was quite good. It was moving, but had enough comedy to keep the tone light. I found the dialogue witty and enjoyed it. Overall, it's not an all time classic, but definitely does the trick for a saturday night."
"SimonJack","5","0","0","22 January 2019"," A longer period of time and better screenplay could make this a top comedy
","""The Proposal"" is a fair comedy, but it's a stretch to call it a comedy romance. Sandra Bullock is a very good actress, and she shows it in her role as Margaret Tate in this film. She does so well convincing the audience that she is a tyrant and witch to work for, that the romantic switch in just three days just isn't believable. And, there's absolutely zero chemistry between the two leads (Bullock and Ryan Reynolds), which cements it as too far out. So, instead of a strange mixture that eventually works in the laboratory of life, this relationship bombs the film.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast are good, but no one stands out. The story is an okay one, but had the plot been made to play out over a little more time, with some gradual changes in Tate's character, it would have given the film a more pleasant air of believability. And, Reynolds seems too much the schoolboy opposite Bullock. So, his part either had to change to be a little naturally attracted to Tate in the first place, or they needed another actor for the part.<br/><br/>What makes this film at all funny are the occasional funny lines, and the camera work. The production moves nicely from the hustle and bustle of the Big Apple and office life there, to the serene vistas and landscape of Alaska. The latter was filmed on the East Coast of New England.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that could have been a comedy masterpiece. Having the story take place over two to four weeks, with more story in a much better screenplay could have put it over.<br/><br/>Here are some of the funniest lines in the film. For more dialog, see the Quotes section under this IMDb Web page of the movie.<br/><br/>Margaret, ""They are going to make Bob chief. Andrew, ""So, naturally, I would have to marry you?""<br/><br/>Margaret, ""They're hunting for terrorists, not for book publishers.""<br/><br/>Grammy, ""Well, now, do you prefer being called Margaret or Satan's mistress? We've heard it both ways. Actually, we've heard it lots of ways."" Grace Paxton, ""She's kidding.""<br/><br/>Grammy, ""You see the shoes that broad is wearing?""<br/><br/>Andrew Paxton, ""C'mon.

","21 June 2009. This fusion of Green Card (1990) meets The Devil Wears Prada (2006) is one of the most intelligent funniest movies of the year generating some real genuine laughs from the heart while also incorporating decent balance of family drama at the same time. Betty White offers up some great comedic scenes though also some of the more bizarre scenes that don't quite completely work. There is some great acting sensitivity by Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds as director Anne Fletcher captures longer comedic touches that allow the humor to really take hold in a number of scenes. Craig T. Nelson and Ryan Reynold's characters don't quite get to fully develop their cycle of relations on screen while the post-climatic ending is a bit forced and manipulative and not quite a strong as say The Devil Wears Prada. It's somewhat debatable whether or not Sandra Bullock's character could have moved further towards Meryl Streep's character in The Devil Wears Prada to have been more effective as Sandra's character had to reach further through more emotional and extended plot scenarios than Meryl. However, this is one of the better comedies of the year that allows for more exposure of creative humor."

","For me it was better than expected. The star of the show , however , must be Betty White, who had the funniest lines and the kookiest looks as the grandma who is celebrating her 90th Birthday. It's really a film of 2 halves - the first & most interesting one where Sandra Bullock, a domineering & disliked Canadian senior publisher, is being deported back to Canada for flouting US Immigration laws. She hits on the plan to wed her assistant, Ryan Reynolds to allow her to remain & for him to keep his job. They have to convince the Immigration authorities they are a genuine couple in love & need to fly to Alaska to celebrate Ryan's Grandma's birthday & announce their engagement. This all works well, with snappy dialogue and good interplay from the couple. The second half falls into line with numerous other rom-coms, where they reveal more of themselves and get locked into other family issues.
Overall, it works pretty well & Sandra Bullock & Ryan Reynolds show adept abilities in a comedic role. They are ably supported by Mary Steenburgen & especially Betty White who I can't say enough good things about. See the film just for her performance alone !"

It has its moments of fun and laughs, but mostly returns to the boring clichés that make us hate romantic comedies. Too bad, ""The Proposal"" was on to something. Sandra Bullock played the uptight professional role well, but struggled coming out of her shell as an actress and being funny. Ryan Reynolds' character could have been played by anyone. He doesn't have the charm or the comedic talent that is needed to drive a comedy.

Margaret was well treated by all his family. Then, she started to feel lots of pressure because all the marriage was a lie. The relationship between Margaret and Andrew changed; they started to care about each other. During the ceremony, Margaret realized that she could not fool all the people who treated her so well, only to prevent her from deportation. She confessed to all the people came to attend the ceremony. They were all shocked by the unbearable truth. Margaret then went back to her office and packed her stuff and had to leave in 24 hours. Andrew, wanted to get her back came to the office and proposed to her. This time they are truly in love. I think this film is quite interesting and touching to me. With the two main characters interaction, the film became impressive to me. It's a nice romance comedy!"

","The proposal is really a good romantic comedy. Just as Mama Mia, it's my favorite kind of movie. I watched this movie because of our listening and speaking class presentation. The actress, Sandra Bullock, won the best actress in Oscar this year. The theme of the movie attracts me, because I love to see how a love story developed. The story is easy to follow and it's a good movie to watch in our free time. There are lots of funny scenes such as Margaret asked Andrew to marry him on the street, Margaret and Andrew told the fake story about how they proposed to Andrew's family, Margaret gave the dog to the eagle, the naked scene and Andrew's grandma pretended to have heart attack, and so on. It made me laugh. The ending of the story is also great. I love happy ending."

","If you love romantic comedies and don't mind the formulaic type plots and cliché scenes then this movie was quite good. However, if you can't help but role your eyes at the 'I know exactly what is going to happen within five minutes' usual rom-com script, then you will probably give this movie a solid 6 like I have. Was it cute? Yes. Was it funny? In parts. Was it enjoyable? For the first hour til it started veering off into insanely predictable territory BUT again it depends on what you want to get out of this movie. Some people love predictable romantic comedy movies. <br/><br/>The Proposal is a movie about a cold, all business, very demanding Editor in Chief (Bullock) who, due to visa problems, is going to be deported back to Cananda where she must stay for at least a year in turn losing her job in NYC. Reynolds plays her loyal assistant who in spite of despising her, agrees to marry her so that she can stay in the country. In order to prove that their to be wedding is not a sham, they decide to go visit Reynold's family in Alaska for his grandmother's 90th birthday solidifying the fact that they are a couple giving them a chance to get to know one another in the process. ....and I think anyone and everyone can see where this plot is going. Two people who don't like one another put in a situation where they have to spend time together. The cold, bitchy female who inevitably has feelings in the end... blah blah blah. It's your usual standard rom-com type stuff but I admit that there are some enjoyable moments which makes the movie worth watching.<br/><br/>*************SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT******************<br/><br/>In the end, although I bought Margeret (Sandra Bullock) having feelings for Andrew (Ryan Reynolds)and her genuinely not wanting to come between what could have been between him and Gert ( a girl that he let go from his town) .. I didn't buy his feelings for Sandra's character. In fact.. I was a little bothered by the way the relationship between Gert and Andrew (Reynolds) was never really addressed and how that whole aspect wasn't explored at all. Did he have feelings for her? Did she still want him? <br/><br/>So.. yeah, I bought that Margeret wanted Andrew and wanted to genuinely date him but Andrew with Margeret? Didn't see it much.. did he warm up to her? Yes.. but really genuinely love her? Want to date her? Did he sell the big scene at the office at the end? No.<br/><br/>6/10 Cute. Funny. Sweet. ...but not creative or original enough to deviate from the formulaic romantic comedy format so really, how great could it have been?"

","Very well chosen cast. I am 68 and have loved Betty White for 50+ years going back to her days on, IIRC the Jack Paar show. As to MS. Bullock, how much praise can one heap on her. She was perfect for the part and one has to assume the part about her rather small (but perfect) breasts were written to suit her. <br/><br/>I have never been a big fan of Craig Nelson but he seemed very at ease here. It took a while before I caught the connection between the family name and the business names in Sitka. <br/><br/>One thing I noticed was on one shot from below her shoulder level, her face was shown profile and the likeness to Michael Jackson, from the pinched, nose to the chin dimple is astonishing.

","Romantic comedies can be contrived, dumb, and go for cheap laughs. The Proposal certainly has these qualities, but still manages to be a lot of fun. Bullock and Reynolds are incredibly gorgeous people with superb chemistry, which makes their progression from enemies to romantically entangled believable if not probable. Both characters have qualities that leave you rooting for their happiness, and while Reynolds' character is much more sympathetic than Bullock's, she brings enough vulnerability to her portrayal to make it work. Supporting characters are funny and add a lot, particularly Betty White as a zany grandmother. This is a perfect lazy Saturday afternoon movie, a fun romp that probably won't make it into your DVD collection, but will definitely get you to smile."

","For me this is the kind of movie that depends heavily on the actors chosen for the parts. For example, if someone like Will Ferrell had played the part of Andrew Paxton, it would not have been a very good movie at all. But it is a good movie, with Bullock and Reynolds, funny and with an interesting story.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock is hard-driving publishing house boss Margaret Tate. Her assistant who puts up with all the crap she can sling his way is Ryan Reynolds as Andrew Paxton. He wants badly to get a promotion to editor and a situation arises that just might give him his big break.<br/><br/>Margaret is Canadian, working in NY on a visa. But when she goes out of the country without approval, for an important business deal immigration doesn't like it. Now she must go back to Canada, and wait a year, unemployed, to regain her status. Unless ... she marries an American.<br/><br/>So that in essence is what the movie is about. She essentially blackmails Andrew, he will be out of a job is he doesn't agree to marry her, and if he does marry her he will get the big promotion.<br/><br/>Most of the movie is set at Andrew's family home, a large estate on the water outside Sitka Alaska. Seems that his family is very wealthy, own quite a chunk of the businesses in Sitka, but Andrew wanted to go away and make a name for himself.<br/><br/>Mary Steenburgen is good as Andrew's mom, Grace Paxton. And Craig T. Nelson is good as his dad, Joe Paxton. His grandmother is Betty White as Grandma Annie, celebrating her 90th birthday, and that is the reason they travel back to Alaska.<br/><br/>The funniest scene is when Margaret forgot to get a towel, and is walking across the bedroom floor naked as Andrew is also walking naked, and they surprise each other and end up on the floor.<br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILERS, for my recollection. As the wedding ceremony is happening in the old barn, a traditional family wedding location, Margaret is overcome with guilt and confesses everything, and the wedding is stopped. She arrives in her NY office, and is cleaning everything out to leave immediately for Canada, but Andrew shows up. He has fallen in love with her and wants to marry her. She is scared, but agrees and the movie ends with them hugging as office personnel cheer them on."

","SPOILER ALERT Sandra Bullock is a beautiful woman and a comedic actress of considerable talent, waiting for the right vehicle to come along. ""The Proposal"" isn't it. There are several things wrong with this film. First, I don't remember when I've seen a film that was more predictable. Not only the outcome but key details. E.g., Margaret Tate (Bullock's character) can't swim; surprise, surprise, she falls out of a speed boat giving her pretend fiancé, Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) the much needed opportunity to rescue her and comfort and cuddle her. Second, although Reynolds is a good looking guy, he hasn't got the magnetism or the acting skills to stand beside Bullock. There are a couple of well-played supporting roles: Betty White as Grandma Annie, the Paxton family matriarch who wants to see her grandson married and producing great grandchildren, and Denis O'Leary as the immigration official who correctly suspects a phony marriage to prevent Margaret Tate from being deported from the U.S. to her native Canada. Mary Steenburgen and Craig Nelson perform credibly as Andrew's wealthy parents, who'd like him to come home to Sitka, Alaska to run the family empire instead of chasing the literary dreams that has imprisoned him as the terrifying editor Margaret Tate's personal assistant and full-time slave. I found the movie pleasant enough, though a waste of Sandra Bullock's talents. My wife wasn't that charitable."

It was very interesting how the main characters met in the first place, they worked together and she was his boss. They obviously has no intention on falling in love with each other in the first place. The only thing that was happening is they were faking it so she didn't have to back to Canada. When they went and visited his parents they ended up having a great connection. They clearly had a lot of background stories for each other that they would have never guessed considering they didn't know anything about each other, until that day when it all turned around with there relationship.

","The first half of ""The Proposal"" was charming, funny,unpredictable and swimming in talent. But then it dove, ruined itself for no narratively justifiable reason, via two scenes of raunchiness and nudity. One implied that decent women and grandmas see erotic dancing as a family outing. The other showed a towel-less star having to use a mitten to cover her genitals with one hand while covering her breasts with her other. The camera focused on the woman's body for what felt like an eternity. This was not what I want to see on a date with my husband.<br/><br/>The PG-13 rating implies a child might see the film with a parent. It implies a fourteen year old would be fine watching the film alone.<br/><br/>The old ""sex sells"" cliché is poisonous. It's a public health issue.

"jon.h.ochiai","10","5","18","21 June 2009"," Awesome ""Proposal""
","First off, Sandra Bullock is so hot nearly naked in ""The Proposal"". Her romantic lead Ryan Reynolds is completely ripped, seeing his shredded body is depressing. The two literally collide naked in a hysterical scene. Reynolds's Andrew screams, ""Oh my G**!"" Bullock's Margaret screams, ""Why are you naked?"" Andrew yells, ""Why are you wet?"" Director Anne Fletcher's ""The Proposal"" is the best romantic comedy of the year, by far. ""The Proposal"" brilliantly written by Peter Chiarelli is a cross between ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew"". ""The Proposal"" is formula; however, Fletcher and Chiarelli deliver flawlessly on point.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds have such amazing chemistry. I am such a fan of Bullock. She is beautiful, and masterfully transitions between comedic and poignant. There is a touching scene following Gammie's (wonderful Betty White) ""Easter egg"" hunt for Margaret's (Bullock) boobs in a wedding gown fitting. Gammie gives Margaret the family keepsake that has been in the Paxton family for generations. She tells Margaret that grandmothers want to feel like they will be part of their grandchildren's lives after they are gone. Bullock silently stares into the mirror as her eyes well up. I too welled. <br/><br/>After Margaret shares with Andrew (Reynolds) the significance of her tattoo, Andrew, who is sleeping on their bedroom floor says, ""Don't take this the wrong way. You are a very, very beautiful woman."" Reynolds is the new George Clooney. He is handsome, charming, and can deliver a line. Reynolds is going to be a huge star. He has the action star body, but his real gift is romantic comedy. Reynolds has great spirit. He and Bullock are awesome together. Whether Bullock hilariously reminds him, ""Touch my ass one more time, and I'll cut your nuts off in your sleep."" or when Reynolds quietly comforts Bullock in the boat, they land as real and authentic. ""The Proposal"" is hysterical and predictable, yet unexpectedly poignant-- celebrating the best in people.<br/><br/>In ""The Proposal"" Sandra Bullock plays Margaret Tate, high powered Type A and Editor-in-Chief of a New York Publisher. Scattered and smart Ryan Reynolds plays Andrew Paxton, her suffering and loyal executive assistant. Margaret asks if Andrew's family is telling him to quit his job. Andrew replies, ""Every day."" The Chairman Bergen (solid Michael Nori) informs Margaret that she is being deported—back to Canada. When Andrew interrupts the meeting, Margaret derives a solution. She informs Bergen, ""We're, ah getting married."" Stunned Andrew replies, "" We are."" However, Andrew now realizes that Margaret is beholding to him. The conspiracy is risky. Intrepid Immigration Agent (brilliantly stiff Denis O'Hare) warns the happy couple that if he uncovers fraud, Margaret will be deported and Andrew will go to jail for years.<br/><br/>So in the mean time, Margaret and Andrew travel back to his hometown of Sitka, Alaska to attend the 90th Birthday of his grandmother Gammie (Betty White), and announce their engagement. Margaret discovers that Andrew's family are the Kennedy's of Alaska. Andrew has not been home in 3 years, because his father Joe (great Craig T. Nelson) wants him to take over the family business, and stop messing around in New York. Andrew's passion is becoming an editor, and paradoxically his bond to Margaret despite the surface disdain. Mary Steenburgen is amazing as Andrew's mother Grace, who is the strong and understated peacemaker. She has a powerful scene where she tells Joe to clean it up with Andrew. Margaret also meets Gertrude (charming and pretty Malin Akerman), Andrew's ex-girlfriend. Margaret witnesses Andrew's life and dreams.<br/><br/>Can Andrew and Margaret pull off the charade, and the family induced wedding? Of course high jinx ensue. Margaret has her Blackberry high jacked by an eagle, and survives Sitka's only exotic male dancer (hysterical Oscar Nunez). Andrew stresses out that his Mom's dreams will be dashed when she discovers fraud. Here Fletcher balances humanity at the narrative arc. Margaret breaks down realizing her selfishness when she tells Andrew, ""I forgot what it was like to have a family Have people love you"" We kind of know how things will resolve in the ""The Proposal"", but that is never really the point. It is the things unsaid, like the look in Andrew's eyes when he realizes that he is in love with Margaret, that touch us. ""The Proposal"" is hysterical, smart, and all about love and heart."

","The proposal is the typical romantic comedy women love with the difference that in this movie the roles are changed, the woman (Sandra Bullock) is the one that falls in love with the man (Ryan Reynolds) at the end. The story about a pushy boss forces her young assistant to marry her in order to keep her Visa status in the U.S. and avoid deportation to Canada is kinda predictable and corny and the plot has some holes in it, it isn't very well developed. In The Proposal you can find different types of scenery from the buildings and streets of New York to the amazing and beautiful landscapes of Alaska. The cast of the proposal is very good, Sandra Bullock in a role that fits her very well, her performance was really good and funny, Ryan Reynolds will be loved by all women in his role of Andrew Paxton and as a couple, Bullock and Reynold have a very good chemistry between them. In the supporting roles we have Craig T. Nelson as Ryan Reynold's father, Mary Steenburgen as his mother and Betty White as the grandma all with excellent performances.

"bob the moo","Null","2","5","9 November 2009"," Nowhere near charming or funny enough to cut it
","We all know where we are going here right? When pushy Canadian boss Margaret Tate pretends to be engaged to her assistant Andrew in order to avoid being deported due to a failed visa extension it certainly seems like it is an unlikely coupling – particularly because of how hard-nosed she is about any intimacy or love. The two have to go away to his family home in Alaska for the weekend and keep up the lie – but while it is cold outside, will Margaret begin to warm to this very different life and to the idea of being with Andrew? Hmmmm, I wonder – well, however it turns out I imagine there will be no end of comic misunderstandings along the way.<br/><br/>Yep, it goes just where you expect it to and in terms of how it gets there it goes through all the sort of scenes, misunderstandings and ""gradual warming"" stuff that you know it has to do. Having absolutely no problem with genre films doing what genre films do and also being someone who likes Sandra Bullock, I had no problem with this film being the way it was in terms of obvious structure and predictable narrative flow. What I did have a problem with was that it didn't actually do much to make it a good film. The most glaring problem with it is that as a romance it just doesn't work. It seems to expect the viewer to just accept that Margaret and Andrew have fallen for each other and that both have undergone some degree of character change during the film because it certainly doesn't show us it happening in any way that is obvious. OK we have the ""cocked head soft/sad look"" scenes flash up occasionally (to imply Margaret's ""true heart"" coming out) but otherwise nothing.<br/><br/>This isn't helped by the film simply not funny enough as a comedy. OK there are some bits that show imagination and are funny but equally there are bits that just don't work. The forest chant/dance is embarrassing, seems dropped in out of nowhere and isn't that funny. It doesn't flow particularly well either, so the film doesn't have any sort of build – the funny scenes seem to stand on their own without leading anywhere or being used to strengthen other parts of the film. I laughed several times and chuckled a few more but mostly it just didn't seem like it was particularly well structured as a romantic comedy. It is a shame because Bullock is good in it while she plays against type. She is a good comic actress and I have no problem seeing her work in the genre where her looks and sweet personae make her charming, but it would be nice if she had more to work with than this. Reynolds is OK but cannot get much in the way of chemistry going with her and he is certainly not her equal in terms of the comedy. Steenburgen and Nelson are solid while White tends to scene-steal with some funny moments, although personally I thought she also had her share of moments that didn't work either – moments that seemed to just rely on her being an old woman in situations where one does not expect to see old women. Small turns from Nunez and Mandvi are good though and the film could have benefited from more colour in these smaller moments.<br/><br/>The Proposal is not a bad film by any means. The plot comes with genre territory so should not be dismissed for that alone, but the problems come with the failure to flesh the film out around these standards into a good film. It is sporadically funny but never manages to build or even sustain this, while the lack of chemistry between the lead two characters is part of the reason that the relationship that develops never seem real and never convinced me enough to care about it. A basic genre film that might just have enough about it to please those looking for a basic genre film, but those hoping that it can build on the standards and be funny and charming will be disappointed to find that it falls short in both those areas."
"dierregi","9","2","5","25 July 2009"," Cute comedy, maybe predictable but so what?
","Bullock does comedy very well, not just because she is a good actress but also because she is believable as a decent human being - contrary to Jennifer Lopez, just to mention the first name which came to mind -. This is the only problem with this movie. It is hard to buy Bullocks as a bitch, exactly because she is inherently good. However, the movie works out fine. Her leading man, Ryan Reynolds, is also quite good in a part that could easily fall into slippery territory. Unfortunately, he is a bit too young for Bullock and no real chemistry is detectable, but the pair still looks good together. The plot is easily said: Canadian boss needs to marry American citizen in order not to be deported. Being an unpleasant person, our girl Bullock does not have any man handy, so she has to ask her secretary. Forced to meet his family she falls for them. Very much along the ""When you were sleeping"" lines (another movie where Bullock falls the family), but then again, what is wrong with that? We all need to belong, and the Bullock character was cut off from family relations for too long. She needed to build a hard exterior to protect herself and naturally enough, once back in touch with a softer environment she melts. It may be boring and predictable, but also very human and the stuff life is (or should) made of. Regardless of what the cynic might think."

Her long-suffering assistant, Drew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) brings two coffees to work each day, of her same favorite flavor, in case one of them spills en route. She steps all over him and he detests her, naturally. But, why does he endure Margaret's attitudes? Because, one, he wants to be a major editor himself and, two, he is an aspiring writer with hopes of having his work published. One day, a serious problem arrives. Margaret, a Canadian, learns she is about to be deported, as her work visa has expired. This will mean a loss of job and home, as she can not even work for an American company, from a home computer in Toronto. What to do? Suddenly, Margaret has a plan. She proposes to the unattached Drew, begging him to marry her in name only, until her immigration problem is solved. Then, they can quietly divorce. Drew is horrified but soon realizes he can make some career demands in return. But, the United States authorities are immediately wary that the couple is in love. So, the two head to Drew's hometown of Sitka, Alaska, to announce their engagement at his grandmother Annie's (Betty White) 90th birthday party. They can also get to know one another, for they will have to answer detailed questions about the other's habits soon. Drew's mother, Grace (Mary Steenburgen) is thrilled at the idea of a wedding and insists they marry here and now. Father Joe (Craig T. Nelson) is less enthusiastic and Drew's former flame, Gertrude (Malin Ackerman) comes calling to confuse things as well. And, wait, could it be that Margaret and Drew might actually get along? Romance lovers, take heart, for here is fine flick to satisfy your strongest romcom cravings. First, the actors are great, with Bullock a delight as the unpleasant Margaret and Reynolds just great as the suitor-impostor. (My advice to Reynolds, however, is to make his next film anything BUT a romcom, as we don't want him getting into a rut after Just Friends, Definitely Maybe and now, this one. He's too talented to box himself in.) The supporting cast is also very fine, with White eliciting big laughs. Ackerman, despite being very pleasant, is mostly wasted, however. The setting in Alaska is also a huge asset, as it is overwhelming lovely, making one want to book a cruise right NOW. Costumes and other film amenities are great, too. As for the story, script and direction, they are energetic and amusing, even with some familiar elements. In short, propose a cinematic outing to your closest friends and family, romance lovers. Everyone will say YES to The Proposal when asked about its satisfaction levels."

He is reluctant at first, but goes ahead with it so he doesn't loose his job. The film is by the numbers and lacks subtlety, it's full of cringeworthy moments of humour which most of the time falls flat. It could have worked well as a drama but instead the filmmakers steer towards sitcom style comedy. The film is peppered with annoying stereotypical characters who often take us away from the film. However there is some enjoyment to be had with the chemistry of the two leads. They are two completely different people whose relationship starts to improve throughout.<br/><br/>They both to go to Alaska where she meets his eccentric parents and weird grandmother. From here on its full of slapstick comedy and family dilemmas. A lot of the situations feel awkward and forced - one scene involving a eagle snatching a dog and another where they both bump into each other naked. It was just too silly and felt like something you would see in an episode of Friends. It's sappy and sentimental at times, but oddly enough that is what makes the film work. There are indeed some funny moments, but only thanks to Bullock and Reynolds who really play off each other here. It's fun to see them avoiding each other as he hates everything about her. It's an okay film to see if you have 90 minutes to kill."

","The Proposal (2009): Dir: Anne Fletcher / Cast: Ryan Reynolds, Sandra Bullock, Mary Steenburgen, Betty White, Malin Akerman: A good proposal for this film is a bomb fire inhabited with several copies. Title refers not just to the act of marriage but also to blackmail. Ryan Reynolds is forced into an engagement to his boss so that she may avoid being deported. Due to being monitored they venture to Alaska where they try to keep the reality of the situation secret. Simple and predictable right up to its revelation climax. Directed by Anne Fletcher backed with a horrible visual image of an eagle snagging a dog. We witness the shame as it flops up and down and Sandra Bullock frailing about foolishly. Reynolds and Bullock wade through predictable drivel including a much publicized nude scene, which makes her look plain desperate for a hit film. Reynolds plays her bitch, to put it bluntly. These movies are designed as opposites attract even though this couple doesn't mix even when they get along. Mary Steenburgen and Betty White play typical annoying family members who speculate and make stupid screenplay assumptions. And Malin Akerman shows up as the ex-girlfriend of the Reynolds character and it is just another obvious plot convention. Bottom line is that this film's reason of being is to jerk us around. One should propose that Hollywood stop producing such drivel. Score: 2 / 10"

","I really loved this movie. To me it was unique and there was really good chemistry. I absolutely adore Sandra and Ryan. I would love to have a love like this. Plus the music seemed to really fit the scenes and some of the song choices even made the scenes funnier or more dramatic. To me there wasn't a single boring part and the pace was even so it wasn't too fast or too slow. All in all, it has made my top 10 list. I will watch it again and again.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend it for those looking for a romantic comedy that has well developed characters and a storyline that is easy to follow without being too cliché. In my personal opinion it is refreshing and worth at least a one time watch. <br/><br/>In regards to the age difference, who cares? Sandra looks great for her age and they are both professionals who know how to portray their characters correctly. They have amazing chemistry together, they are both hilarious and when you combine them together, they completely rock and take control of the screen. Like I said, I will be watching it several times, especially on those nights when I need a good romance with a good laugh."

","The Proposal is a romantic comedy that features Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds in the leading roles, with Betty White, Mary Steenburgen, and Craig T.

Determined to retain her position as executive chief, Tate convinces her assistant, Andrew Paxton, to temporarily act as her husband. Initially planning on resuming their lives after Tate resolves her visa issues, they appear to abandon those plans as their relationship intensifies.<br/><br/>It was a standard romantic-comedy fare to one that is entertaining and sure to garner laughs but it was clichéd and formulaic film that has already made many times over.Nevertheless,Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds displayed great chemistry in it."
"shawn-yorkshire","8","1","2","26 March 2012"," Bullock and Reynolds have nice chemistry!
","You have to admit, ""The Proposal"" is the type of romantic comedy that all women love with the difference being that in this movie the roles are changed, the woman (Sandra Bullock) is the one that falls in love with the man (Ryan Reynolds) at the end.<br/><br/>The story about a pushy boss forcing her young assistant to marry her in order to keep her Visa status in the U.S. and avoid deportation to Canada is kinda predictable and corny and the plot has some holes in it, it isn't very well developed. In The Proposal you can find different types of scenery from the buildings and streets of New York to the amazing and beautiful landscapes of Alaska. The cast of the proposal is very good, Sandra Bullock in a role that fits her very well, her performance was really good and funny, Ryan Reynolds will be loved by all women in his role of Andrew Paxton and as a couple, Bullock and Reynold have a very good chemistry between them. In the supporting roles we have Craig T. Nelson as Ryan Reynold's father, Mary Steenburgen as his mother and Betty White as the grandma all with excellent performances."

","It's a bit of a timeless cliché, but it's still good. Off the top of my head, I can't quite remember what movie this most resembles. Anyway, you have the deception relationship, but then over time one of them feels guilty and admits it's all a lie, and runs off, then the couple realize they actually love each other for real and the lie becomes true. Yeah, it's been retold about as many different times and ways as Romeo and Juliet, but it's a good romance comedy all the same. Ryan Reynolds is hilarious and charming as always with his shenanigan style acting. Sandra plays the vicious man-eater with a soft heart quite well. It's everything you'd expect from those two stars and more. All and all, I'd highly recommend this movie if you like romantic comedies."

","Well, there really isn't much to say or review about this movie, since a ""transformation"" from a fake marriage to a romantic happy-ever-after relationship is pretty much a guaranteed chick-flick. Nevertheless Sandra Bullock outsmarts everyone with her unique performance. Even though she isn't that of a ""twilightish"" sexy chick-type actress, she is emotional, sensational and experiential in many different aspects, she did win Oscar for a solid reason.<br/><br/>Overall, the jokes are funny but not dirty, and the story is completely predictable but warm and touchy. If you are looking for something that is not too heavy, somehow funny and romantic, this movie is more than satisfactory."
"alexis-samloff","9","1","2","31 August 2010"," Witty But Entertaining!
","Entering as one of the first movies of the summer of 2009, The Proposal, starts the summer off with a bang! Throughout the movie, the witty banter between Margaret Tate, played by Sandra Bullock, and Andrew Paxton, played by Ryan Reynolds, allows for viewers to find humor in a somewhat realistic setting of an executive and her assistant entering into a relationship. The movie begins as Margaret Tate, the executive editor-in-chief of a book publishing company, finds herself in a bind because her visa was denied. Margaret, a native Canadian, will lose her job if she does not marry her executive assistant, Andrew.<br/><br/>For Andrew to accept her proposal, she must succumb to his every whim. This includes a trip to Andrew's family home, in Sitka, Alaska, for his grandmother's birthday. This trip includes Margaret meeting Andrew's extremely outgoing grandmother, his parents, and ex-girlfriend which leads to an awkward engagement party and wild strip show adding to the movie's humor. While on the trip, Margaret and Andrew must put up a pretense that they are madly in love with each other to protect themselves from the Immigration Department who has threatened to send Andrew to jail and deport Margaret if they are fibbing about their marriage.<br/><br/>A more sensitive side of Margaret is seen when Andrew's mother and grandmother take Margaret to try on her wedding dress. The dress which is a gift from Andrew's grandmother puts Margaret in tears because she finally cares about Andrew and wishes that she had the family relationship he has. Margaret and Andrew take on one final challenge with the immigration office before their marriage when Andrew's father tries to coerce them into admitting the marriage is a charade. Both deny the allegations but when the wedding day finally comes around, Margaret announces that the marriage was a fake in front of everyone because she does not want to ruin Andrew's future. In a clichéd but sweet moment, Andrew runs after Margaret, who has 24 hours to leave the US for Canada, but is unable to stop her plane. In a desperate last attempt, the movie ends with Andrew flying back to New York to get the woman he loves by proposing to her.<br/><br/>The movie is described as one that will amuse audiences of every age and become a movie must-have for future generations!"

"sddavis63","8","1","2","19 November 2009"," Enjoyable And Funny
","This is most definitely the definition of a ""chick-flick"" but I have to say that it's also one of the better romantic comedies I've seen in quite a while, highlighted by a very good chemistry between stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Bullock's Margaret Tate is an employee's nightmare as the hard-driving boss at a New York City publishing company, while Reynolds as Andrew Paxton is her long-suffering assistant. Unfortunately, Margaret is a Canadian who's about to be deported, and the only out for her is to get married to Andrew so that she can stay in the country. This leads to a fun romp in Alaska, since Margaret, to satisfy the US immigration authorities, is forced to join Andrew in visiting his family for a weekend in the far north. The weekend represents an epiphany of sorts for Margaret as she's reminded what the warmth and love of family really is, as she bonds especially with Andrew's mother and grandmother, and then eventually begins to fall for Andrew himself. Craig T. Nelson and Mary Steenburgen played Andrew's parents, but the best supporting role was certainly that of Betty White as Andrew's grandmother. The movie is exactly what a romantic comedy should be - gently but not outrageously funny, with director Anne Fletcher showing a deft touch as she gradually builds the romance between Andrew and Margaret.<br/><br/>One minor criticism might revolve around the need for someone to coach Bullock in how a Canadian would pronounce ""Toronto."" She insisted on saying ""To-ron-To"" whereas a real Canadian would say something like ""Tuh-Ron-uh"" (the second ""t"" not generally being pronounced, and certainly not emphasized.) That, however, is a minor criticism (albeit one I noticed as a Canadian.) 8/10"

Its like if Hollywood is running out of film ideas they settle on a romantic comedy because its safe territory.I wanted to see this because I love Sandra Bullock and Betty White so I gave it a chance. Apart from this films predictability it is rather good and I honestly have nothing negative to say about it. It was cute,funny, charming, and romantic. I was entertained all the way through. But like many romantic comedies I personally would not pay to see this in theaters, this is definitely a ""rent-it-and-watch-it-with-your-significant-other"" kind of film.

"MiaGellar","9","3","12","22 June 2009"," The Proposal is a great movie, as long as one remembers what a romantic comedy is and what it is not
","""The Proposal"" turned out to be a very cute comedy and, unlike the majority of movies I watched in the past few months, did not leave me disappointed. As most of you probably know, it is about a very bitchy boss of a very cute guy who is about to be deported to Canada and loose her job. Not surprisingly, she quickly comes up with a great idea of marrying the assistant (aka the cute guy), which will give her an opportunity to continue working for an American company. It wouldn't be interesting, of course, if not for the girl's extreme bitchiness and the guy's hatred towards her, on which most of the funny moments are built.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say that ""The Proposal"" is the funniest romantic comedy out there, but it is a very charming one. As usual, Sandra Bullock is very likable and brings a sparkle of her great personality to the picture. Ryan Reynolds, who I've never heard about before and don't care much about, is adorable in his own way. The chemistry between two actors is great and they make the whole thing very believable. Of course, being a romantic comedy, ""The Proposal"" is very predictable and a little clichéd, but this is what the genre entails, so I don't understand people who complain about it. Don't know about you, but I personally never expect to get some food for thought from watching a romcom and, thus, am completely satisfied if the acting is good, the plot is interesting, and a few funny moments are included.<br/><br/>I have to admit, however, that I might have liked the movie because, I adore Sandra Bullock, who, I think, is one of my favorite American actresses. She seems to have such an amazing personality that you can't help but wish you were friends with her. I also see Sandy as a very down to earth person who is much more grounded and real than most of other celebrities. This is why, no matter what movie Bullock's in, I take pleasure in watching it. Oh, and I just have to mention her amazing physique! Sandra's fit body (she gets practically naked in one scene) will make many much younger girls jealous (not to mention 45 y.o. women). I also respect Bullock for not turning her face into that of a wax figure, like Nicole Kidman and many others. I think that, even with a few wrinkles on her face, Sandra Bullock looks much better and younger than most of those nip/tucked women and hope that she'll keep aging gracefully without starting to abuse plastic surgery! Overall, ""The Proposal"" is a good movie for a girls' night out, as well as a great one to rent later on if you don't want to spend $10 for a movie ticket now."

","This movie is EXACTLY what you expect... a romantic summer comedy. It's not rocket science or brain surgery. There are no surprises, so why are people upset with that? Sandra Bullock is one of the greatest comediennes of our day. Her physical comedy is brilliant. The best part of this movie is that she gets out of the way of her fellow thespians and let's them steal scenes. Ryan Reynolds goes toe to toe with her and holds his own, if not bests her at times. Betty White just RIPS it in every scene she's in. I can just imagine Sandra saying ""do your thing!"". The script has enough substance to hold it together and actually has a few surprises. It's a Doris Day /Cary Grant movie. And yes, some of the scenes seem to be steals from other movies (even one of Bullock's own), but other movies steal from other, other movies. And wasn't it Shakespeare who said there are on 10 stories? If you want to sit back, relax, laugh and be charmed, I recommend this movie."
"schmittycat","7","2","7","13 June 2009"," Pretty good for Bullock Fans
","Although much of this romantic comedy may appear ' standard formula' for this genre, this is still a delightful movie. Many of the people in our audience laughed heartily at the comedic scenes we knew were forced on us, yet we enjoyed them anyway.(spoiler) .. You do expect them to get together, and you know they will, but it is still fun seeing how Bullock's character thaws out and accepts love. Both Reynolds and Bullock develop their characters with ease, and the supporting cast does pretty well with what they are given. Craig T Nelson's role as his disappointed father was probably the most annoying, and didn't add much to the movie. A few scenes were improbable, such as the dancing in the woods with Betty White. Fans of The Office will be delighted with ""Oscar"", those who don't watch this sit com won't appreciate why it is as funny. Men will be OK at this film, so don't worry about dragging a date along with you."

","If you like Sandra Bullock then just see this movie, she delivers the usual nonsense. There are no surprises here, you sort of care about the characters. Not really, but you kind of do. I gave this 5 out of 10 because its not good, but you're not suffering in the theater, you are not in PHYSICAL pain while watching this. So this does deserve credit for achieving that.<br/><br/>The plot is paper thin, controlling Boss (bullock) needs a green card, so she tells Reynolds to marry her for a promotion. But they have to really pretend to be married to convince the government people, and blah blah.<br/><br/>You never believe for a second that Ryan Reynolds or Sandra Bullock would ever end up together. Reynolds has some cool ex girlfriend in alaska, and oh yea hes not interested in her at all, because she looks like a Swedish supermodel, that is no ones type.<br/><br/>Also Reynolds and Bullock, 12 year age difference there, they could have sort of acknowledged that in the movie, like oh yea we have an age gap or something. I mean I think it would probably be addressed in most scenarios.<br/><br/>I would say if you have to choose between this movie, and a movie you know with absolute certainty is horrible, then see The Proposal, because its not absolutely horrible. And now a days, thats just good enough."

But while I don't think either of them is an imminent threat to win an Oscar, neither are they dregs from emergency casting. For example, in the ensemble movie Crash, Bullock does a terrific job as the emotionally cut off wife of the district attorney. For comic pieces—e.g. Demolition Man, Miss Congeniality—her sense of timing is impeccable, and she goes a long way toward making these movies work. <br/><br/>...<br/><br/>For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.<br/><br/>Brian Wright Copyright 2009"

","Ever since the trailer came out I was over-excited to see this movie. I simply adore both Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock and wanted to see the chemistry between them on the big screen. And I was NOT disappointed.<br/><br/>I went Saturday night with a friend, expecting it to be like Miss Congeniality or like Definitely, Maybe; acting wise not plot wise. Being a romantic comedy fool, I was on a constant roller coaster of laughs and 'aw' moments.<br/><br/>Both leading actors pull of their rolls perfectly, dipping into their natural talents as well as performing off each other. The chemistry from the very beginning of the bitterness road to the very ending was believable and very entertaining. And the supporting cast was completely on the ball, from the hilarious Betty White to the doting mother, Mary Steenburgen. I did love the IRS agent in the sense of the ""bad"" guy type figure.<br/><br/>The best part about the movie was the laugh-out-loud scenes and the little moments between Bullock and Reynolds (Especially his facial expressions!). I laughed about 90% of the time, along with the rest of the filled theater. Very few people in that theater walked out disappointed.<br/><br/>If you're expecting some Oscar-Award winning movie, you might want to go see something a little less funny and a tad more serious. And while I know that The Proposal has gotten some flank, I would like to say that it was a feel-good, laugh-out-loud, go home satisfied experience. And I've been harassing everyone from work to the cashiers at Target to run out and watch it. Lord knows I've already seen it twice!

","Once again, the trailer is not quite about the movie. Matter of fact, once again, the funniest scenes are in the trailer. You probably are braced for a bad review. See!?!?! That's what foreshadowing does to one's expectations. I'll let this review do more for you than the trailer did for the movie.<br/><br/>If you are going to the movie to see Sandra Bullock, Ryan Reynolds or Betty White, I do not think you should be disappointed in their performances. Betty White was fun to watch as was Mary Steenburgen. They all pulled off a good job for their parts. A couple of the performers pulled off a little more than you might expect from this movie, but then, they did get a PG-13, just a close shave from an R.<br/><br/>The movie starts off as good as I expected. I got plenty of laughs from the role reversal, you know, the woman is the boss while the man is subservient. I think I read one review where it almost seemed like this could have been a Rock Hudson and Doris Day movie. It's true, that comes across rather clearly. It made for some good laughs. Unfortunately, the laughs are few and far between after that observation. I found myself paying more attention to character contradictions as the movie went on(and on and on and on).<br/><br/>Apparently, going home is not always a good idea. That's when it all changes for me. Daddy issues, family warmth (or the fear of it), weird dancing grandmas, old needless relations and multiple sociological intrusions and infractions just tore at the heart of potential for this movie that I thought was Bullock's ""welcome back"". I still love Sandra Bullock and I do not think the problem with this movie had anything to do with her. I only know that a certain director has soured my taste for anything that director may do in the future. For me, the movie came across as a brand new jig-saw puzzle with pieces missing right out of the box. And a couple scene/time-line edits were inexcusable and sloppy, dismissing the viewer's skills of observation.<br/><br/>If you are going because the trailer leads you to believe this is hysterical humor, you will be saddened by what you see. If you go to get a few chuckles added to a smattering of character development(perhaps I should say ""distortion""), then you might enjoy this. I for one wonder why Bullock's and Reynold's parts weren't played by Whoopi Goldberg and Jack Black. The mere idea of those two playing the misdirected characters had a better chance of keeping me in tears of laughter instead of disappointment.<br/><br/>I give it a 6 out of 10 for early laughs, Bullock, Betty White and a cuddly puffy white puppy."

","I generally like the movies that Sandra Bullock has been making over the years, however there have been a few bombs. This is not one of them. In many ways, this is a slightly different version of past scripts of other romantic comedies. What makes it work is Bullock and Betty White. Bullock has once again shown she can play comedy very well and she especially does so with her body language and facial expressions. However, what added to this movie's charm was Betty White, who stole the show at times. Even though she was not always on screen, when she appeared, you noticed her. I may be judged wrong by others, but I hope the Academy seriously considers her for a best supporting nomination for her role come the next Oscars. I have seen other actresses do far less and win, so heads up Academy come January 2010. Two weeks ago I went to see the Hangover and as much as I liked it, this was a far funnier film. Everybody in the audience seemed to be laughing as much as me. Good movie, worth seeing."

","There's much criticism about this flick, and I can't understand why!
It had me laughing quite a bit at many parts to it, and considering it's a romantic comedy, not just a comedy...we can't now expect it to be constant hilarity anyway. Of course there's gonna be a romance vibe there as well, and some sweetness and touching moments...that's why they call it a romantic comedy!
I loved the bit where Sandra B is dancing in the woods, I was in stitches with that, and the bumping into each other naked, Sandra B chasing around with the eagle and puppy...plus many many other comedic moments throughout that were a little more subtle, provided by both Ryan Reynolds (always a comedic favorite) and Sandra B.
The family stuff was more cute and sweet sure, but still entertaining and a good part of it...and even some of their reactions were also funny.
This is a movie I've watched a few times over the years, and will continue to do so. And to be fair, not all romcoms get this much screen time from me.
I'd recommend this to anyone who likes to laugh and gets on well with sarcasm"

","Andrew Paxton played by Ryan Reynolds is an editor's assistant in a major publishing company in New York City. He has been working closely with his boss Margaret Tate played by Sandra Bullock for more than three years in an attempt to win a promotion to editor. Andrew has become so familiar with his boss that he know just about all there is to know about her. Margaret is somewhat of a recluse in that she has virtually no social life and runs her department at the publishing company with an iron fist. Including Andrew all of her co-workers see her as a witch on a broom casting spells on all her coworkers (Hoberman, Chiarelli, & Fletcher, 2009).<br/><br/>Andrew is a devoted employee with a passion to edit. In order to achieve this goal he feels it necessary to know everything there is to know about his boss and make sure that he pleases her at all times. Even if this means marrying her so that she can maintain her Visa status in the United States. Andrew makes what he feels is a deal with the devil in disguise. He agrees to marry Margaret only if she will give him the promotion that he feels he not only has worked three years for but that he deserves. Andrew and Margaret prove that love can come from the most unexpected places and conquer just about anything (Hoberman, Chiarelli, & Fletcher, 2009). Much like another one of Ryan Reynolds movies ""Definitely, Maybe"", where Will Hayes a successful political consultant is explaining to his daughter how he fell in love with and subsequently will divorce his daughter's mother. In the process Will falls in love with an unlikely match, a video store clerk named April (Bevan & Brooks, 2008). <br/><br/>The first time I saw this movie I fell in love. Just the thought of two very different people coming together to take a difficult situation and make it work for all involved sounds like the perfect scenario. Andrew who is very easy on the eyes and has women throwing their phone numbers at him has poured all his hopes and dreams into trying to get a promotion to editor under a boss who needs him to such a level that she has no intentions of promoting him out from underneath her. Margaret has closed herself off to the world in such a way that she has virtually no social life and has alienated her co-workers as a result of her work ethic.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful film of love, hope and desire. With many familiar and interesting family dynamics that most viewers can certainly relate to and understand. I found the scenery to be extremely beautiful giving the viewer a feeling of renewed hope and excitement."

Funny because it makes fun of the immigration service that is picking on silly details in the marriage between an American man and a Canadian woman who is being expelled because of an expired visa. And we are speaking of top executives in a publishing house. It is also funny because most of the film takes place in Alaska and the poor Canadian from Toronto does not exactly know how to react to eagles, waterways, family traditions and some other more exotic traditions. But apart from that it is schmaltzy to the extreme. It's a shame because they had a beautiful subject and the man like the woman, or the boy like the girl were good looking and we could have appreciated a little more skin contact. But it is fun for an evening when nothing is pressing in the oven or the washing machine.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID"

","No my title has no bearing on this movie at all. It just came to me. Spoilers? Who cares? Its been out for a while anyway..<br/><br/>While the majority of the scuttling movie-going insects pontificate about the script and the story and worry about the predictability and over-quote the ""chick-flick"" adage...which annoys me to the point of drinking glass, I THINK THIS IS A GREAT STUPID FILM.<br/><br/>Its made to make you laugh and hopefully, listen. Notwithstanding the incredible cast (Micheal Nouri, you're a Flashdancer baby!..awesome to see you there!), this was a showcase of chemistry on stage. If you didn't listen above the sound of your laughter or at least press ""pause"", you missed the entire point. Reynolds and Bullock are fun and happy together. They each deliver their lines with stage cast training and complement each other soooo much. As is evident in the 'most memorable quotes on IMDb as there are about 200 of them.<br/><br/>Besides the obvious irony of Bullock being 'deported' to Toronto (where I live btw) and that Reynolds is Canadian makes it all the more intellectually stable. I couldn't stop laughing at their lines; incredible, fun writing! Oh, and I'm sorry, but I am SO glad of the FINALLY wonderfully tastefully semi-nudity of Bullock. Gorgeous and stunning; more women need legs like that! This is a FUN-flick!"

","The horror genre is not the only film genre to be famous for producing only a few gems amidst a pile of mediocrity; the other primary one is the romantic comedy. About as creative as a dumbed-down slasher flick and lacking any of the guilty fun, romantic comedies are often blemishes on the face of Hollywood and a constant reminder that American cinema is almost completely out of new ideas. Then, along comes ""The Proposal"", a film that is indeed about as clichéd as they come, yet one that is charming, likable, and downright hilarious. Taking a top-notch cast and combining them with a surprisingly witty screenplay proves to be just the right breath of fresh air necessary to move this long-ailing genre in the right direction. Admittedly, ""The Proposal"" will probably only serve to inspire many more pale imitations rather than true creativity for the genre, but the appeal that this film has to offer, even to the most jaded of movie-goer, is undeniable and refreshing.<br/><br/>Read My Full Review Here: www.thecinemaboy.blogspot.com"

","THE PROPOSAL, in my opinion, is an excellent, hilarious, charming, and sweet romantic comedy. If you ask me, there were a lot of hilarious mishaps. Some of the funniest, in my opinion, were the ones with the dog and Margaret's (Sandra Bullock) cell phone. I hate to say this, but Margaret was really pushy at times. Also, I didn't like the wedding dress that she tried on. Before I wrap this up, the performances were spectacular, the direction was flawless, and everyone involved did a good job. In conclusion, to all Sandra Bullock fans who haven't seen this excellent, hilarious, charming, and sweet romantic comedy, I highly recommend it."
"FabD1","6","1","4","27 September 2009"," I did not laugh
","Well, <br/><br/>after having seen IMDb's current rating (7.1/10) and taken advice from someone who told me the movie was nothing new but very 'efficient', I finally bought the BD and watched it last night. End result: a very strange experience. It's the first time I don't laugh watching a comedy. I mean, not a single laugh; at best, two or three very timid smiles. Yet the movie kept me rather entertained, despite its obvious derivative and formulaic nature. Is it a good film? I guess so; at least, it's very well made.Is it original? Not in the least? Is it nevertheless different from most comedies? I guess so. As I write these lines, I come to realize that, for me, the movie worked best as a commentary on sexism (Sandra is the boss) and on age difference between partners. In other words, it works as a social commentary on serious and important matters. And I feel it's a courageous and laudable move for Sandra Bullock to have taken the part the plays in the movie. It's also always interesting for me, as a male, to watch a movie for which many if not most creative decisions have been taken by females. I feel it widens my horizon and I like it. The only thing I disliked is the social status the (male!) screenwriter gave to the groom's family or, more precisely, how that status was used as part of the plot. That, I REALLY disliked. <br/><br/>Le me conclude this way: Did I ever believe in the romance between the main characters? No! Am I happy with the ending? No! Would I nevertheless recommend the movie? I don't know! I hope this review, though ambivalent, will help you."
"Delphian","8","1","4","3 August 2009"," Best Rom-Com in Years
","You know how this movie is going to end before it starts. That's the thing about genre films: they are familiar and comfortable, like that T-shirt you still have from high school. The problem with most genre films is that they are riddled with clichés. It is a rare film that manages to fulfill all the expected conventions without slipping into soupy clichés. The Proposal is that rare film. Pete Chiarelli has crafted a script that satisfies our expectations of a romantic comedy, yet by keeping the pace up and keeping the scenario fresh and active manages to avoid the pitfall of romantic comedy schmaltz.<br/><br/>The film follows Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock), a top editor at a publishing house in New York, whose visa has expired and is facing deportation back to Canada. Her long-suffering assistant Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) unwittingly provides a way for her to stay in the US and keep her job. She threatens to destroy Andrew's career if he doesn't marry her – romantic, huh? In true romantic comedy form the two can barely tolerate each other at first. Yet a weekend in Alaska at Andrew's parents' place proves to be the perfect tonic for them. As they discover genuine feelings for each other, Margaret can't go through with the sham wedding and turns herself into the suspicious USCIS officer and prepares to move back to Toronto. As you might expect, Andrew flies back to New York in time to declare his true feelings for Margaret and as the saying goes, they live happily ever after.<br/><br/>One of the key ingredients that makes this film work is a stellar cast headed by one-time romantic comedy queen Sandra Bullock, who is back at the top of her game after a string of forgettable roles, with perhaps her most complex characterization yet. Bullock's Margaret Tate begins the film as a staid, cold-hearted editor who everyone fears and hates. Along the way as we learned more about Margaret, we discover this is truly a lonely woman whose tough façade is just that a façade, a way of coping with the life she was dealt. Bullock manages to bring out the humane side of Margaret, so that the audience ends up on her side.<br/><br/>As the over-worked, under-appreciated Andrew, Ryan Reynolds is instantly likable. Despite everything, Andrew is a glass half full kind of guy. Reynolds fits the role nicely and provides an excellent straight man for Bullock to play off of. I recognized Reynolds from the TV show Two Guys, a Girl, and a Pizza Place, and am glad to see that he has finally come into his own this year. I think we'll be hearing his name a lot more after the success of this film and Wolverine.<br/><br/>Of course no film is complete without a supporting cast and this film includes heavy hitters Craig T. Nelson and Mary Steenburgen as Andrew's parents. However, it is the indomitable Betty White as his grandmother who steals the show. White, who continues to get more funny and vivacious as the years go by, proves her comedic genius here. Some of the best moments in The Proposal belong to White. From the famous wedding dress scene where she gropes around to find Margaret's breasts amongst the overabundance of fabric, to dancing with the male stripper, to chanting in the woods Native American style, White exudes more energy than actresses half her age. All I can say is give the woman an Oscar already! The Proposal makes a valiant attempt to hearken back to the golden age of comedy when Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant ruled the silver screen. While it may not be Bringing Up Baby-good, it is certainly the best romantic comedy in recent years. This may be just the film to bring the dormant genre back. After being inundated with ""bromance"" comedies of late, The Proposal feels like a breath of fresh air."

","The Proposal has Sandra Bullock (Margret) has the laugh without the grunt and as the subtler version of Miranda Pristley from Devil wears Prada. Ryan Reynolds (Andrew), last seen in Wolverine, now he is the boss's (Sandra Bullock) assistant/executive. Some how Margret puts it together that Andrew and they are getting married, to save Margret from getting deported to Canada.<br/><br/>That's the proposal, what happens next in the movie is actually quiet predictable, but i like the way the story unfolds in the beautiful Sitca, Alaska. Even though they are not trying to be funny, but the whole situation and they land themselves into is awkward a first, funny for all of us. Since it is specially based in Alaska, it just seems to be perfect setting for a fantasy and romantic world. But none the less, the timing of the dialogues between Andrew and Margret are comical and well written.<br/><br/>Betty White who plays Andrew's eccentric, but loving grandmother takes the cake, specially with her dancing in the middle of the woods, or dancing with the stripper. She is purely brilliant and has her own extreme ways of resolving conflicts, which is hilarious. There is also Andrew's parents who underplayed in the movie. There is Andrew's story is comfortably on the not highlighted.<br/><br/>Its worth the watch, at the end of the day, its a nice ""chick flick""."

Sandra Bullock does not disappoint, she's better than ever here! Ryan Reynolds has great chemistry with her and holds her own. It's also great seeing Betty White! The funniest character of all is that guy(cant remember his name haha) who is a male stripper one minute and then the guy who holds the wedding the next minute! There's a reason why The Proposal is dominating the awful Year One, and is even holding its own against the famous Hangover! Say yes to the Proposal! Just one thing though. What the hell was up with the previews? As much as I love Sandra Bullock, her next movie(based on the previews) is truly going to make me lose some respect for her! Oh well."
"eggbert_tg","5","1","4","3 July 2009"," I Used to Like Sandra Bullock movies
","Her movies used to be good, and I did not object too much my wife dragged me off to see them. They were sort of like a romantic comedy version on the the Dukes of Hazard theme (the real Dukes -- the TV version): the good guys always won, the bad guys always lost, and nobody got hurt. Somewhere her movies started fading, though. The one about a time warp (one or two seasons ago) was the first of hers that I thought was pretty dumb. The Proposal was better but still dudley. The plot was way too predictable, some of the characters were stupid, and Sandra is way too old to be playing the part. Ryan Reynolds did well, as he always does. Anyway, I'd have to say the Proposal is mostly a bust. Not a waste of time; just not very good. I'd just as soon forgot I ever saw this thing, except the characters were so idiotic that it is going to take a while for this too happen. Back to Sandra Bullock: The I liked the best, of all her movies, was 28 Days. She was great in that."

There is some over the top humor in it. A good date night movie. I give the film a seven or eight out of ten. Tho Rambo VS The Transformers sounds cool I think my wife would rather have me buy her this film instead. I would not mind watching ""The Proposal"" again on video or VOD the movie one night. Good movie."

","Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds really light up the screen in this wonderful film. They have absolute Tracy and Hepburn chemistry. I am so glad this movie has put Bullock back on top because she has earned it. She really shines as a cold-hearted book editor who learns how to love. She finds out she is going to be deported to Canada unless she marries and she blackmails Reynolds into it. He whisks her away to Alaska to meet his loving but eccentric family (Craig T. Nelson and Mary Steenbergen are great as his parents and the wonderful Betty White steals the show as his kooky grandma. Betty is still going strong at 86 and may she have at least fourteen more birthdays). There is a great scene where Bullocks opens up about being so jealous of Reynolds because he has a wonderful family and she has been on her own since she was sixteen. This is a wonderful film that entertains, warms your heart and really makes you think. What more could you ask from a movie? Two big thumbs up."
"mizwright","8","1","4","16 June 2009"," We need more romantic comedies
","The summer months are reserved for the boys and their violent toys. Let's give the girls something to look at. The best things about the Proposal are the two lead comediennes Sandra Bullock and Bette White, and it's hard to tell who's stealing the movie from who. I give Bette the edge. Sandra is at her best in these familiar, comfortable roles and she's still got that comedic timing. Ryan Reynolds shows his comedy chops too. The story is a cross between The Devil Wears Prada and While you were sleeping; Sandra once again plays a woman who has to pretend she's in love or about to get married to a guy she hardly knows. It works just the same, and she shows a little grown-up toughness in this story. Lots of laughs and the girls will love it, especially at the end; everyone will go ""aaaHH"" goes ""aah"" when the two protagonists kiss."
"siderite","7","1","5","27 September 2009"," Started great, ended in a disgusting cliché
","At first I thought it could be possible that the movie was really as good as the hype and the marketing made it out to be. I mean, it is a romantic comedy, so could it really show chemistry between the two protagonists, really be funny and not stick to the stupid, idiotic formulas that rule this genre?<br/><br/>The start showed all that promise and then it started to go awry. Suddenly the self-empowered New York book editor remembers her passion for hip-hop music, starts dancing ridiculously, accepts anything is thrown at her by the incredibly rude Alaskan family that couldn't have been more annoying to either boy or girl. And in the end, this leads to love. Really?!<br/><br/>So, from something relatively good it became average by completely trashing the ending. It is still reasonably good for the genre, but hell... how hard is it to make a real script for once?"
"peterkowalski","7","1","5","24 September 2009"," Heart warming!
","The Proposal is not the most original movie of the year, and it's not the most unpredictable one, either. Truth be told, it's the same old story, repeated over and over again, but -again- truth be told, it's a very warm comedy. The movie starts much like The Devil Wears Prada, but as the movie progresses, the similarities vanish, and it begins to develop as While You Were Sleeping of 2009. It's the same story: two people who are so wrong for each other, the warm family you want to marry into and you wish it was your own; finally, the confession and the happy end. For some reason, it's not corny or cheesy at all; the great performances of Reynolds, Bullock and White make it seem believable and welcoming. The only problem one may have with the movie is its inconsistency; the movie starts glamorously, just to get silly, then plain stupid, then it picks up again. You have to have a lot of faith and courage to keep up and actually want to watch it till the end. It's semi-worth it: the ending is nothing of an original, but it is what you wanted to see. The movie -in its own charming manner- borderlines on kitsch and romantic, predictable and desired, just to land in the category of the romantic comedy of the year, a good, old-fashioned love story that does not need to be original or surprising, but it does make you fell warm and fuzzy inside."
"kerswilljnr","8","1","5","1 August 2009"," Much better than expected
","When i was literally dragged to see this film i wasn't expecting much just another romcom without much promise however i was pleasantly surprised. This film is actually funny! Sandra Bullock said in an interview we all know what the ending is but its how they get there which i think is utterly true for this film. The ending is handled well although it is slightly mushy but the rest of the film is much better than most films of the genre. Its a rom com with character which males will enjoy as well as females without the need for attractive leads, and although it does rush some aspects of their relationship it is a film i would defiantly see again and recommend which is unusual for someone that prefers horror! As an afternote im not a crazed female fan of the male lead but he was faultless. It does have some slightly adult humor but i will definitely being seeing this again with not only my friends but my parents also."
"3xHCCH","7","1","5","31 July 2009"," Sandra Bullock is Really so Funny!
","The main premise is quite far-fetched. Margaret Tate is a cold and bitchy Canadian book editor working in New York. She was not able to take care of some Immigration papers, so she is under threat of deportation. She coerces her assistant Andrew Paxton to marry her, in order to circumvent this problem. So the two of them fly off to rural Sitka, Alaska to meet Andrew's family. There, Margaret rediscovers the warmth of family life and love.<br/><br/>This is a really funny movie. I was actually shamelessly laughing out loud at several parts. Hahaha! Most of the success of this film lay on the star power of its female lead, Sandra Bullock. She is beautiful and classy, yet she is not afraid to play these funny scenes that threaten her dignity. She is really one funny actress. She is still one of my favorite actresses.<br/><br/>The funniest scene was when Margaret needed a towel after her shower but the dog kept on barking at her. There was a scene where she was just covering her essential parts with her arms and a bath mitten! Hahaha! The scene of Margaret fitting the Granny's 1929 wedding dress with her small breasts lost in the fabric is also very funny. There were scenes that that teeter on being flat, like the eagle flying off with her phone, or the scene with Granny (played by scene-stealing Betty White) dancing Eskimo rites in the forest, but it was Sandra Bullock's sheer comic timing that turn them into gems.<br/><br/>It was great to see Betty White again after all these years. I read in an interview that she is already 87 years old in real life. She is still quite sprightly and she looks very good for her age. Her naive Rose Nylund in ""The Golden Girls"" remain to be one of my favorite TV characters of all time. Too bad she was not given more substantial screen time and dialog here.<br/><br/>I leave the judgment about Ryan Reynolds to the ladies. I felt there was something missing in his chemistry with Sandra Bullock in their scenes together. His character is not as well-written as the Sandra Bullock character.<br/><br/>The most irritating character in the whole movie (even more than Andrew's dad and the INS official) is the multi-tasking Latino neighbor, Ramone (Oscar Nunez). All his scenes (especially the stripper scene) could have been deleted and the movie would have survived. Even his scenes during the closing credits were excruciatingly unfunny.<br/><br/>Overall, we both liked this movie. It was light and hilarious. A good movie for a good date. You can feel that this cast under director Anne Fletcher (Step Up, 27 Dresses) was having fun while they were shooting this. And picturesque Sitka, Alaska seems to be a great idea for a vacation one day."

","Oh my god, I must have cried in this film about five times. So many sentimental moments! You really get in touch with the characters and I loved Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds, they were incredibly sweet (and funny) together! This is the first time I've seen Ryan Reynolds act, he is amazing (the bit where he sings) and let me say...I've developed a huge crush on him now after this hahah. I've always been a big fan of Sandra Bullock, not only can she act but she gets bloody more beautiful as she grows older! (Not fair!) The Proposal is so entertaining to watch, never a dull moment! The cast was brilliant, especially Ryan Reynolds family... (his gran LOL). It did remind me slightly of The Family Stone where Sarah Jessica Parker and Sandra Bullock meet their partners families. They also embody the same characteristics (high maintenance, well-groomed and alittle uptight). Although The Proposal is waaaaaaaaaaay funnier. I'd definitely watch it again and cannot wait till it comes out on DVD! Definite must - see!!"

","While this is your typical romantic comedy, it's always made better by a phenomenal leading man. I personally think Ryan Reynolds is brilliant the way he can take over a scene with a mere mannerism or facial expression and this film is no different. However, he has a great serious side that he portrayed briefly in previous films such as Van Wilder, Blade III and Amityville Horror. The diversity is something I've grown to appreciate and it makes for a more believable role; girls don't like complete jokers, you've gotta have a serious side.<br/><br/>The surprise, to me, was the supporting cast. Sandra Bullock and Betty White took this movie to a higher level than I had expected. Overall I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to most anyone."

"diac228","7","1","5","22 June 2009"," More than you would expect in a romcom with a rehashed plot.
","The Romcom is a genre that becomes increasingly easy to craft, but as the years go on, it's a genre that is liked less and less by critics of all ages. Unlike the genres of action, sci-fi, and even comedy, the amount of ideas for a romantic comedy become quite limited. You can only find so many ways to make people fall in love before you realize you've seen it before. In recent years, romantic comedies rely much more on star power and chemistry rather than storytelling; since the story is probably something done before in dozens of other movies, romantic novels, television productions, plays, musicals, etc.<br/><br/>In this decade, the most lucrative romcom hits emerge because of the main actors and their interacting with each other. Movies like Hitch, What Women Want, He's Just Not That Into You, Sex and the City, Knocked Up, and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days used big stars, big names, and lavish productions for successful profiting. The Proposal does the same exact thing: they took a story we all know (and females love) and pitch it with two likable, bankable, and attractive stars. Add a dosage of beautiful scenery, strong supporting staff, and cute animals, and viola, there's a hit arriving. Yet, for the second time this year, we have a repetitive plot being saved by delightful performances. Just like He's Just Not That into You, it's a predictable ride, but an unexpectedly fun one.<br/><br/>The Proposal is about a stern, cynical, and seemingly heartless boss (Sandra Bullock as Margaret) blackmailing her young and hard-working assistant (Ryan Reynolds as Andrew) to marrying her to avoid being deported. In order to prove to immigration that they are indeed going to marry and it's not a ploy, the new couple heads to Alaska to meet Andrew's loving family. Throughout the trip, the fake couple learns more about each other than expected; and as the plot twists and turns, sparks start appearing. Like I've said before, we've seen this tale before; it's not a groundbreaking tale that will change movie-making forever.<br/><br/>Instead, we rely solely on star power and the supporting cast. Despite the age difference (and the movie experience difference), Reynolds and Bullock have a nice bit of chemistry together, and play off each other's tricks and subtle jabs perfectly. Bullock is very talented, but yet seems to have found a comfortable groove in these romantic comedies, and it is quite frustrating considering her performances in Speed and 28 Days. Reynolds proves that he can mold into different types of roles, as he was a comic book character just a few weeks before this movie's release. Check out the star power behind the support that was not advertised: Craig T. Nelson, Mary Steenburgen, Betty White, Malin Akerman.<br/><br/>Yes, the clichés are present, yes left-field moments do occur (and since when do they not in romantic comedies?), and yes, you can predict where the story goes. Fortunately for us, Disney (in its marketing), and the director Anne Fletcher does a fantastic job hiding the surprises sprinkled throughout the 107 minutes. The surprises range from plot twists, to totally improvised moments in which you can't help but chuckle at the absurdness. Fletcher doesn't dazzle with clever shots or beautiful cinematography, but did do a fantastic job maintaining The Proposal in the PG-13 range with several scenes, especially concerning a nearly graphic yet hilarious moment that must have ruffled some feathers in the censorship department with the nudity involved.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Once again, I am surprised by a chick flick, and can't help but actually recommend the film, even with the flaws attached. Star power, like in all the good romantic comedies of this decade, is what carries and drives this film away from mediocrity and keeps it afloat even whenever the movie drags the slightest bit. This isn't going to win awards or become analyzed for years to come, but it will improve any gloomy evening with its comedy, chemistry, and overall lovable personality. Loosely shut off the brain and memory of previous flicks, and you'll have a good time."

Both provided some much needed humor.White was the loving and occasionally odd grandmother and Nunez was the towns store clerk, only male stripper and minister.

Reynolds downplays his role nicely and Bullock plays her part perfectly. They're helped by a script that is predictable but VERY funny. A sequence between Bullock, an eagle and an adorable little dog is hysterical! There's a strong supporting cast doing wonderfully--White is great as always and Mary Steenburgen is excellent as Reynold's mother. Oscar Nunez is great in multiple roles! Only Craig T. Nelson disappoints as Reynold's father.<br/><br/>This is a chick flick that is utterly predictable but works every step of the way. Well done and entertaining. An 8."
"Chance2000esl","7","1","6","30 June 2009"," The Audience Laughed All Through the Movie!
","When I saw this at the local multi-plex with my wife of 27 years, the audience was continually laughing throughout the entire film. This tells you that here is a romantic comedy without any dead spots. And for good reason.<br/><br/>First, the cast. Sandra Bullock plays a tougher than nails book editor, Margaret Tate, who is forcing her secretary, Andrew Paxton (effectively played by Ryan Reynolds) into a quickie marriage-divorce so that she can avoid being deported back to Canada. That she is actually 12 years older than Reynolds only adds to the chemistry between them, as they try to fool his entire family in Alaska. Much of the humor derives from Margaret refusing to display (or to awkwardly show or painfully fake) real human emotion, making her enjoyable to watch throughout the film. This helped Sandra the actress avoid the cloying, saccharine sentimentality she displayed in 'While You Were Sleeping' (1995). Good move, producer Sandra! <br/><br/>The characters are fleshed out, the film is well written and directed. For me, the only low point was the scene in the woods where Margaret joins Grandma Annie (Betty White) in a silly chant and dance to 'give praise to the universe,' culminating in Margaret's uninhibited hip shaking frenzy. Though other reviewers didn't like it either, in the theater this was where the audience went wild with laughter, clapping and applauding! I'm sure everyone felt that finally she was relaxing, letting her human side come out, and was going to really fall in love with Andrew. But no. Since it's a romantic comedy, we expect this to happen sometime during the film, but when Andrew sees her, she puts the wall back up, and to the film's credit, keeps it there until the final moments of the movie, when showing her feelings she frankly admits, ""I'm scared."" <br/><br/>Great bonus casting of Mary Steenbergen and Craig T. Nelson as Andrew's parents, and for the wonderful presence of the highly skilled TV veteran performer Betty White, whom I first started watching in 'Life With Elizabeth' (1952)-- that's right, 59 years ago!-- and for the comic punctuations of Oscar Nunez doing a deliberately absurd and silly male stripper dance, as well as playing four other 'roles' in the film.<br/><br/>Although not totally a screw ball comedy, the somewhat thin premise is well played for laughs, and the movie is carried along by the fine efforts of its skilled actors.<br/><br/>I'll give it a 7.<br/><br/>Note: I'll also watch these Sandra Bullock films anytime: the amazing 'Demolition Man' (1993), 'Speed' (1994) and the ultra-jeopardy film 'The Net' (1995)."
"AcousticWords","7","1","11","21 June 2009"," Surprisingly decent
","I was ready for the run-of-the-mill 21st century romantic comedy -- a lot of smirky sexual humor, a lot of dumb people, and a lot of lame dialog. I was pleasantly surprised. True, this is no Shakespeare -- or even Howard Hawks -- but that kind of lightning doesn't often strike anyway, so no great disappointment there.<br/><br/>First of all, based on some comments I'd heard and read, I was expecting Sandra Bullock to be out of place as the romantic lead (one reviewer referred to her as being a bit long in the tooth for this kind of role). However, her character (Margaret Tate) was clearly a woman who had put off romance in favor of career. Indeed, when she is greeted by Mary Steenburgen (Grace Paxton) as ""Andrew's girl"", Betty White (Grandma Annie) remarks that Margaret could hardly be called a ""girl"". (Note: in the showing we attended, they previewed Sandra Bullock's next movie, ""All About Steve"". Now that one shows serious signs of miscasting.) Secondly, in reference to Grandma Annie, I was fully expecting her to be treated the way elderly ladies are often treated in contemporary romantic comedies (""Made of Honor"" comes immediately to mind) -- i.e., as either foul-mouthed (so we can snicker at the ""f"" word coming out of a sweet old face) or totally clueless about contemporary sexual practices. Instead, Betty White is given a smart, sassy role. She's a bit earthy, but it comes off as endearing and natural.<br/><br/>Third, the dialog and the characters are both intelligent. At first, Ryan Reynolds' Andrew Paxton seems a wuss, but as we get to know him, we realize that he is as tough as Margaret, and as ready to do whatever it takes to achieve his own dream, whether that be kowtowing to ""Satan's mistress"", or seizing his own chance to do a little blackmailing. And the Paxton clan clearly accept Margaret not because they're stupid, but because they honestly love Andrew and want to love his (supposed) fiancée as well.<br/><br/>Of course, you can't avoid some formula in a movie like this. And need we doubt for a moment that there will be a happy ending? (Although I will give the script credit for throwing in a little doubt there as to just whom that happy ending would include.) All in all, this is worth an evening at the movies. The audience included viewers from teenagers up to seniors, and all seemed to really enjoy it (that's a rarity!). However, we did see at least one young girl (about 10 or so); I really don't think this movie is appropriate for that demographic. (Why does a young girl have to be exposed to a male stripper, even played for laughs?)"

","Sandra Bullock said in an interview that she was leaving rom com alone for a while and perhaps it would have been a wise move to have stuck to the intent of that statement. Her performance in this film is one of its biggest flaws. Her delivery is as subtle as a gun, subtle as circus clowns with big shoes and a plank of wood. This was like stage slapstick rather than cinema. Overblown actions and responses, painted in large black and white lines and yet it still managed to seem muddled and unnatural. <br/><br/>There were 2 saving graces. <br/><br/>one was the location. A beautiful Alaskan setting and stunning house. <br/><br/>The second was Ryan Reynolds who even in a derivative uninspiring flat piece of movie making like this can still manage to put in a great performance. Granted it's a performance he's put into many of his roles before, but he's imminently likable and watchable. He doesn't put in obvious primary colours to his work and for that he is always the one to watch. I doubt the director guided him to this judging by the 2 dimensional rest of the movie. <br/><br/>Most of the good gags were in the trailer. I'm so pleased we got free passes to a preview, I just wish they'd been to another movie, like a half decent one. <br/><br/>Please stop making these kind of movies Sandra. You're not without talent but you've got to start figuring out what that talent is, and it's not lame over acted rom com."

","""The Proposal"" is a romantic comedy film directed by Anne Fletcher and written by Peter Chiarelli. This film was released in 2009 in the United States of America. The main characters are played by Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Sandra Bullock plays the Canadian Margaret Tate, who is an executive editor in chief of a book publishing company, and Ryan Reynolds plays Andrew Paxton, her personal assistant who is always bullied around by her. <br/><br/>After being informed that she has to leave the United States and has to go back to Canada because of an expired visa, Margaret forces her assistant Andrew into a marriage. Margaret promises Andrew to publish his book manuscript if he marries her. An U.S. immigration agent suspects them because he thinks they faked the marriage to avoid Margaret's deportation. The ""couple"" travels to Sitka, Alaska, to visit Andrew's family because of the 80th birthday of his grandmother. There, some unexpected incidents happen.<br/><br/>We recommend this film to everybody who likes funny films with a romantic touch. The main actors did an amazing job and played their roles authentically, but the supporting actors are great also.

There are frequent illegal immigrant legalization campaigns, after all...<br/><br/>The cast is strong and pleasant as well, especially female ones: Sandra Bullock as Margaret Tate and Betty White as Grandma Annie (White was over 85 during the filming!). Ryan Reynolds is a good actor, but not among my favorites, he seems sometimes rustic... However, there was chemistry visible between him and Bullock, and the duo was nicely complemented by others plus fine Alaskan nature, being a kind of supporting actor as well. <br/><br/>All in all, no masterpiece, but worth watching if you like romantic comedies without syrupy course of events."

","OK, I don't think it's a spoiler to say that this is a genre movie, and we all know the conventions of the genre. Which means it's not about the story, it's about the execution. <br/><br/>And this was a well-executed instance of the genre. Not as good as the absolute best, but pretty damn good. The leads are attractive and appealing, there are few (unfortunately not quite not zero) of the lazy clichés so common to movies, and very little I found objectionable. <br/><br/>My primary (small) criticism is somewhat meta: we are supposed to take from the fact that this woman is driven and competent that she is a b**ch, a monstrous boss. At the start of the movie we are told by everyone how awful she is, but that awfulness seems primarily to consist of her being confident and doing her job well. This left a bad taste in my mouth --- it seemed like an example of precisely what feminists say about the impossible situation of a woman in business."

It is clichéd, formularic but benefits greatly from the superb chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. <br/><br/>The Proposal is about Margaret Tate, a pushy and ruthless boss who forces her young male assistant, Andrew Paxton, to marry her so that she can escape deportation to Canada. They both negotiate deals in their relationship and after their marriage they decide they will divorce straight after if Margaret comes with Andrew to meet his parents in Alaska. From here their relationship unintentionally blossoms and they discover their true feelings for each other. The match-up of Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds is brilliant and their awkwardness is just superb, as is Reynolds' character's complete weakness to stand-up to her and easy to manipulate personality. They attempt to outdo each other throughout the film and it is, in a way, nice to see how their relationship develops. <br/><br/>Reynolds' family is suitably embarrassing, especially Betty White's grandma Annie along with Mary Steenburgen and Craig T. Nelson's mum and dad. <br/><br/>The main stumbling block in this film is not the characters but the lack of plot movement or variation out of the ordinary, which makes way for a slow paced second half of the film. The premise is there but the majority of the film is just 'coincidental' events bringing them closer together. Sandra Bullock although very good as her bossy character, seems strange as a complete character contrast later in the film when her character changing to a loving sympathetic fiancé. A scene in which she raps with Betty White is completely ridiculous and silly.<br/><br/>The film as a whole is enjoyable, light entertainment but once again an excellent romantic- comedy concept has been ruined by the filmmakers strong desire to stick to the same old boring formula."

","OK, it's a conventional Hollywood romantic comedy. Namely: something has been done endless times before, and will be done endless times after. Although the skeleton is one, the flesh and blood are many and different, or - for the sake of satisfied viewers - supposed to be. Let's see how this movie was doing in terms of that matter.<br/><br/>The couple is working in the publishing business. She is the tough boss of he. He is loaded with money, but just doesn't say. The family of he lives in Alaska. Then, some sprinkles, like: an eagle kidnapping a puppy, a baby maker blanket, Sandra Bullock's rap, and yes.. a male stripper!<br/><br/>On the other hand, there are tons of the genre's worn-out antiques: the from haters to lovers, from fake love to actual love, and the opposites attract themes and sketches. The character that blows up the scheme of the fake lovers, hence a problem with the newly born ""actual"" love. A confession in front of the whole jury, hence a bigger problem that - naturally - leads to some kind of conciliation. Then the ""running"", which always distinguishes these movies, where he or she runs for the other, to catch her or him in the nick of time. Well, you know the drill, you experienced the routine, AND THIS MOVIE TOO!<br/><br/>Despite the general mildness, the few ""new"" touches were few and touches. Some of them bothered my stomach, and I do mean the male stripper scene, then knowing that he is the town's minister as well (How innovating? No, How repulsive!). Moreover, the many ""old"" clichés were many and old. At the moment of ""Whoops, we ran into each other so accidentally while being both undressed"" I was real sick. I saw that so-called coincidence at least 100 times before in Hollywood romantic comedies, produced in the last 10 years only!<br/><br/>All the storylines that concern Ryan Reynolds's character, ex-fiancée, father, wasn't utilized, or even made, well. Watching material like swallowing an appetizer suddenly, a fabricated ring story.. etc. proved to be repeated and unfunny. In fact, the comedy was ranging between not being made creatively, or not being made! The movie was deadly predictable; for instance, I saw the whole third act, scene by scene, coming from a million miles away. And if it was predictable from the start, then the script didn't make it ""that enjoyable"" along the way too. Here's a movie that thinks that it makes new stuff and big laughs merely by seeing a Hispanic male stripper that works as a minister!<br/><br/>There is a 13 years gab between Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. That wasn't for the sake of her by any chance. She - for the very first time in her career - looked old in front of her rom-com's co-star. Reynolds is talented, but seemed a bit stiff for most of the time.<br/><br/>The most lovely and energetic old actress today, Betty White, is the movie's main dish. She stole the show, albeit it wasn't originally that hard to be stolen. There was a chuckle here, and other there, all in the first third, which heavily disappoints for the rest of the movie. Hmmm, what else could be good?! Yeah, Sandra Bullock, despite doing almost the same again and again. Her ""favorite things"" thawing monologue was perfectly written and acted. I myself like Brian Dennehy as well!<br/><br/>Along the way, (The Proposal) pushed me to remind numerous other movies: (Green Card - 1990), (The Devil Wears Prada - 2006), (Something's Gotta Give - 2003), (When Harry Met Sally - 1989), even violent action like (Wanted - 2008) with suppressed employee who bursts in his female boss's face, and (When You Were Sleeping - 1995) starring Bullock herself. Maybe before writing this, Peter Chiarelli (mainly a producer who turned here into first time screenwriter) watched many romantic comedies to make somehow a mix out of them. But the outcome turned out to be something easy to write, easy to watch, and easy to forget. WAW, that has become a sign of Hollywood's movies lately!<br/><br/>I read that tissues are recycled from old papers. (The Proposal) is a tissue, smooth and light. But still a used-for-once tissue. And its original ""papers"" are better and more original. I don't mind doing the same stories again and again and again. The thing is.. again isn't always a gain!<br/><br/>4 out of 10. Sorry, but the ""Whoops, we ran into each other so accidentally while being both undressed"" moment was too unbearable. It's more predictable and boring than seeing Friday the 13th getting killed in the end of every Friday the 13th movie!"
"abbers1990","7","0","1","1 May 2012"," The Proposal
","This movie starts out with a very rough professional relationship between two people. Both of them are not truly happy in their lives but they feel they are doing what they need to in order to succeed in life. They have good jobs, they are young, they are good looking. But as the movie progresses they run into a few problems, the main lead woman (Margaret) is told that she won't be able to have her job anymore because she is Canadian and her visa in order to work in the United States was denied. She then convinces her assistant (Andrew) to marry her in order to keep her job and therefore her happiness. Andrew agrees to do this only because she has threatened to take his job away if he does not help her. They go away for the weekend in order to tell Andrew's parents that they are getting married. The over arching theme of the weekend and therefore the movie is that in order to find true purpose in life you must find your significant other. The people in your life are the things that make life worthwhile, they make it worth doing anything, being in a certain job, loving someone that's in your life. <br/><br/>God is not a part of family; He is not even a part of the movie. He does not get mentioned at all, the wedding that takes place does not happen in a church instead it happens in a barn. The only thing that is spiritual is the thanking of the ""spirits"" which is not taken seriously. It is given in a very comical light; the grandmother who is thanking the spirits is shown in a very humorous view. The only authority that is expressed within the movie is that of people and most of those that are in authority are expressed as unintelligent or uncaring. The only gods in this movie are money and self. The money is expressed through the success that the people try to attain through their jobs. The self is expressed in pretty much everything else that is happening, it is all about how does it make me feel what are the emotions that I am going through, what kind of emotions do others make me feel. The media part of this movie has a couple of mixed messages. It does not give any value to God and what God's part in our lives is. He is not the authority He is not what gives us hope or a future through this movie. We only need to find the one that is going to love us for the rest of our lives; that should be our goal. We need to find love in those around them instead of in a relationship with God the Father. <br/><br/>This movie is good art in my opinion. It has good technical excellence; it was well done with good acting and good writing of the script. The story is valid, there are a few stretching details that would be a little hard to believe at times but at the same time they could happen. The content is solid, it's a good story line and something that someone can get very easily caught up in. I find that this movie is good entertainment although we need to be careful about who we watch it with and what parts people are exposed to. There is one scene that is inappropriate for someone young and to be honest it's a bit inappropriate for anyone. It is very funny but at the same time it is two naked people to say it bluntly. The pair is completely nude, and the camera captures all but the most sensitive regions of their bodies throughout the scene. In essence, the filmmakers show us everything, while not showing quite everything. Because of this I'm not sure I would be able to endorse the entire movie, especially without some reservations. I found that the love that Andrew and Margaret have for each other is completely unselfish. This is the kind of love that we should be having for one another. I would be able to put that into perspective and instead of two humans loving each other it would be God loving us. The love that He has for us is perfect and although sometimes the love that others have is self seeking we would never have to worry about that with Christ's love."

","Sandra Bullock absolutely wonderful as always but I had not seen Ryan Reynolds before and wasn't certain how he would pan out, but to my surprise, I found him to be not just engaging but very sexy and a perfect foil for Sandra - together they make a great couple and I even teared up at the end - yikes - am I turning into a creme puff or what? The supporting cast is uniformly strong and the location shots are first rate - who knew Alaska could be so inviting - in fact all production values are first rate and I am certain this has a lot to do with the fact that the film was Sandra's baby since she is one of the producers and I am certain the force behind getting the film made. She is no longer a lightweight - that's for sure. She's right up there with the big boys!"

","Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds star in one of the most perfect romantic comedies ever accomplished. Bullock plays a boss from hell, who pretends to marry her secretary, portrayed by Ryan Reynolds, to save herself from being deported. Then, it leads to complete wackiness when they visit Ryan Reynold's family for the fake wedding, and it ends up into hilarious consequences. Now, ""The Proposal"" is one of the greatest romantic comedies of the year, and Sandra Bullock brings another excellent role of a lifetime that stole the entire show, since her inspirational performance in ""The Blind Side"". Ryan Reynolds does a pretty good job for his role, and he makes perfect chemistry on screen with Bullock. The perfect romantic comedy ensemble continues with Malin Akerman, Mary Steenburgen, Craig T. Nelson, and the ever-loving, ever-funny Betty White. Every moment in the movie was totally hilarious, I almost fell out of my seat. Some of my favorite moments include Betty White feeling up Sandra Bullock, an accidental naked jump with Sandra and Ryan, Sandra making a groove dance with Betty White, and the hilarious interviews during the end credits. The movie also has a well-written script that really took another comedic level, and it contains worthy dialouge. But more than comedy, the movie struggles through serious romantic drama when they start to realize they are literally in love, when all they are doing is pretending to be in love. The script is top-notch, the cast is excellent, the jokes are deserving and hilarious, the heart of this movie is beautiful, and this is a well-deserved romantic comedy for the ages, and you won't be disappointed with the results of watching a Sandra Bullock flick. Well, maybe not if you saw ""All About Steve"" (I hear it's bad!). ""The Proposal"", in my review, ""a fun and exciting romantic comedy, with the incredible Sandra Bullock""."

","This is a movie that holds up to repeat viewings! There is always something to laugh at-this movie is full of humor that can easily be missed during an initial viewing. Reynolds is a comedy guy, so this role was made for him. Bullock can do anything I'm convinced. Thank you so much for Betty White! Gamma really is a character! I loved the scene in the forest between her and Sandra- dancing and chanting- in Sandra's case, rapping! What a riot! I love how there is depth to these characters- it's not some surface comedy flick-all for laughs. The two grow and come to realize very significant things. For ""Satan's Mistress,"" family is important and special to have in ones' life. For Andrew, he realizes that he actually likes the woman and he'll do anything to get her back, include marry her so she can stay in the country. All in all, I highly recommend this solid film."

","I want to start out by first saying that I ADORE everyone in this cast. I can't even think of a better cast. Starting from Ryan Reynolds all the way down to whoever plays the immigration guy. Brilliant.<br/><br/>I personally like rom-coms. I do not have a problem with them because, to me, they're still better than extra=cheesy slasher films. With that said, I know how to spot a good romantic comedy really well. Let me tell you, this is one of them. I laughed every time they wanted someone to, I gasped every time they wanted it, and I sighed every time they wanted it.<br/><br/>Bullock and Reynolds have hilarious and wonderful chemistry, both when they hate each other and when they love each other. They play off one another to make it so believable even though the plot isn't.<br/><br/>Let's take a moment to talk about my favorite part, the side characters. First, there's the wonderfully sweet and charming Mary Steenburgen playing the mom. Love her! Then, there's the dad. Him and Reynolds have issues, and I love the way they play that out. Malin Ackerman is so charming, as usual playing the ex girlfriend. There's Ramon, the town.... everything.... So funny. And last, the one and only, Betty White. She was so adorable and the scene with her and Bullock is to die for. Roll on the floor funny.<br/><br/>I don't understand how anyone could hate this movie. Definitely one of my favorites!"

","Recap: Margaret Tate is the chief editor, Andrew's boss in fact, and the office witch. Exactly everyone, Andrew included, hates her for her heartless, ruthless ways and that she puts work above anything else, and expects everyone else to o the same. She does things her own ways, and don't bother listening to anyone else, including the Immigration Agency. So now they're deporting her. To stop that she recruits Andrew to marry her. To fool the immigration agent they go to Andrew's grandmothers birthday, in Sitka Alaska. At first they can barely stand each other, but naturally there is more to each one than first meets the eye.<br/><br/>Comments: A pretty much standard romantic comedy, where the two at first seems to hate each other but in the differences find love. And it works well, and I really liked The Proposal. Not very surprising in the grand scheme, actually it takes most of the standard cliché, but it does have a few quick turns and small surprises.<br/><br/>It got a good cast too. Bullock is a real veteran in the genre, and got solid support from Reynolds, Steenburgen, Nelson and perhaps especially White. They are all proved actors in the genre, and performs their respective roles well. But especially Reynolds and Bullock lack some of the chemistry as a couple, both when fighting and when in love, to really elevate the movie. It looks too much of acting, they don't seem to believe it themselves.<br/><br/>But I did get quite a few laughs out of it, and that's the point isn't it? <br/><br/>6 fraud marriages out of 10."

Nevertheless, they are different films, being both romantic comedies and both starring Sandra Bullock.<br/><br/>'The Proposal' is not much of a movie and its plot is quite predictable and formulaic, but it does well its aim of entertaining the public. It's a story of blackmail, selfishness and manipulation which converts in... love! Such a strange ""marriage""...<br/><br/>Julia Roberts was to have taken the role of Margaret Tate. However, just like in 'While You Were Sleeping' Demi Moore was replaced by Sandra Bullock, on this one Julia Roberts was replaced by Sandra Bullock. Very clever decision in both cases. I couldn't see Demi Moore in that role or that frog's mouth Julia Roberts in this role.<br/><br/>Ryan Reynolds and the loving Sandra Bullock have a nice chemistry. They convince as a couple who hates each other but eventually fall in love. Both act well, but Sandra Bullock is better in her performance. While beautiful, she wasn't always a great actress, but with age she has improved considerably.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock... can you believe she was nearly in her mid-40's when she did this movie? She is in amazing shape! She's undoubtedly a milf and there are a few ""sexy"" scenes with her in this movie. A real delight for the eyes and soul of men."
"bissetterh","8","0","1","24 January 2011"," Summary of the Proposal
","The proposal was one of the better romantic comedies I've seen. Sandra Bullock can pull off any role imaginable. Ryan Reynolds has always proved to be very humorous and the two actors were a very good match for this film. Sandra Bullock plays the harsh boss of an editing firm while Ryan Reynolds plays the ""bitch"" secretary.<br/><br/>Sandra Learns that she is being deported back to Canada therefore won't be able to work for a US company anymore. Thus, she gets the idea to be ""engaged"" to Ryan Reynolds so that she can remain in the country. Since she threatened his career, he agreed to marry her so that she could become a citizen of the US and then quickly get a divorce.<br/><br/>The comedy in this movie is so much better than some of the films the two have been in such as ""Just Friends"" (Ryan Reynolds) and ""All About Steve"" (Sandra Bullock). Betty White is also in this movie and plays the sweet and dim-witted grandmother which truly adds to the movie. Also the fact that the two travel to Alaska for the weekend provides the movie with beautiful scenery and even a tad bit of action. It is a must see ""chick flick"" and perfect for a date night."

","Sandra Bullock(TWO WEEKS NOTICE)& Ryan Reynolds(JUST FRIENDS)star in this romantic comedy about a businesswoman named Margaret Tate(Bullock) who is about to be deported to Canada as her visa is expired. She comes up with a plan and makes out that she is engaged to Andrew Paxton(Reynolds) who is her secretary. The two then have to go to Alaska where Andrew's parents live and they have to pretend that they are actually in love with one another because they don't want anyone to get suspicious about it. As day goes by the two start to like each other for real and they soon realize that what they are doing is wrong.<br/><br/>I quite enjoyed this movie as there was a lot of funny scenes from Sandra Bullock rapping a song with Betty White chanting in the woods,Ryan & Sandra getting naked and they fell on top of one another(yes it is awkward isn't it it makes you want to barf),the hilarious hen do with the guy in the shop stripping off and showing his butt and Sandra getting embarrassed. The chemistry between Reynolds & Bullock was good(I heard that these two spend New Years eve together in real life hmm I wonder will they actually date in real life who knows). The story was good yet it reminds me of that Mellisa Joan Hart movie My Fake Fiancé which was from ABC Family in 2009.<br/><br/>If you like MY FAKE Fiancé then you will like this.<br/><br/>BEST SCENE: Where Margaret is singing Get Low in the woods. Where her and Andrew fall on top of one another WORST SCENE: The ending could have been better(the alternative ending from the DVD was better than the one they already used in the film).<br/><br/>BEST QUOTE Margaret I'm asking you to marry me,because I want to date you."

","The Proposal was neither bland nor grand. It was what it was: A zany romantic comedy with a very strong cast and silly plot lines.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock was consistently funny, but it was Ryan Reynolds's character that stood out for me. Every time I see him on film I forget how hilarious he can be.<br/><br/>I missed the opening 15 minutes, but basically Margaret (Bullock), a predominant book editor in New York, is in danger of being deported to Canada (unimportant as to why) and the only way she will be allowed to stay in the United States is if she gets married. Her assistant Andrew (Reynolds) is unwittingly dragged into the whole mess and agrees to a phony nuptial as long as she later promotes him to editor. But in order for everything to become official, the pair must prove to immigration that they are indeed in love and not committing fraud by passing an exhaustive test that challenges their intimate knowledge of one other. In a further attempt to attest their counterfeit romance, Margaret tells a representative from the immigration office that she and Andrew will be spending the weekend in his hometown of Sitka, Alaska.<br/><br/>That's where I'll stop as I wish not to give too much away.<br/><br/>If you wish to simply turn your brain off for a couple hours, The Proposal will suit you just fine. It's also a decent date movie that shouldn't be taken too seriously. There's a scene with a fluffy dog, a cell phone and a hawk that essentially puts the whole thing over the top."

","While it has it's moments, premise is weak for several reasons:<br/><br/>Margaret...she should have been involved with a man (maybe the writer Frank who we never see). She proposes to him first, he turns her down. Then, last ditch idea, she turns to Andrew. She carries that hurt and rejection (makes her more sympathetic and human) and reveals that in time to Andrew. In other words, make Margaret conflicted, make her begin to fall for Andrew and be shocked, confused and realize that there's more to life than being career driven by what she sees in him. The his great family thing is fine, but in her eyes Andrew becomes great, too.<br/><br/>Andrew's mom should hate Margaret. It's OK for the older GrandMa to be all gushy and romantic, but no one really looks at why Margaret supposedly loves Andrew (a boss he's told them he hates). It falls on his mom, who should be more skeptical of the whole deal...this is her only child!! Accepting it on face value is too convenient. Again, this is something else for Margaret to have to deal with.<br/><br/>Two scenes could have been better. Don't you think that being on a plane ride for what 10 hrs, the thought of their marriage proposal story would have come up?<br/><br/>Also, the scene where Margaret threatens Andrew with mutilation for the grievous crime of grabbing her butt (not funny) would have been funny if she'd just forgotten herself and kneed him in his privates with Mom and Grand Mom looking on.<br/><br/>That's it...they were too much 'in character.' Funny would have been the two of them trying to think up stuff to do to appear to be the couple they weren't in front of people. Andrew could have been laying kisses on her in front of his folks without warning her and she'd have to roll with it, etc."
"Ryan_MYeah","6","0","2","24 June 2010"," MYeah's review: The Proposal
","While the movie does make for an interesting premise, it's only moderately successful.<br/><br/>The film stars Bullock and Reynolds respectively as Margaret Tate, a very pushy boss, and Andrew Paxton, her tortured assistant. After discovering that she is about to be deported back to Canada, Margaret hatches a plan to stay in the country, she decides to marry Andrew so she may keep her citizenship. Andrew agrees to this only if Margaret gives him a promotion. To further keep up the facade, they both travel to Alaska to meet Andrew's family, and announce the news. This includes Andrew's pushy father (Played by Craig T. Nelson), his very loving mother (Played by Mary Steenburgen), and his all around peculiar grandmother (Played by Betty White).<br/><br/>The film relies on a lot of formula. Two leads who hate each other at the start, one hatches a plan to obtain something they want, The two begin to understand that they do love one another, and I'll let you figure out the rest. It's not a very original story, but it's better than most formula movies, and at the very least fast paced.<br/><br/>The movie at least gets it performances right. Bullock and Reynolds are not only good in their roles, but have such great chemistry together. The rest of the cast such as Nelson, Steenburgen, and others aren't really as good. Even Betty White, who while good in the film, lacks a great deal of her always brilliant comedic presence.<br/><br/>So while it suffers from a predictable story, it benefits from two good lead performances.<br/><br/>I give The Proposal **1/2 out of ****"
"Robert_duder","8","0","1","5 June 2010"," Sandra Bullock returns to basics with a little edge and heck its just fun
","Nearly every review I read on The Proposal had the same statements and I agreed all around. It wasn't going to blow any minds, or win any acting awards but it was exactly what you expected when you walked in. Classic romantic comedy gal Sandra Bullock goes back to her roots and delivers a cute, funny rom-com and the only difference between this and some of her previous successful romantic comedies is that The Proposal has just a little more edge. Perhaps gives a more adult twist to her family friendly comedies with a little more raunchy humor which was necessary to go up against 2009 comedies like The Hangover. The film isn't trying to blow you away with anything but rather giving you two great stars with incredible comedic timing and personality and delivering a fun, cute adventure that you will enjoy and could watch any time. From slapstick one liners to some really terrific physical comedy the cast is incredibly well put together and just a clever slick little movie. Some terrific cameos round out what is easily a cast that works together and shines by playing off each other in the most perfect way.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock has had ups and downs like any other but ultimately she is a star and 2009 was absolutely her year with this smash success and of course the success of The Blind Side. (I'm gracefully side stepping All About Steve---although I haven't had the pleasure yet.) Bullock demonstrates what made her an absolute star in The Proposal. She's versatile, funny, incredibly charismatic and can be a lady and a little raw at the same time. Ryan Reynolds is equally as versatile. He has done drama, action, horror, and of course comedy and he happens to be the perfect combination to Bullock despite their twelve years age difference. He is also one of the most charismatic young stars in Hollywood. They are truly the stars of the film but the supporting cast is a who's who of character actors who are as fun and charismatic as the leads. Mary Steenburgen (an amazing comedienne) and Craig T. Nelson who is always amazing. The amazing Betty White as Grandma Annie is sadly and almost surprisingly underused but her one liners as always are impeccable.<br/><br/>I think women directors always have a special flare when it comes to romantic comedies. And I don't mean to say they make it more like a chick-flick but rather have a knack for telling a story with the characters. Looking at the resume of director Anne Fletcher and you'd think she could write just about anything. The woman has worked on everything from amazing comedy classics like 40 Year Old Virgin to choreography on Catwoman. She obviously enjoys a good story as much as anyone seeing this film. Although her directing resume is fairly new this film will prove her chops. So the moral of my review and most others is The Proposal is the absolutely perfect movie to drop down and just relax for two hours and you'll laugh and just really have a good time. It is the ultimate date movie and anyone who finds something to complain about means they expected more than what it offers. 8/10"

","A wonderful premise soon evaporates into a very routine, ordinary film.<br/><br/>Bitchy book editor, Sandra Bullock, is an absolute ogre to deal with. She fires a subordinate and then learns that as a Canadian she faces deportation for not following through on paper work. She comes up with the brilliant idea of marrying her male secretary, who has long been suffering under her management.<br/><br/>This all sounds great but the film soon flounders when the secretary takes Bullock home to meet his family. Living in an area of Alaska, we have Craig T. Nelson who appears angry at the whole world, Mary Steenburgen, as his wife, who seems rather uncomfortable in her role and Betty White, the ex-Golden Girl, who as grandma does a native dance and feigns a heart attack to get her grandson to the airport after Bullock.<br/><br/>The one good point is the emphasis in the movie on family togetherness. Otherwise, it's rather routine grappling with the issue of 2 people falling in love under unusual circumstances. How many times have we seen that idea before?"

","Sandra Bullock, one of my favorite actresses, falls somewhere between the brilliant, confident, wise-cracking Katherine Hepburn and the more vulnerable and lovable Doris Day in her role as a successful and ruthless businesswoman (Margaret) who coerces her wimpy male assistant (Andrew, played by Ryan Reynolds) into marrying her to prevent her deportation to Canada, an occurrence that would negatively affect her career. In order to accomplish this, they must both convince the U.S. immigration authorities and his family in Alaska that theirs is not a marriage of convenience.<br/><br/>The problems I have are with the main characters are: How does a sophisticated, well-heeled businesswoman does not know how to dress to take a boat ride, but shows up in a business suit? How does she not know how to pull the blinds to keep the sun out of her eyes? How is it that a seemingly meek and manipulated assistant turns out to be from a wealthy and supportive family; he certainly does not have to subject himself to the demands and blackmail of his boss! It was also a shame that the background scenes were not shot in Alaska; if they had, they would have been much more breathtaking and majestic. If you can overlook these inconsistencies, ""The Proposal"" is fun and entertaining, thanks to the spot-on acting by the superb cast, including Bullock, Reynolds, Betty White, Mary Steenburgen and Craig T. Nelson.<br/><br/>Funniest scenes: The misreading by Grace and Grandma Annie of what is happening with Margaret, the eagle, the dog and the cell phone; Margaret and the male stripper.<br/><br/>My advice is to ignore the silly script and just enjoy the actors' witty performances."

So she proposed her assistant on her knee to marry her. This part is very funny. Another part that made me laugh a lot is the word she said ""Alaska"". Because of the special pronunciation of this word that I can still remember the word she said and imitated her. That really interested me. They pretended that they married and they fell in love accidentally at the end. I like this kind of romance though it is a common plot. But I think it is still sweet. As a person who desire for love, the movie of love real touch his or her heart. As a comedy romance, it makes me feel warm and touching and makes me burst into tears with joy.

Betty White was terrific as the spunky grandmother of our assistant Andrew to Margaret the chief editor aka shrew of a top notch publishing company. Faced with deportation, Andrew agrees to marry Margaret to save her life so to speak. Everything is not what it seems as far as Andrews life as well as with Margarets life.

When this came out in theaters, I had heard people calling it, the best romantic comedy in year's, so needless to say, it put a lot of hype on the movie for me.

Ryan Reynolds did very well in his role. He's a likable gent, and proved why he's one of the best up and coming actors out there. Mary Steenburgen and Craig T. Nelson do fine as the parents. Betty White is funny, but her character kinda repulsed me in the end, as I already mentioned. Malin Akerman plays a nice part.<br/><br/>Bottom line.

Bullock, Reynolds, and the entire auxiliary cast are so astonishingly bad, so dull and unpleasant, that the only entertainment that could possibly be derived was to see if my beloved wife and daughter would declare it good . . . and me bad.<br/><br/>I reviewed Practical Magic a few years ago and, if you go back to read it, you'll notice that I had some kind things to say about Sandra Bullock's pleasant believability on screen.<br/><br/>Where did it go? The woman I found breathtakingly normal ten years ago looks and acts as if she is just a skin shade shy of a George Romero undead-person; Bullock shambles zombie-like through the movie.

I would have given anything to watch her grab Betty White to rip out her throat (not that I have anything against Betty White--it's just that THAT would have been original!).<br/><br/>Everything sucked in this movie, even the idea that Reynold's family couldn't be a normal working-stiff clan, but a dysfunctional way- upper middle class bunch of unappealing boobs.<br/><br/>But . . .<br/><br/>I did get two hours of uninterrupted quality time with the family.

","Although entertaining to a point, there are too many similarities to other comedies to make THE PROPOSAL anything but ordinary.<br/><br/>Most notably I found the plot to be very similar to another, older Sandra Bullock movie, WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING. But this time we have an accomplice in the deceit and he's not in a coma. Seriously. Think about it...<br/><br/>A woman who is in need of something (in this case a need NOT to be deported) comes up with a plan to achieve that goal (whether by accident – While You Were Sleeping – or not – The Proposal). Girl falls for the wrong guy. Guy falls for wrong girl. Family gets fooled. Girl confesses and thinks she's lost everything. Guy chases down girl with the approval of the family. Everyone lives happily ever after. Ta-da! The entertainment value in the film comes from the first half of the movie in which we have plenty of comedic zingers flying about, including quite a few from Grandma Annie (Betty White) while trying to dress Margaret (Sandra Bullock, THE LAKE HOUSE) in a wedding dress and losing – then finding – her breasts.<br/><br/>The cast is good in their respective roles, including main love interest Ryan Reynolds (SMOKIN' ACES) playing Andrew Paxton, a sort of rich boy playing poor boy in order to tick-off his father, Joe, played by Craig T. Nelson (THE FAMILY STONE). Nelson just seems to be going through the motions during the entire film and never really gains and traction. As does Mary Steenburgen (THE DEAD GIRL) who plays Reynold's mother.<br/><br/>The other problem with the casting is that we just don't get that romantic air between Bullock and Reynolds' characters. She is obviously much older than him (can you say ""cougar?""), which isn't always a problem but, again, there just didn't seem much attraction going on. They fight, argue and never really resolve anything before miraculously falling in love ...because of one kiss? Let's get real...<br/><br/>Even with these flaws, the comedic timing is excellent and the visual backdrops of Boston and the (supposed) Alaskan countryside can take one's breath away. Also, the Paxton family house is stunning to see.<br/><br/>Looking for something original? Not here. Want a fantastic romance story? Not here either. Looking for something entertaining, funny, and visual appealing? Give this one a try."

","I first approached this film with caution. I love Sandra Bullock, but after ""premonition"" I had serious doubts about her choice of films. After reading some reviews I decided to give it a try, specially since I read that Betty White was in it.<br/><br/>Sure, it's not a masterpiece & there are some parts where it gets a bit predictable, but for the duration of the film I was truly entertained. I laughed out loud and was even moved at the right parts. Sandra Bullock & Ryan Reinolds do deliver, and there was no part of the film where I didn't believe they could fall for each other. This one will surely become one of my ""must see"" films when I'm feeling a little down, since it truly lifted my spirit. I do wish I had given this one a try when it came out on the theatres.<br/><br/>If you like films that make sense and where the plot is flawless, and where you'll probably pay attention to every little detail, then you should really stay away from this one. It's a great film, but if you really abandon yourself to the story"

","THE PROPOSAL as written by Pete Chiarelli and directed by Anne Fletcher looks on the surface (posters, promos. trailer) like yet another version of tough woman manipulates subservient guy in a toss that ends up in a role reversal. And in many ways that is what this film is about: hard-as-rocks but beautiful editor Margaret (Sandra Bullock) verbally abuses her assistant, wannabe author Andrew (Ryan Reynolds), until her employers discover her visa is expired and she is to be deported to her native Canada. A fast thought drives her to claim that she and Andrew are engaged in a ploy to avoid deportation. Shocked at first, Andrew decides to make this ultimate blow to his ego work for him and takes Margaret to his home in Siska, Alaska to meet his family - mother (Mary Steenburgen), father (Craig T. Nelson) and wildly alive grandmother (Betty White) - where Margaret must play the charade. Of course in the beauty of Alaska and under the influence of the warmth of a family Margaret never had, the expected magic happens and ... you know the rest. <br/><br/>Sandra Bullock is good and creates a solid character, but it is Ryan Reynolds who proves his chops as one of the best comedic actors on the screen today. It is a fun outing. Whether or not it deserves the Golden Globe attention mush less Oscar attention is up for question, but it is a pleasant diversion for some very fine comedians. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"sabretoothmovies","6","0","1","5 January 2010"," Romantic Comedy #1537
","I have seen my fair share of romantic comedies, way more than I would like to admit. I have seen so many romantic comedies that I could probably list Meg Ryan's ten last films ... in order. I have definitely seen enough romantic comedies to know the typical format of the genre, considering it never ever changes. Now I know this is true of most genres, but for some reason romantic comedies seem especially bad. I almost wonder if there's a writing-romantic-comedies-for-dummies book out there that all screen writers use that says scene five must be a comedic incident that causes witty banter and scene fourteen must include a deep conversation about love.<br/><br/>Where I am getting with this is that The Proposal is not a bad movie, it's just a typical one. In the film, Ryan Reynolds plays Andrew an Alaskan born twenty-something living in New York City. Against his parents wishes he moved to New York to become a successful publisher, but has spent the last two years as a glorified secretary under the iron thumb of the cold-hearted but successful Margaret (Sandra Bullock, falling way short of Meryl Streep). Margaret however is Canadian and when her green card isn't renewed she risks being deported back to the cold barren waste land ... unless she marries an American citizen. Before you know it Andrew and Margaret are getting married (he get's a promotion for his effort) and they're off to Alaska to meet the parents.<br/><br/>Due to my extensive knowledge in rom-com's I know that the fake-relationship plot line has been used in films such as What Happen's in Vegas, and Failure to Launch (both made in the last three years), so this angle is not new. Neither is the fact that the love interests at the beginning of the film hate each other, or the fact that they end up together at the end (I would've put a spoiler alert in front of that but let's face it we all knew it anyway). Even the scene where Margaret let's the inside-only pet outside was used in Meet the Parents. The jokes are partially recycled and worst of all the new, funny jokes they did have were all given away in the trailer. The movie in short is nothing new.<br/><br/>The good news though is that those of you that like the standard romantic comedies will love The Proposal in the same way fans of Die Hard loved Die Hard 2. This movie has an audience, a specific but dedicated audience. And it's not all bad; Betty White is awesome, and so is the house in Alaska. Some scenes are funny. the acting is good and it's not totally unrealistic (just around the same level as Die Hard ... it could happen).<br/><br/>So in the end I suppose all that really needs to be said about The Proposal is that it's a romantic comedy, and not a totally bad one at that.<br/><br/>Like the review check out more at sabretoothmovies.blogspot.com"

","I saw The Proposal last Saturday with some friends, and all of us were very impressed with the film. Of course the plot is gentle, yet very predictable, and I did feel the writers could have developed Margaret's dominance over Andrew more. Still, it is very well done. One definite plus was the strong performances from Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds, Bullock especially gave one of her better performances in years. The two share a real chemistry and some good comic timing that was really refreshing to see. Out of the supporting cast, who all did very solid work Oscar Nunez deserves mention for his hilarious portrayal as the handyman, it is Betty White a delightful and very underrated actress who steals the show as the matriarch who thinks marriage is preachy. The Proposal is further advantaged by some truly breathtaking Alaskan scenery. It was so beautiful to watch, and perfectly captured by the skillful cinematography. The direction from Anne Fletcher is very nice, and the film is snappily written with some genuinely funny moments. There were some parts in the more slower and subtle parts that I felt tears welling up too. All in all, very well done for a comedy, predictable it is but it is fun too. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

","There seem to be tons and tons of generic romantic comedies out there nowadays. Most of them have the same basic storyline and the 'comedy' is pretty dry. This movie, however, is different. When I read the plot I though to myself 'Here we go again'. However, I was wrong and pleasantly surprised. It has many parts that made me smile, even laugh. The acting, the production, the cinematography, it's all very neat and polished. <br/><br/>But what exactly went wrong with this? Well, with all the unconventional humour found in the movie, I did not expect the movie to succumb to usual romcom clichés and such. But towards to end of the movie, it pretty much became like every other romcom. The movie became very less funny, there was too much emphasis on the romance and the ending is completely predictable to anyone who has even watched a couple of romcoms. I already knew what the ending was going to be when I read the plot but when I saw the movie, I kept hoping that this one would defy the dumb rules of romcoms.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a movie that starts out very promising but ends up very generic. When will movie makers realise that you do not need to stick to stupid rules to make a good movie? If you're a romcom fan, I'd definitely recommend it as it's probably the best I've seen in the genre, alongside 50 First Dates. If you're not a romcom fan, this is worth checking out but only if you have nothing better to do."

Bullock will be deported if she doesn't marry in the next week, so she forces her assistant (Reynolds) to fake a marriage.

","I have no real reason, but I absolutely despise Sandra Bullock. I even despise initial choice of Julia Roberts to play the lead role as well. However, nearly a year ago, I saw a preview for this and I thought it looked wickedly funny. I thought, ""my gosh, this may be the first movie with Sandra Bullock that I want to watch."" Despite my passionate hatred for Bullock, the duo of her and Ryan Reynolds was unreal. Fantastic chemistry and the awkward faces and pauses from Sandra and Ryan nearly put me on the floor with laughter coming out of my gut.<br/><br/>The premise of the film is Margarette (Bullock) is being deported to Canada and unless she can use her assistant Andrew (Reynolds) as an option to keep her in the USA, by marrying him, then Margarette is out of a job and so is Andrew.<br/><br/>I found myself hoping and praying that at the end of the film there would be a happy ending of them magically falling in love. Believe it or not, there is some twists and turns to keep your suspense moist and to keep you on your edge.<br/><br/>The comedy is outrageous, especially for an actress such as Sandra. Ryan's no newbie to comedy scene and once again, he dazzles me with his wit and timing. I couldn't stop laughing at his awkwardness during the scene with Margarette telling her boss they'd be getting married. Likewise, I couldn't stop laughing at Sandra's awkwardness --that occurs for nearly the entire film.<br/><br/>It's a beautiful film that shows a lot of scenic views and has a lot of established cast as the support and secondary roles. I was very surprised at how much I didn't want the film to end and I was even more surprised that I enjoyed a film that had Sandra Bullock as the main attraction. That being said, I do love the film Speed, which stars Sandra, but I like it for other reasons and try to block her out.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who's seen the previews. Even if you didn't think it would be good, give it a try. Any Bullock fans will love this. If you're a fan of both actors, this will be your Heaven."

","As romcoms go, this one is pretty high quality on the performative standard. Bullock and Reynolds are attractive and believable, the dialog is sharp, the story is interesting, the characters are fun to pay attention to, it stays close to familiar territory while being new enough to be interesting and not downright boring. As a date movie goes, this is a better example of the genre and I can definitely see why it made so much over the summer; and with this and Miss Congeniality, Bullock is certainly a new kind of chick flick hero who manages to be very sexy while not being very girly or ridiculous.<br/><br/>On the technical side, not so much. The continuity in this movie is atrocious (literally, a big deal is made about a man frozen in mid-sentence with his glasses in his hands, then cuts to his reaction and the glasses are nowhere to be seen--understandable if the glasses weren't a major part of his reaction), the lighting is very uneven (though the wedding was nice and the Alaskan summer was realistic), and sometimes the blocking itself loses complete track of where the characters are in space. Anne Fletcher obviously spent a long time working with the actors and getting the performances while not concentrating so hard on the blocking and camera movement. I still say it works, since Bullock and Reynolds really hold all of the attention. If there were any problem with the world created at all it would mostly be that the supporting characters and background is not nearly as interesting as the leads."
"alexdbtlr91","7","0","1","12 November 2009"," A Not so Romantic Proposal
","""You can tell she is a good dancer by the way she drinks her soda pop.""-Ramone<br/><br/>The Proposal is filled with awkward, sarcastic humor that had me crying with laughter at points. Although the story line is basically like every other romantic comedy, the actors are what made the difference because of their star status. It is a mix between Meet the Parents and The Devil Wears Prada. Although it may seem like another chick flick because of its title, it has a lot of crude humor and it makes a good date movie that both people can enjoy. It may not be winning any Academy Awards anytime soon, but it is definitely a must see if you have some time to waste.<br/><br/>The movie's premise is somewhat amusing. The scrip begins in New York City where a distressed, handsome assistant named Andrew Paxton, played by Ryan Reynolds, frantically tries to change his outfit before his boss named Margaret Tate, played by Sandra Bullock, sees that he spilled her coffee all over his shirt. As the despised boss walks into the office, everyone predictably switches from happy to serious. After being called into the CEO's office Margaret learns that she is being deported back to Canada. In the midst of the confusion, Andrew innocently walks into the office. Margaret uses this opportunity to announce the surprising news that her and Andrew are actually getting married. Andrew tries to play along because Margaret is his boss, but after realizing how much trouble he could get in if caught, he gives her an ultimatum: either she gives him a promotion to editor and publishes his script and he goes along with the engagement or he resigns and she gets flown back to Canada for a year. Reluctantly she promises to give him a promotion and a book deal. When the two fly up to Alaska for Andrew's Gannie's, played by Betty White, 97th birthday party, Margaret learns that he is not as poor as she thought. While driving though the small town every building has Andrews last name on it, ""Paxton."" When they reach the Paxton household it is anything but an Alaskan cottage. Margaret asks Andrew, ""Why didn't you tell me you were some sort of Alaskan Kennedy?"" Andrew replies with a sharp tone, ""How could I? We were in the middle of talking about you for the last three years.""<br/><br/>As the hilarious events play out during the weekend, Margaret starts to open up. Like in any romantic comedy, Andrew and Margate fall in love as they get to know each other. When Andrew's parents and Gannie ask them to get married that weekend, Margaret can't go through with lying to his wonderful family and she hands herself into immigration authorities. As Andrew is left alone at the alter, the viewer wonders if he is just going to let her go? If you have seen any other romantic comedy you will know the answer to that question. <br/><br/>Although I like this movie, I have some criticism for it. For instance not only is it a typical romantic comedy but it is just like the director's other films. Anne Fletcher, the director, directed the new movie 27 Dresses and was involved in the making of The Devil Wears Prada. They both take place in New York and have the same scene where the assistant is running around getting coffee for his/her boss. When viewing her movies, it seems that she takes random details and adds them to her other films. While it might be her hidden signature, I think she is just unoriginal. The movie also has the same cliché scenes that you see in most comedies, such as the one where an animal is let outside when it is not supposed to be, and the frantic person tries to get it back inside without the owners knowing. And to make it worse when they are in that scene the special effects seem to be from a 1990 film. Some scenes like the one with the dog should just be left out. <br/><br/>Although there are some minor issues with the film the fact that there are such great actors in the movie makes it a memorable one. Although she has mostly done TV shows like The Golden Girls, this is by far Betty White's best role. When being introduced to the infamous Margaret Tate she asks, ""Do you prefer Margaret or Satan's Mistress""? Her sharp one-liners help lift the movie from its straight-to-DVD potential. Not only does Betty White's acting light up the screen, but so does the chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. In the beginning of the film you can feel the couple's awkwardness hover over the audience. As the film goes on, we are able to see the little signs that they actually like each other. For instance when he helps her out of the freezing water back into the boat and gives her new clothes to wear. He would have responded in such a nice manner two days prior. <br/><br/>Since the movie is mainly based in Alaska the scenery is gorgeous. The Paxtons live by the ocean with lush tress surrounding the back of the house. The high pixelation of the camera shows off the wonderful colors of the landscape, like the crisp blue color of the water and dark green grass. The best picture in the movie is when Margaret and Andrew are going to bed. Since the sun does not set during certain seasons in Alaska, the red, orange and yellow of the sun lays on top of the water reflecting into their room. They have to close the blinds to be able to sleep. The quality of filming in the movie makes up for the lack of originality in the script."

","Fletcher's film reminded me of the 1996 movie 'While You Were Sleeping' (which also starred Sandra Bullock). While that was a superior film in comparison, the main similarity is that the lead female is deceiving a family under the pretense of being their son's fiancé. That is not to say that 'The Proposal' is devoid of entertainment. In spite of being a typical romantic comedy it was a lot of fun to watch. The Alaskan setting was refreshing. I also enjoyed the scenes between Bullock and the family. It is Sandra Bullock followed by Ryan Reynolds who make this work. After a long time, Sandra Bullock has returned to comedy and she carries the film with no difficulty. She's still among the funniest actresses out there. Reynolds holds his own. Of the supporting cast, Mary Steenburgen is great and Betty White is adorable while Malin Akerman is wasted. For those who are up for a bit of rom com, 'The Proposal' isn't a bad watch."
"PHallowed","7","0","1","25 October 2009"," Solid romantic comedy
","The Proposal is one of the better stories in the romantic-comedy genre. Margaret Tate, played by Sandra Bullock, is a fearsome autocratic book editor at a publishing firm in New York. Her ""faithful"" assistant Andrew Paxton (played by Ryan Reynolds) follows her every order but trashes the editor behind her back. The story quickly takes a turn towards the hilarious when Canadian citizen Margaret is informed of her visa expiration and imminent deportation, but instead of leaving US of A and potentially losing her job, Margaret decides to marry Ryan to gain legal residency. Ryan agrees to the scam of a ""brief marriage, quick divorce"" because of the enticing promotion she presents to him.<br/><br/>To convince the skeptical immigration officers as well as Andrew's disbelieving family, who by this time have had an earful about Margaret, the two invent dating tales as they go. As befitting their characters, Margaret plows right on, while Andrew at times appear unconvinced and much put-upon. Adding to the fun is Grandma Annie, an outspoken and eccentric character who is into giving thanks to Mother Earth by dancing to the sound of drums.<br/><br/>For me the female main character contributed much to the watch-ability of this film. There is something about a mixture of stubbornness, independence, and also a soft vulnerability (revealed during the Alaska trip) that I like very much. Andrew's character is convincing but gets eclipsed by the more dominant Margaret.<br/><br/>The film has its boring trite moments, for example the bedroom scene where the two have their tête-à-tête. But these are required for plot development and are not dragged out. Even if the ending is predictable, there is plenty of comedy to compensate."

Bullock is great in these kinds of roles, as seen in the Lake House.

"DonFishies","6","0","1","23 October 2009"," A missed opportunity for romantic comedy greatness
","Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is a ruthless editor at a New York publishing house who is loathed by her staff. Her loyal assistant Andrew (Ryan Reynolds) does what he can to please her, but he messages everyone in the office just as much about his hate for Margaret. During a meeting with the bosses, Margaret finds out her Visa has expired and she will be deported back to Canada. On a whim, she concocts a scheme that will allow her to stay in the United States: pretend she is going to get married to Andrew. As customs tries to dissect their fake relationship, the ""couple"" travels to Andrew's parents house in Alaska to celebrate Grandma Annie's (Betty White) birthday, while finding out more about themselves.<br/><br/>On the outset, The Proposal looks like a by-the-numbers romantic comedy unlike any other. The unlikely couple is set up early on, we get introduced very quickly to the strange and sitcomishly quirky family members and friends, and then we watch as the hi-jinx and love ensue. And for the majority of the first half, the film does exactly that. Only the film lets on that it knows how predictable it is and will become, but lets the cast have fun in their roles anyway. I did not laugh a lot, but I would be lying if I did not have a smile on my face watching Bullock and Reynolds act off each other. There is not a lot of chemistry between them, but it works because Reynolds' character is supposed to hate every fibre of Bullock's being. Watching him pull his wiseass sarcastic shtick has still not become tiresome when it is used in the right films (X-Men Origins: Wolverine was not one of those films). And Bullock has always been a reliable rom-com gem, so watching her back in a role she helped perfect was quite amusing.<br/><br/>But then the film takes the necessary turns leading to its conclusion (packing on stranger and stranger moments of ""hilarity"" involving White), and it runs out of gas all too soon. The small amount of laughs left got replaced by weepy melodramatic drama, and a key storyline involving Andrew's relationship with his father Joe (Craig T. Nelson). Its relative ease at knowing what kind of film it is gets replaced by trying to be a film it is not. It takes its quirky set-up, and it turns it into something stale. It feels like someone caught on that the film was playing too fast and loose with romantic comedy conventions, and decided to invigorate it with some ideas it did not need to use. As it beelines headfirst towards its finale, it just becomes a complete bore to watch and lacks any of the zest and enjoyment the proceeding half of the film had. Its predictability becomes a chore for it to fulfil, not a fun obligation.<br/><br/>The downfall of the film is in the fact that the filmmakers realized how much of a by-the-numbers romantic comedy it was, tried to change it up, but left most of the evidence behind. The requisite ex-lover is here in Gertrude (Malin Akerman). It seems to be fine for her to hang around with the family, and she reveals a few secrets about Andrew's past, but the film does nothing with her otherwise. Mr. Gilbertson (Denis O'Hare) is set up to be this dastardly villain of a customs agent, deadest on proving Margaret and Andrew are faking their engagement. But by the time he shows up again after his initial introduction, you have practically forgotten he was introduced at all. Nelson and Mary Steenburgen do a decent job as Andrew's parents, but their relationship now and from before Andrew left Alaska is never really fleshed out. We only get small chunks of what went on, and not enough to piece together this backstory that seems so integral to the film. White and Oscar Nuñez are here specifically to be comic relief, but even their outrageous antics become tiresome as the film goes on.<br/><br/>But the brunt of the blame falls on Bullock and Reynolds. They work so well together for the first half of the film (age gap notwithstanding) that it just becomes downright heartbreaking to see it all fall apart by the end. It almost looks like the performances they were proud of ended up all at the beginning, and all the negative and rehearsal practice footage ended up at the end. You can almost pinpoint where their hearts are in it making this film, and when they just could care less. If they look like they stopped caring what happens, then why should the audience? It is just so disappointing when you go into a film with low expectations, only to have them shattered so well by being so surprised, only to realize too soon that your low expectations were right all along. I had the same experience with I Am Legend, watching a great first half only to fall prey to an absolutely atrocious second half. While The Proposal was never on track for the same off-the-rails disaster Legend quickly became, it still stands as a film that started well and just ended up being a failure.<br/><br/>While there are some hilarious moments littered throughout the film (even when it is at its weakest), The Proposal still acts as a missed opportunity. It has the makings for a typical romantic comedy, but one with an awareness for the genre that does not impede on its ability to be enjoyable. But it betrays that sensibility far too quickly, and ruins any of the fun viewers could have had with it. It is by no means unwatchable, but unfortunately, it is nowhere near as good as it could have been.<br/><br/>6/10.<br/><br/>(Portions of this review originally appeared on http://www.dvdfanatic.com)."

Before I saw this movie I thought it was going to be a romantic chick flick with a little humor, but there is a lot of humorous parts in this movie. I recommend this movie to any person who needs a good laugh.<br/><br/>A big time New York book editor, Margaret Tate, is told she is being deported back to her native land of Canada. She quickly thinks of a plan to marry her assistant, Andrew Paxton, so she can keep her status in the United States. Margaret quickly finds out that there is something missing in her life that she found in Andrew's. Andrew takes Margaret to Sitka, Alaska to go to this grandma's 90th birthday and she meets his family. Andrew still has relationship problems with his father and an old high school sweetheart comes back to his life. Towards the end of the movie Andrew and Margaret almost get married, but Margaret tells his family the truth about the scam. She then goes back to New York to pack her belongings and Andrew shows up telling her how he really feels about her. In the end, they finally get married and for the right reason.<br/><br/>I watched this movie with a few friends and they were laughing the entire time. I believe that this movie does meet viewers' expectations because with Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds the movie is hilarious but romantic at the same time. ""The Proposal"" is a little unrealistic because of the scenery with the big house and the small town, but when you need to get away from reality and relax a little just watch this movie."

","Ryan Reynolds has always been a favorite comedic actor of mine and Sandra Bullock has always been good in her comedies. These two really work well together. This a great comedy for both genders. Most of the story takes place in Alaska which provides some pretty visuals.There are also some touching moments in this movie too, it got a little dusty in the room towards the end of the movie. Oscar Nunez's cameo in the film was funny and weird!It was also great to see Craig T.

","Publishing powerhouse Margaret Tate is used to getting her way. She bullies her ambitious assistant, Andrew Paxton. But Margaret, a native Canadian, finds her career in jeopardy when she is denied a visa and learns she will be sent northward. She forces Andrew to become her fiancé, but she'll have to take a trip home to Alaska with him to prove to U.S. Immigration that their impending union is genuine.<br/><br/>Every once in awhile, you must be willing to forgive a romantic comedy of its clichéd-filled plot because it's executed so well. THE PROPOSAL is one of those movies. Yes, mostly everything is done strictly by the numbers and yes, we can see the ending coming even before the movie begins but you feel so happy and warm and fuzzy inside that you want the conventional to happen.<br/><br/>Most of this is because of the two leads: Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Both have such a great chemistry together and their scenes filled with head-on sarcasm hit the right funny spots! They elevate the movie to a higher level. Other supporting cast members include Betty White, Craig T. Nelson, and Mary Steenburgen, who all have their moments in the film.<br/><br/>However, with all this delightful things going on, there were some problems in the film. One main one is that it has some kind of bipolar disorder. For example, one scene starts off sad and tragic and one second later, it's a sitcom. It's like the movie didn't know which route to go to. This happens frequently especially in the last half hour of the film.<br/><br/>But other than that, the film is light and fluffy. It plays it safe and sticks to the conventions but you wouldn't mind because of the two terrific leads, whom make it better than most romantic comedies. There are also some standout scenes including one where both Bullock and Reynolds talk about themselves in a bedroom at night, which is truly heartfelt. Hey, I guess I'm sentimental, but you know what? I enjoyed the movie."

","Canadian Margaret Tate (Bullock)is a hated boss, but her Visa is expiring and she proposes to marry her assistant Andrew (Reynolds) to be able to stay in the United States. <br/><br/>This had huge comedic possibilities but the script wasn't up to the effort. If the promos hadn't shown the Betty White scene 10,000 times where her character is fitting Margaret with her old wedding gown it could have had, at the very least, one LOL moment. Didn't happen. The script was bland and okay for a made-for-TV movie. <br/><br/>And, really. in a movie like this where the main characters who don't like each other, end up liking each other (Oh, you didn't know that would happen? HA!) someone should try to match actors that have a good chemistry so we could all feel good at the end. Didn't happen. I didn't care if the pairing, proposal, or ""marriage"" would work. Did anyone? Also, I think the ending should have gone another way. Would have made more sense. No, I can't tell you what the ending is and what I wanted. <br/><br/>Needless, useless and not funny scenes: every one with Ms Bullock and the dog, and the male stripper scene in the bar. <br/><br/>I want to say the acting overall was good, and it was, but there were some over-acting moments with Bullock and the dog and I couldn't wait for them to be over with. Do people actually watch the scenes before it goes out to the public? Hmmmm.<br/><br/>Yes, Ryan Reynolds looks like Ben Affleck. I thought it was Affleck and had to check the DVD box. They look the same, act the same, and have basically the same expressions. Think I'll check the box again. <br/><br/>Betty White is a treasure no matter how many times a scene with her is shown. Other treasures are Nelson and Steenburgen and they did good as did the rest of the cast. I thought we would at least see a family dinner along the way. Didn't happen. The breakfast-in-bed thing doesn't count.<br/><br/>Overall, an okay movie that has been hyped to death. I get the feeling that Ms Bullock wants to push the envelope with her partial nude scenes. Suggestion to her: Do it with a better script.<br/><br/>Violence: No Sex: No. Nudity: Partial by both Bullock and Reynolds Language: No."

Some good performances (especially Sandra Bullock and Betty White) and scenery help make the 108 mins. of run time go by painlessly. Looks like a few moments were left on the ""cutting room floor"" as there seems to be some elements and time frame out of sync. Actor Denis O'Hare who plays the immigration officer has a silly role and he overplays it terribly. Not a good actor at all. Spoils the few scenes he's in.

","This romantic comedy does what it sets out to do and I am sure that those movie fans who like this genre will enjoy the experience of seeing The Proposal.<br/><br/>It's a very effective vehicle for Sandra Bullock to display her quirky comedy talent, and she does very well (her best movie in quite a while I think). Her co-star Ryan Reynolds adds good support and the pair dominate the screen as you would expect. But viewers won't tire of seeing the duo in action I suspect. The dialog and story move along with pace and there are plenty of opportunities for laughs and chuckles.<br/><br/>As you might expect, this is no complex twisting plot, but rather a gentle ride through a nice story of how events can shape relationships, both for good and for bad, further complicated or helped by families.<br/><br/>A very watchable movie that neither grates nor annoys (but neither does it leave much in the memory, I must add).<br/><br/>My only critical comment would be that I wish the director had worked much harder to make us believe in the strength of the relationship during its transition for one end of the emotional spectrum to the other. Admitedly the plot requires the actors to act hatred and the characters to fake affection, then feel love, but I didn't feel the intensity of either end of the process."

Quirky characters and a really bizarre scene in the forest (a scene that might leave some viewers completely baffled) add to the special flavour. Although the latter mentioned scene could almost have been a big downfall of the movie, Sandra somehow pulls it off (not completely, but enough for the movie to still work).<br/><br/>If you're not bothered by the whole premise of the movie, than you might enjoy it.

But this time she is a business woman who seems not to have a lot of fun in her life. I wonder if this role was supposed for Jennifer Aniston. In the great tradition of Screwball Comedies we see Ryan Reynolds as her male opponent. He is her employee. The only chance not to loose his job he loves so much is to play her fiancé. It sounds terrible for a good relation but good for a romantic comedy with some touching moments. The supporting cast with Betty White, Craig T. Nelson, Mary Steenburgen, and Oscar Nunez are all pretty good and enjoying their roles. Don't know why but I got the feeling everybody was very relaxed in this production. Maybe cause of the beautiful locations the movie was photographed. Of course it's a solid comedy not untypical other similar movies but it had certain touching moments and it's good to see the sympathetic Sandra Bullock on screen again.<br/><br/>The story was good enough to keep my attention but I thought it could have been a little more adult.

","Sandra Bullock plays Margaret Tate, a high-maintenance dragon lady of a boss at a prestigious New York City book publishing firm, and Ryan Reynolds of ""Wolverine"" is her assistant, Andrew Paxton, who struggles to keep up with her outlandish demands. During its first quarter hour, ""The Proposal"" looks like a spin on ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" but with a guy enduring all of the chaos the evil woman can inflict on him rather than a woman. Instead, ""27 Dresses"" director Anne Fletcher, who helmed ""The Proposal,"" has really made an opposites-attract romantic chick flick where the tables whirl on the icy, businees only minded Bullock. <br/><br/>The chief complication in the newcomer Peter Chiarelli's screenplay is that Bullock's character is about to be booted out of the country by Immigration officials because she is a Canadian without U.S. citizenship. As a marriage of convenience, she springs the proposition onto her assistant, and he creates a laundry list of demands that she has no option but to accept. They fly off to Alaska to meet his parents. Betty White steals the show as the grandmother. Craig T. Nelson is cast as his dad, and Mary Steenburgen plays the mom. Reynolds has lots of issues with his father who believes that he is wasting his time in the publishing industry. Lots of funny scenes and some tearjerker scene.

","PLOT: Successful B!tch is about to be deported and needs to marry her long suffering and easygoing assistant to stay in the country. They are stalked by an immigration officer and head up to Alaska to meet the grooms reasonably quirky family. Unlike frosty Alaska the Successful B!tches heart begins to melt. They fall in love. They fall out. They re- fall in love. They get engaged for real. END PLOT<br/><br/>If you have read this and are thinking - ""Hey! You have totally spoiled the movie for me"" then where the hell have you been living since the dawn of time? All romantic comedies must follow the same beats. It's the law, it's probably in the American Constitution somewhere so as with most rom-coms The Proposal doesn't rely on the story for originality or shocks but rather on the performance of the leads and supporting cast, as we already know before the teaser trailer has ended that they will in fact, live happily ever after.<br/><br/>Nowhere in cinematic history has the two leads in a movie been as preened, polished, groomed, styled and perfected as Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. They are barely human. They exist solely to be beautiful. Even if they are covered in mud or almost drowned in the Alaskan sea they still pull of dowdy in the most preened, polished, groomed, styled and perfected way.<br/><br/>Bullock and Reynolds have the advantage of being naturally charismatic and both can to comedy competently up to standard rom-com expectations. If the movie had starred Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey then you know you would be in for a tough ninety minutes.<br/><br/>The problem is Bullocks character, when in New York and in b!tch mode never really seemed that threatening. Is it possible for Bullock to be unlikeable? She lacked that extra bit of bitterness and sharpness that someone like Meryl Streep could easily just phone-in to her performance. This meant that the inevitable softening of her character Margaret didn't really pull any emotional punches as she didn't come off as particularly mean or distant in the first place. I am not heartless though, when Betty White (a name I probably should recognise but I honestly don't!) gave her a necklace which is a longstanding family heirloom it was quite sweet to watch her realise that she was an accepted member of the Paxton family.<br/><br/>Reynolds was just Reynolds, walking around with two out of his small selection of looks. This movie we were treated to ""confused"" and ""smart ass"". You can tell them apart by how far he opens his mouth and widens his eyes. <br/><br/>As with all rom-coms there is that one character who is there for the purpose of obtaining cheap laughs. He is usually a male most likely to be effeminate in nature or an in-your-face-homosexual, as, we all know - gay people are hilarious (apart from Will and Grace). The Proposal went the other way with Oscar Nunez' who stars (so I have read) in the American version of The Office playing the roles of the town stripper, shop assistant and vicar. The audience seemed to really enjoy his strip routine and were in hysterics when he popped up out of the blue to marry Margaret and Andrew (Reynolds) but me - not so much.<br/><br/>Apart from Bullock and Reynolds there is nothing more beautiful than rom-com New York. It is as preened, polished, groomed, styled and perfected as can be. It does look gorgeous but it was totally upstaged by Alaska. It turns out Alaska isn't all husky dogs, igloos and Sarah Palin (pitiful attempt at political humour) as the location was gorgeous and to be honest I would take small town Sitka over uptown New York any day of the week<br/><br/>I think that the only flaw in The Proposal is that I was there to see it. The audience in the packed out screen two were thoroughly enjoying themselves, laughing out aloud at the tiniest little thing whereas the most I could muster up was a smile at Gammys fake heart attack. I didn't sit there stone faced the whole time and I did enjoy the movie for the time filling ninety minutes that it was but I don't think I laughed once as I found nothing particularly funny in the entire movie.<br/><br/>The Proposal could be compared to an old repeat of Friends - you watch it for easygoing familiarity and comfort and not for high class and witty humour. <br/><br/>I would give it a generously watchable 6/10; you know going into the movie that you wont be watching anything remotely original but the charisma of Bullock and Reynolds give it an extra few points."

","I thought this was an enjoyable romantic comedy. It did what many movies don't do, which is to allow you to empathize with all the characters and actually care about them. One thing I noticed is that the ages of the characters was a little hazy. Ryan Renolds is 33 and seemed to be playing Andrew at about that age, maybe a little younger. That would make Mary Steenburgen believable as his mother at 56 and Craig T. Nelson as his father at 65. That would also make Betty White (87) believable as Nelson's mother who is supposed to be 90. But how old is Sandra Bullock's Margaret supposed to be? She is 45 in real life, only 11 years younger than Steenburgen. But did she see her first concert at age 24 when Rob Base released ""It takes two"" in 1988? Seems like she is trying to play 5 to 10 years younger than her actual age. I guess she can pull it off OK. The other thing that jumped out at me is that when they announced their engagement, nobody asked to see the ring, and nobody noticed she had no ring. Also, they made it seem like Toronto is this far away foreign land. It would have been much easier for her to return to Toronto, and then for him to drive 10 hours up to marry her there and get the papers for her to return at the U.S. consulate. But I guess you can't overthink these things."

","OK so, the rule is as followed. As a dude I'm entitled to enjoy one romantic comedy a year, any more than that and I may as well have grown a vagina. The trailer for ""Bride Wars"" made me distinctively uncomfortable. I couldn't make it through the first 30 minutes of ""Confessions of a shopaholic"" so it comes as no surprise that this proposal didn't interest me. Why did I go? To state a few reasons, its starring Ryan Reynolds, aka the greatest guy that ever lived. He was the one spot of blue in the big sea of red that was ""Wolverine"" and his presence alone made me excited to see the proposal. The verdict? This is one of the better romantic comedies you'll be likely to see this year, granted its made especially for women, this won't send men into a nauseating coma but It may just make that special someone go week at the knees. If the movie doesn't do it, Reynolds is sure to.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock stars in the romantic comedy The Proposal, as a Canadian immigrant who creates a demanding and difficult work environment for her subordinates at the office. When the news arrives that she's about to be deported to the Great White North, she rushes into a marriage of convenience with her young assistant (played by Ryan Reynolds) to prevent such a catastrophe from occurring. 27 Dresses' Anne Fletcher directs from a script by Peter Chiarelli for Touchstone Pictures. The story isn't anything groundbreaking. To put it simply its tediously formulaic and, as is the trend for romantic comedies, ""The Proposal"" doesn't aim for new heights. Instead of going for gold it plays it safe making for a satisfying if unoriginal coupling. The story hits every point you expect, it has the rise, the fall, the rise then once again, the fall and, not to ruin the ending but typically our heroes rise once more. It's been here seen that all before material but it does a decent job of getting from point A to point B.<br/><br/>What works for the film particularly well is casting director Amanda Mackey Johnson knew what she was doing. The film is wonderfully cast with each actor giving it everything they could. We've come to expect exceptional performances from screen veterans like Reynolds, Bullock and Steenburgen but the real pleasure comes from Golden Girl Betty White was makes for a hysterical treat as she goes from the bizarre to the downright dangerous. Bullock is better here than she's been in some time. That's not to say she is going to be nominated for any awards but she gets the job done with grace and dexterity, and for a woman of her age to have the guts to do a nude scene, you have got to give her props. What's odd is my distain for this director (Anne Fletcher) previous two movies. Step Up and 27 Dresses were two films I couldn't get through, possibly because I'm the wrong crowd but here she brings her A game and directors each moment with grace and a certain style that I haven't seen in a Romantic comedy in quite some time. <br/><br/>Whoever decided to cast Sandra and Ryan in this together is a genius. Their chemistry is so natural and they look so good together that it is one of the main reasons that this film works. You won't laugh out loud too often. And in fact some of the scenes are plain embarrassing (especially those involving Oscar Nunez's waiter/exotic dancer/minister character) but it is all rather engaging fun. Plus there is a very funny nude scene that Bullock and Reynolds have to share that goes to show that both are in good nick physically (remember she has 12 years on her younger co-star)and are game for a laugh. <br/><br/>Verdict: The Proposal is not a marriage made in heaven by any means, but the eventual charm of the leads and a gag-packed second half manage to salvage the movie from inauspicious beginnings. Ultimately, there is something refreshing about The Proposal's undemanding humour and unabashed feel-good factor. A pedigree cast, fun premise and punchy dialogue make Bullock's return to romantic comedy look a great catch, and Reynolds is sharper than a diamond solitaire. For my overall rating I give the proposal 3/5."

So it's not the most intelligent or impressive of films but it does what it sets out to and is laugh-out-loud funny in places.

Sandra Bullock is another under-rated actress who appears here in quite a different role than she's played in the past. Bullock pulls off the ""Satan's Mistress,"" as Betty White puts it early on pretty darn well. I will say that the first scenes in the movie seemed torn right out of The Devil Wears Prada. While I think Bullock in general did a good job of being pretty mean, she definitely did not come across anywhere near as scary as Meryl Streep at the beginning of The Devil Wears Prada. The movie runs at a decent pace, although the ending is a bit rushed in my opinion, and comes in at a typically good time for a romantic comedy (just over 100 minutes). The cast, I think, is really what made the movie an ""8"" for me and not a 6 -- everyone is SPOT-ON....Betty White as Gammi, the matriarchal grandmother who has Inuit Eskimo background and does a great dance thanking ""Mother Earth."" Mary Steenburgen turned in a fine performance as Drew's (Reynolds) mother -- she misses her son and blames his over-bearing father (Craig T. Nelson) who has set up a pretty substantial financial empire in Sitka (he basically owns the town). Nelson played the part well as usual. Reynolds and Bullock turned in great performances and had great on-screen chemistry.<br/><br/>My only disappointment was that the movie was not filmed in Alaska and was instead filmed on Boston's north shore.

"pyrocitor","6","0","3","24 July 2009"," Despite a formulaic template, unexpectedly sweet, insightful and witty in spite of itself
","A romantic comedy with situational comedy revolving around two mismatched individuals, a looming wedding and an extended family full of quirky characters - with such an astoundingly familiar premise, one could hardly be chastised for feeling apprehensive about The Proposal, or for dismissing it as yet another of a slew of formulaic, forgettable romantic comedies. However, despite well warranted skepticism, the film's main trick card is that, in spite of it all, it is actually a worthwhile watch. Despite its formulaic structure, The Proposal boasts a welcome wit, traces of honest emotion and even a dash of profundity, assuring that while it may not be the innovative cinematic masterpiece of the decade, it at least makes for a pleasantly surprising and thoroughly enjoyable viewing experience. <br/><br/>Director Anne Fletcher demonstrates her genre experience by showing enough sense to, rather than caving to its inherent story clichés, hit them over the head with as much spunky exuberance as possible, making the narrative, however predictable, substantially more difficult not to derive at the very least small glimmers of enjoyment from. But what comes as the most surprising are the surprising vestiges of life in Peter Chiarelli's screenplay, with not only a welcomely barbed wit and some genuinely unpredictable laughs worming through the formulaic situational comedy, but surprisingly credible bits of interpersonal interaction. Life stories, personal quirks and inner demons shared by the characters feel a cut above the usual formulaic dredge offered in such circumstances, making the individuals emerging all the more easy to warm to. Fletcher amplifies the realism aspect with fleeting moments of uncommonly artistic technical work, frequently using high angle shots to accentuate closeted emotions and feelings of inferiority, demonstrating far more thought being put into the project than the sort of by the numbers mess it might easily have been.<br/><br/>Fletcher even manages to work some unorthodox traces of profundity into her work, as the initially cute toying with gender roles (Bullock as the icy workaholic boss, Reynolds as her neurotic assistant) turns into more of an outright exploration of the male/female binary, of the arenas in which women commonly gain power over men, and the ethical and social consequences of the inherent imbalances and struggles. Carefully dodging caving to traditional patriarchy or outright feminist preaching, Fletcher manipulates her cast of alternatively credible or cartoonish characters sufficiently to point out the flaws in either extreme, while making the eventual leveling of power dynamics between Reynolds and Bullock laudably palatable. As such, in spite of all this, it is a substantial shame to see the entire work drift inevitably into maudlin, syrupy cliché by the end, as the sharp and snappy picture leading up to the teary climax proves a far more self-aware and intriguing animal, making the eventual descent into overt formula feel somewhat of a letdown. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, there can be no question that the real strength of the film lies in the performances of its two leads, and the prickly chemistry between them. Sandra Bullock finally peeks out from autopilot, delivering a performance which, no matter how familiar, admirably succeeds in capturing the essence of a conflicted human being, and managing to be both contemptuous, sympathetic and endearingly goofy all the while. Ryan Reynolds, meanwhile, puts his triumphant mastery of comedic timing and dry sarcasm to perfect use, while also demonstrating a scarcely glimpsed potential for bringing credible life to genuine human emotions, purloining many of the film's best lines and scenes while never unreasonably taking command of his scenes. The supporting cast is hardly as remarkable, but most do perfectly suitably jobs, with Craig T. Nelson a sturdy presence as Reynolds' gruff, domineering father and Betty White managing to for the most part evoke laughs out of a worn out 'comic relief grandmother' figure, despite coming across as simply irritating more than one would care for. Malin Ackerman is given next to nothing to do as Reynolds' ex- flame, but Oscar Nunez is a welcome scene stealer as an unorthodox male stripper, bringing in many of the film's more raucous laughs. <br/><br/>Despite its eventual caving to cliché and patches of false or unbelievable emotional exchanges, The Proposal manages to accomplish its purpose of being charming and enjoyable with enthusiasm to spare, while managing to work in some unexpected laughs, endearingly sweet patches and even emerging as a mite profound and genuine in spite of itself. While there is still a frustrating sense of the far superior picture which might have been, the film remains worth a watch, if only for the pleasantly surprising moments of quality which pop up welcomely in the midst of its more familiar trappings. <br/><br/>-6/10"

","It was just another weekend. My friends and I decided to go out and see a movie. At the time there weren't many movies we could choose from other than ""Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen"" and we had already seen it. So in the end we decided on this movie. I having never even heard of the movie, and thinking that it would be just another sad movie or just a plain movie..but i was soon severely mistaken. From the first 5 minutes of the movie, I was rolling around in laughter. The movie was extremely hilarious. there wasn't a period of time longer than 5 minutes that wasn't full of laughs. I would recommend this movie for anybody. It is full of laughs, love and brilliance. I love this movie and I am definitely going to buy it once it comes out in DVD."

I think was because he was the comic re-leaf and popped up, every time the film was slowing slightly.

"neil-476","8","0","3","22 July 2009"," Enjoyable romcom
","The bare bones of this romcom are fairly familiar, albeit with a role reversal element. Sandra Bullock is Margaret, a hard-as-nails editor who makes the life of her personal assistant Andrew (Ryan Reynolds) a misery. When she is faced with deportation back to Canada she blackmails him into marrying her. During the long weekend at his family home in Alaska the ice maiden gradually thaws and the inevitable happens.<br/><br/>But for a movie which runs along such well-oiled and predetermined tracks, The Proposal is very entertaining. Bullock is very convincing as the boss from hell, and her gradual change is believable. Reynolds is sympathetic and funny and knocks out some decent acting. Mary Steenburgen and Craig T Nelson give good support as Andrew's differently motivated parents, and Betty White has a ball as nonagenarian grandmother Anna.<br/><br/>The script is bright and breezy with some very funny moments, decent motivations for the characters, and sufficient sentiment without being schmaltzy.<br/><br/>I liked this movie a lot."

","Sandra Bullock has excellent a charisma one, it made that it to reach the success with romantic comedies that always get for the light diversion of the spectator. In recent years, however, the actress only seemed to make mistakes, since "" Two Weeks Notice"" (2002) until the failure of "" Miss Congeniality 2"" (2005).<br/><br/>But with "" The Proposal"" , Bullock comes back the good form that the public one in such a way knows of its better successes of years 90. By the way, this film is the best since "" Miss Congeniality"" (2000). The tram is cute, obtains to amuse in almost all the duration, beyond not appealing a mood rude. It is truth that possess innumerable clichés, but all are worked in favor of the film.<br/><br/>Perhaps the only problem of the film is the proper personage Margaret Tate, therefore at the beginning of the tram, it seems a species of Miranda Priestly and later it comes back to be the typical personage of Sandra Bullock. This could have been worked in another way for the script, but nothing that the final result compromises in such a way.<br/><br/>The question is that it is very good for seeing that the Sandra Bullock is in return with its comedy and that it still obtains to entertain the public. I hope that the actress comes back the same with other productions in style and by the way, the success in the box offices is very deserved. In these times of turkeys like "" Transformers 2"" , "" The Proposal"" it is a good alternative to have fun."
"Rafacus","7","0","3","14 July 2009"," Taming of The Shrew with a Green Card twist.
","A modern-day ""Taming of The Shrew"" with a Green Card twist. Reynolds was himself, Bullock was sexy and Betty White stole the show.<br/><br/>Without pretense of being something other than a predictable romance comedy, The Proposal did not surprise, disappoint or lend itself to any other emotions outside of my cringing at the ""awwwwws"" that the female audience members would coo whenever people kissed, spooned or proposed on screen. Not being the biggest fan of this genre of movies, I went into it with little expectations outside of seeing the hotness that is Sandra Bullock, only to leave feeling rather unimpressed.<br/><br/>I found Sandra Bullock's portrayal of the Icey Margaret to be pretty good, being that I began to hate her, I would say she did a helluva job. Margaret, is a head case, never have I seen a woman this cold on film since Tilda Swinton's portrayal of The White Witch in the Chronicles of Narnia. She is also a peculiar woman, going from office ice queen to singing Rob Base's ""It Takes Two"" and shaking her ass to the Ying Yang Twins I couldn't make this up if I wanted to. I was not sure what to think of Margaret outside of her physical goodness, the character was not likable even after her taming was done.Ryan Reynolds was harmless, and his character was written to be more of a prop than a person. Although his wit and timing are always solid, I can barely remember any of his lines outside of him looking confused and dazed the entire time. The parents are typical but Grandma Annie (Betty White) is who owns this movie. Claiming Native American blood, she does fire dances (yes I know), loves lap dances and is very candid with her opinions. She is pretty much that strange, quirky senior that some of us have experienced in our lifetimes.<br/><br/>The formula as I've said is standard RomCom fluff. There is an attempt of a side story dealing with the tensions of Andrew's super successful father Joe Paxton (Craig T. Nelson) and his son but it felt so uninspired and pointless that I wished they had just left it out. This is definitely not something to run out and tell your friends to see. I would take it as a nice, edible RomCom that guys can watch with their ladies without the need for coffee to keep them awake. Would I recommend seeing this in the theater? Probably not, but it isn't exactly bad either, just a strangely mediocre movie that cannot figure out what it is, or what it is trying to do.<br/><br/>Review taken from www.SpicyMovieDogs.com"

","Marriage is hot. Last years, it's all about marriage-movies. Made of honor, 27 dresses, the hangover and now the proposal (I left out a few). The proposal is not bad. It's predictable though. At first it's all just fake, then they fall in love, she runs off, he comes after her, and they live happily ever after. There are some mistakes in the movie as well, quite noticeable. For example, when the two tell the story of the proposal, they say they were just about to celebrate their first year together. But later they say he asked her when they were approximately 6 months together. No, it's certainly no high quality. But it is very feel-good and the jokes are quite funny. Also, there are some parts in the movie, that basically every couple will recognise. That adds up to the fun. Conclusion: yeah, it's OK, yet not even close to a really good movie."
"puffball97","6","0","4","30 June 2009"," This Summer's First Romantic Comedy
","Everything in this movie may look clichéd, and you may have seen much of the same material from so many other contemporary romantic comedies – girl and boy meet, girl and boy clash, girl and boy get together under unexpected circumstances, girl and boy fly to town to meet boy's parents, girl and boy are about to get married, girl and boy have a fight and break up, girl and boy fly out of town separately only to coincidentally find each other back home and fall back in love again. But a winsome cast holds everything together and sustains many honest laughs to keep ""The Proposal"" from being another formulaic romantic comedy and date movie.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock has been the heroine of so many romance films since 1995's ""While You Were Sleeping,"" but here in ""The Proposal,"" she gets to play a ruthless corporate witch. She plays Margaret, the tough book editor of a prestigious publishing firm in Manhattan, bullying everybody, including her assistant Andrew, played by Ryan Reynolds, who has also established himself as a romantic leading man in many of his recent movies. Somehow, they are smitten by each other deep down. They discover that when an immigration visa inspector (played by Denis O'Hare) declares that Margaret's Canadian visa has expired and she has not renewed it, and now he wants her to leave the country. Margaret and Andrew come up with a ruse saying that they are engaged to be married, but they don't go back to Canada. He whisks her off to Alaska.<br/><br/>The Alaska scenery is actually shot in the daylights of Boston and Rhode Island. Here, Andrew introduces Margaret to his parents (nicely played by Craig T. Nelson and Mary Steenburgen) and his spry ""Grammie"" about to turn 90 (the always reliable Betty White, 87 years young). The women immediately take a liking to Margaret and accept her as part of the family. However, the father is more cantankerous and doesn't want to see his son fly away millions of miles from home with his bride-to-be, but he warms up to his son and prospective daughter-in-law near the end of the film.<br/><br/>There are a lot of laughs that keep the audience rolling, and intermittently, there are scenes played with heart for good balance. No, this is not going to make movie history or win any Academy Awards, but it is a light outing for anyone who wants to fall in love, have a good laugh, or even wants their hearts touched. ""The Proposal"" is an enjoyable summer romance."
"socrates99","8","0","3","29 June 2009"," As a guy expected to cringe more than I did -- thankfully
","I find Sandra Bullock funny and easy to watch. Without her, I wouldn't have accompanied my wife to this movie. But it turns out, Ryan Reynolds more than holds up his end of the bargain, and that was a huge relief because I was certain they were going to put in some female heartthrob making it almost impossible for a guy to enjoy watching Ms Bullock get out of her predicament. (She needs to fend off Immigration so she isn't deported to Canada. I can't believe this happens much in real life, btw.) But Ryan matches her all down the line comedy-wise and there's something extraordinary about that. This guy's quite good. In fact all the secondary players are quite good as well. This is a message film and the message is, family matters even more than a high-powered job in New York. It's not a perfect film, there are a few rough spots and some laughter dry spots, but in general, it's a pleasant time at the movies with some very capable actors and a workable script."
"rmay17","7","0","2","29 June 2009"," Prepare to be entertained...
","Somewhere between the outlandish behavior of John Belushi and his accomplices in Animal House, and the suave, sophisticated humor of the characters portrayed by Cary Grant and Grace Kelly in To Catch A Thief, lies the comedy of The Proposal. Does the movie require a suspension of belief? Absolutely! And most of the plot and sub-plots are predictable. But don't most vehicles of pure entertainment engage in some degree of literary license? Sandra Bullock is her usual delightful self although her character strives to be one merciless and hated female boss. Ryan Reynolds, her less well known co-star is cast perfectly as her personal indentured servant and soon-to-be lover. Their screen scenes together leave one aching with the desire to see more of them... and by the same token, there are some other scenes that should have been left out. The supporting cast of Craig T. Nelson, Mary Steenburgen, and Betty White are often misused and at times, miscast, but they all do what they are supposed to do... support the story and make the stars shine brighter. Overall, the whole story is a bit improbable and a tad too reminiscent of the film Green Card, but still highly entertaining."
"jaredmobarak","7","0","3","27 June 2009"," The witch is on her broom  The Proposal
","It is safe to say, my man-crush on Ryan Reynolds has remained intact after watching his new film The Proposal. It could have gotten ugly being a vehicle for Sandra Bullock, (Reynolds is in fact the ""romantic interest""), directed by Anne Fletcher, the woman behind the occasionally entertaining 27 Dresses. Would I have enjoyed myself as much as I did if Reynolds—a Canadian playing an American, opposite an American playing a Canadian—was not there? Probably not. That is what his sarcastic humor does for the romantic comedy, it makes it worth the time; he seriously makes this movie. But I don't want to disregard everything in the film, because I actually thought Bullock was good as the tough as nails, cutthroat boss. In fact, for an actress I don't generally enjoy, the last two I've seen including her have been surprisingly good. Yes, I enjoyed The Lake House.<br/><br/>Peter Chiarelli's script is by no means original at all. Besides making it the woman that needs a sham marriage to stay in the country instead of the man, what we have here is a premise devoid of creativity. However, all these films contain that crutch; it's nothing new. One doesn't go to a date movie like this for intelligent storytelling, it's about being entertained for a couple hours, watching the antics of love do their worst on screen. And, frankly, The Proposal does exactly that. I laughed a lot during the course of this Alaskan adventure, knowing the outcome, but genuinely interested to see the path that would lead to it. This high-powered book-publishing editor-in-chief is at risk of losing her job for a whole year if she is deported to Canada. None of her employees would be crushed from this fact, as they are completely scared of her, computer messaging each other warnings when she is moving around the office.<br/><br/>While they all would probably be better off emotionally, alleviated of a lot of stress, it is her assistant that would lose the most if she were sent away. Being her right-hand man, despite loathing her as well, he'd be the first to be fired in order to rid the office of anything Margaret Tate. Therefore, when confronted with the proposal of marriage, he decides to risk jail in order to blackmail his ""bride-to-be"" into giving him a promotion to editor and the respect he knows he deserves and thinks she does as well. The reason this film is as funny as it is? Mainly because Reynolds' Andrew Paxton eventually realizes he has the upper hand, his fake doting charm is washed away and the biting, cruel longing for payback comes to the surface as it is his turn to make Margaret's life a living hell. Satan's mistress no longer holds the control in their relationship, as he is the only chance she has of keeping her job.<br/><br/>So, it becomes a test of each person's mettle. He has to lie to his parents and Gammy, (it's her 90th birthday), about being in love with the woman he abhors most in this world, and she must pretend to not be the cold, frigid, soulless person she is. The course of events in the small Alaskan town—virtually owned by the Paxton's—becomes the true driving force of the film. The actual wedding and immigration fraud is in fact only a premise to splice together numerous comedic skits and opportunity for both Reynolds and Bullock to verbally spar. The quick wit is fun, especially in moments like the telling of how Andrew proposed. It is an ad-libbed discourse told by the back and forth of both New Yorkers, doing their best to make the other seem weak and powerless.<br/><br/>Besides the scene stealing performance from Reynolds, (don't get me wrong, he won't be nominated for any Oscars here, but he does what he is supposed to and makes this thing worth watching), and the solid job from Bullock, you can't leave this film without a smile forming when thinking back to both Betty White and Oscar Nuñez. These two are hysterical. White is great as Gammy, never afraid to speak her mind or make the guest uncomfortable. Without shame, she is at her best opposite Bullock, definitely having a fun time with the role. She is also a main catalyst in the second of two ""musical numbers,"" getting her soon-to-be granddaughter to chant and dance around an indigenous fire ceremony. That chanting becomes a wonderful rendition of ""Get Low"" by Lil Jon. But you can't forget the brilliant falsetto from Reynolds doing Rob Base & DJ E-Z Rock's ""It Takes Two"". The scene begs you to recall 27 Dresses' best scene of ""Benny and the Jets"". Fletcher seems to like her sing-a-longs.<br/><br/>And, of course, there's Nuñez. His first appearance made me laugh due to his comical Spanish accent. Seeing him as the straight man, (no joke intended), opposite the crazies in ""The Office,"" gives you a certain typecast idea of what he'll be doing. Throw all those preconceptions out the window, though, because he is definitely not Oscar from television. No, he is Sitka's resident butler, country store manager, and exotic dancer amongst other occupations. The Spanish lisp gets funnier as the film goes on and his antics more absurd. It is supporting roles like his that prove the effectiveness of the film, making it more about the audience laughing and less about what may happen to Reynolds and Bullock. Sit back and enjoy a good time, because The Proposal has the potential of being a lasting hit at the box office, especially as reverse programming to summer blockbusters like Transformers 2. So girls, if your man drags you to see robotic carnage, don't feel bad returning the favor with this little gem. He may actually enjoy it, although he'll never tell you so."

","OK, first of all I love Sandra Bullock even knowing that most of her movies are not so interesting enough. Her charisma is always the top thing about her and her comedy felling always flows naturally being always a pleasure see her in the big screen. On the other side I feel bad because she is one of those stereotyped actress that no matter how hard she pushes in titles like A Time To Kill, Crash, Premonition or Infamous she will never be successful enough if not in a While You Were Sleeping-thing. But following her career for more than 10 years, I have no doubts that she's a great actress.<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie is another one with nothing that we haven't seen before in her career or any other 'chick-flick' genre, but I liked because she's comfort in it, and also, there's Ryan Reynolds, and both has a great chemistry in the screen that I haven't seen since Speed. Certainly is entertaining and charming, there are memorable sequences and a few good dialogs, but mainly actors that are not really acting but their experiences give spontaneous funny moments making the movie a lot enjoyable. Even the trailer showing most of the best parts, you would probably enjoy seeing them again. Some kind nostalgic when compared to the old romantic comedy movies but also some kind boring for, once again, being so predictable and full of clichés.<br/><br/>The movie plot has a lot of problems mainly about unnecessary issues like Andrew's ex-girlfriend or also his relationship problems with his dad resulting in forgettable dialogs. Seems that they tried to give some consistence for a so loose plot, but audience probably will not give any importance to that as the lack of consistence is notable on its very beginning.<br/><br/>But that's OK. I had a nice time... and if you're expecting nothing but fun, I guess you will have it too."

The one intended here is for the romantic comedy ""The Proposal"". Sandra Bullock stars as Margaret Tate, a domineering publisher executive who is threatened to be deported from the U.S. because of past illegal immigration business traveling. Margaret is Canadian. Ryan Reynolds co-stars as Andrew Paxton, Margaret's restless assistant who dreams of proposing himself to move up the publishing hierarchy to Editor. In a desperate & improvisational move to convince her bosses to let her stay employed and avoid deportation, Margaret pretends that she is engaged to Andrew. He is obviously oblivion to this firsthand but quickly sees Margaret's selfish motives. Margaret & Andrew travel to Alaska to visit Andrew's family for his grandmother's 90th Birthday, and consequently so Marg can learn more about Andrew & his Paxton family tree so she can ace the dreadful Immigration interrogation of marriage authenticity. Did Andrew and Margaret get at each other's throat in Alaska? Or do they fall for each other throughout this crazy ordeal? Does his family suspect the farce of it all? Does his grandmother survive? Does Margaret get to keep her job? Does she get deported? Am I asking way too many questions in this review? OK, I will stop! It is just that I am in this ""popping the question"" mode while scribing this Proposal review. One question I would definitely say ""No"" to is: If Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds had screen chemistry? Not to take away from their quasi-commendable performances, I just do not see Sandra being Ryan's hope as a compatible acting partner. And visa-versa for Sandra with Ryan, and that is no bullock! Betty White did have some golden scene-stealing efforts as Grandma Annie, but I would not give it a ""grandmother clause"" recognition because we have seen these shades of White numerous times before with her recent film characters in playing the loony geriatric. Craig T. Nelson and Mary Steenburgen looked bored portraying Andrew's parents. And Oscar Nunez playing the Latin zany ""do-it-all"" named Ramone became a running joke that became way too outlandish & creepy and disbarred credibility from his performance; even though there were some ""guilty pleasure"" smirks along the Ramone way. Screenwriter Pete Chiarelli should have proposed to write up a wittier and less formulaic screenplay than the one he offered for the film. Director Anne Fletcher tried to engage the audience with inventive comedic scenes, but not enough to accept her working of ""The Proposal"" as viably original. I do not think you should totally reject ""The Proposal"" but give it some time to think about it, and wait to rent it during its DVD release. End of Proposal! *** Average"

","My husband and I went out to watch The Proposal last night with a pretty full theater. I have to admit we, and the rest of the theater, were laughing repeatedly throughout the film. Bullock and Reynolds are incredible comedians and the film is very entertaining. I would definitely recommend it for both men and women.<br/><br/>The only problem I did have with the film was that it felt a bit rushed. The film could have easily been a good half an hour longer and it would have made the movie so much better. Bullock and Reynolds do have amazing chemistry together and feelings developing between the two of them are very sweet and they pull it off. The only problem is the plot forgets to really give them time to 'fall in love.' There are precious few scenes of the two of them alone together. A lot of the interaction is with Reynolds and his father and Bullock with the grandmother and mother... it becomes a love story with Bullock and family life and Reynolds almost seems to be pushing the business-deal marriage forward in order to spite his father instead of because he might be developing a soft spot for Bullock's character.<br/><br/>However, the scenes they do have together are very well done and the chemistry is very sweet.

The scene with Bullock getting lost in the woods and stumbling upon White doing a tribal dance is so funny the entire audience was belly laughing full throttle!<br/><br/>There's so much more here, but know this...if you don't laugh and cry and laugh at this film then you better get some counseling because this movie is as good as it's gotten in a long time! Very Fulfilling and worth every cent...a woman directed this! YEAAAAA"

","I absolutely loved this movie. I felt like it all meshed so well together.It was hilarious, and heartwarming. <br/><br/>A lot of times in romantic comedies, there are so many cheesy parts, but in The Proposal i didn't feel like anything was cheesy, or at least too cheesy to the point where it stands out. <br/><br/>Reynolds and Bullock were perfect for these parts. They were ridiculously funny<br/><br/>great movie !<br/><br/>The spirit dancing was my favorite And i loved the stripper/waiter/clerk/preacher man. haha"
