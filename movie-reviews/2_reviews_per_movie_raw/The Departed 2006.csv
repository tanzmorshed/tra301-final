","One of the best films of the 21st century, The Departed keeps you on the edge of your seat and is incredibly exhilarating and the characters are incredibly well written and given great backstory. The ending will shock you and everything that comes before is some of Martin Scorsese's best work."
"Aaron_Kyle","9","203","254","9 March 2019"," Scorsese delivers another masterpiece
","The Departed is one of the rare cases when the remake is better than the original.<br/><br/>It succeeds mainly because of Scorsese's vision and ability to bring this project to life. Scorsese works with his cast turning DiCaprio, Wahlberg, Nicholson into a perfect trio and turning this film into of the best of the 00s. Like most of Scorsese's film, The Departed is very bloody and very violent but very entertaining in the process. Right from the opening line to the end credits The Departed shows off its style and keeps it consistent trough the 151-minute runtime. However, the 151-minute long runtime is the only thing preventing The Departed from being a masterpiece. At some moments in the film (not many), it gets somewhat annoying, but not annoying enough to make me lose interest. In other words, the strongest point of The Departed is also the weakest point. The Departed despite being a remake has enough charisma and energy to make it seem original. The Departed is a triumph of its own kind, it works its way up and hits on an emotional level.<br/><br/>There is something everyone in The Departed whether you're a Scorsese fan or not but if you're familiar with his work this is a must-see.<br/><br/>Final Score: 9/10"
"General_Turgidson","10","901","1295","2 October 2006"," Superb acting on top of brilliant storytelling
","Now I know that 'The Departed' is based off of the Hong Kong movie 'WuJianDao', but Scorsese really grabs hold of a great story and brings it to the American Screen. My father grew up in Boston and when we walked out of the theater he couldn't stop talking about how authentic the environment and attitude was. Then there's the acting in which the lead actors (Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon) not only give stunningly entertaining performances, but you become engulfed in each one's perspective and dilemmas. The smaller roles that of (Baldwin, Walberg, Sheen) are supporting roles that remind me of Jesus Quintana from 'The Big Lebowski', by this I mean that their screen time is limited but they make lasting impressions that you cherish each and every scene they are in, Alec Baldwin especially. The story itself starts off with the basic intro of the players and the setting, but you'll find yourself slowing following each and every plot twist and rooting back and forth for the good guys and for the bad guys. If you're a Scorsese fan, which I am, I think you will appreciate this film. You can clearly see the Scorsese touch ranging from the cinematography and of course the music, it's great to hear ""Gimme Shelter"" again, but ""Comfortably Numb"" played in so well. It's another gangster flick from Scorsese, yet this one stands alone because feels so fresh and most would agree Scorsese does gangster films the best; so why not let him. Oscar worthy, the acting I certainly hope; this is DiCaprio's best role since 'The Aviator' which was his best role since 'Gangs of New York', am I seeing a pattern here. But my lasting impression wasn't concerned with the politics of the golden statue; my lasting impression was that I had sat through 2 and half hours of brilliant and especially entertaining storytelling. Thank you Mr. Scorsese."
"Billy_Costigan","Null","220","305","28 January 2009"," Lies, Betrayal, Sacrifice. What will you believe?
","First off, this is an American stylized remake of the Hong Kong hit, Infernal Affairs. I have to give credit to that, a good film. I have seen both Infernal Affairs and The Departed. I personally prefer The Departed, and I think because of one thing: Martin Scorsese. This is the master behind such greats as Taxi Diver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and he's at it again. The film has an all star cast with Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin.<br/><br/>The Direction was amazing. (maybe one of the reasons why he won the Oscar for it) I loved how some of the scenes were shot and set up. Especially regarding the Chinatown, and police interrogation scenes, among many others. The film is perfectly set up with intense, suspense scenes while adding in amounts humor at times. It works really well. The script is top notch. (Also Oscar winning) Realistic strong dialogue from scene to scene.<br/><br/>Another thing I liked more in The Departed, as opposed to Infernal Affairs, was the acting. DiCaprio really seemed to earn a lot of respect from this role. Here, he takes on the tough guy persona so well. Sure it was known he was a good actor from his Oscar nominated performances in What's Eating Gilbert Grape and The Aviator, but he really takes it to another level here. I can't see anyone else as the character, he fits so perfectly with it. Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg, being Massachusetts natives, also give solid performances, with their natural accents. Nicholson works well in his role, as well. Everyone was extremely solid and everything seemed so real.<br/><br/>Set in Boston, The Departed takes in all the Boston like atmosphere. Beautifully shot scenes of the Massachusetts Golden Dome State Capital building is just one part of the landscape. The Dropkick Murphys song ""I'm Shipping up to Boston"" really fits, great use of songs. Scorsese usually works music into his films really well.<br/><br/>""Cops or Criminals. When you're facing a loaded gun what's the difference?"" This quote really represents the film."" Matt Damon plays a state officer in the Police, working for the crime boss of the area, Frank Costello (Nicholson). While Damon's character can be described as a ""bad guy,"" he is really misunderstood. As a kid, he is sort of mentored into crime business by Costello while Costello becomes the father figure Damon's character never had. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a young guy, coming from a bad, crime ridden family. He's decides to become a police officer to get away from the crime life he's been surrounded by. Taking all this into account, Captain Queenen (Sheen) and Seargent Dignam (Wahlberg) decide to send DiCaprio's character undercover to find out more about the criminal underworld and Costello. With his family's crime record, he fit's perfectly into the situation. Now you have a highly ranked officer working for bad guy, and an undercover cop in the criminal underworld working for the State Police. From here it's an all out suspenseful thrill ride. Who's who? Who's working for who? Who can you trust? Paranoia threatens everyone. Lies. Betrayal. Sacrifice. How far will you take it? <br/><br/>At the heart of this film is character development. We really feel for the characters. We feel like we know them. It's really amazing part of this story and film. Tremendous story telling here.<br/><br/>This is one of the most entertaining and suspenseful crime/drama's I have seen in a while. While Infernal Affairs, came first, I think The Departed expands on it in so many ways. Really solid crime/drama. Check both out when you get a chance. It's really worth it. 9/10"

","When veteran director Martin Scorsese walked up to collect his Best Director Oscar in 2007 for his efforts with Hollywood remake The Departed, it felt like justice had finally been served.<br/><br/>After many a miss (hello Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, The Aviator, Casino etc. etc.), cinema fans breathed a sigh of relief when they saw the long-standing master finally get his just rewards and while it's hard to argue against the fact that The Departed is unlikely to be Scorsese's best work, it's one of his most easily accessible and fun films that remains a joy to watch to this day.<br/><br/>Utilizing a whip smart and darkly humorous script by scribe William Monahan, that adapted Asian mega-hit Infernal Affairs for English audiences and transported the action from Asia to the thick drawl of Boston, The Departed is one of the most successful reimagining's of all time thanks to the screenwriter, Scorsese's energetic and perfectly paced direction and a collection of stars who shine together in an all-round ensemble.<br/><br/>Front and centre of the cat and mouse game that sees an undercover mob affiliate infiltrate the Boston police department while simultaneously a Boston police office infiltrates the local mob, is lead trio Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson, who all deliver seriously fun and switched on turns with fantastic help from the likes of Vera Farmiga, Mark Wahlberg (in an Oscar nominated supporting turn), Alec Baldwin and Ray Winstone.<br/><br/>Scorsese struck it lucky with the casting of his 2006 film with both DiCaprio and Damon operating at the peak of their powers, while also snaring Nicholson before he fell into relative obscurity and it's a cinematic treat to see these performers eat up the rich and sassy dialogue and play off each other to great effect as the stories twisted and ever evolving plotline transforms.<br/><br/>The Departed is one of those rarely found films that continually stays on the move, barely allowing you time to stop and take a moments respite as DiCaprio's undercover cop Billy Costigan, Damon's undercover mob mole Colin Sullivan and Nicholson's purple adorned crime boss Frank Costello go about their respective lives, with Scorsese's film becoming a thriller that genuinely keeps you on the edge of your seat, culminating in one of the most unforgettable and at the times unexpected endings, that recalls many a wide jawed reaction for those that caught this classic in cinemas (myself included).<br/><br/>Final Say -<br/><br/>It's not Scorsese's best film but its absolutely one of his most enjoyable. The Departed may not offer anything deep and meaningful but this seriously addictive thriller is the type of cinematic ride we should all enjoy that rightfully ended up becoming one of the most memorable films of the mid 2000's.<br/><br/>4 ½ rat impressions out of 5"
"Alwood","10","874","1347","3 October 2006"," Martin Scorsese Hits the Streets Again!
","Please don't make negative comments like some of the aforementioned people have been doing if you haven't seen the film yet! I have seen it, at a press screening last week. Not only is it the best film of the year so far, it marks a return to form for Martin Scorsese, and ranks with the likes of GOODFELLAS as being one of the best in his canon of films.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of the Hong Kong film, INFERNAL AFFAIRS, upon which this is based. While THE DEPARTED keeps the basic structure of the original, it is very much its own movie, so much so that the screenwriter, William Monahan, didn't even watch the original film while adapting its screenplay, thus enabling him to infuse the script with his, and Scorsese's, respective visions.<br/><br/>All the actors are first-rate (yes, even Leo, for all you DiCaprio bashers out there), and turn in some of their best performances to date. THE DEPARTED is sure to garner a host of Oscar nods, if not wins, including (hopefully) Scorsese's long-overdue statuette for Best Director. Plus, with actors like Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin playing supporting roles, that says a lot about the quality of the film they signed up for! THE DEPARTED is tough stuff, not for the faint-of-heart. That said, it is a must-see for adult viewers who long for intelligent, gritty stories to grace our movie screens once again."
"MaxBorg89","10","193","303","31 October 2006"," Scorsese's best since Goodfellas!
","He has made good musicals (New York, New York), surreal comedies (After Hours), satires (The King of Comedy) and biopics (The Aviator), but Martin Scorsese has never done better than the times he's dealt with life on the streets and gangsters. Mean Streets, Goodfellas and Casino (and, to some degree, Taxi Driver) are proof of that. It doesn't seem strange, then, that his finest film in over a decade (Goodfellas was released in 1990) sees him return to that familiar ground. With a few changes.<br/><br/>The Departed, based on Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs (2002), is Scorsese's first gangster film not to feature Italian-American criminals. In fact, this film is set in Boston, where the Irish rule. One of these ""godfathers"" is Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), the man the State Police want the most. After years of investigation, they're finally getting close, thanks to undercover agent Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio). Because of his family (all Irish, all bad), becoming a member of Costello's crew isn't that difficult. Now all Costigan has to do is report to his superiors, Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg), who will pass on the information to Ellerby's (Alec Baldwin) Special Investigations Unit. What they don't know is that Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), the most promising element of said unit, has been on Costello's payroll since he was 12. Soon enough, both cops and crooks become aware of the situation, beginning a manhunt that's gonna make the already fragile Billy even more nervous and Costello increasingly crazier.<br/><br/>By moving from Hong Kong to Boston, Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan have made the first step in ensuring this film will be quite different from its Chinese inspiration. Another significant factor is the running time: a mere 97 minutes for Infernal Affairs, 150 for The Departed. This is due to new characters (Dignam and Costello's henchman Mr French, played by Ray Winstone, were missing in the original) and subplots, such as the one concerning Madolyn (Vera Farmiga), a psychiatrist who gets emotionally involved with both of the moles. But the most crucial difference is in the depiction of the underworld: whereas IA was stylish without being excessive, Scorsese's vision comprises very colorful language (some insults are so creative one might expect Joe Pesci to show up) and, of course, buckets of blood, the last part of the movie proving to be particularly shocking. None of the scenes ever reach the gross-out level of Casino's head-in-the-vice scene, but in pure Scorsese tradition it remains unflinchingly violent (also notable is the music, perfectly setting the mood, scene after scene, alongside Thelma Schoonmaker's impeccable editing).<br/><br/>Amidst these brutal surroundings, the director handles a spot-on cast: Baldwin, Sheen and Wahlberg (the latter finally back on form) make good use of their little screen time, Damon fine-tunes the edgier side he showed in The Talented Mr Ripley and the Bourne movies, and Nicholson, playing the villain again at last, delivers another OTT but classy turn (original choice Robert De Niro would probably have played the part with more calm and subtlety). A special mention is needed for Di Caprio: working with Scorsese for the third consecutive time, he has finally found a way to shake off his Titanic image, thanks to a vulnerable, gripping (and arguably career-best) performance.<br/><br/>With its clever plot, excellent acting and expert direction, The Departed is without doubt the year's best film so far. If this really is going to be his last gangster film (he has said so), as well as his last studio-endorsed picture, Scorsese can be proud, given the masterpiece he has given us. If only they gave him the Oscar in return..."
"PhoCris","5","501","844","7 October 2006"," Good but not as good as the original
","Just came back from watching the movie so it's still fresh in my mind. Overall the movie was good but it could have been shorter. Good movie but nothing extraordinary, not a master-piece, not a classic. In this period filled with really bad movies it's a movie you have to watch.<br/><br/>Some things are better than in the original (Infernal Affairs) like character development. It is especially true for DiCaprio's character (not really for other character). However the scene, when Wahlberg cites all of DiCaprio's family connection to the mob, takes too much time. They take a long time establishing how DiCaprio sells drugs with his cousin and finally get into Nicholson's gang. However after that it doesn't take long for Nicholson to give his total trust (in one year and a half to two years), which bothered me. This takes the first hour of the movie and i think it could have been cut by at least 20min.<br/><br/>Some scenes have a lot more impact in Infernal Affairs than in The Departed. I'm gonna cite 3 scenes which are some of the most important in the story in my opinion: <br/><br/>-The death of Wong/Queenan: in IA, Wong falls suddenly, lands on a taxi cab taking Yan by surprise. When Yan realizes Wong is dead you can feel the suffering Yan goes through by the loss of the only person who knows he's a cop but also/mainly by the loss of his friend. <br/><br/>In The Departed we see Sheen falls in slow-mo until he hits the ground in a splash of blood. There's absolutely no connection, no friendship between DiCaprio and Sheen. We see DiCaprio almost on the verge of crying. But Why ? He's not his friend and there's still Wahlberg to prove he's a cop.<br/><br/>-The death of Sam/Costello: In IA, Ming seems to show a desire to redeem himself and become a good man for his girlfriend. When he confronts Sam in the parking lot during the raid, he kills Sam to remove any evidence he's a mole and restart on a blank slate.<br/><br/>In The Departed, although Damon slightly mentions starting anew in another city, when he kills Costello he does it just to cover his a-s-s. Never after he seems like he might become good.<br/><br/>-The elevator and final scene: In IA, the meeting on the rooftop is between two men on each side of the law but sharing so much in common. You can even sense that Ming has some respect for Yan. There's no violence until what happens in the elevator. When Yan dies you can see Ming didn't want this to end like that. Yan's death is really emotional, all sounds are drawn off and only an opera piece is playing. When the second mole gets killed by Ming you only hear gunshots.<br/><br/>In The Departed The final scenes are a mess. Damon and DiCaprio just hate each other's gut, the token black guy shows up, the 2nd mole shows up and everybody executes everybody. They just stand there to get shot. The scene seems really rushed.<br/><br/>And when Damon open his door at the end of the movie to see Wahlberg waiting for him, it was the cherry on top of the cake. Everybody was cracking up. How many shots to the head do we need to see ? Was it really necessary to kill Damon and provide the audience with a happy ending ? <br/><br/>Although The Departed is a good movie I felt a lot more satisfied with Infernal Affairs. They have very different feel to them. One is over-the-top street violence while the other one is more subdued, concise and nuanced.<br/><br/>For those who says that The Departed is way more psychological than IA I would have to disagree. Infernal Affairs shows how two men struggle to know what defines if they're good or bad. Is it their actions or their allegiance to one side or the other of the law? In the end they're really similar. Yan tells the Psy he's a cop and lift that weight off his shoulder even if it's for just a second. Ming wants to redeem himself and prove his girlfriend but also himself that he's not that bad. Others before me have also commented on the buddhist notion of eternal hell so I won't talk about it :) <br/><br/>The Departed lacked in that department. There's no connection between the two main characters except for the fact they are moles. They're almost portrayed as black and white. Especially Damon who doesn't seem to have any nuance. He's just bad till the end.<br/><br/>The Departed 8/10 Infernal Affairs 9/10"
"kongwong","7","94","149","15 October 2006"," Jack is great but the Original is MUCH BETTER
","Just watched it last night and can't help but think how much better the original ""Infernal Affairs"" was compare to ""The Departed."" The Departed had wasted its cast power, failed to fully develop the characters, failed to focus on the inner conflict for the two undercover, didn't make enough of a point in betrayal, and tried but failed to made up with Scorsess' trade mark violence and sex.<br/><br/>I didn't feel the inner conflict of Matt Damon the same as Andy Lau. I couldn't help but feel for Jack when Matt betrayed him while I could understand Andy's inevitable turn and his trying to be a better person than he was.<br/><br/>I couldn't feel for Leonardo. He was crying and breaking up after what? SIX MONTHs? Damn! Tony Leung was a undercover for nine years and he didn't sign up because he chose to, he signed up because that was the only way he could be a cop! Martin Sheen got shafted in his role. There was no time for his character to develop a believable relationship with Leonardo. His screen time was wasted. When he got pushed off the roof, Leonardo wasn't feeling the loss of his only life-line to the world, there was still Mark, he wasn't feeling the loss of a trusted friend, there was no friendship, he wasn't feeling the loss of a fatherly figure, and the only emotion he could have was the shock from the brutality of the murder.<br/><br/>Mark Walhberg and Alec Baldwin got shafted, too. Mark Walhberg was reduced to a foul mouth asshole turned plot device. What do we need him for other than showing up at the end to put Matt out? Alec Baldwin? His whole highlight was to make that stupid speech about marriage at the golf course? COME ON! The only bright spot in this movie is Jack Nicholson. But even his talent is wasted because he had no one but ""Mr. French"" to play off his evilness. The classic scene of the original Infernal Affair had Jack's character to confront his counter part in the police station with some of the most memorable moment of the film. Jack has no counter part in ""The Departed"" and his brilliance was wasted. (The dock encounter was lousy with Martin Sheen making empty threats and Mark Walhberg just running his mouth off.) Matt Damon and Leonardo Dicaprio made lousy under covers, nowhere up to the professionalism showed in the original. Even the confrontation at the end lack the power of the original with the surprise. More dead bodies and more punches and elbows actually subtracted the suspense and the confrontation. There was nothing like the psychological confrontation with the calm manner in the original. Instead, we had elbows flying and a character cracking up crying. Mark Walhberg's existence actually ruined the helplessness of Leonardo. Unlike the original, logically he didn't have to do it alone.<br/><br/>""The Departed"" is a good movie if only it wasn't a remake. There is a reason it is not doing well in Hong Kong. The original is much much better plot wise and character wise. The acting was superb in both movie but the script and the direction was the difference. Even though the plot was essentially the same, Infernal Affair was a much better movie.<br/><br/>Watch the original if you haven't seen it, and see the difference in camera work and characters."

","Before seeing this, I knew I was in for a treat, given that it's a Scorsese movie, but The Departed was even better than I expected.<br/><br/>The acting is outstanding. Leonardo DiCaprio gives what is quite possibly the best performance of his career. Even the people who hate him admit he did a good job. It's turned some haters into fans and my brother who despises him even says he was great. Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson give their best performances since The Talented Mr. Ripley and As Good As It Gets. Mark Wahlberg almost steals the show with the best lines. Ray Winstone, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen are good, too.<br/><br/>Definitely one of the best films of the 00's. And easily one of the best remakes of all time. It's intense, funny, exciting, suspenseful, superbly acted, violent, has great characters, and has one of the most shocking scenes I've ever seen. And there's not a boring moment in it's two and a half hour running time. <br/><br/>The film will most likely be nominated for picture, director and adapted screenplay, and in my opinion, it deserves all three of them. DiCaprio and Wahlberg also deserve nominations.<br/><br/>See this as soon as you can."

","Idiots often say this: ""Oh, yes, it's very good for Hollywood I suppose, but not a patch on the Uruguayan original."" Well smack me in the face and call me an idiot, 'cos the 2002 Hong Kong crime thriller Infernal Affairs (Mou gaan dou) is aeons better than the Scorsese-directed, all-star Hollywood remake.<br/><br/>The original was 100 minutes long and so taught you could probably play it like banjo strings. Several of the scenes were filmed with such artistry that they set a new standard in beautifully realised intensity. The plotting was tight, the acting pitch-perfect, and you really felt for the protagonists.<br/><br/>It was, in short, the best cops and robbers thriller anyone had seen in years.<br/><br/>So of course it had to be remade.<br/><br/>Enter Scorsese, Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon, Sheen, Baldwin et al.<br/><br/>What results is bloated competence.<br/><br/>The set-pieces from Infernal Affairs remain, but are slacker and less well-handled. People in the cinema were laughing where they should have been clutching their heart to keep it in their chest.<br/><br/>The precision camera-work gives way to run-of-the-mill shots. Consider the sloppy execution of the rooftop fall.<br/><br/>The film is considerably longer without any real cause (bar, perhaps, Nicholson's hammy imperative to overplay any role he takes on). Witness the affair storyline, which is an unnecessary sop to the need for a more prominent female role, or the FBI addition, which is completely superfluous.<br/><br/>The end result is simply a lot weaker than the tightly-budgeted, tightly-edited, subtler original.<br/><br/>The only improvement  and I shudder to say this  is Alec Baldwin's role as the wise-cracking police captain, which made me chuckle on many occasions.<br/><br/>Get the original out instead. Please. You won't regret it."
"SoncoChairman","10","667","1159","29 September 2006"," Fantastic Bro
","Excellent. A great, great movie. I saw it last night at a special screening and must say it was a tour de force. Even though Boston is not really a gritty town Scorsese was able to capture a darker side of the city. Coming from that area, I am always concerned when actors put on the local accent as it tends to be distracting rather than supportive. However, with local pros like Damon and Wahlberg they were able to really grab hold of it and not go overboard... most of the time. The true stand out performance has to go to DiCaprio. He has really come into his since hooking up with Scorsese, having scored a number of original performances all of which have expanded his range. He really snagged onto a deep and tragic character and created something that will hopefully be recognized come awards season. One of my favorite aspects was the friendly hostility the characters had for each other. It is a specific trademark that I have never noticed in any other city. In Boston, when you are really close with someone (or not really) it is, more or less, a requirement to bust their balls and shoot cruel insults back and forth in rhythmic banter. That detail was extensively realized in THE DEPARTED and I doubt anybody who was raised outside of the metro Boston area, or at least visited at some point, would find it nearly as hilarious as those who were. As for Scorsese's direction, I think he scored big with this one. While many have criticized that his movies have become more commercial I believe that he has just evolved. There were some classic Scorsese moments here, my favorite being a scene where DiCaprio is alone and packing his things in his apartment. Beautifully cut and stylistically directed. Is it his best effort? No. But it still is truly mesmerizing. He has created something truly special from a city that is highly underrated."
"meibreezes","5","91","146","9 October 2006"," Would give an applause to it, if one never saw the Infernal Affairs before
","OK, saw the movie actually 2 days ago, didn't get a chance to think about it. Now with a refreshed mind, here it goes:<br/><br/>If one never saw the original ""Infernal Affairs"", you would fall in love with ""The Departed"" right away, after all it has an excellent plot. And with the legendary ""Gangs"" like Nicolson and Scorsese, we have every reason to have a high expectation. Unfortunately, this is not the case!<br/><br/>The Bad: If I want to sum it up, I would say that was because of Scorsese's passion over brutal violence, it prevents him to reveal the true essence (as human beings) of the movie.<br/><br/>1. I really feel sorry for Martin Sheen, his character in the movie is so pale, he does not show the deep and close relationship (as in the Infernal Affairs between Tony Leung and Anthony Wong), nor there was any sign shows he was even a capable cop. So unfortunately, I found myself hardly could feel sorry for what happened to him. Having said that,Infernal Affair's Anthony Wong did a superb job to catch the essence of his character. <br/><br/>2. OK, how about Mark Wahlberg's role? The obviously increased lines for him did not charm him a bit. With his boss being killed, and him as the only one knows about DiCaprio's true identity, he actually took a paid leave?! What's up with that? Does it even make a logically reasonable sense?! All right, he took his action in the end, but<br/><br/>3. Does it have to be a two and half hours movie? There are so many unnecessary scenes to my opinion. Just name a simple one here: when Matt Damon went in talking to the bad guy pretending he is the lawyer. PLEASE! We audience are no fool, you don't need to show everything to us, all you need to do is send Damon to the room and start talking. We would figure out the guy's lawyer did not show up. Well, there are so many in the movie, what I am trying to say is if Scorsese wants us to keep thinking about what happens and what will happen next, you ought to do a consistent job!<br/><br/>4. The most of all, this movie pretty much follows what the Infernal Affairs had to offer, the biggest shock? The ENDING! I have to say I was confused right after I saw the movie, I thought maybe I was too dumb to figure out what it meant. BUT, the more I think about it, the more I got disappointed. The ending was so bad it can literally take all the credits it gets. Let's set Mr. Scorsese's beloved violence scenes aside, for me, I think the essence for the movie is: the ""good"" and the ""bad"" does not really have a clear line in between to judge from. Just like Nicolson said: ""When I was your age, they would say you could become cops or criminals. What I'm saying is this: When you're facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?"" For that reason, I gave two thumbs up for Infernal Affairs' ending, sorry Scorsese, yours is just too lame!<br/><br/>Also, I am not buying the cell phone communication throughout the movie, personally, I think the Morse code is a much better way!<br/><br/>The Good: <br/><br/>1. Nicolson! To be honest, he is a perfect fit for this character. The only other possible candidate I can think of is Robert De Niro. Nicolson actually did a great job as Frank Costello. My only problem is I could hardly see Costello's foxy side. 2. The Shrink! OK, I have to say that is one shining point of the movie! Not like the original one assigned two female roles to the two leading actors, ""The Departed"" combines as one, which not only makes the character more standing out, but also adds another interesting twist to the story."

","The Departed<br/><br/>The screenplay: Top Notch<br/><br/>The performances: all-star cast delivering all-star performances<br/><br/>The music: perfect<br/><br/>The Directing: Martin Scorsese at his finest and that is saying something.<br/><br/>Once again Scorsese delivers a film that meets or exceeds the expectations of its audience in nearly every way. There are moments of incredible tension, violence, and drama, moments where characters reveal their vulnerabilities and weakness. Comedic moments and moments of sadness and through it all a multi layered and brilliant story is told by an American film maker who once again proves Harvey Keitel correct when he said, ""Maybe he (Scorsese) got what he deserves--exclusion from the mediocre."" <br/><br/>This film is Scorsese's finest work since Raging Bull, but it is not simply about Martin Scorsese or the amazing screen play by William Monahan, it is more than an amazing score, and great cinematography. While many of the accolades for this film belong to those behind the scenes people who envisioned and directed this film. One would be remiss to not point out the great performances of an all-star cast, many of whom deliver the finest performances of long and storied careers. Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon deliver incredible performances. <br/><br/>However the performance that stood out for me was Wahlberg, Mark Wahlberg's Sgt. Dignam stole every scene he was in, and he shared screen time with each of the afore mentioned actors. He gets to deliver some of the best lines, and with every scene he leaves the audience wanting more, and anticipating his next scene.<br/><br/>Since The Academy has had its collective heads stuck  for so long, mentioning a Scorsese picture and Oscar in the same sentence seems to be a waste of time. That being said I can not say if he will finally win the Oscar that he has deserved for so long, as his major competition (Flags of our Fathers) has yet to be released, I will say that I expect to see Wahlberg nominated for best supporting, and Leo and Damon will be pitted against one another once more, this time for best actor, Monahan will be nominated for writing, and of course Scorsese will be nominated for director. Also, it goes without saying a best picture nomination will be in order for The Departed.<br/><br/>That was the long version; the short version is if you like a movie with incredible performances, direction, music and visuals. If you like a layered story that is not formulaic, in short if you appreciate film making and story telling at its finest then see this film. Even with the glowing reviews of myself and others, and the high expectations they will undoubtedly bring I assure you that you will not be disappointed."
"eugeneluah","2","211","359","15 October 2006"," Abject failure of a remake of Infernal Affairs (SPOILERS)
","Caught The Departed last night and I have to say, its one abject failure of a remake. I was expecting it to be good, and truth be told, I wanted it to be good because it is based on Hongkong's Infernal Affairs, quite possibly one of the best gang flicks of all time. It is one of my personal favorites due to its brilliantly conceived plot of gang versus police, replete with paranoia and deceit. It is also quite possibly, one of the most intelligent films I have ever seen (second to Memento).<br/><br/>Where do I even begin? There are just so many things to criticize about. Firstly, the utterly realistic characters in Infernal Affairs have been reduced to one dimensional vectors that merely carry the plot forward. Matt Damon's character was reduced to a bad ass villain and was almost gleefully ridding anyone who knew of his identity, with no hint of remorse even till the very end. In Infernal Affairs however, at the end of the film, Andy Lau truly wanted to be a good guy but obviously, circumstances did not allow him to, and therefore he was forced to kill the gang boss to protect his identity. He subsequently went crazy over the guilt of killing the police informant (Tony Leung, or Leornado in Departed). Infernal Affairs ended brilliantly because Andy Lau's character survived it all with no one knowing his true identity. He could therefore assume his role of a high-ranking police officer, but was ridden with guilt and constantly reminded of the people who died because of him. It was really tragic and you could almost sympathize with his character. And what's with the ending of The Departed?!! Do all Hollywood films have to have perfect fairy tale endings where the bad guy has to die? And even if he has to die, does it have to conclude with an abrupt scene that lasts 30secs, and not to mention, totally cheesy and lame. It seems like a quick way out to conclude the story. The climax at the lift in the abandoned building was also unintentionally funny as body counts skyrocketed as people just started dying ridiculously. The reaction that people had in that scene in Infernal Affairs was true shock'Oh my god!'. The reaction in Departed was quite the opposite  people started laughing.<br/><br/>Also, the strange and awkward friendship between the police informant's boss and the gang boss was completely removed in the Departed. It was so enjoyable watching how the 2 former friends who are currently on opposite ends of the law, try to outplay each other in a full-fledged war of wits and power, but with grace as a result of their friendship in the past. This was COMPLETELY omitted in the Hollywood version. And also, there was a lack of tension between the police force and the gangs. Martin Sheen seems almost weak and hapless against Jack Nicholson and Nicholson himself appears barely sinister and intelligent. Another stupid omission was the friendship between the police informant and his boss, which was meticulously staged in Infernal Affairs, and culminated in a tragic climax when the boss fell off the building and landed right in front of the informant. This scene was attempted in Departed but failed miserably when Leornado tried to look sad when his boss died. There was no friendship to speak of between these 2 characters in Departed!!!<br/><br/>The movie also tries way too hard to entertain. The crazy antics of Jack Nicholson is reminiscent of his character in Anger Management. Yes, Anger management, that rubbish of a comedy. And I do not understand why there are so much sexual references in the movie. There is sex, women and porno everywhere in the movie and is completely unnecessary and downright insulting. Gritty realism is not achieved by dumping sex scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>I can go on and on and criticizing about almost every single aspect in the movie (like how unnecessary the role of the psychiatrist in the Departed was, but completely pivotal in Infernal Affairs etc.), and might as well write a thesis on this movie. To conclude, there was not a single scene of tension nor was it ever moving or exciting. In fact, i found it more funny than anything else. The acting was not particularly great as well despite a rather stellar cast. <br/><br/>Infernal Affairs was an intricate and convoluted plot of deceit, lies, friendship, paranoia and love, at the hands of skillful directors who carefully stage memorable scenes and powerful climaxes  almost everything that Departed was not, despite an almost identical script. The critics are REALLY WRONG on this one. It is a complete failure of a remake, and even without comparison to the original Hongkong version, it is still a ridicule of an otherwise excellent plot. The editing was also fragmented and confusing, and coupled with horrendous pacing, the film gets progressively frustrating. Martin Scorsese has effectively removed everything that was so good about the original. Trust me, save your money and time, and watch Infernal Affairs, even if you have watched it already."

","First I saw 'The Departed'. It was cool. Then I saw 'Infernal affairs'. It was awesome. Then, after some time, I saw 'The Departed' again. And I realized I've been conned. <br/><br/>I wish there was a way to talk about 'The Departed' without constant references to IA, but there isn't. This is not a re-imagining, it is not a remake or a tribute- it's a pure and simple rip-off, most of the time scene by scene, shot by shot. Everything that is good, interesting or storytelling in 'The Departed' originates in IA. All they did was change the setting and the language and dumb down the story here and there with some melodramatic/vulgar effects. Speaking of vulgar; I don't give a s**t about 'ugly words', some of the best movies are full of cursing, and hell, that's how people really talk after all. But... i just couldn't get past of how scenes that are subtle and cool in IA are almost systematically replaced with mindless cursing-orgies here. It's not that they curse it's that they ONLY do that, as if a tirade Wahlberg-style could actually replace acting and real emotions. It seems like throwing in a dick-joke, adding some punches, yelling, being all f**k this and f**k that is what makes true 'realism'. Even in minor scenes; in IA the mob-mole merely has a conversation with the psychologist; here he blows up, yells and runs away. After the cinema scene, when the cop nearly finds out who the mole is in IA you have a tense psychological scene; in The Departed Matt Damon MUST stab somebody, apparently the director doesn't think it's cool enough without that. Or the classic rooftop end scene- in IA the two opponents act calmly, with dignity- here there's cursing and fighting and punching instead of a shared moment of drama. In one word- it's cheap, something you wouldn't expect from Scorsese and this cast."

","Well, due to all the hype I went to see this one with great expectations, although I must admit without having seen the parent film Infernal Affairs. What a let down ! Setting the scene is great, and time taken to achieve this is well spent, but for me the film started to drag, with expectation and patience well run out by the time the plot strands began coming together. Yes, Jack Nicholson is a great actor, but no he didn't convince me in the role, even though most of the good lines and deliveries were his. But Boston Irish ? Everyone, including the deliverer of the line ""I'm Irish & can live with something wrong the rest of my life...."" failed to convince me of Irish lineage. The accents, the faces, the attitudes were all wrong for souls in torment over doing what they believe they have to do, a basic for Irish/Catholic guilt and angst. <br/><br/>The film would have been much stronger with unknowns in several key positions, and for me once the disparate strands were established the rest of the film was very predictable and I wasn't kept guessing - crucial if we are to suspend disbelief and have pressure and tension build in the viewer.<br/><br/>DeCaprio fails to convince as a tough guy, despite the convincing scars. He stills comes across as an adolescent fuming after his pocket money's been withheld. Matt Damon looks like an awkward schoolboy, and was even less convincing than DeCaprio about being a cop. Mark Wahlberg sounded like he'd been taught to swear the week before, Martin Sheen was as hard bitten as a kitten and there were so many operational goofs the film became a comedy. A Federal agent running a State operation against his own informer? What a waste of time and budget monies. Only two people knowing about an undercover operation? BULL! Keep sending an undercover back after his nerve's gone ? Garbage ! Permanently deleting a full record (on a State Police computer no less!) without possibility of recovery ? Unbelievable - even children know data can be restored, and the system will keep a record of who deleted the information. For me, the film became a joke and I couldn't wait for the end to arrive so I could leave. By the time the end plays arrived and new players were falling like flies, the audience was laughing out loud at the inanity. Once again, Hollywood takes a good story and ruins it with poor crafting, no matter how well filmed. Very bad casting, a rushed and unfulfilling ending, far too much gore, not enough character substance, one dimensional players and an insult to the viewers intelligence."

I cannot make a good comment of the movie because it definitely is not a movie of it's own. There is no excitement of watching the movie because I know what would happen on every scene.

","Definitely the the type of movie that makes it worth going to the theater. Very intense action and violence, twisting plot, lot's of misdirection.<br/><br/>The story line is a bit overly whelming at times, this isn't a good movie to watch if you're tired and follow the action, the double crosses and the sometimes confusing who's who of the movie, but if you can just remember the basic characters the minor twists won't be too confusing.<br/><br/>While it's certainly not a love story, there is that element, with a bit of a morality play going the whole time.<br/><br/>I can't make some of the statements I'd like to make because I really try to avoid spoilers in my reviews, but I'll say that I enjoyed the movie even though had I been in charge it may have ended differently...<br/><br/>All that said, if you like a thriller that has some rough and tough violence and a plot with a few twists and turns this film would be one I'd recommend to you."

","When I heard Scorsese made this movie, i was very excited. Because one thing that i know, Departed will be an adaptation of my favorite Hongkong movie ""Infernal Affairs"" or ""Wu Jian Dao"". And when I read a magazine, the director denied and said it's only inspired by. So my expectation flew away. But all my dream has gone when I saw ""Departed"". It's all the same. Sorry, spoiler, how the boss gang died, how the captain died, how the undercover died, all the same. In short, all the important scene, are all the same. Maybe, they have different ending but if you have seen ""Wu Jian Dao"", ""The Departed"" just only follower. No need a big name like Scorsese just to remake an Asian movie. One thing, ""The Departed"" has lost the thrill that ""Wu Jian Dao"" have."

","Make it long, add top star billing, and spend a zillion dollars, and I guess anything can receive an award. Silly me, I thought original, provocative, and at the very least, plausible story telling was needed for good drama.<br/><br/>Let me start by adding, that ""great"" actors are useless when miss-cast. I'm sorry, but Damon and DiCaprio's persona's and looks are both too soft to play hard edge characters. Wahlberg and Sheen were so absent of realism, they compromised important plot dialog. Baldwin's attempt to add some comic flare came across as more buffoonery then wit. Even Nicholson's part was more cartoon then character. (Quintisential Jack)! Costello should have been cast by a hungry unknown, (from Boston).<br/><br/>What makes this very pretentious movie really bad, are the ""holes"". This movie leaked like a sieve. Allow me to address a few:<br/><br/>1) The premise alone. You have a large police department investigating a large crime family, yet only three members, (one of which is not even out of the academy), will alone without the resources of the department infiltrate an organized mob presumably using a mole. 2) If costigan is suppose to have been dismissed from the force, then why is he being seen by a civil service police psychiatrist. 3) If costigan was pulled out of the academy specifically for the benefit of his anonymity, then why does everyone he meets, know him and his family. 4) Does the department acknowledge the existence of costigan or not? His entire identity can not be conveniently eliminated from all record and then later resurface for a meritorious award. 5) If Costello was an F.B.I. informant, were the hell were the F.B.I., and better yet, what bigger fish would the F.B.I. want, then Costello himself. 6) Speakng of other agencies, were the hell were the Boston police during all these inner city homicides going on inside their jurisdiction.<br/><br/>The ending alone was most pathetic due to the fact there was no feasible conclusion possible based on the story's lack of continuity. I don't mind the enigmatic challenge of a smart and sophisticated screenplay, but please don't mollify me with vapid subplots.<br/><br/>Too much budget, and not enough substance. Unfortunately, I seem to find the latter in only foreign or independent films. Hollywood needs to to produce more movies that don't just rely on its marquee. Next time the director calls, ""That's a wrap"", there should be no loose ends.."
"kane4782","7","68","112","9 October 2006"," Scorsese tries, almost succeeds, but fails in my eyes...
","I have loved the original (Infernal Affairs) from the first time it enthralled and enticed me into its engrossing story, and I have watched it so many times without ever losing a moments interest. When I found out it would be remade, I was annoyed at Hollywood for meddling with masterpieces, but then I heard it would be Marty at the helm. His films have always impressed me and he deserves an Oscar for his efforts, yet his recent offerings have left me feeling a bit underwhelmed. Take Gangs of New York, it was entertaining, it had all the right elements to make it a great film, but after watching it, I felt a bit robbed. Undoubtedably, the best thing was Daniel Day Lewis' 'Butcher' character, along with the fight scenes and the setting, yet none of it really ever gelled together to make that masterpiece Scorsese always craves.<br/><br/>This brings me onto 'The Departed'. I went in thinking, this should be OK, Scorsese has taken an amazing concept and is trying to make it his own with a stellar cast that with such material, really shouldn't go wrong. I was right to an extent, but I was left with a feeling of dissatisfaction.<br/><br/>Having read in reviews that Jack Nicholson stole the show, to be honest, he didn't really do much for me in the film, just his usual on screen persona (feisty, scary, loud). He fits the bill though, he took up the screen and he owned the scenes he was in. However, if you look at the original and compare it to Sam, you'll notice that Sam seemed more menacing, because you really didn't know what he was going to do or say next.<br/><br/>Martin Sheens 'Quinan' was probably one of the weakest characters, his role in comparison to the original does not give a real mentor bonding with Billy Costigan (Leo Di Caprio) and defeats the idea of the closeness of the two main good characters. His sidekick however, Mark Wahlbergs 'Dignam', I think was the best thing in the movie. It allowed for a bit of banter and sparked off a few laughs in the cinema. He was more developed in this version, however he got in the way of Quinan making any impact on the story.<br/><br/>The two leads were well cast, Leonardo Di Caprio does well with his role and looks frail but tough, and caught in the middle of things. Matt Damon had probably less to do, in acting terms, however he manages well with what he had. Having said this, neither of them match up to Tony Leung or Andy Lau, from the original.<br/><br/>The one thing I did like about The Departed was the new idea that they both fall for the same woman. It added a bit more to the back story and suspense, towards the end. <br/><br/>Overall, I gave this a 7, because it is a movie in its own right and being that, it is a pretty good offering by Scorsese. The problem is, for me, the original is far better. The whole concept, suspense and acting from Infernal Affairs is so much more believable and flowing. I think one important point to note is the environment, the Hong Kong police force and triads are much better suited for this plot, as well as the language. Scorsese did well with transferring the idea over to the S. Boston Irish 'mafia', but he failed in trying to translate a lot of the dialogue over from Cantonese (eg. the wrong way of writing the word 'bodyguard' on the envelope, changes to the misspelling of the word 'citizen').<br/><br/>To conclude, if I was to take into account the original, I would have given this a 3.5/10, which may seem harsh, but I believe its nowhere near as good. If you haven't seen Infernal Affairs and were intending on seeing The Departed, I would advise you to see the latter first, so you will know what I mean about feeling unsatisfied. I think the rating of 8.7 (at the time of writing) for The Departed does not do the original justice. I leave it for you to decide."

","I had massive expectations for THE DEPARTED , a violent mob drama directed by Martin Scorsese the greatest film maker in the world today . After seeing it I did have a slight of feeling of something I have experienced throughout my life - Disappointment <br/><br/>***** SPOILERS ******<br/><br/>The film starts in typical Scorsese style of a sweeping framing sequence with a musical soundtrack by The Rolling Stones similar to the work he did in GOODFELLAS . Unfortunately the director doesn't sustain this and whilst never becoming mediocre we don't see much in the way of what cinematic beauty Scorsese is capable of and in several scenes most notably in the death of Queennan the original film INFERNAL AFFAIRS did it far more better <br/><br/>THE DEPARTED suffers from a very uneven screenplay courtesy of William Monahan . When it's bad it's woeful but when it's good it's great . It should be pointed out however that when it's good it's entirely down to Siu Fia Mak's original script and if you've seen INFERNAL AFFAIRS you'll notice how tight the storytelling was and how loose and cluttered Monahan's adaptation is in comparison . Did we really need a romantic subplot ? And there seems a lack of thought put into Costello . He's spent years as a crime boss so how come it appears it's only now that the Boston police department have come up with the bright idea of putting several moles into Costello's crew ? Are we to seriously believe that Costello is being protected for < Plot revelation that I won't give away > , and just because a tough gangster likes opera that doesn't make him multi layered , it just makes him clichéd and unconvincing . Most ridiculous scene is where Costello meets his police mole in the cinema . If it's a clandestine meeting then why does Costello draw attention to himself by grunting and pulling out his penis ? Possibly the most stupid sequence I've ever seen in a Scorsese film <br/><br/>There's been many other criticisms of this movie , a movie that seems to have split the critics right down the middle . One is the cast . I do think DiCaprio is a much better actor than what he's given credit for but I was never entirely convinced when he has to dish out violence . Someone a little less pretty should have been cast while you're left with the impression that Deniro and Pesci were first choices for Costello rather than Nicholson . Damon does merely okay as Sullivan while Ray Winstone as French is somewhat distracting because he's a widely regarded actor and household name in Britain and seeing him attempt an American accent is something of a shock to the system . The one performance I wasn't keen on was Mark Wahlberg as Dignam down to the fact he plays one of those fast talking foul mouthed cops that we've seen in far too many films and HBO series. Perhaps I'm being somewhat harsh to the cast in general and Wahlberg in particular because the dialog in Monahan's screenplay contains far too much swearing . Yeah I know swearing exists in real life but it's almost like it's included in every line just so the audience know that it's a hard hitting adult drama . I think everyone knew that when we saw the name Scorsese in the title . No need to over egg the pudding or include a fist fight every few minutes otherwise someone might think they're watching a Tarintino movie <br/><br/>As for the good points ... well if you've liked most of this great auteur's movies then you'll certainly like THE DEPARTED , just not as much as you've liked Scorses's previous output . If you have loved most of Scorsese's films then you'll be slightly disappointed . It's not helped by the fact that this is the first movie directed by Scorsese to pick up the Oscar for best film where as master works like TAXI DRIVER , RAGING BULL and GOODFELLAS didn't"

Infernal affairs didn't even get nominated for best foreign language movie. When it is certainly a cut above the Hollywood remake.

Cause the most important key was missing! In the original movie; the mole (Chan Wing Yan (as Tony Leung)) in the mafia gang had a great bond with the head guy of the entire case. He gave him a watch for his birthday. At that moment you could see how those two has a bond with each other. That would explain the grief that he showed in the movie when the head guy got killed.<br/><br/>The American re-film: Billy and Queenan totally had NO connection in my eyes. All Dignam could do was bash him with the f words. Why the hell would Billy give a crap that Queenan died? They had no bond. <br/><br/>I think supposedly in both movies the death of the head guy was the twist in the cases. The both moles (mafia side aswel the police side) realized this cannot continue anymore. Afterwards they had to take strong measurements to the case. That all cause of the death of that head guy.<br/><br/>So yeah, I advice everybody to watch the original one first. I think this movie is too overrated.

"martinitaly","1","144","253","17 March 2007"," The Untalented
","The title clearly refers to Scorsese's talent, which vanished in a squirt of stage blood about 15 years back. He wasn't talented, he was brilliant -- but that was then. Today he should be making intelligent independent movies, elder statesmanly flourishes of wit and humanity, inspiring a younger generation. Instead, he's humiliating himself with overblown junk. His love affair with hoodlums is tiresome, his critique of Catholicism is ignorant and stupid -- I mean, I dislike Catholicism as an institution, and God knows it doesn't need me to defend it -- but any sociological or spiritual phenomenon with the history and complexity of Catholicism deserves better treatment than the head-kickings Scorsese metes out. And ironically, Scorsese has made his own Faustian pact with the Devil -- he had his years in the Hollywood wilderness and feels he won't get anything thoughtful financed -- so it's better to team up with a bankable but untalented actor and produce these lumbering, brainless sub-epics.<br/><br/>Many people in their comments here have struggled to express quite how deeply bad this film is. I too am at a loss. It's intriguing for a while, then downhill races into one of the worst supposedly classy films EVER MADE. Jack does his Jack Show, because he is vain and because no one has the guts to tell him that it was already self-parody 20 years ago. Supposed hard man Leonardo looks as enraged as a poodle when the canine beautician has gone a bit to close to his ear with the electric clippers. Matt is actually OK in the light comedy bits, which makes one wonder why he has become Hollywood's current Brooding One. Wahlburg -- rubbish. Sheen looks like he's focusing all his energies on trying to deliver his lines without spitting out his dentures. By the way, I reckon the script originally developed the sexual thing a bit more -- as it implies that Damon is not as groovy between the sheets as Leo, and his homophobia and other things seem to hint at his being a gay in denial -- but they decided that audiences wouldn't buy a gay hero, or it scared Damon, or God knows what -- just another loose end in this spaghetti-plate of a movie.<br/><br/>Overall, hardly anyone in this movie (Winstone is an exception) act-ually ACTS. They are all oh so boringly themselves. Consider Olivier in Marathon Man, how his characterisation of an ageing Nazi suggested all sorts of undercurrents of twisted psychotic nastiness -- and then look at Nicholson's leering, over-the-top gurning. Chortling as you pull the trigger on someone is not really quite enough to convince us we are witnessing evil, Jackie baby.<br/><br/>By the way, the film shows cutting-edge developments in cinematic blood-squirting technology. Instead of the wounds exploding using charges that produce a small cloud of smoke, they sort of vaporize -- it looks like it's done with compressed air. A great advance Scorsese can be proud of. <br/><br/>This film has been larded with praise -- by gaga members of the Hollywood money machine. Every year people say Scorsese deserves an Oscar, and it's usually because we remember his early films. Well, they have Lifetime Achievement Oscars if we want to reward a body of work. Now he has to go to his grave knowing he got the Oscar for a Turkey. Only he probably doesn't know. And do any of the egos involved in this mess care? Hollywood cynicism, parodied in Scorsese's last film, The Aviator! What a joke.<br/><br/>Right -- my last word, if you're still reading. We are currently being told by our masters to hate Iran. It has one of the few cinemas in the world that sometimes try to show something true about the human condition. Whereas our civilization produces, as one of the top-billing cultural manifestations of the year, expensive to make, heaped with praise and awards, exported around the world and seen by multiple millions--something about as edifying as watching lions tortured or Christians having limbs lopped off at the Roman Colisseum two millennia ago. What does this say about us?"

Did you forget the unbuilt grey area regarding the CIA informer?"

","Lets start with a very slow intro to an amazing story. Then lets compile a dream cast of characters to act out this amazing story. So amazing in fact that it very well could be the best movie of the year. Then once this character had given up everything and risked his life in nearly every scene, lets FINALLY give him the opportunity to hand over the dirty cop and set things straight. Well, we don't have time to finish the story with a great ending, so lets just kill him. Then at the end, lets kill the dirty cop so he can be decorated as a hero instead of turning over evidence so he can be convicted. This could have been the best movie of the year, and the story could have been told in well under 2 hours. They should have just opened and closed with a firing squad and I could have been in and out in 10 minutes with the same results."

","Although I loathe a lot of what Hollywood does in films these days, I am willing to put up with much of it as long as the film pays off in the end. While there is much to admire in The Departed, the ending is one of the worst I have ever seen, below the standards even of Training Day and John Q. I was quite mesmerized up to the point where Costigan discovers the truth about Sullivan. In spite of Scorsese's compulsion/obsession with every filthy aspect of human nature, I was very much enjoying the performances and the story. Then, it seems he or the screenwriter had a brainfart. In light of that fact, all of the excess of the film caused it to implode. In the ensuing vacuum, I could find no redeeming quality of the film at all. What does the story tell us? It wasn't true to itself at all. No one gained a thing. No redemption. No resolution.<br/><br/>I am not an expert on films in any way. But it seems to me that when a story is developed on the strength of a collection of main characters, the story had better wind up focusing on the relationship between them. One by one, the supporting cast is eliminated. Then one of the three main characters is killed off. That leaves the two lead roles, and as far as I'm concerned, at this point it has to come down to the two of them. Whether it's a showdown or a meltdown, this film had to close with Costigan and Sullivan forcing the outcome. Instead, they are both eliminated with as little drama as if they were innocent bystanders. The fact that these events left as many questions as answers tells me that the director really didn't know what he wanted the story to say.<br/><br/>The acting was superb, the story captivating, the suspense almost unbearable - what more could you want from a good movie? Well, as far as I'm concerned, without a good ending, all of the above amounts to little more than the hype that usually precedes a film, but in this case makes up the bulk of the film. Enough with the blood and guts, Mr. Scorsese, enough with the profanity and vulgarity - lets see if you can make a film that succeeds on its own merits.<br/><br/>And in the meanwhile, I would appreciate it if you could convince the studio to refund my money."

","I thought the original movie of it ""The Infernal Affairs"" was more entertaining than ""The Departed"". The Infernal Affairs had more actions and more emotional than The Departed. It was total copy cat of the Infernal Affairs. When Leonardo DiCaprio was trying to beat Matt Damon on the top of the building was lame. With the Infernal Affairs was awesome. Tony Leung(Leonardo) pointed his gun at Andy(Matt) and said, ""Sorry, I'm a police officer."" Later Andy killed Tony in the elevator that was great action. Unlike The Departed was really retarded. For the Infernal Affairs it's a 10/10! There is one thing that was good about The Departed was that there was Leonardo DiCaprio. He acted extremely well. Matt Damon doesn't know how to act. They should of had Brad Pitt instead. The performance would be more outstanding. They got lots of cheap actors for The Departed. For the Infernal Affairs, they got a lot of expensive actors. GO INFERNAL AFFAIRS!!!"

","Before starting I must confess to watching this film never having seen the original and without realizing there was one. After reading some of the comments here I will pick up internal affairs and watch it. Having discovered the film is a remake of a superior foreign film this explains a lot (though probably not all) of what makes this such a bad film.<br/><br/>But I am happy to take the film stand alone on its own merits, of which there are few. For Scorsese to stoop to this debacle after masterpieces like Mean Streets and Goodfellas is shocking. The fact that this won so many awards is beyond me.<br/><br/>Let's review the completely unbelievable plot points: - Gangster Nicholson allows former cop (who he knows is a former cop) DiCaprio become his right hand man seemingly moments after joining his gang.<br/><br/><ul><li>Nicholson discovers there is a mole in the organization. And can't work out that it's DiCaprio, his latest recruit. Ludicrous. This appears to be a gang of less than ten people. Give me a break.</li></ul><br/><br/>The whole film falls apart right there - if you can't believe the main premise then it's failed. But let's go on.<br/><br/><ul><li>DiCaprio is the only gangster not to give his ID number to his boss, but he is still above suspicion.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Rotten Cop Damon gets away with blasting his boss Nicholson - and there is no investigation? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Nobody ever subpoenas cell phone records (a very easy thing to do) </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Damon and DiCaprio just happen to be dating the same girl.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Said girl is given incriminating tape of Damon by DiCaprio. Nothing is ever done with this tape though. Was this cut out to trim the film under three hours? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Said girl agrees to go for a coffee with her patient DiCaprio. This doesn't happen in real life. Psychiatrists do not date their patients. Not even Frasier did that and that was supposed to be comedy.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Police records are completely erasable by one person with no backup and no trace remaining. Nonsense.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The final scenes at the building are ludicrous. Characters only briefly touched upon at the beginning of the film are suddenly players in the big game to the point where they will commit cop murders. I'm not sure I understood why it needed to be on the roof anyway. From what I understand this was in the original film but there was a reason for it. Poorly executed.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Jack Nicholson is Boston Irish. Maybe he is of Irish descent in reality - but he sure can't play it well.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Err, the State Police in central Boston? No - that's BPD's turf. They at least have to work with BPD.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Gangsters throw a captain of the State Police off a building and there are no fingerprints or other evidence available later.</li></ul><br/><br/>And now for the pointless time wasters: Obviously Scorsese is big enough and powerful enough that he can dictate cuts (or lack thereof) to the studio at this point. Unfortunately this leads to a self indulgent two and a half hour (felt like four hours) film and convoluted story telling <br/><br/><ul><li>The whole plot with the girl psychiatrist. What is this for? It serves absolutely *no* purpose in the film other than to make it longer and less believable. Even her pregnancy is left hanging. I really get the feeling they filmed a lot more but had to quickly cut to get the length down. This is why studios have editors. Let them do their jobs and cut the drivel from films and make them entertaining.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The whole setup in police academy. That's half an hour right there that should have been cut out of the film.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The stupid porno/hooker stuff with Nicholson. Pointless, plot irrelevant and simply unnecessary. Goodfellas managed to be a great film without that. Although there was one light moment when Jack implied he can't raise the titanic any more. Art imitates life I guess.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The OTT language. I'll believe it from gangsters but special investigators tend to be a bit more pro.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The sex scene was just silly</li></ul><br/><br/>Now let's throw in some bad casting/bad directing decisions: - Having Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio play the leading roles, both cops with crew cuts. They are both good actors but something should have been done to differentiate between the two in terms of physical appearance. These guys look too much alike in the opening sequences - waaay to confusing. This is solved later when DiCaprio starts to look more ragged.<br/><br/><ul><li>Whatever happened to the FBI angle? Why bother with it if it is unused? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Too many stars. They all demand face time which makes the film drag. It would have been better with some unknowns.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The whole secret cell phone deal was used how many times? Repetition plagued this film all the way through.</li></ul><br/><br/>OK - so you get it. The film has a plot full of holes and drags on for hours. It promises so much and delivers so little, which is why it deserves so few marks from me.<br/><br/>The one star, if I must give one, is for Alec Baldwin who is hilarious as one of the senior cops and steals every scene he is in. In a cast of stars that's a pretty neat trick."

The truth is that a person who has to curse to try and prove himself lacks the character and integrity to be a ""real"" man. Don't try and say that the characters in the movie are talking like cops in the real world do.

","I wasn't surprised when it won. The ""oh, he/she has never won, so we've got to give it to he/she"" has been VERY busy the last few years. Plus, I hadn't seen it. I was really looking forward to it. WOW!! This was bad in a number of ways, but mainly because this has to be the worst screenplay EVER to win any Oscar, never mind a best pic. How else was it bad? Casting Nicholson as a tough guy that would scare everyone else has always been a laugh. Nicholson is a little pisant. He wouldn't last a year in South Boston, never mind decades. Nicholson's games with hookers were pointless and just distracting. The woman shrink, whatever her name was, sleeping with both Damon and DiCaprio was ridiculous. Wahlberg (was that him? I hadn't known he was in the pic, and for a few minutes I thought Damon was playing two characters.), looked and sounded like a local village idiot in Charlestown. Truly, the entire police force, local, state and FBI couldn't have lit a 100 watt bulb. The idea that Nicholson's character wouldn't have fingered and killed DiCaprio's character quickly is also ridiculous. Let's see. Nicholson has, oh, a half-dozen henchmen, all of whom have been with him for YEARS, all of whom have KILLED for him. Then DiCaprio shows up. He is an EX-COP! Hicholson takes him in. About a year later, it becomes clear there is a rat in the group. Gee, who do we suspect? <br/><br/>Now here is one that gets a little tricky. I noticed the guy told DiCaprio to go to #314 instead of #344. The guy noticed that DiCaprio still showed up at #344. Now, we aren't sure if that guy was an undercover cop or not. The TV said he was. Nicholson doubted it. If the guy wasn't a rat, why didn't he tell his cohorts that DiCaprio was, ahem, suspicious. Gee you think?<br/><br/>Another reason it is so ridiculous he hadn't killed DiCaprio by then. When the TV fingers one of his guys as a rat, Nicholson won't believe it, though he knows there is one. This is like a ""which one doesn't belong in this group"" game for a 2 year old, but Nicholson failed it!<br/><br/>There were a few more crazy plot holes and foolish setups. It was hard to keep up with them. As for the almost everybody-gets-shot-in-the-head ending, don't get me started. There are too many inanities there to begin. At least Wahlberg's village idiot knows how to put on foot covers. Was that to hide the fact that he didn't know how to tie his shoes?<br/><br/>All in all, I understand why MS got the Oscar. The direction and acting was pretty good. But, giving this a Best Pic or voting it anything over a 6 is ridiculous."

","Oh my God.<br/><br/>I can say without overstatement that I just saw the most gripping and entertaining American film to come out in at least the past ten years.<br/><br/>I was lucky enough to get a pass to an advance screening of The Departed this past weekend in Boston. I wasn't sure what to expect and actually planned on being a little disappointed with all the expectations and hype of such an all-star cast.<br/><br/>From the moment the opening credits came up, the movie grabbed me by the neck, ripped me out of my seat and didn't let go until the final scene.<br/><br/>Each performance is more masterful than the next. Damon was a tour de force as the lead, tapping every ounce of his acting reservoir for this role. Nicholson creates another classic role to add to his already sterling resume. His mob boss would almost steal every scene he was in, if it not for every other actor being so fantastic However, the biggest surprise for me personally came from Leonardo DeCaprio.<br/><br/>Having never warmed up to any of his roles or movies, I found myself blown away by him in this. I'm not sure if it was the material he was given, or if DeCaprio has grown this much as an actor, or a combination of both, but he finally won me over with his role in this instant Scorsese classic. Every character is pitch perfect, every scene is right on the money. The plot builds to a crescendo of such dynamic proportions rarely seen on film. I don't want to give too much away, but I'm still shaken from the ride I was taken on.<br/><br/>People go to the movies in the hopes that maybe once in a hundred times you get to experience storytelling so masterful and transcendent that it changes the way you view cinema. This is one of those spectacularly perfect times.<br/><br/>Forget Taxi Driver. Forget Raging Bull. Forget Goodfellas. As much as I LOVE those movies and as much as they have affected me in my lifetime, The Departed will hands down be Martin Scorsese's Master Work."

Needless to say I was expecting a lot  more than I thought this director (of classics like Taxi Driver but lately of Gangs of New York) would deliver. I was very wrong.<br/><br/>Though the exact plot is unimportant, The Departed is about the blurred lines that distinguish good guy from bad guy, and cop from robber, in present-day Boston. With a packed cast (which I need not mention) that includes great supporting roles by Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin, the acting in the departed is stellar. Living-legend Jack Nicholson flawlessly delivers one of his best performances in years as the execrable mob boss Frank Costello. Nicholson's nuanced acting was so on-point that at times I felt like I was actually about to be shot by the slimy capo.<br/><br/>The Departed is nothing short of spectacular.

"marvin344","10","182","333","16 October 2006"," Don't compare with Infernal Affairs
","I went to see this film yesterday after reading all the wonderful comments along with some slightly bitter comments from people that have watched Infernal Affairs and were not entirely happy with Scorsese's take on the Hong Kong original.<br/><br/>The first comment I would like to make is that I saw the original Infernal Affairs a week ago meaning that it is still fresh in my memory. That film was a very complex thriller that got straight to the point. The Departed on the other hand focuses on story telling and whilst staying faithful to the original, it becomes its own film.<br/><br/>Scorsese has taken a great film and turned it into a masterpiece with breathtaking violence and superb character development. If fans were expecting a shot-for-shot remake, they obviously don't understand why Scorsese is regarded as one of the best directors of all time.<br/><br/>The acting of all the leads were legendary and they all looked very comfortable in their roles. Anyone out there who previously disregarded Leo DiCaprio as an actor will be totally converted as he delivered an astounding performance and showed a gritty side to his character. In fact, he was so good that Mr Nicholson didn't act him off the screen when they shared screen time together. Accolade also has to be heaped on Damon also as he came into his own as the sneaky but smooth rouge cop. Add Sheen, Whalberg, Baldwin and Winstone to the mix and you have the best cast assembled for a motion picture this year.<br/><br/>Offcourse no film is perfect (Although this comes close) but the only disappointing aspect of the film will be from the perspective of those that have seen the original. I am ultimately referring to the ending. Whilst anyone seeing this film for the first time will most probably embrace the climax, anyone that has seen the original will know what I mean.<br/><br/>That aside, this movie has marked its place alongside such classics as Goodfellas, Raging Bull and Scarface."
"Jay_Exiomo","10","158","287","4 October 2006"," A masterpiece right up Scorsese's alley
","Director Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed"", a gangster flick based from the Hong Kong thriller ""Internal Affairs"", goes without saying as perhaps his best work since ""Goodfellas."" Working on a genre that's right up his territory, Scorsese is back on top of his game and recreates a new dimension to the genre. This crime thriller treads the same theme as much of its director's previous films does. It's about two young men, the people around them, and the complications brought about by their characters' ambiguity.<br/><br/>Set in Boston, the Massachusetts State Police sends young cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) to go undercover and infiltrate an Irish mob syndicate where he quickly earns the trust of leader Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Meanwhile, Costello's informant Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon) works for the police department's Special Investigation Unit. Soon, stakes are raised when both the police and the mob realize there's a traitor among them, and that both Billy and Collin are both in danger of losing their cover and even their lives.<br/><br/>Nicholson, yet again playing another villain, owns every scene he's in with his portrayal of Costello, providing a paradoxical attraction to his menacing character. DiCaprio, increasingly maturing as an actor since becoming Scorsese's ""muse"", fits right in as the streetwise cop, while Damon brings his usual authoritatively calm demeanor to the part. They are complemented by the ensemble performances of Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg and Vera Farmiga.<br/><br/>Scriptwriter William Monahan (""Kingdom of Heaven"") retains much of the structure of ""Internal Affairs"" but adds depth to its characters and an acerbic quality to its witty dialog. The cinematography by Michael Ballhaus is brooding and morbid, capturing the character of its Boston setting while Howard Shore's score is as good as a soundtrack can be.<br/><br/>At its core, ""The Departed"" is a well-crafted, well-written, and well-acted film noir. In an age where style usually triumphs over the narrative quality, ""The Departed"" is one of the best films I have seen so far in recent memory."
"TheMovieDiorama","7","8","10","2 April 2018"," The Departed is Scorsese's most overrated film.
","Now now, before you go and comment, dislike and lambast my opinion, hear me out. This is by no means a bad film, in fact it's better than good. Yet, a ludicrous amount of film aficionados deem this as one the best films from the last decade. I'm afraid I strongly disagree. An amateur Boston cop infiltrates an American Irish gang by following the chief mobster. On the flipside, a criminal from the gang infiltrates the police department and reports the status of the investigation back to the head honcho. It's a vintage crime story that thematically conveys the power of trust. Scorsese is back to what he does best, crafting intricate mafia crime thrillers fuelled by rich character development. The arcs of the leading individuals are fully realised and are played out like a methodical game of chess. Motives are shrouded in mystery, minds are tainted by corrupted ideologies. Scorsese brings in an A-list cast comprising of Damon, DiCaprio and the ever reliable Nicholson who essentially chews up every scene like he is devouring a piece of tender chicken. Monahan's screenplay consistently brings out the gritty Boston upbringing of these characters. It's a harsh environment that lures you into this convoluted world filled with rats and tyranny. Wahlberg's sarcastic banter was a much required element to what is a tough exterior. My reasoning for not rating this excruciatingly high is the narrative structure. There are no surprises in this, it's a ""thriller"" that doesn't excite me. Purposefully indicating who the informants are in both parties at the beginning means a large duration of the film becomes predictably unexciting. It's only at its conclusion that it mistakingly tries to be enthralling by shooting people in the head (literally!). Lazily underwhelming, especially after 140 minutes of character development. The Boston accents also came across extremely heavily from certain actors, particularly Farmiga as she exclaims ""harrrrrdest!"". A well constructed crime drama that unfortunately is weighted down by a mechanical narrative."

"bob the moo","Null","37","61","7 November 2006"," Enjoyable thriller but there are failings and missed targets across the running time
","The war between the police and the organised crime in Boston has reached new heights. Both Oliver Queenan and target #1 Frank Costello have placed a mole into each other's organisations. Billy Costigan is selected to infiltrate Costello's ranks thanks to a family background of criminals and working men, meanwhile Colin Sullivan has been groomed since youth to come up inside the ranks of the BPD. As Costigan makes progress it becomes clear to his police superiors that they too have a rat feeding information outwards. With only Frank knowing Sullivan's identity and Queenan and Dignam knowing Costigan's, a race begins with the first one to expose the other winning.<br/><br/>Having enjoyed the original film, I was quite looking forward to this film and not really worried that Hollywood would mess it up. In a way it does deliver but it is hard to ignore the problems and failings in the film and if I didn't realise how IMDb put together their top 250 list, I would be amazed that the film is running so high up it. The original was a tight cop thriller which I remember thinking owed much to American cinema in style and tone, so surely America can only do it better? Well, if not better then this is certainly bigger, with stars oozing out of every pore, a big director and a long running time. In regards the latter, the film should be commended for moving slickly through the 150 minutes and not feeling as long as it is. The fact that it is cool, engaging and quite exciting will be enough for most audiences and indeed the sheer volume of positive votes on this site shows it has struck something of a chord, but this is not to say it is a classic and those putting it alongside Goodfellas are simply out of their trees.<br/><br/>The script here tries to give more room for growth to the characters, to explore their feelings outside of the tension and fear of their situation. Unfortunately this produces many scenes that are a bit dull and unconvincing as they attempt to deepen the material. Specifically I am talking about the thread involving the girlfriend, her scenes add little and the dialogue in the session scenes is obvious and, as a Sopranos viewer, I was surprised by this. A secondary downside of this (although not totally to blame) is that it is not as gripping and claustrophobic as I would have liked. Yes it is thrilling at times but I wanted it to be consistent like a real cat'n'mouse game with the noose tightening palatably around each character's neck as they raced to hang the other first. The ending is also a little less effective than it should be because, added to the original's strong ending is an extra scene that doesn't have a strong foundation and is not as good as it should have been.<br/><br/>Ironically for such a starry affair, some of the performances are a bit weak, and I'm thinking specifically of Damon. He never seems like the flipped version of Costigan and I never really got the feeling of him being trapped, panicked and hunted in the same way as his opposite number was. Conversely then DiCaprio is pretty strong and is convincing as he loses himself into Costello's gang of murderers. He works well alongside a scene-stealing Nicholson. At times he threatens to completely tip over into ham but for the most part he is just larger than life and provides a lot of energy to the film. This energy is harnessed well by director Scorsese who directs with this usual eye for a setup and also an enjoyable soundtrack. The use of sudden stops in the music and quick cuts is perhaps a bit much to get used to but it is strangely effective. The support cast is impressive in depth but they are not all that well used. Walhberg has all the best lines but it seems like he has wandered in from another movie at times and, funny as he was, he is never the developed and involved character that he needed to be for the way the narrative required. Baldwin is the same although he is more restrained and fits better, while Sheen is a nice touch of class. The woman playing the girlfriend is as weak as her material and although she did have an important part in the story, she adds very little beyond the writing on the page.<br/><br/>Overall though, this is a strong and professional film and it is a shame that it isn't as good as I wanted. The attempts to paint detailed and complex characters makes it interesting but not as convincing as it needed to be  with Damon in particular left out there with little to work with in comparison to DiCaprio. The moments of slick tension and action are very good though and the only downside was that it made me wish for more of the same and that Scorsese had focused on keeping it tight and taut in the same way that the superior original had."

"stephenftlauderdale","6","22","34","28 March 2007"," Doesn't deserve the ratings
","Sigh. After seeing the raving comments here for this film, I have to do a double take.<br/><br/>I watched it and enjoyed it, but it's just an average movie, with big stars and a famous director.<br/><br/>It's OK at best. Worth a watch, but not worth getting to excited about, which is why I think there is a reality distortion around the ratings here.<br/><br/>I think most people will watch this in 10 years and wonder what all the fuss was about. It's probably because this is the first film of this type that has been made successfully in a while, and so subconsciously we must be pretending it's going to make us feel warm inside like True Romance or Goodfellas; probably because most people haven't seen Internal Affairs and so the main plot is new to them; and probably because it bagged an Oscar and everyone figures it's hip to dance at the winning party.<br/><br/>Lets be clear, the original Internal Affairs worked because it left gaps, which helped get a sense that time had passed and you accepted that each of the main characters had gradually worked into their respective positions over many years.<br/><br/>This gave a sense of increasing tension as each of their relatively comfortable positions were made more vulnerable, when essentially, they were activated for the first time by each of their masters for the end game.<br/><br/>With this remake, it fails because they tried to fill those gaps with well known actors and then provided them with excess dialog to warrant their appearance; as a result the situations the protagonists find themselves in, feels forced.<br/><br/>If Costello was really the evil, guilt free gangster Nicholson was trying to portray, then frankly, he'd have had no hesitation taking Costigan outside to dance with a few bullets and put the doubt out of his mind once and for all.<br/><br/>It reminds me of another Scorsese film where an evil, guilt free gangster had a few doubts about his associates and did exactly that.<br/><br/>It felt real in that film, because, well, it was based on the real events and well... thats what evil, guilt free gangsters tend to do.<br/><br/>As for the Oscars, well, it says something I suppose. The Aviator was a better made film, both for Scorsese and DiCarprio who nailed Howard Hughes. They should have bunged it Scorsese's way then, now it just feels arbitrary and robbed Little Miss Sunshine of best picture, of which it most certainly is."

","""The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have Our contract celebrated."" Shakespeare, The Winter's tale<br/><br/>It's not Taxi Driver or even Goodfellas, but Martin Scorsese's Departed is one of the year's best films and one of his best, after his 2 or 3 indisputable classics such as Raging Bull. The director has assembled a first-rate cast, who, right down to Jack Nicholson as mobster kingpin Frank Costello, are having a great time nudging each other's performances toward excellence through collaboration.<br/><br/>Remade from a 2002 Hong Kong smash called Infernal Affairs, The Departed tells of moles within the Boston State Police Department and the South Boston Irish-American mob. When the director opens the film with Costello's brief narration and the Stones' Gimme Shelter for background music, we're in for a whole lot of no shelter for anyone and uncommon acting for everyone. <br/><br/>The set up is just complex enough to act as a metaphor for the nasty workings of the United Nations, Iraqi Assembly, and US Congress. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) willingly serves as a mole in the South Boston Irish-American mob for the State Police, while Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) does the same in the State Police for the mob.<br/><br/>Amongst the intertwining machinations of cell phones and lies is a triangle with those two operatives and a psychologist Madolyn (Vera Farmiga), as well played by the three as could be hoped for in such a trumped-up situation that provides little sexual payoff for audience voyeurs and many scratched heads for those who enjoy well-structured plots. This triangle is the only disappointment in a film layered expertly to show how intertwined crime and punishment can be in a world last laid bare by Clint Eastwood's Oscar-winning Mystic River (2003).<br/><br/>Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus and production designer Kristie Zea are winning collaborators with the director for a look that is authentic (I worked in South Boston for 3 years), crisp, and dark. But in the end the film belongs to the actors, chief among them DiCaprio as a young Scorsese acolyte showing the master's handiwork after 3 films with him. And Matt Damon has never been better in his hometown, as has fellow South Bostonian Mark Wahlberg in his role as a detective with a barbed tongue and equally sharp intuition.<br/><br/>Welcome back, Martin S. The Departed may not win you an Oscar, but it does guarantee you never will be ""departed"" from the pantheon of premiere American directors."

This isn't a Martin Scorsese film; this is a Saturday Night Live sendup of a Martin Scorsese film. This is the Academy saying, ""Well, we didn't give him one for Gangs of New York or for Good Fellas, and he's getting a little long in the tooth, after all. We'd better give him an Oscar for this before he croaks."" Is there anyone -- ANYONE??? -- in this film, with the possible exception of DiCaprio, who isn't acting following a major dose of Xanax? (Matt Damon evidently took his Xanax after a lobotomy that was so botched that he could no longer even change his facial expression.) And what's with Mark Wahlberg's HAIR??? Is there any redeeming social value in scene after scene (after scene) of heads exploding in a red cloud? Even Scorsese is bored with depicting violence; he does it because it's expected of him, not because he really gives a damn anymore. You're stupid enough to want it; he's jaded enough to give it to you. A plot line with more holes in it than the hull of The Titanic. Characters about as appealing as Jeffrey Dahmer. You can't care what happens to a single person in this film, and you can't even care that the moral center collapses about an hour in. This film isn't even sickening; it's just dull, dull-witted, and trashy. Scorsese got his Oscar out of sympathy; too bad the film doesn't have any for the viewer."
"dbborroughs","7","9","12","2 November 2006"," Good, but very familiar story of cops and robbers
","Remake of Infernal Affairs is not the second coming of the gangster film that some proclaimed it. It is a very good, if decidedly over long tale of cops battling robbers with moles on each side trying to remain hidden.<br/><br/>The plot is simple, a cop is sent undercover in the mob at the same time a crook works his way into the police force. Complicating matters is the fact that the bosses on both sides quickly realize that a rat is among and they begin the search to ferret out the mole.<br/><br/>The original Infernal Affairs is one of the better Hong Kong Films of the last ten years. Its a well told tale with some nice stylish twists. If the original has any flaws its that the film falls in love with itself in the second half and becomes a bit too showoffy. Thats not the case here, here the story has been refashioned and rethought into a gritty tale of Irish cops and robbers in Boston. Its different enough to discourage comparisons, which is a good thing in these days of shot for shot remakes.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese has fashioned a really good film. The cast is mostly excellent, with only Jack Nicholson ruining things with an occasional lapse into stereotypical ""Jackisms"". Leonardo DiCaprio has at last arrived as an actor and turns in an excellent performance as the cop gone deep undercover. His performance is sure to garner an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>I really liked this film but I didn't love it. The film carries a sense of having been down this road before, not because its a remake, as I said it different enough to rebuke comparison, rather its because it takes the gangster films of the past thirty years and compresses them together and has a very familiar feel. It reminded me of several other films about the Irish mobs, State of Grace in particular, so it didn't strike me as ground breaking the way The Godfather or Goodfellas did upon first seeing them.<br/><br/>My one real complaint with the film is that it takes too log to get where its going. Yes its tense and it keeps you on the edge of your seat but when it was over I felt as though I had been watching it for twice its length. A good movie should fly by and make you lose track of time. I was checking my watch through out much of the second half of this movie.<br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing, but I'm not sure you're going to love it, so much as you're going to like it.<br/><br/>7 out of 10."
"Tilyou1","1","43","75","7 December 2007"," Everyone shoots everyone. ooops I gave away the plot!
","Jack Nicholson does his impersonation of Rip Torn, Dicaprio and Damon are distinguished only because one of them (but which?) has some facial hair, and all of them and everyone else puts on a lousy ""Southie"" Boston accent so even the actors natively from there come across as fake. Except a few actors put on a fine Irish Brogue so you know they're Irish. Such entertainments are needed in this remarkably plot-free orgy of camp, grumbling, meaningless shootouts and poignant cell phone usage. I haven't counted to see if cell phones are used as often as guns, but no doubt a future thesis on the theme is lurking.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson at one point refers to the John Hancock building. That's a building in Boston. Wow, Nicholson was so in character he might have just winged that.<br/><br/>Everyone calls everyone else a rat, or an undercover, and sometimes they say things like ""He's undercover!,"" What undercover?"" ""No, he's my undercover."" Abbott and Costello more humorously expressed it: Who's rat's on first?<br/><br/>There's also authentic Hollywood crime lingo, like ""were you tailed"" (a play on rats perhaps).<br/><br/>Everyone informs on everyone else and in the end, everyone shoots everyone else, except one person who's character is so vague you can look him or her in the eye and not know who. ""I want my identity back,"" says one character, mysteriously. All of this highlights the key themes of the film, that everyone is everyone else, and in the end, only cell phones survive.<br/><br/>There's also a lot of looking in cell phones, presumably because to Hollywood types, even more than the rest of us, looking at cell phones is done often and always is a thrill. <br/><br/>This movie is a really good argument for having movies directed instead of run by mugging improvisers; alternatively a future film can dispense with actors entirely, and focus entirely on cell phones and computer screens.<br/><br/>However the City of Boston, played largely by itself, is convincing.<br/><br/>T"

","What a shame. Scorcese, the old one, lived in a world that worked differently than the world of most folks. His world has no God, no laws, no fate, no environment. His world is a world of characters who exude the world. If there are apparent laws, it is because of the force of people creating the space they project into. <br/><br/>He works in this way because its his heritage, an Italian legacy both in culture and film. And because it works. A filmmaker's job is to define a world in a film, ideally in the first few moments of a film. There are all sorts of ways to do this and the way we digest what we see has a lot to do with how it is served in this way.<br/><br/>One way, the way the old Scorcese used, was to invest wholly in bodies. Focus the camera completely on people, a few very, very strong people, and grow the world and a whole world system  usually based on simple ethics  around it. It means you have the latitude to develop some loud, apparently full characters, but it also carries disadvantages: we never can fold his movies into our lives. We can never overlap our world into his, because his doesn't exist.<br/><br/>He knows these limits. He's spoken of them privately, and in his last two films you could see him trying to outgrow the limits of the old Scorcese. With ""Gangs"" he reached far into space, defining places, a city, underground havens, mobs, the flow of rumors through society. He reached to groups. His camera flew, not as expertly as DePalma's but wildly compared to old filmmaker's which was tethered to single bodies. ""Gangs"" overreached and ran out of money, time and the patience of his patrons, so it was wrapped up with some explosive characters.<br/><br/>""Aviator"" showed us a new man. I hailed him as the best new filmmaker of that year. He drifted into the world, away from characters. He designated a watcher in Blanchett, something he has never done before, and he let he bring her tools of folded narrative to bear. It was film worth watching, his first one in my opinion.<br/><br/>And now we have the old fellow backsliding into his easy manner, his cheat. His way of delivering apparent power with no power. Yes, it is well put together. Yes, it has serious actors doing their bit without worrying about how it fits in the symphony. There is no grand design, just speechifying. Yes, the use of music is perhaps the most competent you will ever find.<br/><br/>But it is empty. Again.

","First of all, I must say this is THE worst Martin Scorsese movie I have ever seen. I usually like Scorsese's movie, but this one is the first one I have encounter that totally blow me away in its awfulness.<br/><br/>My first problem with The Departed is the casting. They got a bunch of baby-face fruitcakes like Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Anthony Anderson and Mark Wahlberg which totally throws the suspension of disbelief out of the window. It is like watching a bunch of boy scouts playing cops and robbers - None of them look like cops - more like boy scouts.<br/><br/>Secondly, the acting, is just wooden. There is no subtlety in the acting, and they try to cover that up by over-acting, and constant swearing. (Perhaps it is to make them look more ""mature"" for their part.) Now, about the plot, it is pretty thin, and confusing at times, lacks clarity or resolve. The several scenes made me cringe, particularly when Jack Nicholson tries to torture Leonardo DiCaprio, it just seems totally unbelievable after Jack Nicholson violently tortured DiCaprio and he trusted him AGAIN!! <br/><br/>Now, about Matt Damon's acting in this movie, it is pretty god damn bad. In fact, what acting!!?? Matt Damon just doesn't emote at all!! He is as souless and as wooden as a robot. It is extremely wooden as if he is the living proof that Pinocchio exist!<br/><br/>Leonardo's acting is more of his usual self, pretty boy in distress with endless whinings to anyone who would lend his ears to him - but in this movie, he seems particularly out of place. The character development lacks subtle internal conflicts presented in the original character so involving and multi-dimensional.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson is just his usual sly scoundrel self. Totally uninspiring acting. Same goes with Martin Sheen's super stiff acting. Anthony Anderson is totally mis-casted in this movie as if he is a comic relief (and yet there is nothing comic about it)<br/><br/>The character development and inter-character dynamics are almost non-existent between the two rivaling characters (Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon) it is as if they are in two separate movies. The movie not only lacks any subtlety but blatantly plays up the caricatures of what we perceived as ""mafia"" - loud mouth constantly swearing goons - it is both extremely cliché and uninteresting.<br/><br/>The plot is also pretty confusing due to extremely bad direction, it lacks focus, and the camera work is also chaotic and uninteresting."

This was a world first...i have seen other bad movies in my life...however this one actually made me feel emotions of anger / disappointment / disillusionment all at once. I fully understand that readers would be asking 'why..o why' have u condemned such a, and a quote 'Film of the Year' (LOL).

OVERALL STORYLINE...<br/><br/>15 minutes into the movie it was clear what was going to happen...<br/><br/>Matt Damon was a snitch....Leo DiCaprio was a snitch....the ONLY thing we the viewer now needed to see was exactly how all involved parties (Nicholson, FBI, Cops, other miss. randoms) were going to find out and consequently act about it..You may wish to argue against me...however look into your hearts...you know what i say is true...and hence you must realize the stupidity of such a movie...<br/><br/>2. ELEVATOR SCENE LOL - Quite possibly the worst scene of any movie, of any form, of any generation. NOT and over dramatization. OK, i do understand that it was necessary in the overall storyline for those people to die...but really...4 people getting shot in the head.....LOL..people were laughing in the cinema...in this what Scorcese wanted?? The only thing achieved by that God forsaken scene was a 'novelty' effect created by 4 exactly similar gun shot...blood splatter..etc...at the conclusion of the scene i began to day dream that possibly it might be better if i was number 5...ready and willing to get shot in the head, ultimately putting myself out of the misery which was 'The Departed'.<br/><br/>3. Mark Walhberg His stint in this movie is laughable..i really am laughing at this very moment...He plays a tough talking cop....lol...arguably promoting as a main character in the film...HOWEVER has NO (0) relevance in the film whatsoever...EXCEPT for KILLING damon at the very end???<br/><br/>4. Look, readers of this website...their really are to many things i hate about this movie to continue...Di Caprio / storyline / people in the cinema laughing about ridiculous Nicholson antics (such as patting a dog??? (is that funny or are people just stupid??)??.

Leonardo Di Caprio was pretty good in his role though I must admit that i was more 'attached' to Tony Leung. Overall, I find that The departed is just a remake of Infernal Affair: it didn't really add up much. SPOILER: i really hate the The Departed ending. Why did they end it like that? They should have stuck to the same ending as Infernal Affair.

That's this film.<br/><br/>It plays out like a slick mystery novel - everything revolves around the narrative and everything happens to conveniently fit perfectly in place. <br/><br/>While this isn't bad necessarily it comes at the expense of the characters being more interesting. Even with the all star cast line up it doesn't do much to give anything more than a cardboard cut out for the characters. <br/><br/>How this won an academy award is certainly a wonder. Either the competition that year was terrible, or the judges simply looked at the names in the credit roll and felt like in order to keep their jobs they had to vote for it. <br/><br/>The movie opens up laboriously slow trying to give you a background and history of the main characters, but what it fails to do is make you feel connected to the characters - it comes off slow and trite. It's just too forced and almost feels like a soap opera for the first 15-2 minutes.<br/><br/>The major low in the film is when Billy somehow is supposed to fall in love with Madolyn and vice versa. The movie makes about as much effort to sell you on it as a bad porno. IE: Therapist girl gives one session with Billy, kicks him out. And then somehow a few scenes later they're knocking boots. It was just so terribly unrealistic or believable, but then again most other things in this film are. Now film works by the viewers suspending but this film just fails to really engage the viewer with the characters which would then allow you to suspend belief.

","OK. First off, I'm glad to see that ""The Departed"" has as many detractors as it has admirers. My objections to it, for the most part, have been filled in by other users. Therefore, I'll keep it brief. The movie's characters, just like its gushing audiences,seem to suffer from attention deficit disorder. As if they've never read a book in their lives. And it appears as if Scorcese had that in mind, knowing fully well in advance that the film would appeal to people who seemingly have no problem with the F word being uttered every twelve seconds--whether it's in the movies, or in their actual,everyday pedestrian conversations. Which, I've found to be a problem with those who, quite simply,did not stay in school long enough. And who would believe-- even for a second--that two members of the Boston P.D.(played by Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg) would engage in banter graphically describing how each of them had sex with the other guy's mother--at a meeting where the bulk of the attendees consists of top- level Federal Agents?. What are these guys--in the 8th Grade? If I held that position in real life ( FBI,CIA,etc. ),I--while walking out on the two of them-- would look both in the eye and let them know what slobs they are.<br/><br/>Finally, to switch gears, I guess nobody thought the film went awry when Leo DiCaprio has apparently no trouble beating the hell out of two grown men from the Rhode Island branch of the Cosa Nostra (man, that's some muscle that got sent in from Providence, huh?). All of it punctuated by the unnecessary--not to mention perfunctory-- accompaniment of The Human Beinz ""Nobody But Me"". And later, when one of Nicholson's men is being interrogated, we are treated to about six and a half seconds of ""Sail On Sailor"". If you're anything like me, when you think grueling questioning, you think... Beach Boys. And don't get me started on the fact that this is an Oscar winning film, the last ten minutes of which consist of not one...not two... not three...but four-count 'em-- men getting a bullet through his brain. Lovely.Just like the conclusion of ""Babe"", where the talking pig wins the Sheepdog Contest. Guaranteed... when you're at some guy's house/apartment--and you don't see any bookcases--that if the subject of this film comes up, he'll tell you just how terrific it was.

","I didn't know who directed the movie until the credits when the name Scorsese popped up, so I saw the movie without any expectations. I must say I wasn't very impressed. First off the infiltration of Costigan into Costello's gang happened way too fast and wasn't very convincing, just like the infiltration of Leo's character in Gangs of New York. Mark Wahlberg's character Dignam felt really fake, the kind of language he used was not very likely to be used by someone in his position, same goes for Baldwin's character capt. Ellerby. The love triangle drama was just pathetic, why would she date some ex con with drug problems when she's already moving in with Sullivan, a career cop who climbs the latter in the department like a sky rocket (i.e. very unlikely). They tried to portrait Costello as this big time mobster but the way he handled business felt more like a small time gangster, stealing pocket change from some corner shop.<br/><br/>I haven't seen the original Infernal Affairs so I can't say weather or not this was worse, but I would really think so. The only part that surprised me positively was in the end when the other mull showed up and blew Costigans brains out, I didn't expect that one. That kind of woke me up, too bad it was just before the credits."

The characters in the original are captivating. The characters in the remake seems shallow and pointless.

","With out Siu Fai Mak, this film would never have happened - even from Martin Scorsese. It is evident that Hollywood has completely run dry of new ideas and is seeking great films from Asian nations to make money - e.g. 'The Ring'. After years of great original gangster films from Scorsese, I am disappointed. A setting in Boston, is the only original item of this film. For those unfamiliar with Siu Fai Mak, I deeply encourage you to watch 'Mou Gaan Dou' ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338564/ ) aka 'Infernal Affairs' - the basis for this film. Infernal Affairs contains far more intense drama and (if not better) an equally high quality acting roster than this remake.

","I am a fan of Martin Scorsese but this movie sucks. This movie is a remake of a Hong Kong movie called ""Internal Affairs."" If you have never seen the original, then please do so because you will definitely appreciate how well the original was as opposed to this crap made by Scorsese.<br/><br/>Why do I hate ""Departed?"" First, Scorsese was an idiot putting Jack Nicholson as the crime boss because he is going to steal the whole damn movie. Nicholson is that talented. Plus, Scorsese gave too much part to the crime boss character. He should have been a tangential character with the real crux of the movie focused on Matt Damon and Di Caprio.<br/><br/>Second, Matt Damon's character was too one dimensional or there was no real complexity to his character. He was simply bad. In Internal Affairs, the bad cop was more complex. In that movie, you see a cop becoming annoyed by the crime boss who he sees as a threat to his future.<br/><br/>Third, there was more violence and sex in this movie than in Internal Affairs and I love gratuitous violence and sex in a movie so long as it is done properly. Scorsese just injected more sex and violence to cover up his terrible script adaption of an excellent film.<br/><br/>Fourth, the dialog was fine but again, it lacks intelligent discourse among the principal characters so I cannot say it was great writing. It was simply mediocre at best.<br/><br/>Fifth, and primary reason I hate this movie is that there is no real TENSION between the characters. Oh sure, Damon character wants to kill Di Caprio and vice a versa but there has to more to this than that. In the original, there was interaction between the bad cop and good cop, but you see that the bad cop is not so truly bad and therefore, the audience is torn. What I am trying to say is that there was a subtle buildup to the real tension in that movie which makes you really appreciative of the quality of that movie as oppose to this crap.<br/><br/>That being said, if you have never seen Internal Affairs, then you will like this movie. But if you are like myself and some others who have seen it and have seen this movie as well, then you will be disappointed. In fact, for those who decide to rent Internal Affairs, I can almost guarantee that you will like Internal Affairs much more than Departed. You will like Internal Affairs so much more that you will see what a junk Departed really is."

","I know that it is not difficult to say that in every remake's case, but this one really got my hopes high. Unfortunately, it wasn't the case this time. Don't get me wrong, the movie is still great, it just falls below expectation. Yes, Di Caprio is great for the first time (he was good in some movies before, but here he is just superb). Nicholoson - is over the top, being 69 years old he is still much more charismatic and believable than his young rivals. The rest of the cast is just good, no flaws.<br/><br/>Whenever they tried to stick to the original - everything worked great. For some unfortunate reason they decided to over-complicate already sophisticated screenplay - and spoiled it. There are some unnecessary characters creating the mess, some FBI storyline in the movie that only God knows what that was intended for. And also the ending - I do not know, ending in the Hong-Kong movie was reasonable and understandable, here it is basically the same - but messy. In the original all of the characters had very clear reasons for everything they did, and they lost it here.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with that one is that in the original neither one of the main 2 characters was either complete bastard or saint - and here they actually made it black and white.<br/><br/>And no, don't forget about Taxi Driver:) this one is very good (especially if you have not seen the original), but not great."

","The director practically gutted the original story. This is classic Hollywood doings. I've never seen a worse adaptation from an original movie. They basically added more sex scenes and cut out all the meaningful parts of the original stories, made the story choppy and hard to follow, then stick a couple of big names to draw the audience. <br/><br/>The original Hong Kong movie Infernal Affairs has a solid character development. Infernal Affairs also used more intelligent ways of communication between the undercover and the source, making you sit at the edge of your seat. Aside from much stronger story lines, it also portrayed mental health workers in a much more professional manner...the psychiatrist in the Departed would've had her license taken away in a snap as there are strict laws prohibiting dual relationships. Just like all meaningless mainstream movies, as if putting in a sex scene and showing some flesh would make up for the horrid chopped up story. The original made the psychiatrist-patient relationship more real and tapped into the inner workings of the psychiatrist working with an undercover. If you are looking for a truly well written screenplay with deep emotional plots, go watch the original Infernal Affairs instead!"

","Oh dear, it's Scorsese does Tarantino with some Goodfellas thrown into the mix (even down to using the Human Beanz - Nobody But Me for a fight in a shop). The first third of the film is excellent, despite the constant sound of the Rolling Stones - Gimme Shelter every five minutes, but then it goes downhill fast. The basic premise of a cop infiltrating the Irish mob and a mobster infiltrating the cops is good, but soon so many other things are thrown into the plot it becomes a farce. Why make Costello am FBI informer? Pointless, other than maybe to give Matt Damon a reason to kill him, although it would have been a thousand times more interesting if Damon's reason was Nicholson's dismissive treatment of him since a teenager. Why did Matt Damon's character have so much power to do as he liked in the force after only joining a few months back, able even to call a surveillance of Sheen police chief? Stupid. How come Damon didn't figure out immediately that Dicaprio's character used his phone at the meet with the Chinese? He knew the whole of Nicholson's crew apart from Costigan, but Scorsese just needed to drag the film out for another hour. Why was Baldwin's character camping it up like a pantomime dame all over the screen? The acting from Baldwin was so bad it made me think he was play acting for Damon's character and actually new he was a mole, but he didn't, Baldwin just can't act. The mess of shootings at the ending wasn't a twist either it was very dull 'ho hum' and 'so what' and i had lost interest half an hour earlier when Nicholson exited the film. After the first hour this film is silly, contrived and with no clever plot twists at all but just pointless adding of layer on layer of meaningless guff. If someone tells you this is an intricate and well plotted film, don't believe them, point them in the direction of The Usual Suspects."

","American remake of the successful ""Internal Affairs"" trilogy, about two men seeking out each other's identity; one is a cop that goes undercover as a mobster, the other, a mobster that goes undercover as a cop. Dream-boats Damon and DiCaprio do a good job vanishing into their roles as tough guys, but their charm and ruthlessness still can't mask the crime-thriller clichés; and the ultra-climatic conclusion is just really nothing more than simply over-the-top. The wittiness of Jack Nicholson doesn't impress since he doesn't seem to do much acting, but rather just charismatically act like Jack. The quirky dialogue of Irish-American mobsters comes off as corny and tiring. Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg are memorable and well-delivered in the humorous good-cop-bad-cop odd-couple, with the latter earning a Best Supporting Actor nomination.

","I am not saying that I think this movie is in the category with other Scorcese greats such as ""Raging Bull"" and ""Taxi Driver"", actually ""King of Comedy"" is my favorite Scorcese film, however ""The Departed"" is a relatively remarkable film!! The acting in this movie is simply incredible!! The plethora of acting talent simply overwhelms you!! Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Jack Nicholson, Leonardo Di Caprio, and of course Matt Damon!! I thought Matt Damon's performance was the best acting performance in this movie!! The comment he made which I found to be very interesting was ""The Irish are impervious to psycho-analysis"".. I went to grade school at an Irish parish, and even though they were affluent, they did seem more visceral than many other ethnic groups are!! Boston is the only city in the country where the Irsih control the syndicate. The Italians are accustomed to ruling organized crime in virtually every other city in the United States. Boston is where the movie ""The Departed"" takes place.. The F word replaced a lot of semantics in this movie, and the violence seemed to have some kind of tenet of amelioration attached to it!! ""The Departed"" won for best picture in '2006, as it would appear as though the copious quantity of top notch talent in this film would almost mandate such an accolade!! How were all the problems in this movie solved?...WITH A GUN!! The violence in ""The Departed"" was almost satirical, as it signified a precarious set of checks and balances!! Everyone's anger seemed to reflect a sordid and justifiable pontification for everything!! Many techniques of agitation and vindictiveness with this movie told the movie audience one thing- This is a Scorcese film!! His style emanates a proverbial belligerence through frustration that he has incorporated in so many of his past movies!!

","OK....I'm preparing for my death on these message boards but here goes... <br/><br/>Am I really the only one that thought this film was incredibly overrated and definitely not one of Scorsese's best? I'm sorry, but I've seen it 3 times, each time praying I will somehow see the ""amazing Oscar-winning-film"" that everyone rants and raves about but no: I see a somewhat waste of an amazing cast, a crappy script, and Scorsese after having a little too much sex with Hollywood. NOW before you murder me, please read some of my reasons below: <br/><br/>The Script: was ridiculous at times. Some of the dialogue was almost unbearably fake to me, and at times laughable (especially with DiCaprio). <br/><br/>Cinematography: was amazing at points, but by the 100th ""zoom-in-really-quick-on-a- character-when-they're-talking"" I was bored of it. <br/><br/>DiCaprio: was unoriginal....point blank. It doesn't take much to be an aggravated, obnoxious, and mean little goatee-ed man who is hooting and hollering all of the time, a role that seems to be DiCaprio's favorite type. As much as I respect Leo shedding his pretty boy skin and doing ACTUAL roles, I'm getting pretty sick of the same character he plays in every film. <br/><br/>The Story: was incredibly unbalanced. There were a few choice scenes that would fall in the ""Brilliant"" category for me, but a good 60% of the film was nothing more than mediocre. <br/><br/>The Ending/last shot: was stupid. How much skill and creativity does it take to kill everyone in your cast? NONE. It was an easy cop-out. And let me be the one to say that the last shot was comedic. ""GABEGOMEZ4, YOU DON'T GET THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RAT AND THAT SHOT!!! YOU'RE SUCH AN AMATEUR WHO IS BLIND TO EVERYTHING GENIUS ABOUT THE ENDING!!!!"" is what I'm sure all of you are thinking/typing as we speak but please...it doesn't take a *beep* rocket-scientist to get the symbolism of a god damned rat. <br/><br/>Scorsese's talent: was missing in this film. His true talent and love for the film was simply un-evident in The Departed. I miss the Meanstreets' Scorsese, and the Goodfellas' Marty. Personally I feel that it was slightly disrespectful to Scorsese to give him the statue for this film. The academy was basically saying ""Hey, sorry about the past and overlooking your works-of-genius, but since you made a bloody Irish-mob film with some of the most talented actors in the business never mind how mediocre it was, we'll give this one to you!"" Please....Scorsese, please go back to your roots. <br/><br/>Look don't get me wrong, I don't think this film is terrible. It has fantastic parts, and you can't really go wrong with Matt Damon. In reality, I'd give it a solid 7. But given the circumstances, I feel the need to call it out on it's faults. <br/><br/>Thanks for reading and remember, it's just an opinion."
"OrrinBob","6","6","8","3 January 2014"," Ridiculously overrated.
","Maybe it deserves a 7. It is quite to very suspenseful, with a valuably complex but not arcane plot, well-made, solidly acted (meaning in part that Jack Nicholson does not just re-enact his job as the Joker. DiCaprio was better in Blood Diamond.) The cast is indeed stunning.<br/><br/>But right now it is ranked above such trivial fare as Citizen Kane, The Shining, North by Northwest, M, Vertigo, To Kill a Mockingbird, Eternal Sunshine, Bicycle Thieves...(citing only a few whose lower ranks make me want to vomit). I know I am beating a dead horse. It probably is, after all, better than Shawshank (dumb fanboy movie of the world, I guess), Cuckoo's Nest, Inception, Forrest Gump, and arguably 5 to 15 others in the top 46.<br/><br/>But it has limited to no imagination and makes no contribution to film history. Its best picture Oscar should've gone to Pan's Labyrinth, or Volver, or conceivably The Lives of Others, or Letters from Iwo Jima, or Little Miss Sunshine--three to five other films to rank ahead of Departed. I haven't yet seen Infernal Affairs, so I can't make that comparison. But in a nutshell, I know Taxi Driver and Departed is no Taxi Driver (#68. Makes me nuts.)"

Despite such compelling material, Scorsese only skims the surface, opting for gloss instead of substance, adding confusing sub-plots that serve mainly to hook the audience. These sub-plots destroy the momentum of the film and pull the whole thing off the tracks. Without these (no spoilers), the film may have had a chance. Scorsese's trademark violence stingers are now overripe at best. Am I the only one who started to yawn when people were getting pounded over a loud soundtrack in ""Casino""? I doubt it...<br/><br/>There is some pretty silly ensemble work here, too - we're not talking ""Glenngary Glen Ross"" or ""The Usual Suspects"" here by any stretch. Most of the bad highlights usually involve Wahlberg's profane fool of a character. Overall, the individual characterizations seem to be either shrill, as in the case of the annoying Wahlberg and chest-thumping Damon, or flat, like Sheen's police captain. Nicholson's Whitey Bulger take is completely lacking in menace - it's amusing, if nothing else. Only DiCaprio's brooding Billy Costigan stands out, but he's got nowhere to go, both literally and figuratively - the sub-plots basically turn his character to face the wall... <br/><br/>Much has been made of the ending here, but I would describe it with one word - ""cowardly"".

As it is, he fails to suspect anyone at all.<br/><br/>OK, so it was purely a money-making enterprise, and succeeded in that, but please; why could they not have fleeced their customers with a little good humour? Avoid this film like the plague - it's on cheap channel reruns at the moment (Aug 2012), and it is disgracefully badly written, poorly acted, and sloppily directed.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you want to hear Dvorak's 'New World' (you know, the 'Hovis' ad) played on the bagpipes, which I am asked to believe is what the Boston Police play at all their funerals, fast forward to the end.

","So very glad not to have spent money on this film in a cinema, but watched it only on TV. I do wish that some of today's directors and actors would immerse themselves in an intense examination of some of the Hollywood and British movies of the 1940s and 1950s to see how really to make films that are crisp and tight in direction, how the actors of those times were able to speak their lines in clear and understandable English, and that self-indulgent acts (actors) like Jack Nicholson simply were not given the time of day.<br/><br/>As for this film, far too much of it was devoted to scene after scene of interminable length, simply so that the director and actors could show off their alleged ""skills"". That was, instead of the director getting hold of the central storyline - potentially, quite good - and his actors by the scruff of the neck and stating quite clearly: okay, guys, let's really get on with this and concentrate on the core essentials of the story in as tight a manner as possible.<br/><br/>Instead, the whole film went on and on in a cumulative exercise of screaming tedium.

I don't believe the screen play writer hadn't watched the original Infernal Affairs while writing the Departed screen play. I am sure everybody in the cast and of course the writer and Director had watched the Original for at least 10 times if not 100 times. The actors delivered the same exact emotions and writer and director just Americanized the story. Add some sex scene. Add few sub plots not related to the story and a happy resolution in the ending. Come on guys you can be a little more creative with 90 Million dollars budget. The other sad thing is how films are sold and marketed using actor names and not the story line. Infernal Affairs and Departed are great example of this. The Original Infernal Affairs when screened in US just made $89.6K, because in US there are very few people that watch anything made outside Hollywood.

"ClaytonDavis","9","30","58","27 September 2006"," Scorsese's Best since ""Goodfellas""
","I'm very glad to say that this is his best achievement since ""Goodfellas"" and the best of his career. ""The Departed"" is a remake of the Hong-Kong film ""Infernal Affairs"" which tells the story of two men, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) whom are on two opposites sides of the law and seem to have their lives revolving around one of the most notorious gangsters, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy comes from a family of mafia lords and crime smugglers however, seems to find his way into the honorable profession of law enforcement and wanting to make a difference. After his graduation from the academy, he is made an offer that involves getting entangled with the roots of his family and becoming the one thing he swore to fight against. <br/><br/>He is discharged from the police and serves a one-year prison sentence and upon his departure, join the crowd of Costello made up of scandalous thugs and convicts, in order to gain information and evidence to convict the felon. But Costello has some tricks up his sleeve and his infamous nature is guarded by the inside of the commandment. Many years prior to Billy's infiltration, Costello befriends a young boy and makes him his own personal messenger and protégé, Colin Sullivan. Colin is well trained and Frank convinces him to join the Boston State Police as his source of crime and information. He tips Frank off for police operations while quickly moving his way up the ladder of success in the department. <br/><br/>The two men accept their tasks and we are thrown into the ultimate story of corruption, deceit and loyalty. Billy Costigan is the most complex character thanks to the powerful performance by Leonardo DiCaprio. Billy has his own personal demons and is in constant battle within himself from his crimes with Costello to his loss of humanization. Billy seems to lose himself in the film and is in long search of redemption of his misdemeanors. DiCaprio is truly a gifted and talented actor and continues to show us that he isn't the same boy/heartthrob from ""Titanic,"" his ""Billy"" is perplexing and utterly haunting. DiCaprio's performance is the best of the cast but I'm afraid the role doesn't garner the much ""Oscar scene"" to gather true awards attention. He does have some powerful clips although, they're a part of an action flick that few actors can seem to find their way out of and onto a short list called the Best Actor race. The film would need to be a unanimous hit for him to pull off nomination #3. His Boston accent is great and the fury that he finds in his character is remarkable. I just don't feel his character can be appreciated and admired the way it should be. <br/><br/>Matt Damon has been trying to show us a different part of him each time. Colin is the most hated man of the film, hands down. From his manipulation of the law to his constant deceit and betrayal of his peers, Damon truly finds his character's axis. Colin Sullivan is greedy in power, arrogant in thoughts, and degrading in aura. The powerful and well put together screenplay elevates what could have been a very typical story and turns it into an action genre with slices of drama sequences that some films could only dream to be. The pace of the film is just right with all the right decisions being made. Scorsese builds scenes with so much suspense that it's terribly hard not to become knotted in the film and be at the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>Jack, I believe is on his way to another nomination. Frank Costello is one of the most malevolent, immoral, sinful men of recent film history. Jack is the man and while he deserves the acclaim that he hopefully will receive for the role, he is in no way walking to the podium to accept a fourth Oscar. Even though he does many wicked things in the film, you start to admire the spirit and reputation of Frank Costello. He is the best put together player, head to toe, from his monologues about his past to his devilish humor; he chews scenery so well that he bleeds out the screen. There is no real reason to reiterate how great Jack is but it is great to see those sunglasses at the Kodak Theater from time to time. <br/><br/>While the film is jammed packed with suspense and thrills, there is a huge flaw that befalls the film and it's its extremely weak ending. The film builds you up to a climax you cannot wait to see and experience but unfortunately, the end result is rather dull, flat and bland. While it didn't destroy the film entirely, it did enough damage to not make it a cinematic gem. Also, the entrance of Vera Farmiga's character as Madeleine, the police authority psychiatrist who starts to date Colin and ends up webbed in a love triangle with Billy is rather forced and unneeded. It's a bit too cheesy to suffice and the dramatic elements were enough without bringing in a tedious romance. <br/><br/>What are ""The Departed"" chances for the upcoming awards season? I'll say Jack Nicholson for supporting, the three-person writing team in the adapted screenplay category and a few technical nominations including sound, sound editing, editing and Howard Shore's potent score. Scorsese could find a spot in the Director's five but the film is too ""something"" and I can't think of what it is yet but whatever it is there's an overabundance. The Globes will probably snap at the film because it's very reminiscent of Scorsese's previous works like ""Goodfellas"" and ""Gangs of New York"" but there's no Weinstein's to truly get it out there and appreciated. <br/><br/>The film rips at you from inside and leaves a lucid impingement for all areas to be felt."

","Yesterday I've seen a Nicholas Cage movie where after a lot of tension, he ends up in a... wicker cage - no pun intended - and... dies. Now this movie... America, what's happening? Listen, I'm Romanian and I keep blasting from the mike in a radio station where I work that Romanian movies suck because most of them lack morals and happy endings. The result is - people are despondent and try to get the heck out of Romania (even though we're all A LOT better off than when the dictator Ceaushescu lived). Movies and art in general should give people hope and a moral answer to the problems of life. Don't be deceived: the human intellect is becoming what it's feeding upon. You cannot watch something dirty and remain untainted, clean and pure! It seems to me that mindless, irresponsible individuals literally sell their souls to the devil in order to spread the moral decay and stupid pride that has been the fall of ALL the empires of the world. Which brings me to the title I gave these lines. America is filling her cup. God is looking at his watch. One day He'll say: ""Well, nothing good is ever going to come out of this one."" And the credits will roll as in a movie. I admire the great achievements of the American people, but you guys should get up and say: ""We are a Christian people. Here: It's written on the dollar bill. Let's show Mr. Scorsese that he has got to earn these bills by cleaning up the foul language, the blood and the repulsive subjects he drools over!"" Guys, I love America, but it's painful to see that her people are getting away from God as time goes by. Here in Romania they want the Orthodox Church be the first and last of our beliefs. Yeah, yeah, we have rights... but they put icons in schools and they want Protestants such as myself to feel it's OK... well, it's not OK! No religion in schools! Why don't they kick Darwin with his theory of evolution from schools, since they are so Christianly-oriented? I mean we were created after God's own image, right? Or... we evolved? This ought to be a dilemma... If God let us EVOLVE into His own image, why doesn't the Bible state this? Anyway, if we get back to our horror of a movie, it seems Hollywood thinks happy endings are obsolete. ""We must give the people's minds something new to feed upon. WHAT IF I just die? What if the order of things is: YOU CAN'T WIN?"" Sounds familiar? What keeps the people from killing themselves... ""but that the dread of something after death..."" as the Scorsese of the late 16th and early 17th century put it?<br/><br/>Who needs this kind of ""food"", people? Can you put it in front of your children? It's not good for their mind? What makes YOUR mind impermeable to violence, foul language and pornography?

","Cocky Boston police detective with the Special Investigations Unit--who, as a young man, was mentored by a drug kingpin, an overgrown thug who is still making everyone shake in the old neighborhood--is still in-cahoots with this mob boss and attempts to ferret out the police cadet whose job it was to infiltrate the bad guys' circle and get hired on. In turn, the cadet--who is frustrated by his lack of identity--must find the spy on the police force who is playing both sides. Big Oscar winner from director Martin Scorsese is an Americanization of Hong Kong's ""Mou gaan dou"" from 2002. It is also very typical of this particular filmmaker: flashy, fast-moving, repugnant and yet reveling in its nastiness--to the point where one nearly feels the rampant ugliness and constant homophobia gets the director's seal of approval. As the undercover cop, Leonardo DiCaprio does some of his finest work yet; although he can't do much with the man-woman stuff involving a perplexing Public Service psychiatrist, DiCaprio is convincingly rough in a very difficult role to pull off. As the bad detective, Matt Damon is also first-rate, bravely playing a real pr*ck while giving the picture a smug swagger that suits the narrative well (I would have preferred more about this character's loss of morals however, which happens entirely off-camera). As the drug-lord, Jack Nicholson performs without vanity and slithers through the movie like a smiling cobra; his unpredictability as an actor is tailor-made for this role, and Scorsese is careful not to overload the screen with Jack (we get just enough of him, although one sequence in a porno theater goes over-the-top). ""The Departed"" isn't particularly shrewd, and it is not Scorsese's best work, but the linear structure of the complicated plot is nearly free of static and has many gripping scenes. **1/2 from ****"

"show_pony","4","12","20","16 October 2006"," Like comparing a brick with a samurai sword
","Would I have rated this film higher if I had not seen the HK original ""Infernal Affairs""? Probably - but when you have, it's like comparing a brick with a samurai sword.<br/><br/>Set in the gritty underbelly of Boston, ""The Departed"" is a story of two men working undercover on opposites sides of the law. DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan, a graduate State Trooper handpicked by Cpt Queenan (Martin Sheen) to infiltrate crime boss Frank Costello's (the manic Jack Nicholson) milk-bar raidin', computer-chip and drug dealin' ""organisation"" of what appears to be about 5 or 6 thugs. The sixth or maybe seventh guy in the gang is Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), whom Costello has groomed in his own image since childhood (stricly in a criminal sense - two Jack Nicholsons running your neighbourhood would be too scary. Unless the other Jack was only 1/8th the size (MiniJack), in which case it would be quite sad/funny. Together they would turn away from their life of crime to star in their own music video about building castles in the skywell, in either case, there goes the neighbourhood), to be his mole on the force.<br/><br/>The ingredients are there for a tense and thrilling cops n robbers drama. Instead, The Departed ends up as a blunt, violent film with comedy where's it's not intended. Its main problem is an utter lack of finesse. Mak Siu Fai's screenplay led you to see for yourself the increasing sense of frustration, isolation and fear of the good cop (played superbly by the excellent Tony Leung) - much like Nicholas Cage's tormented good guy trapped in a bad guy's body in Face Off. Scorsese meanwhile, needed DiCaprio to literally yell and whinge about how frustrated, isolated and fearful he felt, because if he didn't, I would've missed it. I mean, what loneliness? What isolation? If ever he felt the onset of undercover angst, he had the comfort of jumping in the sack with Damon's girlfreud or going to Cpt Queenan's house for supper and a chat - try working in a cubicle 8 hours a day. Sure, the prospect being found out as a spy is pretty rough, but if your boss is Jack Nicholson, he's just as likely to grind you into mincemeat for spilling coffee on his tie.<br/><br/>Subtlety is a dying art. Case in point is a scene where the bad cop shows off his policing chops by conning a crook into giving up his associates. When confronted with the impasse in IA, Andy Lau walks into the the room without missing a beat. Calmly, coolly, smoothly, he feeds the guy a line or two and then hook and sinker as well. In TD, when confronted with the same uncooperative thug, Damon looks a little confounded, but lo and behold! He spies with his little eye a mysterious briefcase belonging to no one that just so happens to be lying around. He then furrows his brow to indicate thinking. Finally he says to his chums ""I know! I'll take that mysterious briefcase belonging to no one but that just happens to be lying around, go in there and pretend I'm the guy's lawyer and trick him in to giving us the information we need!""<br/><br/>The other big problem is some of the casting, which means some of the acting. Leo rings in an emotional but always believable performance and I think a little gold man is probably well due him at some stage. Nicholson is Nicholson. The choice of Martin Sheen as Cpt Queenan however, is a little odd. This character (played with heroism and wit by Anthony Wong in IA) should be to Nicholson's Costello what Professor X is to Magneto. Instead Sheen appears blatantly impotent in contrast with his arch nemesis.<br/><br/>The inclusion of Marky Mark as the tough talking nutjob Sgt Dignam was as much a mystery as the briefcase in the interrogation room, though as comic relief, you can't help but laugh at his foul-mouthed antics in spite of yourself. Then there is Alec Baldwin. Unfortunately, I've not been able to take him seriously since Team America - unfortunate, because that wasn't his fault. Fortunately, I can now not take him seriously on his own merit. According to Mr Baldwin's Book of Acting, senior police officers always, except when playing golf, default to an arms akimbo, chest or gut stuck out position (the more senior you are, the lower the body part to be stuck out) and crack one liners. To make matters worse, he lent a copy of his book to Marky Mark, who compounded the error by reading it. There is a scene in which they are standing together in a room, BOTH with arms akimbo, cracking one liners and giving ""the brief"" to the junior officers. Maybe it's just me, but one guy with his hands on his hips is fine- he commands respect, either because he is the boss or Hercules. But more than one just looks ridiculous. I suppose that's why The Three Amigos were so funny.<br/><br/>There are other moments of unintentional comedy you should discover for yourself. Be sure to invite along a friend who actually speaks Cantonese to watch that scene with the ""tough"" Chinese gangsters.<br/><br/>Many critics have hailed this as Scorcese's comeback blockbuster, and the box office might even give you the numbers to proof it. As a movie in its own right, it certainly is not without merits. But compared with the original, The Departed is dumbed down, heavy-handed and completely unnecessary. I realise Hollywood is starting to run out of ideas - but why remake an excellent movie when the ones that need redoing are the bad ones?"

","In a society where being rich and famous is everything, it's sad to see a former rebel succumb to his nation's core values. Martin Scorsese decided being a celebrity with all the material trappings were what mattered most to him, and dreadful films like Departed and Aviator are the result. Perhaps Mr. Scorsese can rationalize his admirable work on film restoration and figure he's doing his part for the greater good, but I'm not buying it. In fact, I no longer will see a film simply because Martin Scorsese is the director. I wish he and Mick Jagger would take their champagne and yes-men to France, and leave the film and music-making to more eager and less corporate fellows. Also, as much as I respect Roger Ebert's analysis and writings, I can not take seriously his review of a Scorsese film.

Tony Leung is one of the best actors in the world and though this is not his best film it is still well acted considering the Hollywood style of the movie.-Yes, I'm hating on Hollywood now. Scorsese obviously tried to fill his film (rip-off) with as many big name Hollywood stars as possible to compensate for the fact that he added nothing original to his movie. If imitation is the highest form of flattery then that's all the more reason to see Infernal Affairs. For those of you looking for an unbiased review of the Departed-sorry you're not getting it here. I just finished watching Infernal Affairs and all the tension and coolness I thought was in Departed was displayed so much better there- in it's original form. Oh, and did I mention that Infernal Affairs is an original- not that originality counts for much I guess. I don't mean to bash Scorsese completely. He does get props for recognizing that Infernal Affairs is a good original movie. But like the character in the movie- no spoiler here- Scorsese mimics something but does not become that thing.

","Scorsese isn't what he used to be and as a Scorsese lover this pains me to say so. He must have sat down watched Goodfellas and thought 'hmmm. What did I used to do that made me great? I'll just copy that.' It's Scorsese imitating himself and not doing a very good job of it. The editing is quick and choppy like in Goodfellas but too much so the whole film is like one big montage with very little innovative direction. DeCaprio and Damon aren't great but neither are they bad, they just suffice. The actors that really shine are Mark Walberg, who finally ditches the breathless, confused moron he usually plays and does something way different and innovative with himself. Alec Baldwin is fantastic he has some of the best lines and is an actor who just seems to be getting better with age. Normally I'd say the same for Jack who's performance in 'As Good As It Gets', was groundbreaking but this time he's just playing The Joker in Batman he's too over the top for such a seriously acted movie. He was also made too nasty, just to make us dislike him with no seeming root for all his hostility. The original is far superior the only thing the remake does better is establishing DeCaprio in the gang before the fireworks start. Basically all the elements that make a Scorsese movie great weren't there; The violence was comic book (especially the number of head shots at the end), the film-making is sub-standard. Only the writing remained consistently good but even then it followed too closely the layout of Internal Affairs which is just plain lazy."

","Disclaimer: V for Vendetta should have won best picture of the year. <br/><br/>One would think that I would just give up on Hollywood films. However, there is an occasional surprise. When it comes down to it, though, I must mirror the sentiment of my good friend Fletch: ""I want to see the filth!""<br/><br/>Okay, so how do you win an Academy award for best picture of the year? Well, you could make a movie about a mentally deficient idiot who takes a pivotal role in every major historical event for the past 40 years, have an overrated hack play the lead, and insert some repulsive underlying philosophy (i.e., submit to authority, or else!)  but that was already done in 1994. Things change, so 2006 requires a different strategy:<br/><br/>(1) Take a fantastic screenplay from a Hong Kong film. (2) Add $83 million dollars to your budget. (3) Insert the word ""f * c k"" randomly 214 times into the script. (4) Eliminate all of the character/plot complexities to pander to the simple-mindedness of American audiences. (5) Completely purge any intelligent or subtle elements. (6) Add 40 minutes of dead weight.<br/><br/>What do you get? You get the year's most pretentious feat of idiocy  The Departed.<br/><br/>The biggest disappointment with this film is the dialogue and character interaction, which are vitally important in the creation of an effective drama. Scorsese implemented his patented ""4-Letter-Word Guide to Juvenile Screenplays."" <br/><br/>Interestingly enough, I gathered the distinct impression that the insertion of these classless quotes was for no real purpose. This is evident in scenes where a particular character will make statements that seem to come from absolutely nowhere, as they have absolutely nothing to do with the scene up to that point. For example, Baldwin is preparing his police squad for a sting operation, only to then randomly tell Damon the following while talking really, really fast:<br/><br/>""You want to have a smoke? You don't smoke, do you? What, are you one of those fitness freaks, huh? Go f * c k yourself."" <br/><br/>How the hell did Baldwin make the jump from police work to this? It makes no logical sense. Must be Scorsese's trademark film-making style. Clever man. The astuteness of these observations is mind-blowing. I wonder if it took longer than 5 seconds to adapt the original Hong Kong screenplay, or if they just used the ""Replace"" function in Microsoft Word to insert the word ""f * c k"" 214 times into the script. And yes, it was literally 214 times  I counted out of curiosity sake. I'm sure a middle school student could have done as much. <br/><br/>As could be predicted by a Hollywood production, the storyline was rather dim-witted:<br/><br/>(1) What's with the blatantly obvious tipoffs between Damon and Nicholson via cell phone. Don't the cops think it somewhat weird that Damon calls his ""mother"" or ""father"" to tell them his ""friends are coming"" immediately before a huge undercover operation? What the hell!? <br/><br/>(2) The sting operation was devoid of any intelligence or cleverness on the part of the filmmakers. Nicholson gets away because  get this  the cops were too stupid to put cameras near the rear of the warehouse, even though they put them everywhere else. Wow. I can't think of a less scintillating ""cat and mouse"" game than that. <br/><br/>(3) The scene between Martin Sheen and Nicholson is so fake. It's as if the filmmakers were faced with the fact that 70 minutes had passed without any tension between the protagonist and antagonist, and were thus forced to earn that tension with a 30-second superficial conversation replete with vulgarity. Bravissimo fellas. Too bad plot development takes much more effort than that. <br/><br/>So the ending finally comes. In perhaps the most elementary use of symbolism since Forrest Gump's ""feather"" scene, Scorsese shows a rat teetering on the edge of a railing! How long did it take to think of that one? <br/><br/>Oh yeah, and the soundtrack was horrible too. <br/><br/>Don't even think of pawning this film off as an original idea. Half a dozen scenes were ripped directly from Infernal Affairs, only executed ineptly. All of the great suspense sequences were already written for Scorsese. All he did was obliterate a well-written and intelligent script by inserting a series of incompetent scenes with lots of explicit violence, sex talk, and 40 minutes of dead weight in the form of pointless, boring moments. Nice job, Marty.<br/><br/>The Departed is totally mediocre as a stand-alone film, but it is helpful to beat a dead horse by quickly comparing it to the superior Hong Kong original. <br/><br/>The original introduced one of the most interesting, complex characters I can remember. The mole within the police department is not a straight-up antagonist, as Damon was  but instead operated in a gray zone that provided some stunning scenarios and plot developments that transcend any crime thriller ever made. It created a truly unique character for the film to revolve around. <br/><br/>The original was much more intelligent. There were scenes that required the viewer to think about what was going on. For example, the sting operation  a highlight of the film  was lengthy and subtle in it's portrayal of the moles and their communications with their bosses. Frankly, it rocked! Also, the relationships between the moles and their bosses were compelling and realistic, not over-dramatic. The Departed was made for people with an IQ of less than 50. <br/><br/>Think of it this way, if you thought any scene in The Departed was halfway decent, it was done more intelligently and entertainingly in Infernal Affairs. So go to your local Blockbuster and rent the true classic that ""inspired"" a juvenile, pretentious knockoff."
"harborrat28","4","17","31","23 February 2007"," F for the Departed
","The day long movie, The Departed (it was a mere 2-1/2 hours but seemed like a day), is one of a very few movies I've found valueless. It is difficult to comprehend what the critics and the Motion Picture Academy are thinking in their various homages to this. I guess Scorsese is the magic word.<br/><br/>The last shot in the movie, a rat toodling along the balcony of the corrupt Colin Sullivan's (Matt Damon) luxury apartment in downtown Boston (the luxury apartment that no honest cop in the Special Investigations Unit realizes that Sullivan is living in on his $30,000 plus salary?) is emblematic of the ham-handed approach of the movie's makers. There are probably a dozen missteps by Sullivan that would have raised the curiosity of colleagues with an IQ higher than that of my cats but, hey, we know cops are dumb.<br/><br/>The Departed was totally lacking in finesse or intelligence and pandered to a crowd that has no trouble believing that all cops are either stupid or corrupt (or both); that undercover cops wherever they are are permitted to engage is every sort of violent, brutal and destructive act short of intentional murder by their handlers and that Baghdad-like firefights on the streets of major American cities and blood gurgling (or spurting) out of people's mouths or spattered on the walls and floors are realistic.<br/><br/>The approach of the movie was actually insulting to the audience (and, by the way, to black officers, making the nice black officer from the training cadre one of the principal mechanisms of the hero's undoing). Lest we fail to respect and empathize sufficiently with Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen), the incorruptible head of SIU, Scorsese takes Billy Costigan/DiCaprio (and us) into his home and has Queenan talk about his wonderful wife and son at college. Any suspense about whether Queenan would be among those left standing at the end of the film was instantly dispelled. I immediately ordered a wreath for his grave.<br/><br/>The movie was a waste of a great collection of actors. I'm not a DiCaprio fan but he was OK in the ridiculous role he was asked to play, although I don't consider lip-pursing acting. Mark Wahlberg, as Sgt. Dignam, a foul-mouthed but fiercely honest cop with good street instincts was about the best of the lot. And, in the end, the directors turn him into a cold-blooded murderer. Jack Nicholson was Jack Nicholson, which is OK. I suppose there are mobsters capable of clever one liners somewhere. The opera reverie scene in which he has a fantasy (?) of tossing cocaine into the air like fairy dust over two of his bimbos was, like the balcony rat at the end, insultingly gross.<br/><br/>I wonder what this movie could have been if it had been written and directed by people with intelligence, finesse and reserve."
"hhsynby","7","4","5","23 September 2018"," Informants number exaggerated.
","The way of Billy's infiltration to gang group was so foolish. What is more annoying more than this is the leader of gang group accepted Billy after a very short testing and took him in the main operational gangsters' group for no reason. 
Secondly Lazio mostly uses abusive language and the chief of Lazio expects the officers and most probably the audience to accept it. The language in his role was unnaturally showy.
Number of informants and the battle of different departments of enforcement agencies each other on these informants are so exaggerated. The gang leader even appeared as FBI informants at the end of the movie.😁 It is the most silly part of the movie. 
In terms of players' acts and cinematography, the movie is outstanding and worth to watch."

Moreover, it may very well be one of the best movies ever, and it ranks with Scorsese's best, including ""Raging Bull."" The cast was, simply, superb, and as I left the movie, I recounted who will win what Oscars....Scorsese is a lock for best director; the film will win best picture; but the acting awards will be more difficult to determine. Surely Jack Nicholson will win his umpteenth best actor award, and I would vote for DiCaprio for best supporting actor. DiCaprio might get a best actor nomination himself. I thought Mark Wahlberg was perfectly cast in his role as the liaison for the undercover cop. I will see this movie again to ensure that I haven't missed any nuances!"

The scenario I found more coherent, less fragmented and with, surprisingly enough less superfluous violence. Also, in the original version two different women are involved and here just one.

And some of the set pieces - the elevator scene near the end, for example, are not handled as well as in the original (the audience laughed out loud during the elevator scene, and I'm not sure that was the intended effect).<br/><br/>All in all, a good film, but I feel it just misses out on being a great one, especially when compared with its Asian counterpart."
"alexkolokotronis","10","14","25","3 February 2009"," A Perfect Blend Of Vintage and Contemporary Scorsese
","The Departed is a great film to say the least. The film centers around an entire police department's chase of a top boss in Boston. The plot may not seem original but the film gives you a feeling of something new with the intensity of that of a drama and the awe of an action flick.<br/><br/>The acting of the cast all around is great with the likes of actors such as Leonardo Dicaprio playing a rookie cop getting his first assignment. As a result of his family's history of criminal activity his first job is to be working undercover gathering intelligence in the dealings of a mob boss played different yet brilliantly by Jack Nicholson. This goes without notice as Nicholson has his man on the inside as well. On the opposite side of the spectrum Matt Damon also plays a rookie cop starting out of the box with a good job though as a result of his honorable family history. There also plenty of great supporting performances by Martin Sheen and Ray Winestone as well as a breakout performance given by Mark Wahlberg.<br/><br/>Despite so many explosive performances this film is driven by its story so perfectly directed by Martin Scorsese. With this film Scorsese uses his skill to show the hard and gritty tough life on the streets as he once did so often as well as his fine attention to detail with amazing plot dynamics. What both of these things culminate into is a well rounded and balanced film with an unlimited scope of cops and gangsters. The depth of the film is limitless as it is so well layered. Scorsese here makes the film of his life here throwing out everything he has. Scorsese and William Monahan, who so adapts this film so vividly, combine for one of the most thrilling and psychologically explosive movies in ages as the film so perfectly illustrates nothing is as it seems as well as a chain is only as strong as strong as its weakest link. We may think we know it all from profile and background checks but as long as we don't know whats going on inside a person's mind we won't ever know what the person is truly about."
"tinny_tiny","6","14","25","9 October 2006"," For The Love of God, please watch 'Infernal Affairs'!!
","As an avid fan of what it had based on, Infernal Affairs. I was excited to see how Martin Scorsese would interpreted it. The cast looked promising from the trailers, I thought Scorsese could do no wrong. <br/><br/>Jack Nicolson as Costello, the calculated brutal crime boss with good sense of humour! I was really surprised by his sense of humour, Jack have really made this character his own and I respect that! Leonardo DiCaprio as Costigan,the police's mole. He had played this tortured soul brilliantly. Matt Damon as Sullivan, Costello's mole with a heart of stone. <br/><br/>The Departed had filled in the missing piece of puzzle of IA (violence) but it had compromised with the film's climax to make this Oscar worthy. <br/><br/>The first two thirds of the film was fantastic! It had went further into the characters'past than IA (IA explores the characters in 2nd and 3rd instalment) It had a style that stood on it own. It was very promising, but the ending has undone most of the work @ the beginning. The film tries to branch out into different plots & sub-plots which doesn't materialise- it could've make this film stand out rather just a re-make, as it did with Batman Begins. E.g. the film doesn't explain why would Costello double-crossed the corrupted Chinese government officials by selling fake hi-tech military microchips. Did Costello have another bigger agenda in mind? Why would he keep the real microchips for? (NOTE. the mainland Chinese spoke Cantonese with the worst accent I have ever heard! It was not in Cantonese or Manderin accent &why don't they speak Manderin - their official language?! Even the extras spoke in perfect Cantonese during the scene where Sullivan kills an innocent Chinese!) Scorsese followed the same plot path as IA, but minus the moral dilemma both Sullivan & Costigan face, and this does not justify the actions which both characters carried out at the end of the film. For Sullivan - he had no reason to kill Costello or his new found 'co-mole'. The 'Sullivan' character in IA did this because despite that he work for the bad guys, he really enjoys his respectable visage (perfect home, life, girlfriend)&felt wrong for the choices he made &wishes for another chance to make it right, therefore he trapped 'Costello', killed him & (later) new found co-mole, so 'Sullivan' could break free of his cycle of crime. But Sullivan does not express any signs of moral, simply a psychopath. I could no feel sorry for him &I felt Sullivan's action is unnecessary. He killed Costello only by chance! Scorsese develop Sullivan's character's unfortunate childhood &his Catholic faith is that strong, Sullivan would have an apartment with a view of a Catholic Church - what is the point having all this to support his character?! Why would Sullivan recommended Costigan for Honor at the end of the film when he didn't admire Costigan's courage as IA have explore? I don't understand Costigan's desperation - nothing to live for, he didn't sacrifice very much. Costigan would achieve his present existence if he had not joined the police (as most of his family has done). Sure he want his identity back but why would Costigan enlisted Brown's help (aka dim-sum of Romeo Must Die)over Dignam, who is still alive?? He could've send evidence to Dignam to arrest Sullivan, as Costigan claimed that he doesn't want to be a cop anymore but still confront Sullivan alone? The Departed's climax scene was lack of class. The characters become two dimension &all they could do is to scream at each other with swear words &shoot each other and Scorsese had stripped off all suspension (the most powerful scene of IA - it still haunts me to this day). IA created a high-tension with suspension in the climax scene without violence or raise their voices.<br/><br/>I am surprise by the final official ending of The Departed is almost parallel to the Mainland Chinese edition of IA. I thought Scorsese would be more brave to use the original 'unconventional' ending.<br/><br/>Scorsese did really well on retelling the story in his unique style, changed the dialogue in his own way. But towards the end of the film, you could see the dialogues are practically carbon copy from IA. Did he just gave up? The film started of serious then it fell apart as if it is a parody of the original!<br/><br/>I thought all the actors did really well especially Jack, Leo, Ray (Mr. French) and Matt. Some people though Matt's act was bit wooden, but it is not his fault - the script did not develop further into his character - bias more to Leo's character.<br/><br/>Madolyn - she seems to fall head over heels to cheeky bad boys. She is just attention seeking. I can't believe she's a shrink!<br/><br/>Mr. French's character is what should most of the actors should work towards - subtle but effective. He have created a dark aura & fear in a handful on screen time. He is more fearful than Costello!<br/><br/>I don't understand why many people think this film is Oscar worthy? The story is directly from IA. Why should Scorsese take credit for it? The ending of the film just make all the characters to appear shallow!! Some say that it is based on true event - well this basically based on any city in the world with organised criminal gangs - which make this story believable! Scorsese - why leave your work half done?? Did you run out of time? Did you run out of budget? Or did you simply Lost in Translation? You had all the right ingredients to make this film a masterpiece. Yet, you have left me to go home and watch the superb work of the original Infernal Affairs.<br/><br/>This is a perfect example that money can't buy you style."
"paulvanwinkle","3","13","23","7 October 2006"," what is this mess?
","I'd have seen this film regardless of the reviews. Scorcese has directed some of the most significant, dramatic and best-told stories of our time, and with Nicholson, Damon, DeCaprio, Baldwin, Sheen, Walberg and the rest, it at least had a solid chance to be a tour de force. It's a mess, though, dragged down to lousy by a screenplay written by the same misguided pen of that disaster-bore-embarrassment ""Kingdom Of Heaven"". Bad or no structure can't be saved by over-cranking the ragefest volume.<br/><br/>It's hard to say why Marty needs to wallow in even deeper pools of perpetual manic violence and blood at this point in his career. Maybe he still just likes it. Maybe he's feeling like we need to take some people out. Maybe the only way he could punctuate and hold together this cluster was with regular, loud, brain blasting, because if it weren't for the continuous bang-bang-blast, in-your-face-insults and face-punch scenes the story would've resembled a garbage pile. An interesting plot line was strung together by an amateur, though fortunately you've got watchable actors, some wry funny lines and a few outrage scenes that pop.<br/><br/>The screenplay's choppy, the edits and lighting choices are weird, and the script's incongruent in a bad way. It never builds a tempo. That's Scorcese's fault. It was a great shame to see great actors content with accepting performance mania in lieu of characters. So in spite of all the odd-crazy, there're also huge bald spots. Nobody in this film goes beyond one-dimensionally anger-crazed, with the possible exception of DeCaprio. Still, I couldn't understand how Leo didn't explode during this film; he goes from appearing over-stressed and over-drugged to rage-psycho. I felt possessed to snort Ajax watching his crazed eyes and jaw grinding for 2 hours.<br/><br/>I give it a '3' -- there's enough good violence to feel punched up after a numbing week at work."
"dudleynomore","1","39","83","6 October 2006"," Inferior remake
","Marty, Marty, Marty, what has become of you? People are saying this is going to win him Best Director? Oh, dear. Here's a spoiler-free list of some of the horribly clichéd or absurd things you can expect from this remake of Hong Kong film INFERNAL AFFAIRS.<br/><br/>This movie is all about psychological complexity. Which is why they have Matt Damon insulting a bunch of firemen near the beginning: ""You're a bunch of homos!"" he shouts. Leo's character is a down-on-his-luck kid with no family support network. It's so complex, you can't tell who the filmmakers want you to feel sympathy for.<br/><br/>Remember how Braveheart ended by implying that Mel Gibson may have fathered a child who would later be raised by the estranged wife of one of the bad guys? That happens.<br/><br/>At the bleakly dramatic climax, Mark Whalburg shows up wearing a hairnet. It looks ludicrous.<br/><br/>Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb crops up on the soundtrack - but at perhaps the most intimate, sincere moment in the movie, so that the lyrics wind up being completely out-of-context.<br/><br/>At one point Martin Sheen's character, in fear of his life, has to bluff his way into an elevator past some thugs, which he does by pretending to be an innocent passer-by. In the original the scene was set in an apartment block where people might be coming and going all day, so this very nearly works. Here, the scene is in an abandoned building, and his actions make no sense. At all.<br/><br/>A criminal mole in the police force decides to marry a psychiatrist who specializes in treating the police.<br/><br/>Matt Damon has just personally shot someone. While he's standing there, he takes a call from the guy's girlfriend. ""He's been shot"" Matt tells her. Oooookay.<br/><br/>You know the guy Matt shoots, who he was there specifically to shoot? Matt waits for the guy to shoot first before doing anything. Like in a bad Western.<br/><br/>Leo, the undercover cop, feeds Martin Sheen information by text messaging him whilst there are highly tense, alert criminals standing all around him. Don't worry, he leans behind a pillar so that no one notices. What a pity the original film didn't have a cool way of doing this that would have made more sense. <br/><br/>You get the idea. One thing I would never criticize is the acting, which is just fine across the board, unsurprisingly considering the expensive cast. Jack and Ray are always fun, especially together. The cinematography is boring but the dialogue is entertaining; it's just that the story is mangled and it takes a ridiculous amount of time for anything to happen. It's as if 'Marty' couldn't decide who he wanted the film to be about  Jack's character, the plot, Catholicism, or Boston itself  so he just put everything in and we end up waiting an extra hour for the same things to happen. I've avoided mentioning the absurd, hamfistedly 'manipulative' final shot, or something else about what happens to Leo, because I don't want to spoil the ending. <br/><br/>Watch the original instead, it's better in every way and 50 minutes shorter."

","Martin Scorsese plays the role of George Steinbrener, putting out a new movie and sparing no expense in the hopes that the sheer line-up of names will keep us glued to our seats. Nicholson, Damon, DiCaprio, Sheen, Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin for heavens sake. All together amount to nothing more than a silly farce. Ridiculous dialogue and senseless violence which was poorly placed and showed. No character had any depth to speak of and poor Jack Nicholson as Mob boss? I don't think so. Jack was and always will be a solo act. His tirades are embarrassing to watch as they are forced and unnatural. What's the matter? Was DeNiro unavailable? Or maybe he just read the script and said - Pass.. The end is expected and senseless. Everybody dies, good bad, whatever. It makes so much sense how everybody in the movie communicates with cell phones and text messages. You want to tell me that the police cant figure that out? Has technology regressed so much that mob boss cell phones are not tapped? I'm sure that the good folks at Sprint would help if asked nicely. The funny part is that in one scene, the police is very proud of the cellphone surveillance they have, as Matt Damon's Cajones shrivel up. He talks to his mob friend once a day, from the office no less, texts him freely. What the hell is this? Where is the sophistication? Where is the Drama? Matt Damons fiancée sleeps with Dicaprio but nothing is made of it? How stupid. Who scripted this thing? Mark Wahlberg should have that guy shot because it made him look like an idiot more than anyone else in the movie. So, why a score of 2 instead of 1 you ask? Vera Farmiga. I can sit around for hours just watching her."

","Here we go again. Another chapter in Scorsese's love affair with slimeballs. Whether it be Italian or Irish he has an unreasonable fascination for the genre.<br/><br/>The central baddie is played by Jack Nicholson who does nothing but play Jack Nicholson. He chews every piece of scenery with a reprise of the malevolence he exhibited in ""The Shining"". You would think that a director with the skills of Scorsese could control him. But, perhaps he didn't want to do so. In any event, his performance is operatic and intolerable.<br/><br/>Damon and De Caprio do well, as do Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg, but not well enough to make sense or meaning of an atrocious script.<br/><br/>Scorsese showed us that he can be skilled in material other than sewer trash, with ""The Age Of Innocence"".

The love story was predictable, a little weird, and definitely inappropriate considering the characters positions. The film didn't really have a climax, instead there were a series of climactic moments that kept sort of just puttering out and letting me down. The cinematography was boring as well, most of the shots seemed pretty simple and uninteresting. Similarly, the score felt contrived and pedantic.

Pretty weak acting. Especially Sheen, Nicholson and Wahlberg. I really like Scorsese and Goodfellas is one of my all time favorite films but The Departed isn't even in its league. Jack shows up, well, as Jack. I think the last time Nicholson actually played a character, other than himself, Reagan was still in office. I don't buy him as a powerful Irish Mob boss for a minute. Wahlberg just yells and cusses a lot for no good reason. And Sheen looks kinda like he had a minor stroke before filming started. He looks like he's trying not to soil himself in every scene he's in.

If you like ""the departed"", go watch ""infernal affairs"", then you will see the difference, you will know why ""infernal affairs"" is so much better in 1. characters 2.consistency in the storytelling 3. logically believable 4. decency(which is the Hollywood movie's weakness) <br/><br/>second of all, the story is written by a Hongkong writer, it has Chinese DNA in it, no matter if you believe it or not. It is like Hollywood has Hollywood style and Hongkong movie has its own style too. So when you try to make a remake, rewrite the script, you will lose something essential, especially when you are trying to translate a Chinese spirit into a typical American one, it will be almost impossible. For example, I've seen ""infernal affairs"" 5 times, I cry every time when I see Queenan get threw out of the building. However, in ""the departed"", I just can't feel it.<br/><br/>third, I didn't know ""the departed"" get 4 Oscars until the second time I try to see it. I mean, seriously??? Well, I have no idea why. But I do have to admit that Leonard is a little bit handsome in this movie loll. But except for him, the rest of the team just sucks..... Jack Nicholson is a really good actor, but shouldn't be chosen for his role. His character suffers a lot unstable situation when he was young, that's how he get to his place in the organization. But in TD, he is just someone abusing his power whatever it cost. Matt Damon is fine, but he is such a typical cocky American, doesn't have that ability to handle his character. Vera Farmiga's part, I would say, is the only part better than ""infernal affairs"", however, still can't get rid of the Hollywood stereotype..... what should I say, 6 out of 10 is the maximum I can give."

Nicholson being overly cruel, Wahlberg being overly cynical and aggressive towards everyone (and why??), Di Caprio spending his time in the movie crying like a girl, Sheen inexistent... Also how can one believe that a stranger can earn a head of crime syndicate's trust in just 6 months, especially when that head of crime syndicate has the reputation of being very suspicious and doesn't trust people easily?? It looks to me that Scorsese was too ambitious, tried to do too much in a movie, and at the end, he just didn't deliver. I felt no sympathy or anger whatsoever for any single character in the movie. I am a BIG fan of Hollywood movies and Scorsese but for once, I prefer by far the original Hong Kong version, Infernal Affairs which is far better directed, more dramatic, where the psychology of the characters is far better developed (I actually felt sympathy for the undercover cop), and the story far more credible (it took the undercover cop several years to earn the crime lord's trust in the Hong Kong movie as opposed to a few months in The Departed).

It definitely diminished my opinion of his version. The Hong Kong original is less violent and there's no explicit sex (can't say I missed either), but it is literally, scene for scene, the same movie.

","Maratin Scorsese has been a fixture in Hollywood for decades and members of the Motion Picture Academy must have felt that they ""owed"" him this Oscar for being Martin Scorsese, certainly not for this film which has more phony elements in it than any movie in recent memory. True it has 3-1/2 high profile stars: Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson and Mark Wahlberg. Plus it has more violence than can be found anywhere outside a war zone and enough blood to fill your average blood bank. Scorsese has plowed this field before -- in ""Goodfellas,"" a vastly superior movie. Why didn't I like it? Because the plot is stuffed with unbelievable elements including a three way romance between Damon as a cop, DiCaprio as an undercover agent posing as a criminal and a police psychiatrist who is treating them both ???). As for Jack Nicholson, he is reprising previous roles as the Devil, this time in the person of a crime boss who is also -- get this -- an informant for the FBI. Damon is Nicholson's ""mole"" inside the police department and DiCaprio is the police department's mole inside Nicholson's organization. The question is who's going to find whom first and, eventually, after many (bloody) twists and turns, who gives a damn anyway? Scorsese has made more bad films than good ones but what the hell -- it's time to give him his Oscar. As for the principals, DiCaprio presents himself as a cool but tortured soul living a dangerous lie, Damon is Damon once again, and Nicholson is out there in front of the camera chewing the scenery as he is increasingly wont to do. Wahlberg does quite a decent job in a completely over-the-top role as an overseer in the under cover section of the police department. Martin Sheen distinguishes himself in this movie (as DiCaprio's ultimate boss) primarily because his character is almost believable and he's low key where everyone else is hamming it up big time. This movie is expensive trash and its success proves once again that you can't underestimate the taste of the American people (or of the Motion Picture Academy)."

IMO, Jack comes off as a low class, dirty, scumbag than a ""mademan"" mafioso top dog. The scene with Nicholson holding the severed hand in front of Dicaprio was just an stupid scene all together. Mark Wahlberg?? What was the point of his character? All he seems to do was act like a hoodlum and curse when he is speaking. I was very impressed with the storyline, the acting, and subtlety scenes in IA, but TD just left me uninterested in the story all together and this is the SAME FILM!! THE Departed is a terrible film with bad acting, by Hollywood A-list actors. Sorry, but I didn't buy the plot, the acting, the emotions in TD.

","I started my day with 2046. I won't recommend that film to any but fans of Tony Leung (Mou gaan dou, Ying xiong), Li Gong (Miami Vice, Memoirs of a Geisha) and Ziyi Zhang Memoirs of a Geisha, Ying xiong). The music was excellent and Tony Leung's performance was spellbinding, but the movie was hard to follow.<br/><br/>I only mention Tony Leung because his performance in Mou gaan dou was on my mind as I watched The Departed, which is a remake of that film. I wish I had a copy with me to watch again and remind me of why it is such a favorite, but I have seen it enough times to know that it still stand above the new version.<br/><br/>I just couldn't wait any longer, so I bought my copy yesterday and sat down with some chips to watch. Leonardo DiCaprio was magnificent. I have never been a big fan of Leonardo. I really liked him in Gangs of New York and Catch Me If You Can, but this performance was over the top. Having said that, I can't really think of another character's performance in The Departed that is worth mentioning. It ran 50 minutes longer than Mou gaan dou and the extra time was really a waste as it did not add anything to the film. The setup in the beginning was really a bore. Scorcese did so much better work in Gangs of New York and Goodfellas, one of my favorite films. I really don't see him winning an Oscar for this film, though they will probably give it to him for ignoring his earlier and better work."
"nicktokar","1","6","9","28 January 2017"," There were rats. Because this movie was foul.
","Where do I begin with explaining how awful this movie is?<br/><br/>First of all, I think the entire plot was written and constructed by a rat being let loose on a keyboard typing up random crap and auto- correct turn groups of letters into words, which ended up as a ""plot.""<br/><br/>Let's start with the casting. They took as many big-budget actors that they could find who would be willing to join them and gave them a role. Let's take Damon and DiCaprio for example. They play two characters who are supposed to be each other's foil and yet, the two actors look so alike they are almost indistinguishable other than the fact that DiCaprio has a bit of facial hair. I normally love Jack Nicholson, but he was a bit weak and not right for his part.<br/><br/>Onto the main part of the movie that really was the downfall, which would be the overall plot. I would be amazed if any person on the planet was able to fully grasp this overly complex plot the very first time they watch it.<br/><br/>The first part that was utterly ridiculous was at early parts of the film, DiCaprio, who is supposed to be an undercover cop severely beats up people for no obvious reason. At the bar he gets one insult from a person and smashes a glass over his head. I don't think that is part of an undercover cop's duty. Later, He beats two random people from Providence, again for no obvious reason. Somehow Nicholson's character learns about this, so what does he do, He smashes DiCaprio's already broken hand with a shoe. But the really smart part is the fact that DiCaprio is more than willing to befriend the guy who just injured his broken hand. Is Nicholson really just going to let him into his crew that quickly? You would think not, but whatever.<br/><br/>Later in the movie DiCaprio even tells the characters played by Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg that they have the evidence to convict Nicholson, but they don't think they have enough evidence even though they know him to run a large scale operation with includes selling drugs, micro-processors, and killing people. And its not like Nicholson is trying to hide or anything. Just arrest the guy for crying out loud!<br/><br/>Later in the movie we see that Wahlberg's character is forced to step down from his position for reasons that the movie failed to explain. Then for some reason they decide to have Damon, who is one of the newest members of the team, lead the case on Nicholson.<br/><br/>Here comes the second most confusing part of the film (Yes it will get more confusing). During some kind of cocaine exchange the cops show up where a big gunfight follows. Nicholson is injured in the fight then reveals to Damon that he has is an FBI informant. Wait... What?!? You're trying to tell me that for the past several decades, Nicholson has been working as an FBI informant? Many unanswered questions arise from this situation: 1) How and why is an FBI agent running one of the largest organized crime groups in the city. He's killed people, sold illegal contraband and this goes unpunished by his superiors at the FBI? 2) What kind of information is he trying to get if he's supposed to be an informant? What is he trying to accomplish?<br/><br/>3) At the very beginning, we see him recruit Damon at the age of 12. Why is he allowed to recruit people, especially kids, for his crime group?<br/><br/>Moving on to the very end of the film, we now find the most confusing part. DiCaprio tells Damon to meet him on a roof so he can arrest him, which he does. But for some reason another cop shows up on the roof from the request of DiCaprio, but he sees DiCaprio as the bad guy. Damon and DiCaprio go down the elevator, DiCaprio is immediately killed by some random guy I don't recall ever seeing, then he kills the other officer who came down by stairs, then Damon kills the guy who killed DiCaprio and the other cop. At this point of the movie I am completely lost. All I know is that people are killing people for no logical reason.<br/><br/>At the very end of the movie, we see Damon walking into his apartment and Wahlberg is waiting for him and shoots him. Then here comes the most brilliant piece of symbolism in cinematic history, a RAT is shown walking across the balcony of Damon's apartment. Yes, a rat. Because that has to be the most clever and least cliché metaphors I have ever seen (sarcasm fully implied) because they only said the word 'rat' about 100 times during the movie.<br/><br/>Complaints continued: 1) This incredibly long 2 1/2 hour long movie is paced so poorly. They spend an incredibly long time on the parts that have no significance to the plot, and the parts that make no sense, they either barely touch on it or don't explain it at all (I don't need to have the plot spoon fed to me, but there is a certain point where there does need to be some explanation within the movie). 2) There is this sort of 'love triangle' going on with Damon, DiCaprio, and a psychiatrist, which adds nothing to the plot other than to make the movie longer. 3) By the end of the movie, there are 3 characters who had screen time that ended up surviving. Basically every important character ends up dead. 4) Scorsese's portrayal of violence is glorified and unrealistic.<br/><br/>Overall, I would definitely consider this one of the worst movies I have ever seen and would not recommend this movie even if you were bored out of your mind."

Not worth repeating. <br/><br/>There were time warp issues where things didn't fall into play correctly. It seems like they got finished filming and decided there were too many big names to just scrap it and pretend it didn't happen. <br/><br/>The most disappointing was Jack Nicholson and Martin Scorsese were involved and they couldn't even save it. It might have been Jacks' most uninspired acting job of his career, but I think the screenplay was so poorly written as though to dumb it down as much as possible so that the audience would realize how unsophisticated the Boston Irish really are. <br/><br/>DeCaprio and Damon were equally bad and Alex Baldwin and Marky Mark were just behind them. The characters were bad, and the attempt to have us understand them was missing except for the vulgar language. I swear, Scorsese must have a deep hatred of Boston and the Irish to portray them so badly. <br/><br/>What was good? the shootings and violence were pretty good. <br/><br/>I think the script caused this all, it was so bad the top actors and directors couldn't save it.

","I've lived in and around Boston my entire life. I have always been interested to see what the rest of the world (or at least Hollywood) thinks about we proud Bostonians, from the Fenway Park scene in ""Field of Dreams"" to Daniel Stern's watching the Celtics and Red Sox in ""Little Monsters"". So it was with much anticipation that I rented ""The Departed"". You see, I had been plied with much gushing praise from all quarters: my mom, the hipster guy I worked with at Newbury Comics who wore jeans that were made for women, the Press, and on and on.<br/><br/>Let's just say that I was a tad let down. Now I've read plenty of reviews about the myriad plot holes, the wooden acting, the absurd amount of F-bombs, and how it pales in comparison to the Chinese film it was based on. So I will assume all of that is given, and try my best to elucidate the rage I feel towards this complete waste of celluloid.<br/><br/>First, as I have said, I live in Boston, have for all of my 32 years. And I can tell you that the ""Baaahstun"" accent you hear from EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER in this movie is really not as prevalent as Hollywood would like you to believe. I don't have one, most of my friends don't have one, and the majority of my family (also mostly life-long Bostonians) have only a slight trace. Outside of Gloucester (significantly north of Boston; see the completely different yet equally putrid Mark Wahlberg vehicle ""The Perfect Storm"") and Quincy (pronounced Kwin-Zee, dood), this manner of speaking is usually reserved for those amongst us who assault people walking around with Yankees caps. That said, the cast's grasp on this accent is tenuous at best, recalling at times Kevin Costner's butchery of the King's English in ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"". Even purported Bostonians Damon and Wahlberg struggle to maintain their comically over the top disregard for the letter ""r"" (i.e ""Pahk the Cah in Hahvahd Yahd"", which, if you didn't know, is impossible).<br/><br/>Secondly, what is the deal with the gratuitous use of the Rolling Stones' ""Gimme Shelter""? With literally billions of songs to choose from, why use the same one over and over again? I have the same gripe with ""I'm Shipping Up To Boston"" by the DREADFUL Dropkick Murphys. But further than its multiple uses in this movie, it was, and still remains five years later, inescapable: from clownish man-child Sox pitcher Jon ""Pap"" Papelbon dancing to it at the end of every game in the '07 World Series run to, well, every other public event/radio broadcast/suburban backyard barbecue. But instead of affecting a comically inept Boston twang like the cast, they opt for a faux-Irish brogue. Turns out they're about as Irish as Killian's Red (made with pride in Golden, Colorado!) <br/><br/>The fact that this won Scorsese an Oscar for Best Director and Best Film(!) is absolutely baffling. This piece of garbage, better than Goodfellas? Taxi Driver? Raging Bull? Absurd. Absolutely absurd. I watched it with my girlfriend and best buddy, and both of them fell asleep about a third of the way through, leaving me to yell at the TV screen and point out all the obvious flaws to the rare New England air. Living proof that Mr. Scorsese has lost any and all magic that he once commanded. Pathetic."

Critics called it one of the best movies of the year 2006, but in my opinion it is a disgrace to the Chinese original, called The Infernal Affairs. And it is also Scorsese's worst film ever. Even Gangs of New York were more original than this film. Let me explain why I didn't like this film.<br/><br/>First, the characters are empty. There is no emotion and the characters don't develop throughout the film. They are just like chess figures on a board.<br/><br/>If I go on, this is two and a half hour long remake of a trilogy of at least six hours in length, so many important things were left out, so the story is full of holes that really need to be patched.<br/><br/>As it is typical for Hollywood the body-count must always be bigger. Many characters just die for no reason at all. It seems like Scorsese thinks that if he delivers us a messy massacre the film will be a success. Just return to your basics Scorsese. Your older films are much better than your recent crap that you call a movie.<br/><br/>Another big mistake is that Nicholson's character is more developed than the characters of Damon and DiCaprio, maybe because Nicholson really did a good job and acted as a professional. But this is the only bright point of the film. And this is the reason for my two stars, because Nicholson is the only one who keeps this movie above one star. A disaster in every way and a very unfair decision of the Academy to claim this movie as the best motion picture, especially to the Infernal Affairs, which deserves an Oscar for the best motion picture more than this poor interpretation."

","Stylish, Exciting, Thrilling, ORIGINAL..! Oh Sorry I'm talking about Infernal Affairs! So you already know now that I do not feel positive about this remake. This isn't the standard expected from the guy who we loved after Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Casino & GOOD FELLA's... All I will say is the film just attach's clustered elements of the original. The characters psychology is seriously weak compared to 'IA' but even if we do not compare the 2, The Departed just doesn't make much sense and is (I really am choosing my words carefully here) LAZY! Who, What, Where, When, Why? There is too much talking, too much unnecessary scenarios, too much confusion on the characters - the film dived straight into the characters and not revealing why Damon becomes a cop! Things just happen in this film. There is no sense of compassion towards DiCaprio unlike Tony Leungs portrayal. I really respect Andy Lau, he was very polite to rate this boring 2hr+ film 8 out of 10.. The only thing he did comment on was the character psychology.. Now I know why! *Sometimes you don't need to try so hard to be effective* As Infernal Affairs was effortlessly cool. Departed , even with Jack Nicholson is just Painfully Bad! Slow paced, not much happens, audiences do not feel too involved, Overall Poor Remake or a Classic!"

","It's no great disgrace that Scorsesse takes this studio project for the dough; but why does every critic in the country have to pretend this warmed over T.V. cop show stuff is any good. It's not. It's a completely ridiculous and unbelievable story that throws around a few Shakespearian names in a lame attempt to give itself class. <br/><br/>If your idea of great cinema is ""Face/Off"" you might like it, otherwise your headed for disappointment. Nicholson does a credible job with this nonsense; nobody is bad really; though the female shrink is pretty sexist eye candy in this ""tough guy"" swamp. What else can I say? It would be nice if Scoresse could find something to really apply his gifts too; some of his underrated films (Casino, The Last Temptation Of Christ) deserve a second look rather than wasting time with this one."
"chicomello","2","13","24","23 February 2007"," A Farce at Best
","****SPOILER*****To any and all that take this film seriously, you are not in on the joke. At its best, The Departed is top of the line farce. At its worst, the film is a train wreck wherein all actors of quality intentionally subvert the director and the film with farcical performances that, though a delight to watch, must have been inspired by the sheer boredom of working with a lead actor embarrassingly limited in ability, DiCaprio, and a director too far gone to realize that his film was only his at its worst moments. This is not to say that this film is dreadful to watch. The performances of Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin, were spectacular, but, then again, they almost always are. It is no trick of Scorsese that such professionals as listed made the most of savagely poor dialog. The fire they project is a necessary distraction from lines that simply don't hold up and pacing that makes little sense. Take for instance Sheen's character being thrown from the building. First, there is no reason within the logic of the film's world for his character to stay behind. He knows these people will kill him, and, obviously, if there is enough time for Leo to get away, why couldn't he follow. Second, he makes no attempt to hide in a room filled with clutter. Third, after he is killed, his character is thrown from a building in broad daylight. Let us not forget that he is a known police officer and that to be thrown from the building his murders must be inside it. So the question arises, why throw him from the building? Certainly not to speed the killers' escape, nor to ensure it. Certainly not to send a message, death in this film is the only message and how you get there is of little importance. The only logical reason is to confront Leo's character with the man's murder. This is the hand of the director and a clumsy hand it is. Such insultingly obvious moves make up the bulk of this film. If we take them as farcical, then there is a certain meta-humor to them. If they are not, and I believe this to be the case, then it is simply poor film making, and this, despite the best attempts of good actors, is a poor film. Don't believe me, take a look at the scenes between Leo and the artless Vera Farmiga, which are some of the most forced, unconvincing ""love"" scenes I have ever seen. True these are the two most amateurish actors in the cast, but then again with such actors we see the director at play, as he must craft every scene for them. In this case, his crafting equates to little more than depicting animal arousal, which, with Leo in the scene, is not convincing to say the least. Not convincing is, I believe the mantra of this movie, just as the cleverly placed allusion to Leo's two accents is not a convincing mask for the fact that he could not maintain a convincing southie accent for even the most highly edited of scenes. Equally unconvincing is Leo's placing of the girlhood picture of Farmiga on her wall as supposedly indicative of his utter understanding of her. It is again nothing more than the heavy handedness of a director whose loss of subtlety is equal to his rise in obsession for an actor who cannot act. That said, enjoy this film for the thoughtless, mindless fun of watching its many good actors have a good time. Do not enjoy it as a pinnacle of film making or for Leo and Farmiga. If it wins an Oscar, then you will know exactly what those awards are worth."
"skillsaul","4","13","24","10 October 2006"," not so great
","The Departed is an occasionally engaging film, beautifully acted and photographed. It has powerful narrative energy as it breathlessly races the viewer through a complex plot. However, the praise for this film has been far overblown. The Departed is not as inventive as Taxi Driver and not startling and sublime like Raging Bull. In fact, Scorcese's new film is overly long and somewhat tedious. The contrived plot seems banal, and neither Di Caprio nor the bland Damon make their roles particularly interesting. Sadly, despite his technical virtuosity, it becomes apparent here that Scorcese has little more to say about his themes of urban alienation and the brutality of modern life. The film is grotesquely violent at times, and the viewer begins to wonder as yet another bloody shooting ""goes down."" Unfortunately, the shallowness of this film and its predictable brain-spraying violence disappoint the Scorcese fan."
"james-bowden","1","35","77","8 October 2006"," One of the worst movies I've ever seen!
","If there was any socially-redeeming value to this movie, I missed it. It was gratuitous gore, violence, and obscenity from start to finish. Not only that, the whole thing played like a preview: cut, cut, cut every few seconds, jumping around in time and space to the extent that the actual storyline was a confused mess. The language was of the foulest imaginable. Every other word was the F word. No, I take that back. Some multi-syllable words had the F word inserted between syllables! It was almost like a parody of a real crime film, cartoonish and exaggerated. If this is the modern American's idea of a great film, I fear for the future of this country."
"JiaQiLi","5","12","22","10 October 2006"," A Disappointing Remake
","Being Chinese, I have already seen the original Hong Kong version (a trilogy in fact). Honestly, I am very disappointed by Scorsese's remake. Matt Damon's character does not seem to struggle in his double identity. The ending of ""The Departed"" surprises me in a negative way. It is really lame and dull compared to the original.<br/><br/>However, it is not fair to evaluate ""The Departed"" by constantly comparing with the original ""Infernal Affairs"" trilogy. I hereby turn my focus to ""The Departed"" as a movie of its own. This is my first time watching a Scorsese movie. He achieves a marvellous job in terms of directing the actions although they are excessive. DiCaprio and Damon are very good in acting but the best actor has to be Jack Nicholson. Playing Frank Costello, Nicholson's facial expression and acting demonstrate the charisma of a gangster leader. Scorsese does an excellent job on generating the tensions between characters too. I did not want to leave my seat for the most part of the movie.<br/><br/>Damon used to be an altar boy at the church that Damon can see from his home's window. He has then become Nicholson's mole in the Special Investigative Unit of Boston police. It reminds me about Damon's past. But if Damon has some struggles, Scorsese ought to do a better job illustrating them. I experience Damon's character to be naturally evil in ""The Departed."" ""The Departed"" probably has a different focus from ""Infernal Affairs."" ""The Departed"" comes across to me as an emphasis on the ones that depart after doing good works for the society. ""Infernal Affairs"" emphasizes the tension between people's goodness and wickedness.<br/><br/>If this is the case, the ending of ""The Departed"" makes very little sense. I give it a 5 out of 10 mainly because of the poor ending. In addition, the actions (well-choreographed) and foul languages are too much. They become too unnatural as the movie progresses. If you enjoy pure actions, ""The Departed"" is worth watching. But I recommend the original trilogy even more. ""Infernal Affairs"" is miles better than ""The Departed."""
"fundaquayman","1","25","53","8 October 2006"," THE DEPARTED -- an INFERior Affair
","the original - INFERNAL AFFAIR is by no means a flawless film. By comparing to the remake it inspired, however,INFERNAL AFFAIRS seems much closer to perfection. If nothing else, I couldn't believe a Scorsese film would call for the audience to suspend their disbelief even more than what the average over-stylized & borderline-fantasy Hong Kong film would demand!!! <br/><br/>There are gaps that THE DEPARTED manage to patch where INFERNAL AFFAIRS had fumbled: 1) watching the news report of Nicholson's goon as an undercover cop, and Nicholson responds ""the cops would want us to believe that so we stop hunting for our mole"". (this is where the HK version leaves audience confused as it is never explained; <br/><br/>2) the shrink actually is not a mannequin that shows the intelligence of an 8 yr old where her consultation with patients resembles an office receptionist taking calls -- flawed by not only the choice of actress, but also in the original script; & 3) why would Andy Lau's girlfriend get so disillusioned just BC she hears a tapped recording of a conversation between her boyfriend and a raspy-voice man about crime -- she doesn't even know he's working on this case, so why would this little thing lead her to believe her boyfriend is an undercover-crook?<br/><br/>THE DEPARTED: done right: <br/><br/>1) as written above, Nicholson's comment on the police revealing who the snitch is helps lower unnecessary confusion that serves little purpose; 2) the psychiatrist has her own demons -- not a cyborg like Kelly Chen played it to be; 3) flashbacks to the children version of the leads were a good touch compared to INFERNAL AFFAIRS using actors in their 20's that confuses the audience BC they neither look like teenage versions of Andy Lau & Tony Leung, nor does it make sense for the difference in looks within even 10 years unless they've both had a FACE/OFF.<br/><br/>THE DEPARTED - INFERIOR & RIDICULOUS: 1) is the psychiatrist a nymphomaniac? if so, why not explain that earlier that she could fall in lust with someone who just yells at her non-stop? At the clichéd least, let it be an act of charity out of pity!<br/><br/>One ""left-field"" line of ""so can we have a cup of coffee?"" after the rapid-fire insults would turn her on? Who's the one with dementia here? Why can't she at least have one scene where a problem between her and Matt Damon surfaces, or maybe she has demons she can't control causing her to fall in lust with Leo? Were there scenes or dialog cut from what was shot because of duration control? <br/><br/>2) when Nicholson's goon suspects Leo to be the snitch, why doesn't he tell anyone else? In INFERNAL AFFAIRS this is justified because the goon is a good friend and aspires to be like Tony Leung. In THE DEPARTED, there is not the slightest sense of camaraderie between these two. <br/><br/>3) when the girlfriend listens to the CD, her motivation is fear of getting caught by Matt Damon about her affair. Knowing so little of what Matt Damon's cases, why would she be so disappointed at him? If any reaction is to come out of her, it would at best be her questioning ""hey, are you taking up voice-acting? why didn't you tell me?"" She wouldn't know what's going on just listening to 5 minutes of cryptic phone conversations... <br/><br/>4) Wahlberg, Wahlberg, WAHLBERG!!! I don't mind some of the lines given to him to make him the asshole of the year. I'll suspend my disbelief that much to accommodate his behavior. What I cannot accept is what happens after the boss' demise -- why would Nicholson and Damon suddenly feel the only remainder to their worries is Leo? When the film clearly states Wahlberg and Sheen are the only two who know the list of Undercovers, why does he suddenly leave the story as if he has no part in it? If I were the dumbest crook, Wahlberg is the first person I'd go for a shakedown to find out about the snitch. Instead, he is forgotten... and these are supposed to be the super-crooks we've been lead to believe throughout the film? <br/><br/>MARTY... did you direct this picture? or you left 1/2 of it to the team of interns? <br/><br/>I give points to the twist in the 3rd-act warehouse scene. It's a wise move to change-up so it wouldn't be completely predictable to those who've watched INFERNAL AFFAIRS. <br/><br/>That said, what's with the ridiculous dialog? Leo: ""xxx you, xxx you, xxx you, xxx the lot of ya!"" Is there some syncopation here? are you trying to add a musical touch to this scene? I won't giveaway your ""surprised ending"". That's better left for everyone else to judge after they see it. I for one, think it was ridiculous and could only have resulted because some Studio Exec decides ""but there's no redemption! The bad guy can't go free!"" <br/><br/>one more thing before I end this rant... it's about the scene with the Chinese gangs. Did you just grab a team of Chinese-looking men, tell them to translate on-the-spot their lines from English to what they think is Cantonese, and then just shot it right there-and-then without review? Do you realize they're speaking laughably bad pigeon Cantonese that doesn't exist -- intonation, and stresses at all the wrong places... when the gang head tells his henchman to check the bag, the audience expects him to say ""You better check it good my man! or it's your ass!"". What the guy says, however, can be translated into English as ""now I assign you the duty (in third person form as if he's explaining about an order someone else had made), you better check IT THOROUGHLY!"" Would you put the stress in ""IT THOROUGHLY""? <br/><br/>IT BAD, MARTY, IT BAD...."
"LukeFord02","10","2","2","14 April 2020"," Scorsese at his true best
","The cast in this film speaks for itself. DiCaprio and Matt Damon give such a compelling performance and showcase the corruption of the police force. The film manages to also include 3 or 4 twists in places you do not expect and this shows the courage and confidence that Scorsese has as a director. The film is bold and gruesome but is told in such an intriguing way. Jack Nicholson and Ray Winstone are both great and entertain their roles superbly. However i believe that the best actor in this movie is Mark Wahlberg and his role in the film becomes the most important."
"o-31546","6","2","2","6 July 2017"," I like this film, but I certainly don't love it
","""Infernal Affairs"" is one of the most successful films in Asia, and it became internationally known when Martin Scorsese adapted it to shoot ""The Departed"".<br/><br/>This is a very good movie - I loved the parallel stories of the undercover cop (DiCaprio) and the bent cop (Damon.) Listening to their Bostonian accents made me think they'd be perfect as the Kennedy brothers - they certainly look the part, especially Damon. So many great performers here - including Mark Wahlberg and Vera Farmiga - and of course, whenever Jack Nicholson is on screen he just wipes everyone else out by sheer force of charisma. He's not only a great actor, but one of the few true stars still with us. But the Chinese one still a better version than the Departed.What the remake did wrong was making the girlfriends of our protagonists into the same person, adding a love triangle, which was unnecessary and distracting. ---From Yidioo"

","Yea that's right, I made an A-Team reference regarding The Departed. Despite the quality differences between these media stories, this film went exactly as planned. So when Brad Pitt and his production company Plan B decided to help remake a Chinese classic, they decided to go all out. Aside from getting the great Martin Scorsese on board to direct and William Monahan to write an excellent script, they felt like it wasn't enough. They hired Leo and an All-Star cast that could only be matched by a corny romantic comedy (Valentine's Day). Then as they say, the rest worked out itself. The acting was superb with Leo leading the way along with Mark Wahlberg, Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson not far behind. Not to mention the ten other actors who did their jobs well and when it was all said and done. Mr. Scorsese didn't get denied and he finally won his Oscar. Plus he found his new De Niro with Leo and with this and Shutter Island, the future looks bright as long as Scorsese is still kicking."
"DemiRonin","6","2","2","2 May 2011"," One of the most overrated films of all time, but hey... when you got star power like this film had, who would dare say a bad thing about you?
","*Note: This film has too many big named actors for me to list them according to their roles. There is a such a plethora of characters in this film that they start to blur so I'm only going to refer to character names for ease sake. Actors you may recognize: DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Vera Farmiga, Alec Baldwin <br/><br/>Synopsis: In the beginning of the film we are introduced through montage and monologue to Frank Costello, the ruthless crime lord of South Boston. He preaches about power, grabbing life by the reigns, and about his general philosophy of the similarities between cops and criminals. <br/><br/>Next we are then thrown into another montage of Colin Sullivan and Billy Costigan, young cadets going through the police academy. After they graduate we see that Colin is a straight- A, climb the ranks kind of officer but also a double agent working for Frank. Billy on the other hand wants nothing more than to serve. However as a man whose family history is littered with low life criminals he is stuck feeling a bit out of place. Noticeably the black- sheep of his family Billy is given a super secret top mission to fail out the ""Staties"" and instead work undercover infiltrating Frank's gang. Billy thinks long and hard about his decision but in the end is persuaded by the father-like figure Captain Queenan.<br/><br/>After a 20 minute long intro, the movie begins as the two undercover operatives work on separate sides, doing their best to conceal their dual identities. In doing so there lives begin to morph and derange to the point they don't know if they're more cop or criminal. <br/><br/>The story is less to do with a singular event and more to do with when the two will be found out and gutted. There is a thing about some military microchips being sold to the Chinese but that story abruptly ends mid-movie. The driving force of the movie is more about how Colin and Billy must maneuver, bluff, and lie their way out of trouble. Both sides suspect a double agent among their ranks which increases the tension.<br/><br/>Madolyn is the on sight psychologist and while getting into a serious relationship with Colin she starts develop an attachment to Billy as their mandatory therapy sessions bring them closer. <br/><br/>Review: First of all this movie is almost 3 hours long! No movie should ever be that long unless it contains elements of fantasy or sci-fi. This film has so many stars and characters that instead of choosing who to focus on, Scorsese gives screen time to EVERYONE. It excessively gives moments of emotional development to Frank and Madolyn. Yes, Jack Nicholson plays a cool bad guy but he acts almost like a narrator spitting diatribe after another about cops, foreigners , and every other social intuition on the planet. Why in a movie that has to deal with identity and suspense is there so much ""other stuff"" added? There are themes about church, race relations, and about settling in your romantic life. All things that are great and interesting but simply should have been set aside for another movie.<br/><br/>The cinematography is nothing special and in fact can be distracting at times, best example is when Billy is being grilled by Wahlberg for his intent on making the force. The camera gets a little movement happy constantly closing in on heads while they talk. Although this film won for best editing I have to forcefully disagree with that recognition. The film is adequately edited but in no way is the editing outstanding. A well edited film has great pace, which this film struggles with in its entirety. It's a stop and go viewing experience with scenes ranging from a couple of seconds to five minutes. Maybe it was purposely done that way to keep the audiences awake, but you shouldn't have to sacrifice flow for attention. Otherwise you're simply shaking the viewer to pay attention instead of enrapturing them. <br/><br/>The acting is pretty good but none of the performances other than Wahlberg's is something new. DiCaprio mannerisms continues to be the same in almost everyone movie and only different thing about Matt Damon's performance is his accent. <br/><br/>The Departed is an American remake of the Hong Kong trilogy Infernal Affairs, which is probably why I am being harder on this film than usual. Also the premise of dual undercover characters has been done before the action film Face-Off so I don't understand all the buzz this film has gotten. Scorsese was a frontier shattering director and I loved his work in Raging Bull and Taxi Driver. However The Departed is far from ground breaking cinema and the clearest example I know of success by name. <br/><br/>Who this film is not for: <br/><br/>-People who don't like gangster/cop films<br/><br/>-People with short attention spans"

","What a Disappointment! .. The Departed Goes Actually Nowhere! I'm not saying the movie is awful but it isn't great .. yeah, there's a big load of excitement but I think it is too big for the movie to handle it and most parts of the movie aren't even, it is an OK at its best .. Martin Scorsese did cast a bunch of Hollywood's class ""A"" Actors and he was relying on the good performances that they could give to empower the movie but unfortunately they all were So-So except for Mark Whalberg who gave an OK performance but his little role didn't give him a chance to do any better .. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance was bad & disappointing .. so is Matt Damon. Nicholson's performance is OK but not at his best.<br/><br/>What I miss in that movie is the depth .. I feel like if it is a cheap thriller movie with a great excitement but it makes no sense sometimes. I felt that the movie is disconnected and not very solid!!! When you read most of the reviews that praising the movie .. you feel that it is the movie of the millennium or of the year .. but actually The Departed goes nowhere .. it was going to be an OK thriller that you watch and forget about it the next day until the horrible ending blew up all the ""OK"" work .<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese did a great job on cinematography but he didn't give a depth to his exciting story. I'm a big fan of Scorsese's .. Martin Scorsese has directed great movies that we loved such; After Hours, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas .. I wouldn't call ""The Departed"" one of his best .. probably his worst.<br/><br/>I'm not comparing the moving with any movies .. I even haven't seen ""Infernal Affairs"".<br/><br/>It is an exciting thriller .. you will enjoy it but by the ending you will feel that you are lost in the middle of nowhere because of the lacking of the necessary minimum depth and it was just a stupid ending. I highly doubt that the movie will receive any big nominations at the Oscars or any other big film awards.<br/><br/>That's what Hollywood dose to a movie! .. it makes it only ""pretty"" pointless picture!

","Whether he knows it or not, Scorcese, has a God-given talent for bringing out stories, with an 'intellectual' twist (Not Last Temptation however). THE DEPARTED, showed the hard-boiled side of Boston that is in need of repair. The whole 'Grit' of the officers and the jobs intermixed, from the criminal element right over to the 'Staties'. There seems to be quite a bit of sludge, in the Law there, as many places, (just about everywhere else in the world) unfortunately. But these investigators, with a real 'leak' Handy-capped department, were everything I would have thought this would be, and I am happy to report even more so. <br/><br/>First off the Captin Queenan's office, the interview with one, oh-so-nice conversation with Statie 'Collin Sullivan', to the interview/interrogation of DiCaprio's character, showed the uneven operator's working on the inside. All the while, just doing their job of course. Breaking in the newbie's, getting into their heads, to see what they are made of, especially under pressure. Right off-the-bat, you got the higher up's in your face, when you pass the class and that's just to get things started. It starts to get more interesting, just after that. The good man got beat down from the beginning, then that man took action and in that course of, he started to make real waves. Almost invisibly. Enter (first) Jack Nicholson's 'Frank Costello' who Billy Costigan has nicely ""Siddled"" up on, and fills a needed position in Frank's business operations his 'Irish' Mafia. This put's Frank's son, who is feeding a criminal from a federal building into a place a crook should never be...'informed'. <br/><br/>I was drawn deep into the storyline, from the first few scenes on screen. I was in shock, first when the Captain (Martin Sheen) was standing in for Leo's character and was unable to make it out alive, thus was cast head-long off the meeting place (building) to his,(bloody) end. But as it went on, the story and the shifting of information, back and forth from criminal (Nicholson) to cop (Matt Damon) it became, with the help of Costigan, a lot more complicated, even as it was sifting downward ultimately time would run out and someone from one of the sides would find out, just who the hidden identity was in fact. You know, that Frank's losing his cool and ability to think as he smashes a fly on the table then proceeds to eat it in a bout of anger! Costigan, went on to drop the hammer on Collin, (Matt Damon) he was almost there. The biggest shock was the elevator, after opening and losing the star player. <br/><br/>This was a great film, in that some of the players like, Damon and Wahlberg, would use a differing formatted character, than what they usually play. I truly enjoy, Matt Damon's work and yet I perfectly could not stand his character, in this. Superbly done. And as in the end, as the elevator door opens and Collin walks out to head to his door with groceries in arms, as he opens his own front door, he receives the very shock, of his life!! I was blown away at this point, because he (Damon)utters, 'Okay.' Dignam (Mark Walhberg) would be the dispenser of 'ultimate justice' here in this equation. Yet, Sullivan still requested the metal of honor for William Costigan, that was a perfect treat for the ending shot, in this story. This for me was beside 'TITANIC' the most memorable Leo, deep, hungry, passionate, fierce. He was raw and yet refined in his 'mode of operation' investigating, i.e.,cousin Sean, smartly deceptive on the job. Calculated. I enjoyed Stephen Balwin's older Bro in this as well.

","This is probably different from other Martin Scorsese's movies but it's truly enjoyable. Cast is excellent and each one of ""the splendid actors gives his best. Dialogues are strong and believable, soundtrack's really great and suitable; as far as I can see there's no moment when rhythm is not steady or story lacks of focus. Furthermore it handles subjects like power and loyalty in a way reminding Mathy's masterpiece ""Good Fellas"". We could say, to sum up, that Scorsese is back with his humor, his class A actors (Jack Nicholson is huge) and his creating Shakespearean atmospheres. ""The Departed"" is purely entertaining and gritty and its action is enjoyable 100%."

The movie just seemed to fall flat despite all the talent assembled on the screen. I don't know if it was the dialog or all the plot holes (there are a lot of loose ends in my opinion).<br/><br/>I just always felt like I had a lot of interesting characters but I kept asking myself as I watched this film - what the heck is going on? How much got lost on the cutting room floor? Maybe this film needed to be four hours.<br/><br/>I would like to see an unedited unrated director's cut or read the original screenplay for this movie. It covers such a large span of time and seems to jump all over the place without neatly putting things together. And the end seems like a desperate attempt to close off as many open plot lines as possible.<br/><br/>Entertaining, yet frustrating. I expected a lot more out of this film and I don't really feel like it delivered. I recommend waiting for DVD."

","To say that Scorsese, Nicholson, Damon, or any of the other Hollywood elites, in 'The Departed,' have outdone themselves would be a vast overstatement. It was simply too bad and too long to sit through for 7 American dollars. Come to think of it, I can't remember the last time I was able to make it to the end of a Scorsese flick without snoring myself awake during its end credits. Nicholson's accent is shaky at best and his role as mob boss about as convincing as the film's denouement when every character that you should care about takes one to the face. It's as if Monahan got tired and handed the script of to his 12 year old to finish. Neither a masterpiece or anywhere near Scorsese's best. Perhaps, throwing in the towel is not an option when you command so much respect. But, it's never too late."

","THE GOOD - A big collection of well-known male actors headed by veteran Jack Nicholson give standout performances. Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon play guys who are both working both sides of the fence and the big suspense revolves around their characters and if will be found out. Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, ---- (the only female with many lines), Alec Baldwin, and Ray Winstone give superb support. My favorite was Winstone, a guy I'm familiar with from ""Sexy Beast"" and ""The Proposition."" Despite the length of this movie, it keeps your interest all the way. I never got more bored... BUT....<br/><br/>THE BAD - ....I did get tired of all the f-words. Usually I could care less about that, but over 250 of them? Sometimes it seemed like every sentence. It was ludicrous and after awhile, your senses seemed bombarded with it, such as too much action can numb you. It just wasn't necessary to have it said THAT many times, and by practically everybody in the film. That's my other main complaint: every character in here is a scumbag: an untrustworthy person who will sleep with anyone and lie to everyone. Baldwin's character, as an FBI director, was the most ridiculous of them all. Both of these faults are typical for a Martin Scorcese film. He's pathetic. Sorry, Marty, but not every person in the world is a low-life as you must be. <br/><br/>OVERALL - Nonethelss, to be fair, his movies - like this one - are usually interesting, just the sordid stuff done to excess. If you can put up with the latter, you'll like this film a lot."

","Scorsese has very little faith in the viewers' intelligence with his constant use of symbolism and visual clichés. Half way through the movie the repeated killings became ""camp"" and the audience I was with started laughing out loud. By the end of the movie it had clearly become a comedy for this audience. The final scene, which I assume was meant to be serious, had most of us leaving the theater while still laughing.<br/><br/>Perhaps Scorsese meant it to be camp. If so it was a successful movie. If not, I would have to say rather than this being one of the ten best movies of the year it was one of the ten worst.<br/><br/>Matt Damon was lackluster at best, Nicholson, while acceptable, still seems to have to do is ""Here's Jack"" face at least once in every movie, and the director doesn't seem able to control him. DiCaprio, whom I have found generally to be a weak actor, did his best job to date with a poor script. Sheen phoned it in. Wahlberg, at least, was interesting.<br/><br/>If you like lots of ""Jesus symbols"", lots of Devil innuendos - get it? nudge nudge - an actual rat crawling along the balcony railing in the final scene in case you've missed all the references to all the rats in the movie, and finally what the constant cell phone has done to society message, you'll love this movie. If not, save your money. This is not the movie for you, trust me."
"Superunknovvn","10","10","18","8 December 2006"," One of Martin Scorsese's finest movies. Period.
","It's hard to start a review about a movie when you're still so excited you don't know where to begin. Let's take a deep breath for a moment... okay, and here we go:<br/><br/>Although he was snubbed by the Academy over and over again Scorsese never stopped working on ambitious projects. He just kept making movies, and they were all solid and good. Still, somehow Scorsese's work lost the importance and the excitement of the director's best movies. ""The Departed"" brings back a Scorsese that glues your eyes to the screen, that makes you forget time and space around you. This is a film that keeps you thrilled for the entire two and a half hours running time.<br/><br/>Truth be told, Scorsese doesn't reinvent himself with this movie. The violence, the callous dialog and the soundtrack including ""Gimme Shelter"" and other classic songs from the 60's and 70's - none of that is new territory. Still, it's a hell of a treat to watch the master at work. There's no one who makes a gangster movie like Scorsese. He understands exactly what the story needs, how it needs to be paced. Scorsese's direction serves the plot and not the other way round, which is what sets ""The Departed"" apart from some of his other masterpieces such as ""Raging Bull"".<br/><br/>Quite a lot of movieshave five, six or seven top stars in their casting list. In the end you're often let down because some of them don't really have important roles or only very limited screen time. In this movie all of the big names make something of their role: Mark Wahlberg as the amazingly unfriendly but unbribable cop, Martin Sheen as Nicholson's opponent and DiCaprio's father figure, Alec Baldwin as the frustratingly idiotic boss and Matt Damon as the slippery traitor. The two actors that make ""The Departed"" what it is, however, are, of course, Jack Nicholson and Leonardo DiCaprio.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson is just Jack Nicholson. He does what he always does, which means that he's great. He was born to play the bad guy. It's quite amazing that he hadn't worked with Scorsese before and it's like a fanboy's dream come true to see their collaboration working out so well. One can't help thinking: ""What if DeNiro had played the part?"". Sure, that might have been interesting, too, but it's doubtable whether DeNiro would have been able to pull off a villain as clownish and sexed up as Frank Costello.<br/><br/>Speaking of DeNiro, Leonardo DiCaprio clearly has proved himself a more than worthy successor as Scorsese's steady collaboration partner. His performance as the tormented undercover cop is once again outstanding. His hounded look alone creates half of the movies' tension. It's quite amazing how versatile this little babyface is. ""The Departed"" should convince even the last skeptics of this guy's talents.<br/><br/>At the age of 64 and after movie classics as legendary and influential as ""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"" and ""GoodFellas"", Martin Scorsese has delivered one of the very best movies of his entire career. Its characters may not be as iconic as the ones from the movies mentioned above, but the superb storytelling and the amazing acting in ""The Departed"" make this nothing less than a true masterpiece. It's Oscar-time, Baby!"

","Now I hate to be the devil's advocate here but I honestly think that the HK version was definitely much nicer. I guess the key difference lies in the fact that mafia and triads are very much a part of the Chinese social fabric, which makes it appealing to movie viewers. Also, Jack Nicolson did not really pull off the big, bad wolf role that well. He appeared to be more psychotic than evil. Also, what's the deal with his woman companion? She did not serve much purpose in building his character in the show. And there was just too much bloodshed. What's up with all the shooting-people-in-the-brain scenes? However, I must applaud the 3 leading actors (Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Wahlberg)They did pull off their roles very well. <br/><br/>For those who did not watch the original HK version Infernal Affairs, I highly recommend you to watch it.

","The Departed, a gangster flick with a twist, is one of the biggest disappointments to date. The film was overly laced with foul language that would make a sailor blush, extremely violent, and overly witty; something that I can look past if the story is there, but The Departed was all over the map. The dialog was forced and without life. The story was predictable. The direction was static. And the writing, well, let's just say I've read crossword puzzles that were more interesting. The only reason I can see why this movie was ever made, is that Jack, Leo, Matt, Alec, and Mark said they would do it. And the only reason they said they would do it is because Scorsese was directing and they trusted him. He let them down. This film has one thing going for it. It won't be in theaters too long. Don't bother renting the DVD either."
"j-lacerra","3","9","16","25 November 2008"," The Disappointed
","Despite all the hype, the Oscars, and the good reviews on this site, I found the Departed a great disappointment. The story never for one moment captured my interest. There was not one character that I cared what happened to. And, as it seemed that most the actors were doing their jobs quite well, I assumed it was either story or direction that was the problem with the movie, or maybe both.<br/><br/>I found that the Departed suffers from Tough Talkitis. That is when all the characters speak to each other with such tough, rude, arrogant attitudes, it becomes unreal (like a cop show on Fox). Why? Because no people anywhere interact with each other that way in real life. It's a synthetic movie-acting manner that actors take on to project toughness into their roles. It is too fake.<br/><br/>DiCaprio and Damon do reasonably well in their over-tough parts, DiCaprio especially. Sheen is restrained. Wahlberg is particularly annoying as the police sergeant who never is for one moment human. He is smug and coarse. No doubt the director shaped that characterization. Worse than all is the outrageous hamming of Nicholson, a lifelong favorite of mine. I never believed him for a second in this role as some sort of serious Joker gangster. Alec Baldwin is very good in one of his small roles, which he seems to specialize in these days.<br/><br/>The story is humdrum and boring. I began looking at my watch about 15 minutes into this epic. There is no humor, even less character development, annoying side shows (the shrink girlfriend), and no real tension in the tale. After one hour and forty-five minutes of this, I realized that I did not care about what happened to any of these characters, nor did I care how the 'story' turned out. So I shut it off.<br/><br/>Three stars for a good try (stretching it!)."
"DaveDiggler","7","9","16","13 August 2007"," Masking Good and Evil
","The 2006 Academy Award winning director Martin Scorsese has brought us some of the greatest films of all time to American Cinema and stands as one of the greatest directors to ever live. With films like ""Raging Bull,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" Goodfellas,"" and more recently ""The Aviator"" and ""Gangs of New York."" Marty now has the best film of 2006 to add to that list of greats with ""The Departed."" <br/><br/>""When you're facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?"" This is coldly and meticulously uttered by Boston Mob Boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). The significance of the memorable quote tells us that no matter who you are or what you've done; when death is staring you in the face, it takes no prisoners. Costello says this to a group of young impressionable kids and among these impressionable kids is Frank Costello's next and future pawn- the wise, savvy, charismatic, charming, and slick talking Colin Sullivan played by Matt Damon, who gives his best acting performance of his career on the heels of another great performance in Robert De Niro's, ""The Good Shepherd"". From the start we see Colin headed down a path of corruption and deception as he is groomed to become a spy in the Massachusetts State Police for Frank Costello and his Boston mafia. His counterpart, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), is a cadet who has been kicked out of the academy and the only way he will ever be able to serve the commonwealth is by going undercover and infiltrating Frank Costello's crew for Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen). Queenan and Staff Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) are the only two people that know Billy is a cop. Academy Award nominee, Mark Wahlberg does a great job as the fast talking, always ready for anything, humorous cop that will make you think this is a comedy at certain points in the film instead of a thrilling drama. Dignam can be cold, callous, and most of all, a dirty cop like the rat he hunts for in SIU.<br/><br/>As Billy and Colin rise in their respective fields, the tension mounts as suspicion in both the State Police and Costello's crew heats up in search for the rat(s). There are twists and turns in every direction. As they become more and more aware of each others presence the anticipation becomes almost unbearable as both look to find each other and take each other out to protect their own skins.<br/><br/>The film brings in plot twist after plot twist and manages to maintain its structure thanks to a perfect script by Academy Award winner, William Monahan. The two opposing figures in the film- Colin and Billy- frantically search and scheme their way to the top all the while sharing a sexual relationship with a psychiatrist, named Madolyn. Both characters fall for her and both unknowingly become twisted in a love triangle that only she knows about, but has no clue how grave her situation is. The motives for each falling in love with the psychiatrist is something to pay close attention to. Look for the reasons Colin wants a girl, and look for the reasons Billy wants a girl. One is putting on an act at all times, and both men struggle to keep their identity in check.<br/><br/>Costello puts fear in the heart of both Billy and Colin as he starts to question everyone around him as the heat is turned up on him. Jack Nicholson gives one of his greatest performances of his career, and an Oscar worthy one at that. The psychological fear and mind games that he plays with both Colin and Billy make them fear that their conscience might be getting the best of them. This is something to truly admire and become utterly stunned by as both actors do such a great job of portraying the paranoia. Costello is not your typical gang leader. He is upper class with a little L Street mentality still left in him. He like's to go and listen to the opera. He loves fine wines and lobster dinners (with a side of bloody hand that could make anyone queasy- especially the nervous wreck that is Billy Costigan.). He also doesn't mind indulging in a little annoying fly, that may be crossing his face at the wrong time, or even a little coke to set the mood so that he's comfortably numb. He has his flaws as every man does, but Frank doesn't recognize any weaknesses because he's just so good at making a habit of getting away with murder. The very deep characters surrounding Costello, along with Costello himself, make this a ""must see."" We watch the drama unfold as the pressure on both Colin and Billy mounts as their guilt of deception and criminal activity makes both men start looking for a safe way out. They realize they both can only take so much and neither sees a way out that doesn't result in death. Colin wants to become a political influence in the community as he goes to law school at nights while Billy just wants his identity back. Neither are able to depart from Costello as he has a strangle hold on their every day lives. This is where we see the characters become three-dimensional and where we start to gravitate towards the characters- good or bad. We see what they are and how far they've fallen. Their weaknesses make them so humane that it's impossible to not feel or root for them.<br/><br/>As the body count rises and the pressure is turned up one notch at a time before the final standoff the film becomes mesmerizing. The shocking and surprising ending will leave some pleasantly surprised or some looking for answers and disappointed. For most directors this would be their crowning achievement, but for Martin Scorsese, it just another classic to add the resume."

I think all the big name actors in this movie delivered highly-energetic, but completely boring performances. That is to say their idea of character development in this movie basically consisted of constant shouting. Nicholsen was cartoonish, acting less like his character and more like, well, Jack Nicholsen. I never believed him as a crime boss, and I never believed Damon, DiCaprio or Walberg in their roles either. <br/><br/>A lot happens in this movie. A lot of people die graphic deaths and a lot of people swear a lot. A lot of people say ""Boston"" things like ""Boston"" people say them. A lot happens in this movie, but nothing interesting happens. I find it interesting that many of the most negative reviews of this movie come from real life cops and others who actually have some firsthand experience with the ""gritty"" urban life this movie purports to portray."

","I went to see this hoping Scorsese would do Infernal Affairs (the original) enough justice for me to class the film as 'mediocure'. But I was horribly wrong. Scorsese instead filled the film with as much cheese as possible. The original was not a gangster film, that The Departed turned out to be. Instead it was an emotional film about the lives that undercover officers must go through. If we'd wanted to see a gangster film, there's plenty out there (all of which are better than The Departed anyway). I was amazed that so many good actors (such as Jack Nicholson and Martin Sheen) signed up for this.<br/><br/>Anyone who has seen Infernal Affairs would probably feel the same way as I do. If you have seen the original, it would be a complete waste of money and time to watch this. If you haven't seen any of the originals, I would strongly recommend that you at least see one of them.

Not easy to do away with that when you tell a story for the cinema. Granted, it’s pretty well acted, especially by Leonardo Di Caprio. But what does this movie say about life? What is the point? Also who is the protagonist? Whom are we supposed to identify with? Logically, it should be Billy (Leonardo Di Caprio) who is the honest cop undercover in the mob. But since we often follow Colin whose character has been given Matt Damon’s pretty mug, it’s not that clear. The double romance is not milked at all. It’s just shown in parallel. And on top of that too many characters play a double game. Even the bad guy (Jack Nicholson) is an informer for the FBI. One of the thugs doesn’t turn Billy in although he has understood who he is. If “The departed” is 43 on the IMDb top list, before “City lights” , “Groundhog day” and “Mr Smith goes to Washington” we are in big trouble. Sad, sad, sad."

","Well I'm a fan of Scorsese but I just didn't think this was all that great.<br/><br/>It was long, had a lot of well-known actors, had a lot of profanity and some short scenes of violence...but it just didn't rise to all the hype. This film just didn't have the depth that other films had. I never really felt involved in this film; unlike other Scorsese films like Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, or Casino. Even Gangs of New York drew you in more than The Departed. Perhaps it's because this is a remake or maybe Scorsese has just lost his touch, who knows. <br/><br/>The problem I had with the plot is that for 2 hours, there's a quasi-cat and mouse game between the police and Nicholson's organization. Both have moles and both are trying to find them. Then of course there's the other plot line of the police actually trying to bring down the mob boss. Then suddenly, there's a random shootout at the dockyard where all of Nicholson's goons are killed including Nicholson by his own spy within the police because Nicholson was an FBI informant? The final 15 minutes or so are just too much...everyone dies. While surprising, once you think about it, this was really a dumb move...you end up wondering why you just watched the movie. Consider the exact opposite and you'll understand why...everyone lives and nothing changes, kind of dumb when you think about it.<br/><br/>Another point was the abandoned romance sub-plot. In reality, you could have left that whole part out and it would not have affected the film one bit. And why would this woman who just moved in with Mark Wahlberg decide to cheat on him with Leo Decaprio? It was like they were going to make that an important part of the plot but it ended up being nothing.<br/><br/>As for the actors. I think at this point in his career, Jack Nicholson cannot be any other character except for the deranged socio-path with sarcastic lines. Comedy, drama, you name it, he's the same guy. Mark Walhberg did an okay job but it seemed like they wanted to establish that he was the stereotypical tough-talking Boston cop really quickly. He was overdone in my opinion. Leonardo Decaprio has already played this role...Gangs of New York. Matt Damon was decent. The rest were okay.<br/><br/>I think had Scorsese worked with the plot some, casted some lesser known actors like he used to do and gone more in-depth on the characters, it would have been better. In my opinion, if this movie had been made by anyone else, it would not have even been nominated for an Oscar.<br/><br/>I've tried to watch it again, thinking maybe I would like it better...by the time Matt Damon joins the special unit, I was done...I popped it out and watched re-runs."
"fdbjr","4","8","14","7 October 2006"," One Negative Vote (Spoilers)
","This movie is sensational 95% of the way through. Di Caprio, whose skills as an actor are grossly underrated, is sensational, Damon is very good, and Jack Nicholson is endurable. (It would be nice to see a movie in which a director actually controls him, as Roman Polanski did in Chinatown. He is over-the-top now in every role, and sometimes it jars as it did here.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the 5 percent that fails is the last 5 percent of the movie. Did any of the critics who are extolling this movie notice that the ending is absolutely incoherent? Let me walk through it.<br/><br/>1. Costigan, the Di Caprio character, gives his girl friend an envelope that she is not supposed to open unless something happens to him. This is done with tremendous meaning and significance. It is, however, the last that is heard of the envelope.<br/><br/>2. Next, a cd arrives for her with an audio of an incriminating conversation between Sullivan (the Damon character) and Costello (Nicholson). Huh?? If Costigan was going to do this, why did he give her the envelope? And what became of it?<br/><br/>Costigan explains that it was Costello's practice always to make tapes of conversations and store them at his lawyer's office. Costigan stole them and made the cd he sent the girlfriend. Huh?? This is the first we have heard of the lawyer, or the office, or the tapes. Why would a gangster do this? More to the point, how did Costigan know of it? None of this is explained. It all develops totally out of the blue in the last ten minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>3. Next Costigan lures Sulliavn up to a rooftop, and cuffs him, announcing his intent to arrest him. Huh?? Why didn't he send these incriminating cd's to the DA, or the police chief, or the Boston Globe? If what Costigan wants to do is arrest, why on God's green earth does he not just walk into the police station and show this mountain of evidence to somebody?<br/><br/>More than this, Costigan has called to the scene a friend he went to the police academy with, with whom he exchanged a joke or two in one of the earliest scenes, two hours before. Huh?? Why him?? Why not Dignam (Mark Wahlberg's character) or - as mentioned - any regular police officer?<br/><br/>4. Costigan gets the cuffs on Sullivan, takes him down in an elevator, and without warning is shot through the head. Now you have to see the whole movie, but this is just script hari-kiri. As much as these Hollywood types like to flaunt their world-weary cynicism, this story requires a heroic ending. For two hours we have suffered along with Costigan, and di Caprio is really good. We do suffer. All of the emotional momentum is in that character's direction. There is an elementary principle of story telling violated here - you don't bump your protagonist off on a whim.<br/><br/>5. And boy, is this ever a whim. Costigan's killer turns out to be ANOTHER corrupt cop owned by Costello. Huh???? This movie is premised on the notion that there is ONE police mole, ONE gangster mole, and the two men are trying to find each other. We've been watching that story line unfold for two hours. The existence of a second insider throws doubt on nearly every scene that has gone before. (I am not going to go back and detail that point by point.) The second mole is so tangental that I could not recall him in a single scene before this sudden appearance.<br/><br/>I could go on and on, for there are a couple of other twists every bit as bizarre and out of the blue as the ones described. But it is late, and you get the idea. I had the sense that someone on the Scorsese team could not stomach the obvious ending, where Costigan gets some sort of vindication and the girl. Well, that would be old-fashioned, but there are story lines that demand it, and this is one of them. In any case, it would be better than the absurd mish-mash of a climax that completely destroys the value of this movie."

Wahlburg's performance, though excellent, is really little more than a cameo, and he has actually done better work (e.g. his roles in The Yards and Perfect Storm). But the Academy won't give him an Oscar for this, especially since he is up against a few Academy favorites and a veteran (Arkin). While I do not think this is Scorsese's best film, nor the best film of the year, it is one of the finest serious crime thrillers I have seen in a very long time.<br/><br/>The film is set in Boston, and relies on stereotypes of that city and its ethnic groups that only slightly detract from the film's believability. Despite the fertile ground for psychological examination, the film's slightly absurd pace (DiCaprio becomes a trusted confidant of a crime boss in 3-4months???) the film is not a character study, and, rather, relies on archetypes of good cop/bad cop which are employed pretty consistently and to varying degrees throughout the film. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio gives a performance that exceeds his own high standards, opposite Matt Damon in a life and death cat and mouse game. DiCaprio is undercover for the police infiltrating organized crime, Damon is undercover for an organized crime boss (Nicholson) infiltrating the police. Vera Farmiga is excellent as the police psychologist who ends up connected to both. Damon also gives a nice, edgy, though a little detached performance, and stalwarts Nicholson, Baldwin and Sheen do some of their best work in years. The Boston accents only occasionally slip into exaggeration (and surprisingly - are only over-done by actors who have lived in Boston!).<br/><br/>The acting is generally outstanding. The cinematography is above average - there are too many straight pans and rhythmic fast cuts, but the action is always well framed and nicely emphasized by the camera. The direction is, as with most Scorsese work, tight, economical and clean. The script is excellent, and, in my opinion, is likely to give Babel a run for its money for the adapted screenplay Oscar. Contrary to some opinions I have seen here, I did not feel that the soundtrack added much to the film. In fact, if I were to fault the film for anything it would be sound. <br/><br/>Excellent film, well worth seeing if you can handle the nihilism and violence it portrays."

","I went to The Departed last night on the strength of some of the reviews I'd read. And while it was a fairly good movie, it is not great. In my opinion, Scorsese has taken an interesting story and a very good cast and created a somewhat-better-than-mediocre picture. The photography is very good, the shots well done for the most part, but he has made some odd choices. The most puzzling is the Chinese/microchip issue. This could have and, in my opinion, should have been omitted. It doesn't move the plot, it doesn't add depth or breadth to the story and it doesn't help to develop any of the characters.<br/><br/>Some of the acting was uneven as well. I love some of Matt Damon's work, but I never felt an emotional connection with this character. I had the sense that I was watching him act. Even his accent isn't consistent, changing from the Boston Southie he displayed in Good Will Hunting to Midwestern.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson is Jack Nicholson, and that's the problem with his portrayal. Unconvincing.<br/><br/>There are other issues I have with this movie, but on the positive side, Mark Wahlberg and Alce Baldwin are both quite enjoyable to watch. And by far the best performance, without question, is given by Leonardo DiCaprio. This young man can act! He has a way of becoming the character and his performance here is worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>So, my suggestion is to go and see this movie, but don't set your expectations at the level suggested by some of the almost hysterically glowing reviews. If you do, you will be disappointed."

","One could look at The Departed and can get the idea that this is less a remake than it is a re-imagining of the riveting crime Drama INTERNAL AFFAIRS.It's more of an inspiration than it is a direct lift off.The story may be the same,but there's a vast difference between Scorsese's epic and the Hong Kong Classic.And for that,this film is truly a fascinating look at the ugly worlds of the two sides of the law.<br/><br/>Rookie Cop Billy Costigan goes undercover and is assigned to work for Crime Boss Frank Costello and get really close to him to deliver some information about his crimes.Costigan gains Costello's trust and gets involved a lot deeper in his crimes.On the other hand ,a rising police office is actually a mole in the department, informs everything about the Police Department's movements to Costello.But things get deadly when both men are about to have their secrets exposed and the Mobs and the cops discover that there is a mole/informer,and a traitor who's getting things messed up on both sides.And then they both try to save themselves from each other and the Mobs.They slowly get confused with their dual identities and things get deadlier for the both of them as their delicate balance with the Mobs and the Cops gets them too involved with the world they're into.While both men are in love with the same women,one of them has to suffer the consequences.Leading to a shocking conclusion to this epic.There are intense scenes of violence and action and twists that you never see coming.<br/><br/>A Martin Scorsese film is always dark,graphically violent,raw,hard edged,and filled with memorable powerhouse performances.And this film is no exception.The Departed is something new and different .Its complex plot unfolds to an even more powerful story ,with characters colliding with one another and facing terrifying situations.Scorsese shows that what it is like to be a cop.Your life is in danger 24/7 ,and that every minute is a risk when you're undercover.Your only fear is having your true identity be exposed.And then,it's all up to the person who's holding a gun to your face.<br/><br/>It's a tough film he carved out,and to be honest it's a perfect example of how a remake should be made.It's actually as good as the original,even better at times.And shows that when it is helled by a legendary director who knows what he is doing the results are always great for a remake.To compare the original and this one,I would say this one is slightly better than the original.Otherwise,it's just as brilliant as the Hong Kong version.But the thing about this film is that even if you've seen the Hong Kong version,you'll still be blown away by the Hollywood version.However,comparisons are inevitable.<br/><br/>What else can you ask for when you have a cast this big?I could only recall one such film that had such a huge cast at the moment,and that was Ocean's 11.Where that film didn't do full justice with its cast,this film makes use of its actors and gives you a rare piece of entertainment that is thought-provoking and ingenious.Scorsese really have given a great piece of work.I wouldn't say this is his best work ever,his best directed film was GANGS OF NEW YORK ,which he should've won an Osacar for,but it certainly is one his best work since Goodfellas in the crime genre.It's got the usual trademarks of the director.The script is fantastic.The writer has done a terrific job in this remake.It makes the film a standout from the original.Rich CinematographyThe cinematography is rich,and the editing is sharp. The Score is superb,Scorsese's choice of music is great.And the look of the film and its sets are brilliant,getting us old and new Boston.And lots of cell phone use.<br/><br/>Well,you're wondering who's the show stealer out of a giant cast like this.Everyone got to do something with full satisfaction.But the real standout here is Di Caprio and Damon.The actors have only gotten better and better recently and here they pull it off again.They are complex and tough characters to play and they play their part brilliantly.Di Caprio's emotional stature is strong.He manages to bring the character's fear and confusion with full conviction.You do feel sad in the end for what happens to him.You will be shocked and it was unfair for the character.Damon on the other hand is superb as the mole who informs the crime bosses.Their face off and rivalries are intense and suspenseful.And of course,Jack Nicholson couldn't have had more fun doing a film like this than doing another sad comedy.His and Scorsese's collaboration is another reason,altogether a different reason, to watch this film.At this age,he could still pull off juicy performances,and do all that he's done on screen really makes you wonder if he's ever gonna do another film with Scorsese again.And his over the top performance is really fun to watch.Wahlberg is great in his role as the tough cop who talks tough to his co-officers.Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen are both terrific.Vera Farimiga was a real surprise as a women who falls in love with both leading men.She plays her part really well and you kind of feel sad that why didn't she chose the character that deserved her. <br/><br/>Of course, this film is not without its flaws,and I expected it to end with a bang,whereas the writer seemed to have abandoned the script's energy and just concluded it somewhat like the original film.It was an uneven conclusion.And I just wasn't sure why was it necessary to do what the writer did to the main characters in the end.But regardless of that the rest of the film is a tour de force raw drama.<br/><br/>A modern classic and a definite must-see of the year.This film can count on its chances of being at the Oscars next year.A sure fire success.The Departed is the most exciting,fun and thrilling dark crime Drama of the year.And it's fully satisfying and very entertaining.Highly Recommended."

He acted so nervous and it was obvious. But you know what? I didn't know what anybody was supposed to be by the end of the movie either. Way too confusing. To me this movie was boring, complicated, and nothing amazing. Definitely doesn't live up to all the hype it gets. One thing I did like was Nicholson as a mob boss.

","Film takes place in Boston. It deals with two men (Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon) who are both working to bring down a crime lord (Jack Nicholson). Problem is they're both working for different agencies and neither knows about the other. Things quickly go out of control.<br/><br/>OK--this is not Martin Scorsese's best film. That goes to ""Raging Bull"" and ""Good Fellas"". However it is one of his best. The plot has many twists and turns and surprises I didn't see coming. There's excellent use of music throughout and Scorsese really manages to capture the mood and feeling of Boston (not easy to do). Also--since this is a Scorsese film--the word ""f***"" is used a few hundred times and the violence is VERY extreme and bloody. This isn't for weak stomaches. My only complaints here are that the movie is too long--it has one climax too many and some lousy acting lessens it. DiCaprio is excellent in his role. I was very impressed--I never thought much of him as an actor but now I've changed my opinion. Nicholson, Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen are good too. Vera Farmiga holds her own in a male dominated cast. But Matt Damon is a blank in one of the main roles. His face never changes expression and I didn't know how to take him. Mark Wahlberg is bad too. How he got an Academy Award nomination for this I'll never know. He's as blank as Damon and just swears non stop for no reason and keeps giving obscene finger gestures. I was just hoping somebody would kill him off soon. He wasn't playing a character--he was doing a caricature. Those two bad performances lessen this. Also some of the cast fake Boston accents pretty well (Damon and Wahlberg are from the area so they didn't have to fake it).<br/><br/>It got Best Picture and Best Director Academy Awards because Martin Scorsese was long overdue for both. So--it is worth seeing but not Scorsese's best by a long shot. I give it an 8."
"tmojoman","4","6","10","26 February 2007"," Ridiculously Over-hyped
","Martin Scorcese's ""The Departed"" won the Oscar for Best Picture last night (2/25/07). Simply by that large achievement my review will be posted here, just to get off my chest a few personal opinions of this film.<br/><br/>This film by large was applauded by virtually every critic that has a area to express a view for movies. While that alone will not be enough to get me excited about a movie (especially nowadays), I am a big fan of Scorcese's work, particularly ""Raging Bull"", which I believe to be the best film to have come out in the last 25 years. So to say that I was looking forward to ""The Departed"", with it's dream male cast of Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Matt Damon (criminally overlooked for a Best Supporting Actor Nomination), Alec Baldwin, and Leonardo DiCaprio, would be a bit of an understatement.<br/><br/>To save some unnecessary details about the film (which, incidentally, if you look at any other reviews, you would have seen already), I will simply say that this film suffered from (largly):<br/><br/>Scatterbrained, attention-deficit disorder editing/screen writing, where the average scene seemed to be all of 14 seconds long, especially in the first 45 minutes...<br/><br/>Deriviative, plagiarized writing that Scorcese has done (much better) before. Gangster picture with violent, non-sensical action meaning nothing, and rapid-fire scenes with music loud and in your face (gee, haven't I heard that Rolling Stones song before?) Undeveloped, unlikeable lead character in DiCaprio. There is no substance to his character and doesn't receive on bit of concern from the audience-goer. Also, while he is a very capable actor, he is just still far too young looking to head a clearly very adult-natured film.<br/><br/>The only thing that saves this movie is the mildly-surprising ending and Matt Damon's unheralded work. He is truly a gifted actor and deserves more acclaim for his work.<br/><br/>4/10 rating."

It seemed that it was not capable of ending until every last character had ""departed"" (pun intended). Alec Baldwin was totally wasted on a character who simply revolved around other characters. Martin Sheen added his name to the credits but remained well in the background.

"danielstephenclarke","3","6","10","31 October 2006"," The Departed - hard to like.
","It was with no little trepidation that I arrived to see this latest offering from Scorsese. There are few directors in his class in modern cinema and he is certainly one you would watch directing traffic, but I can only report that this film is massively disappointing. A strong ensemble cast promised much and almost to a man they delivered massively, and here I think lies the clue to this Curate's egg. It occurred to me that Jack Nicholson delivers a performance that was at best ill-conceived and at worst massively self-indulgent to the detriment of the film. As a result the Nicholson character is a shocking turn off, maybe only rivalled by Ray Winstone's leaden Mr French. The remainder of the cast deliver strong performances, actually exquisite in the case of Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin, perhaps this is an attempt to distance themselves from a flaccid core? For me Leonardo Di Caprio and Matt Damon are serviceable as the central characters (which for Di Caprio is as good as it gets but that is possibly a matter of personal taste) but this doesn't detract from what is ultimately an underwhelming film. Its worth mentioning that the level of disappointment I felt at this film was such that I had to go and watch it again to confirm that I hadn't grossly mis-read the film, sadly the second viewing simply confirmed my lack of satisfaction."
"youramy1","10","6","10","19 October 2006"," The Departed is a REAL movie!!
","I almost never see movies twice (there are too many out there I've missed the first time), but I saw The Departed twice in 2 days and might see it a third time. First of all, I'm a retired cop; did undercover work; investigated racketeers (most dead now, some still masquerading as fine citizens). DiCaprio blew me away (missed his other movies, now I'll go back and see them including Gangs of New York; missed The Aviator, too.)Okay, I saw the Titanic; didn't want to in the first place, hope he got a lot of money for it b/c it's something he's probably been trying to shake for a long time. But I digress....Good Will Hunting is one of my favorite movies, so I've bonded with Matt Damon from that and enjoyed him since. Obviously, Di Caprio had the better role but I cannot imagine anyone playing it better (I'm sure that excellent directing helped). What got me was how inner anger drove that character. Even when he engaged with Madolyn, he didn't go soft (okay, that sounds like a reference to Madolyn's problem with Sullivan). In watching the movie the second time, I thought what drove Sullivan was his inner child/core was good and the fact that he took the bait from Costello as a child and was groomed to be bad really did not come easily to his sense of himself, thus his ""problem"" with Madolyn. Of course, someone I saw the movie with didn't catch that ""problem"" at all. As Sullivan lay on the bed and told Madolyn he thought they could start fresh in a new city, I saw that all the deceit had just about broken Sullivan, unlike Costello who would not live any other way. There definitely was a theme of virility running through the 3 major characters: Costello had only the appearance of it/had lost it; Sullivan lacked it and only Costigan had it (I choose to believe the baby was his). I really appreciated Scorcese's movement from one character/action to the next; I heard some comments that it was choppy (not here) but it brought the ""two boys"" in sharp contrast. I saw Sullivan's quiet desperation and Costigan's explosive desperation more acutely. The lack of gore and lack of explicit sex was also appreciated; this brought a crispness to the pace of the movie. While I could never get away from Nicholson the actor and think of Costello as Costello, I do appreciate that it wasn't De Niro (one of my least favorite major actors) and it wasn't Pacino (one of my favorite major actors who plays this type of role too often). The one thing lacking for me was why Costello adored Costigan to the point of having his lawyer send the tapes to him as well as keeping him in his crew because he had plenty of crew without taking in a possible rat. (The cutting room floor could probably help me on that one). But then a lot of the movie had cop and bad guy incongruities and one has to give fictional movies poetic license... I hope the Academy will recognize DiCaprio and Scorcese. Kudos to Baldwin,Wahlberg and Sheen and Vera F. She was mesmerizing. Baldwin has great delivery (loved him in The Cooler)."
"stormrider65","4","6","10","15 October 2006"," Departed is Never close to being Good.
","Whoever says The Departed is Good, brilliant or Even Purfect is clueless about how a good movie should be.<br/><br/>10 points to prove Departed isn't close to being a 'good' movie.<br/><br/>1) The entire show was unbalanced when Jack Nicholsan allegedly changed his script, on top of the demand for a 'meatier' role. Scorsese was believed to have rewritten the script to suit him, and to make Jack agree in joining the cast. This led to awkward focus on him for the first half of the movie. Totally unncessary and time-wasting.<br/><br/>2) Poor choice of Leo's mentor. A better choice would be Robert DeNiro. Someone tough in appearance, but with an angel's heart. Sheen jus looked too too soft and powerless.<br/><br/>3)This remake took in a few points from 'Infernal II', where Tony Leung's (Leo) character's family history was explained in detail. Leung's dad, in the younger days, was much a baddie than the present Jack (traid gang leader). Thus Jack, when lunching with Leo, said, ""your dad/ Uncle would kill me and my family if he saw me sitting here with you."" However, what the film didn't do was to show the viewers HOW would Sheen guide Leo into meeting Jack. All the show did was to show Leo beat up a few guys & the next moment viola, Jack was lookin up for Leo, by a short intro from 'Mr. French'. All the intimate, heartfelt exchanges between Leo & his mentor was totally absent.<br/><br/>4) The show was BORING for the first hour, with lots of talking and talking, a couple of fights and 'fuck-you', and that's it. No wit-for-wit, game-for-game' kind of moves that have the 'Infernal Affairs' so famous and 'cutting edge'. It was Only in the last half an hour that the show, borrowed heavily from the original, featured a mental game/ fight between the two male leads.<br/><br/>5) Also, in 'Infernal Affairs II', the feud between Jack's and Sheen's characters was explained. That resulted in a long-time mutual understanding for each other. Here, Jack and Sheen were seen only exchanging superficial talks - ""I will get you, Frank."" ""Get me if you can, Queen."" Duh. My choice of Robert DeNiro fits perfectly into a scene: Frank sipping coffee with Queen (DeNiro) at an English café, both chatting casually about their lives and memories, but with an undercurrent running fiercely in the air. Both know exactly what each other thinks and wants, and laid down all their cards on the table, except for their own lead.It would be much enjoyable to see these two tough guys hitting hard on the other.<br/><br/>6) Wahlberg's Dignam wasn't, as someone said, non-existent in the original 'Infernal'. There was a character 'Inspector Cheung', played by Ng Ting Yip in the HK version. A powerful, shoot-from-the-hip kind of cop who stood by Leo's mentor. Dignam was created with some motive, BUT alas, what he did was idiotic: resigned but not contacting Leo? WTF was he thinking? 7) The fact that the show ended with all people dead, well except for Dignam clearly shows that there's no thread for any Part II extension. Just that simple. It's certainly NOT as someone commented, a brilliant move by Scorsese. Geez..some people just like topping Scorsese's head with tall hats and praises foolishly.<br/><br/>8) Someone actually 'revealed' that the scriptwriter deliberately did NOT watch the original Infernal while writing the Departed script, so as not to get too close with it. If this is true, he should be given two bloody knocks on his d!ck-head. Departed went so departed that the whole tension was absent for almost 2/3 of the show.<br/><br/>9) Another commentator said Damon's character Sullivan was empty and deviated from the Infernal's. He was spot-on on this; in Infernal, Andy Lau wanted to be a good guy, right from the beginning. He always had wanted to be Out of the triad and be a good cop, a good man. Thus he killed all who would threaten his position. In Departed, we see Sullivan killing for virtually nothing. Did he feel remorseful? Or guilty? Nooo...a bloody empty soul created by the 'brilliant' Scorsese.<br/><br/>10) The WORST of all: the classic scene of both leads pitting their wits against each other in the infamous two gangs' transaction. In Infernal, Leung (Leo) was using Morse Code (a brilliant move) via an antenna to contact his mentor, while on the other hand Andy (Damon) was to use comp to send out text messages to his boss for notification. There was an info leakage and Leung's mentor made a switch in radio frequency and called for a retreat, but to realise at the last sec that the transaction would be at a beach. Immediately the retreat was again cancelled with full force to head for the beach, whilst the triad boss would call for a disposal of Cocaine. All happened in a breath's time of few mins. This, in comparison to Departed, is two knots higher. Departed's scene of 'no camera' installed for the back-exit was laughable and idiotic."

Unfortunately, this remake is a major letdown given the star casts and the director.<br/><br/>First, there was lack of emotional development in the Departed. There were just too few emotional developments for Billy to explain his later actions.<br/><br/>Then, the Departed introduced a major plot flaw that the undercover police Collin should have another police Dignam who could identify him. So the ending part where Billy telling Collin that no one could identify him was simply wrong. Consequently, the actions taken afterward made no sense.<br/><br/>The ending of the Departed was also bad (compared to Internal Affairs) in that no sequels can be made as all main characters are dead. There was no rooms left for imagination.<br/><br/>I would recommend watching Internal Affairs instead of watching this movie."

","I'm not sure about you, but there is something I find comforting upon hearing the words a Martin Scorsese picture. Like a good home cooked meal, you are in for a treat with all the trimmings. With a Scorsese picture you can bet your 'Color of money' that you will be edutained with his amazing cinema technique, references to classical Hollywood and international filmmakers, and a soundtrack that has you anxiously trying to free up space on your MP3 player.<br/><br/>Not including the bloated but interesting 'Gangs of New York', The Departed sees Mr Scorsese return to the gangster genre since his 1995 masterpiece 'Casino.' More than just a remake of the well received Hong Kong film 'Infernal Affairs' The Departed sees Leonardo Dicaprio as Billy Costigan, a middle class Boston Irish police cadet officer, brought in to become a mole and work undercover in an effort to bring down a local mob and their boss Frank Costello played by the devil incarnate (Jack Nicholson) The engaging plot has a complexity added to it in the form of Colin Sullivan, played by an in form Matt Damon. Looked after as a child by the Costello character and with a life almost the exact flip side to Dicapro's Costigan, Sullivan has also become a cop, only he has been recruited by Nicholson to be his eyes and ears in the department enabling him to see around the longest corners.<br/><br/>A web made from the finest lies, wiretaps, frantic mobile phone whispers, sex, violence and deceit is spun, as both Costigan and Sullivan are caught up in it, trying to snuff one another out. The Departed is filled with wonderful moments that highlight the mastery of director Scorsese.<br/><br/>A scene in which Costigan tails a paranoid Sullivan through a seedy China town is fantastic, cut with switchblade precision from regular collaborator and genius editor Thelma Schoonmaker. Another is a shootout in a standard gangster genre warehouse, Scorsese stages the action with an assured eye and the sound is brilliant as you hear shots and screams echo out like an orchestra of death.<br/><br/>Signature pans, swishes, wipes and zooms are all here, with broody and sombre photography from Michael Ballhaus. Learn to direct watching Scorsese and his amazing crew, even when people are talking the camera moves with purpose and style keeping it interesting and within the needs of the story.<br/><br/>William Monahan must take a lot of credit for this film. His script has taken the structure of the original but flavours it all on his own with quotable for years to come and an underlying pathos and humour amongst the swearing and shouting. The film is so full of menace and testosterone the woman next to me in the cinema sprouted hair on her tongue.<br/><br/>With wonderful support from Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, Vera Farmiga and Martin Sheen The Departed is the best Hollywood film of the year.<br/><br/>See you at the Oscars."

","What a disappointment. Fun level of zero. Realisism near zero. Cops that do nothing but constantly scream the f-word and get in fistfights with one another at the office all day, every day. Apparently assaulting an officer is OK if you are an officer. A couple of Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies worth of pointless gore. Uselessly jarringly filmed like a bad CSI episode. And if I want to see that many people realistically killed I'll rent the entire Faces of Death series. This movie is junk. It should have been classified as horror so I could have avoided it.

The film is well paced - it does not have the usually present it most films of 150 minutes plus duration that sagging spot - no way could you cut a frame of this film.

The lead role of Sam cannot be replicated by Nicholson and the fact they changed the name from Infernal Affairs to The Departed is shocking.<br/><br/>The basic story is there is a rat working for the triads in a high ranking police position and there is police man undercover is the triads. The two know each others moves but don't know who each other are which makes the film extremely tense and this makes it a superb movie.<br/><br/>Also the outfits and characteristics of the original have not been carried over.Basically this is a Hollywood SHAM and although I respect Scorsese as a director, the movie is not good thanks to him, its good thanks to the original.<br/><br/>Watch the original Infernal Affairs.

Aside from the phenomenal acting and the satisfying conclusion, I was only impressed with the simplicity of which a complex double-rat story was told. I never felt lost trying to keep track of who worked for who and who was spying on who, because the filmmakers laid it out so clearly for me."

","Sad... It's so sad... This film, The Departed, has an 8'5. However, Infernal Affairs, the film that was the ""inspiration"" of this awful remake has just an 8'1... It's really sad finding one of the most amazing and relevant directors of all times, Mr. Scorsese, father of masterpieces like Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Raging Bull or Casino, making the remake of an unknown Hong Kong trilogy. What happened? You see DiCaprio, Damon, Nicholson and all the other stars and you have a masterpiece? That's not what I thought cinema was. I've seen both versions, in fact I have it on DVD. The Departed is a great movie, that's true. But it's nothing more. I can't understand why Martin changed so many things and he still thought it would be the same story but told in a different words. This is not about Italian Mafia!!! This is about Chinese mafia, and that's not the same!!! Please, everyone who enjoyed The Departed: Take a look on Infernal Affairs. Or ask Tarantino about what he thinks about this remake... The film is OK, but there's no color between The Departed and IA. Salud!"
"cugel_the_clever","3","5","8","14 February 2009"," would be OK if it were not a remake - just my personal opinion
","When I started watching the movie I had no idea it was based on IA so it seemed like an okay flick. Not great by any stretch of the imagination but a passable B-movie with A-list actors. Mark Whalberg's character was annoying and just seemed too unstable and unfit for his position. Still marginally entertaining as I was not expecting a serious cinema and paying more attention to the visuals and Jack Nicholson's familiar antics. Once it became clear that this was a remake the whole impression just totally crumbles as you just notice only deficiencies and see no added value. To be fair it's not a one star movie characters are two-dimensional but there's some entertainment and shock value in it. Finally movies are goods to be sold let's be honest how many people among the average US movie going public have heard or watched IA? Like one performer said once ""people will gobble it up anyway"" so that's another McMovie"

","for reasons that many others have pointed out before me, this movie was horrible. i could only apologize to my girlfriend for making her watch it with me, because i was so exited about it after watching infernal affairs. firstly, on the film on its own, its horrible. gratuitous, unclassy, and just plain bad. i was bored throughout the first 1/3 of the movie. though DiCaprio did a decent job, i do not think any other character was played very well. Nicholson does a poor job portraying a mob boss, and comes off more of a schizophrenic crack junkie than the leader of an organized crime syndicate. Alec Baldwin's character was neither funny, nor appropriate for the movie, and i believe mark walbergs character is completely unnecessary except to come back and kill Matt Damon in the end, which i think is a poor change to the story line. the ending was also excessive. and except the the change in storyline, that was looking at the movie without comparing it to IA. IA is just executed much better, with more class, and more intelligently. watch it, instead of this Hollywood trash. this movie definitely has scorsese's mark, but it does not fit the theme and tone of the movie and the story. watch IA. ditch the departed."

","This movie had so much potential, so much star power; the directing, the casting: everything. But I hated it. Why? It was so incredibly dirty. Every other word is f**k this or c**t that. Jack Nicholson's character owns pornographic theaters, the sex is over the top, and the blood is a little excessive. I have a hard time believing this story because everything is just so over the top. There's just no way that any real people can be just so twisted as this--and here it is, on my TV! Mostly the language bothered me. I think I could have gotten over the rest of the shortcomings if it wasn't for the language. I just felt so dirty for having witnessed such a film--I actually shut it off. And for those of you who think I just can't handle it: I'm a 21-year-old guy who loves action movies."
"Gerald-8","4","5","8","5 April 2007"," Under-written and under-whelming
","This is one of those films out of the angst-school. Everyone runs around screaming obscenities at one another and there's lots of shooting and blood and it goes on much longer than it needs to.<br/><br/>There's the core of a very good story here, with the double agent, double agent scenario. There could be a good, tight exploration here with the character structure and the woman linking them. But for me, there was nothing to explain why the woman was so attracted to either man which the plot kind of hinged on. And none of the characters were particularly well defined.<br/><br/>The acting's okay, but Jack Nicholson can do roles like this in his sleep, it just calls for him to look charismatic and dangerous.<br/><br/>It reminded me of the sort of plot you see on the BBC's 'Life on Mars'. Except that would have packed it with genuine intrigue and emotion into one hour. And with class. Class is ultimately what 'The Departed' lacked. (Classy film-making, not denied, but in terms of how the characters and story was portrayed).<br/><br/>And if American cops really go around screaming obscenities and being so racist, sexist and homophobic all the time... well, that's not a very good advertisement for the Police Force is it?"

"jason_sjc","4","5","8","27 February 2007"," OK... I am biased, but it doesn't worth an Oscar
","The Departed was adapted from the original police vs triad thriller ""Infernal Affairs"" produced in Hong Kong in 2002.<br/><br/>IA had always been my favorite movie due to the intriguing plot, the convincing role plays by actors, the subtle meaning behind the movie,and the artistically molded scenes. It had been a miracle in Hong Kong's filming industry. I was thoroughly disappointed when it didn't claim an Oscar for the best foreign language picture. But at that time I knew that it would be remade into a Hollywood movie, and was convinced that it would be as enjoyable.<br/><br/>But then I was disappointed. Maybe because the plot was tailor-made for Hong Kong's social background and culture, I just found the movie not convincing at all. The time frame was a mess. The characters were not as 3-dimensional as the original. The ending was a disaster. It's just not fair to compare the movie with the original one, but the Departed doesn't stand as an excellent movie individually.<br/><br/>OK, I know I am biased because I live in Hong Kong and I saw IA before The Departed, but come on, you are not giving an Oscar to a movie that's appealing to everyone because of its plot, when the plot wasn't even original! I was utterly shocked when they announced the Departed as a movie inspired by J-A-P-A-N-E-S-E movie ""Infernal Affairs"". I mean, Oh my God, how could THIS happen in an Oscar?! I urge you all to see the Infernal Affairs after the Departed, which you will surely find the difference."

The plot where in the original ""Infernal Affairs"" was just the most gripping film ever, here felt somehow shallow, if you had seen the original before. Honestly even the huge stars, which are really good actors with talent and real acting abilities, that played in ""The Departed"" weren't as half as good as the Chinese counterparts in the specific rolls.<br/><br/>What really gets me mad though, is that Scorsese and his crew will take the credits and the recognition that don't belong to them!!!<br/><br/>All the Oscars should go to the original by far!!!<br/><br/>If you think that I got it wrong I really urge you to watch the original and you will understand the difference simply by the impact that the characters will have on you and by the fact that visually is so much more detailed and in a much higher level.<br/><br/>My opinion...

"animalmother05","4","5","8","29 October 2006"," I beg your pardon?
","I am shocked at the number of reviews that exist that praise this film to no end, and that call it Scorsese's best film since ""Goodfellas."" ""The Departed"" is far from a bad film; it is, in fact, a decent one, but it is still very disappointing, and the only part of ""Goodfellas"" it resembles at all is that film's last segment, starting at 6:55 AM on May 11 of 1980, after which it loses track of everything that made it one of Scorsese's best film. The film consists primarily of extremely short takes sloppily edited together which are theoretically meant to jar the spectators, but in fact only prohibit the narrative from moving effectively. There is nothing theoretically wrong with short takes; Sergei Eisenstein made very powerful films with shorter Average Shot Lengths than ""The Departed"" ever dreamed of having, but his films were conceived as juxtapositions of shots, whereas in ""The Departed,"" as in most modern films that use this technique, the shots only interrupt each other. Eisenstein's films were great, and revolutionary, because he used editing to create sequences of shots to develop his ideas; Scorsese's greatest films tend to have longer average shot lengths because he expresses his ideas in a single shot rather than a sequence of them. In ""The Departed"" he has not decided to express himself with sequences of shots rather than single shots, he has merely made the shots shorter and thus hindered the expression of his ideas in the film.<br/><br/>Moreover, there are serious narrative flaws in the film. Jack Nicholson gives an outstanding performance as a once great (if a little eccentric) mob boss who has become paranoid near the end of his life and becomes self-destructive. He is hilarious for much of the film, but at times, particularly near the end, he truly becomes terrifying. This is all quite good, but the film is not about him; it is about Billy and Colin. It perhaps would have been better to have made a completely separate film about Frank Costello, since he is given either too much or too little attention in ""The Departed."" The same could be said about Alec Baldwin's and Marky Mark's characters; they need either to be given more major roles that relate more directly to the thematic elements of the film, or to be removed entirely. At times, it seems as if Scorsese were so intent on having an Outstanding Ensemble Cast and in the process forgot about his main characters.<br/><br/>It would seem to me, from the film's mere plot, that a major idea with which ""The Departed"" could play is that Billy and Colin are mirror images of each other. The film should be an exploration with the nature of identity, and though it obviously would tie in most directly with these two characters, it should also apply more subtly to the other characters in the film. However, Colin (Matt Damon's character) does not come across as in interesting character suffering from inner conflict; he is simply a jerk. Before Marky Mark's character shoots him at the end, he says ""okay."" The line should be delivered with a sense of self- hatred that has developed after Colin's conscience begins to attack him for the damage that he has wreaked on all the people from both of his lives; instead, he sounds merely bored. Billy is significantly more interesting than Colin (though I give more credit to Leonardo DiCaprio than to the screenwriters for this), but could still use more work. Damon's performance does not stand out, DiCaprio's reminds us that he is perhaps the most talented actor of his generation in Hollywood, though the film, lamentably, does not make as much use of these talents as ""The Aviator"" did.<br/><br/>The film particularly seems to fall apart after Frank Costello dies. It would make sense for Colin to become indecisive and confused after such an event, since his mafia loyalties were to Frank alone, but it instead seems as if the screenwriters were the confused and indecisive ones. Moreover, having all the major characters (except Baldwin and Marky Mark) die was not the proper ending for the film; it seems dull, predictable, and superficial to the extent that, when Colin says ""Okay"" before getting shot, I could empathize with his boredom."

","I finally caught up with this only recently, and had to keep pulling my jaw up from the floor. What a deliriously bad, hysterically loopy film this is. It's as if Scorcese had dozed off in front of ""Goodfellas"" one night after eating a cheese and garlic pizza, and thinking, ""How can I top this.top this.top this"" And this film is the result. Not so much a film, but a dream of a film, one that defies any sort of logic. There's a rat in the gang. Could it be the ex-cop who's always on his phone? Nope, because after all  they asked him, and he said it wasn't. Well, fair enough. Meanwhile, there's a rat in the police force. Could it be the cop who grew up under the wing of the mobster under investigation, the one who leaps onto his phone in full view of everyone as soon as an operation against said mobster is announced? Naaaah. Meanwhile we also have a police psychiatrist who, as luck would have it, is gorgeous and who, as her sense of professionalism would have it, thinks it's okay to sleep with not just one but two of her clients.<br/><br/>A definition of a bad film, (which I read on a website dedicated to bad films) states that you know you're watching a bad film when the plot will only progress if the characters act stupidly.<br/><br/>This, ladies and gentlemen, is one of those films.<br/><br/>To be fair, Damon and Cipriano are surprisingly good, the latter, in particular, having developed a leaner, meaner look than he's known for. Unfortunately, these are balanced out by average, TV-movie performances by Sheen and Baldwin, a bogglingly bad one by Wahlberg (a piece of wood rolled on to bark rude comments) a stunningly confused one by Ray Winstone (what is that accent again?) and thenthere's Jack. Any hopes that this might be one those roles that allow him to recall his acting skills are swiftly ditched by the scenery-chomping on display here, as if Nicholson were bored and decided he could only get through it by making it as surreal as possible, meanwhile coming across as neither Irish nor Bostonian. He's no longer an actor, he is a performer, a grandstander, and this is what you get. If you don't want characterisation or subtle emotions, you call Jack. You also, in his wake, get the wildly uneven tone, veering into off-the-wall black humour (the hand at the breakfast table  what was with THAT?) and moments so throwaway it looked for all the world as if they were being made up on the spot (Nicholson appearing, covered in blood). The end piles on twist upon twist and body upon body which, on the surface, are entertaining enough, but just don't hold up to any sort of scrutiny (and the psychiatrist does what with the tapes?) A passable no-brainer action film, and an entertaining exercise in loopy film-making from a director who should know better, praised by fans and critics who should also know better."

Nicholson can certainly do the man in charge, but not in this. Leonardo is fairly believable, although he seems to be working hard on looking sullen. Damon is okay, nothing special. Sheen is fairly good but Wahlberg is awful. Sheen has to pretend there's not a bad smell in the room when he's with Wahlberg. We are to believe that his Dignan is expressing real emotion, this is a real tough guy? This story relies on so many twists to carry itself, but the weakness of the characters and to some degree, the plot, is surprising.

None of the characters you meet in the first half hour are alive at the end of the film. Some of the characters you meet along the way have sub-plots that don't tie in and are not resolved in any way.<br/><br/>This is all underscored by the low point in modern cinema featuring Jack Nicholson pretending to masturbate in a porn theater only to reveal that he is waving a dildo instead.<br/><br/>The AMPAS should be ashamed, and all members should be replaced after this recent display."

But this movie could have under gone some serious editing. Jack Nicholson had a girlfriend that served no purpose, heck, for that matter the love interest of Damon and DeCaprio didn't really serve a purpose either. DeCaprio's love scene served no purpose. There was symbolism with a church at the beginning and end that really wasn't tied into the movie as a whole, and Nicholson's character starts to go mad and we don't really know why, or it isn't show in a fluid manner. I know this movie is a remake - I've never seen the original so that doesn't matter to me.

Both films had a very strong cast. However, the original's cast acting performance was more real and touching. The original made a huge hit because it encompasses more than just a basic organized crime and thriller movie including the philosophies and thinking of the eastern culture and Buddhism. No doubt I would rate it as a great movie had I not seen the original but Martin's adaptation is too far-cry compared to the original. It's completely a waste of time."

Though I certainly can appreciate all the talent involved here-- I mean, what a cast, Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon, etc.-- and Scorcese directing (who should have won the Oscar for his masterpiece, Goodfellas) the ridiculous plot (remake of one of the commonly ridiculous Hong Kong cop genre films) is, frankly, an insult to the intelligence, and to watch it attempt to justify itself with ever more absurd plot points--Sheen's character falls off the roof and lands right on top of another character, I mean, PLEASE!!--was tedious, and even painful to watch at times. I give it the stars just for the effort of particularly the actors involved, but the normally extremely talented Scorcese should simply have taken the basic plot and had it rewritten to a more terse, realistic thriller (something Robert Redford and his director Sidney Pollock did with Three Days of The Condor, which came from a book called Six Days of Condor and had much more exaggerated action scenes in it). Hopefully, Scorcese can put out another masterpiece before he's done and then finally be rewarded for the level of work that he's so obviously capable of."

","This movie is similar to Pacino's movie Donnie Brasco but for one time we leave the NYC and Italian underworld for the Irish and Boston! Thus having Damon playing in it is interesting as he deepens his local ties from Will Hunting and in a way, his meeting with DiCaprio is the new generation confrontation of Pacino / De Niro. However, the pleasure doesn't go farther as this movie is just totally unbelievable: the new thug becomes close to the criminal boss and nobody thinks he is the police rat, the policeman grows up with the criminal boss and nobody thinks he is the criminal rat. With that, the movie just take fun to tell the most bad words and to show the most blood... All the characters are pathetic, badly played by the ordinary big names who does their same show over and over (Baldwin, Wahlberg, Nicholson who has absolutely no charisma as the boss!). The scenes with the shrink are totally useless and just add minutes to get a long movie! Sure many would praise it as it's a Scorcese but frankly, i won't watch it again while DB is much more engaging!"

","Has there ever been a film with a better cast than this? I can't think of one. Comment if you can. The acting in this is amazing and every actor did their job. I think this is Leonardo's best performance. He did it so well and it was actually like he was the character and not actually performing. The music is awesome. Especially Shipping Up to Boston which is done by one of my all-time favourite bands @dropkickmurphys. The song was the perfect choice for the film and they played it at just the right times. The plot is ingenious and Scorsese directed it superbly. This film even managed to be better than Infernal Affairs, which is what this film was based upon. I love the opening scene with Jack Nicholson's monologue and it really set the film for what was to come. The film also had it funny moments (thanks to Mark Walberg). This film is extremely entertaining and I love the characters. There is nothing to complain about in this film and I could and probably will watch this over and over again. One of the best this century. I was actually sad when this film was finishing because I didn't want it to end. Acting: 10/10 Dialogue: 10/10 Plot: 10/10 Characters: 10/10 Entertainment Value: 10/10"

I normally hate pace breaking in movies, so this is already a big + in my book. the story is interesting to watch as Dicaprio and Damon struggle with their identities while Jack Nicholsen has some fun as the bad guy. This movie has a great plot, cast, music score, length and almost all elements of movies possible such as: drama, comedy, action, crime, thrills and suspense and many more. The Departed is a great movie and should be recognized as one.I find nothing wrong with it. maybe the lack of female characters, but it ain't that bad."

","Frankly, i think Scorcese suffers from a personality crisis for quite some time. This movie is another example that this director, who made milestones of Hollywood history once, totally lost his style and constantly tries to follow tired trends. That he's successful with it, tells more about his audience then the quality of his recent movies. A good example for this is the nerve-wrecking soundtrack of this mediocre remake, which dive-bombs the viewer with one blaring rock song after another. Who does Scorcese thinks he is? Quentin Tarantino? It would be excusable for a beginner to over-spice his first movie with his favorite mix-tape. I like music and i like movies. What i don't like is to be pestered with someones dated musical taste when i want to see a gangster-movie. My God, just read the list of songs at the end credits. It's insane!

","Talk about undeserved Oscars  This movie definitely didn't deserved them . It's a sad thing that Academy decided to honor Scorsese with Oscar not only so late , but also with movie that didn't deserved it one bit . It's even more sad that so many people think it's a good movie . I disagree with that opinion.<br/><br/>The movie suffers from bad acting from the three leading stars : DiCaprio , Damon and Nicholson. Matt Damon doesn't act at all . He just is in this movie . He breaths , he has open eyes and he speaks. That's it. Jack Nicholson plays his part in such way that would fit Burton's ""Batman returns"" . He's overacting . He's campy , cheesy and not one bit dangerous. Unless you think that killing and eating a fly makes him dangerous . DiCaprio is also overacting , but at least he's switching from being ""very nervous"" to ""very angry"" from time to time. And who the f*** casts Anthony Anderson in a serious role of cop ?! That fat and unfunny piece of meat sticks out here like a sore thumb. <br/><br/>The supporting actors are surprisingly much better than the trio of stars . Alec Baldwin , Martin Sheen and oh my God Mark Wahlberg give the best performances of the movie. I wasn't surprised by the fine performances of Baldwin and Sheen . I didn't expect Wahlberg to give such a good performance as the tough asshole cop. It's his best role since ""Boogie nights"".<br/><br/>The movie has it's share of rather ridiculous twists that are hard to swallow . There is a big plot-hole involving a certain object that seems to be important for the story for almost 70% of the movie , yet it strangely disappears and none of the characters seems to care ! Not to mention the indestructible cell phone.<br/><br/>The movie is badly directed . Scorsese fails to recreate the psychological tension of the original, so he uses the simple way to do it – by making characters shout very often and punch each other . The wonderful sense of sorrow and tragedy that you could feel in the Asian movie is also gone . Instead there is a lot of loud music . And the shootouts look absolutely terrible , like something that Michael Bay could direct.<br/><br/>The movie ends differently than ""Infernal affairs "" and it's a really bad thing . Not to mention that the whole symbol with the rat is just pathetic . In the end you might realize that you have just seen an empty and bad cop thriller. I give it 4/10."

","Nicholson is always worth the admission price, and other cast members do a creditable job. But in the end this is a movie that's wayyyyyyyyyy too long, weighed down by endless clichés of the genre (top Mafia boss is endlessly clever, a real sex machine, and full of philosophical one-liners in street patois; police management is too gullible to remain alive; when educated women meet tough guys they can't wait to leap into bed with them; etc. etc. etc.) As always with Scorsese the film is technically brilliant, but never comes alive (no play on words there) except now and then in Nicholson scenes, and quite often when Dicaprio is on camera--he does very well. Did I mention that it's formulaic and way too long?<br/><br/>The Sopranos handled similar plotting and material ever so much better.

","The Departed is a movie that first-timers to the plot will enjoy most thoroughly. The idea of two sides both having a mole each is most thrilling and I am sure viewers will be most impressed, especially with the line-up of stars in the cast.<br/><br/>However, I give this movie a 6 out of 10 as it is a direct copy of a Chinese movie, ""Infernal Affairs"" (2002). I am not talking about the general plot idea of the film, but rather the entire film sans the very last moment of the film is a direct copy down to Frank breaking the mole's cast to check for wires. Even the elevator scene at the end is almost a complete copy from the movie.<br/><br/>I would have rated the movie a lot higher if it didn't copy so much from ""Infernal Affairs"". The cast-breaking; the bad guy not revealing that he has found out on his deathbed that the gangster is a mole; the elevator scene; the head cop falling from the roof. All of this happens exactly in ""Infernal Affairs"" (2002).<br/><br/>In fact, ""Infernal Affairs"" was a lot more interesting in terms of how the moles went about communicating with their respective boss' and in this way was a lot more thrilling.

","The Departed is an American crime thriller film,a remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs, about two men from opposite sides of the law that are undercover within the Massachusetts State Police and the Irish mob. The film is directed by Martin Scorsese.It has a star- studded cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, Vera Farmiga, and Alec Baldwin.<br/><br/>The story begins when Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is introduced to organized crime through Irish mobster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) in the Irish neighborhood of South Boston at a young age. Costello trains him to become his mole inside the Massachusetts State Police. Sullivan is accepted into the Special Investigations Unit, which focuses on organized crime.While Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is asked by Captain Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Staff Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) to become an Undercover Agent due to the fact that his family ties to organized crime that makes him a perfect infiltrator. Before he graduates,he drops out of the Academy and does time in prison on a fake assault charge to increase his credibility.Eventually,both infiltrate their respective organizations and play a cat-and-mouse game until the end of the film.<br/><br/>We are treated to a great action thriller in The Departed.But comparing Infernal Affairs and The Departed,the original is a lot superior as compared to the American remake.<br/><br/>Infernal Affairs is more realistic and has more emotional depth as compared to The Departed.It clearly explores the complexities and moral ambiguity that both Inspector Lau and Yan are undergoing.Aside from that,the material is very original and it is truly brilliantly made.The acting of the film is also great especially that of Andy Lau and Tony Leung.There are more interesting characters like Inspector Wong and Sam,the triad boss.Finally,the movie's ending makes you feel for both Inspector Lau,who finally became the person that he wants to assume by becoming a real cop through a series of lies and murder; and Yan,whom we feel considering that he never got his true identity back of being a cop and will always be remembered as a criminal.<br/><br/>The Departed is just a two-hour and a half mindless entertainment.It is NOT AN ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY since it is remake of Infernal Affairs. (Literally it is a remake since it copied scene by scene of the Infernal Affairs - LOL).Most of the great scenes of the movie was taken from IA as well.Also,there is too much swearing in the film.Why do the movie has to have the word f*ck said for 237 times?Do all cops and criminals swear every time they speak?Also,both Billy Costigan and Colin Sullivan are one-dimensional.One is good and the other is bad.There are too many characters and a lot of them are bland.Frank Costello looks more like a cartoon-like character rather than a mafia boss.There is less emotional depth and complexities as compared to the original.Then there is the pathetic character of Vera Farmiga named Madolyn.Does she really have to sleep with both Colin and Billy?We are treated to the acting histrionics of the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio,Mark Wahlberg and Jack Nicholson.Matt Damon is simply bland in this film.Watch Damon in The Informant instead.Finally,the viewer has less empathy to the characters in the end since everybody just has to get shot in the end.<br/><br/>In the end,I still prefer the original compared to this remake although this movie still deserves a 10/10 rating."
"Irie212","5","3","4","31 December 2009"," One of the 50 best movies of all time? Really??
","""The Departed"" isn't a bad movie, but it's certainly not one of the best movies ever made, yet as of this writing it is #49 on IMDb's Top 250-- a list which reveals far more about the reviewers than the films.<br/><br/>One look at the Top 250 is enough to make any cineaste curse transient gods like Michael Bay and the Wachowskis. The list is so slanted toward movies that are both American and recent that a serious list of excluded movies-- from 1919's ""Broken Blossoms"" to 1939's ""Rules of the Game"" to 1959's ""400 Blows"" -- makes the Top 250 look downright silly. How silly? It includes the following, all of which have good qualities but nothing approaching best-ever levels: Inglourious Basterds, The Prestige, District 9, Kill Bill I, V for Vendetta, In Bruges, Benjamin Button, Big Fish, Crash, and an Eastwood quadruple-threat, Gran Torino, Changeling, Million Dollar Baby, and Mystic River. (News flash: Eastwood is as talented a director as he was an actor.)<br/><br/>Ranking ""The Departed"" at #49 is particularly strange because it isn't even as good as the Hong Kong original, ""Infernal Affairs"" (2002), which lands at No. 249. (Foreign films take a real beating on this list, which is why I cite many non-American filmmakers here. The USA is, after all, only one of more than 150 countries producing movies.) ""The Departed"" at #49 is also odd because it's far from the best work of any of the actors-- Damon, DiCaprio, Nicholson, Winstone, Farmiga. (As for Oscar-nominee Marky Wahlberg, all I can ask is WTF. His apparent facial paralysis wasn't a particular handicap in his role as Sgt. Dignam, maybe that's why he was lauded. All he had to do was deliver profanities, but even at that Wahlberg is to R. Lee Ermey as Bud Lite is to Guinness Stout.)<br/><br/>It's probably also true (for obvious reasons) that a lot of IMDb-ers have mainly seen movies made after they were born, and mainly American movies besides. No wonder they produce a list as lame as the Top 250. A lot of young people I know categorically dismiss black-and-white movies, which is probably a fair reflection of the number of idiotic fusspots in the world. But if you've never seen Gregg Toland's cinematography, how can you evaluate Wally Pfister's? One 20ish couple I know-- movie buffs who are well-read and savvy-- haven't even seen The Third Man or Grand Illusion or Rashomon, so I find it really impossible to take their uneducated opinions about film seriously. I also wonder if they really are fans. I don't see how they can be if they're not searching out Ozu and Leone and Lubitsch.<br/><br/>Ultimately, IMDb's Top 250 is a good list if your teeth need grinding. As for the actual written reviews-- some of which are very very good-- the only profitable way I've found to read them is to customize them by eliminating all ratings of 1 and 10. Try it. It's an astonishingly effective filter because about half the reviewers don't seem to know that numbers 2 through 9 even exist. I just checked an unquestionably average-to-above-average film, ""Rushmore"": it had 592 comments-- and 452 (76%!) rated it 1 or 10."
"bobarino","10","3","4","9 June 2008"," Scorsese is in his prime with The Departed
","If there was any doubt about Martin Scorsese's craft as a film director, The Departed silences any critic of his. However, if there was any doubt in the first place I highly suggest quitting movies. Scorsese delivers an epic in a time where movies are being churned out with no emotion, no connection to the viewer, and reliance on gimmicks so the studios can earn a little dough and taking the prized honor of being the number 1 listed movie on a 12 year old kid's myspace page.<br/><br/>The Departed delivers in every facet. The cinematography is well crafted - the camera positions to grasp the scene in its fullest while avoiding being generic and also straying away from overly ""artsy"" camera angles that make the film unwatchable. In fact, The Departed is probably Scorsese's most rewatchable film. There are more twists than a Chubby Checker concert which will make you both gasp and let out sighs of relief.<br/><br/>The characters are believable and engaging. Jack Nicholson plays one the most accessible of all the mob villains of Scorsese's past. He is complete slime, but his demeanor is that of an uncle who permits you to watch the TV shows that your parents told you not to. Matt Damon as Colin is like one of those pompous pricks who cheat repeatedly and get away with it, and Leo as Billy Costigan grows on the viewer and as a character through his dangerous line of work as a police informant.<br/><br/>The Departed is an American masterpiece."

I know its hard to imagine him doing this type of role, but he really has evolved as an actor over the years. GO SEE THIS MOVIE. I'm not one of those guys that is going to get all technical. But this movie is real with real conflicts(especially Dicaprio). Marky Mark, Nicholson, Damon, Sheen, even Alec Baldwin played their parts well. Simply one of the best."
"Thrashman88","7","3","4","31 March 2007"," Good film, but certainly NOT Scorsese's best...
","THE DEPARTED is a long and intriguing film where opposite rival bands infiltrate each other to gain inside scoop info. The guys who do the ""infiltration"" are Matt Damon, doing the bad guy on the good side, and Leonardo DiCaprio vice versa. The story develops slowly and you have to pay close attention to all the minor details because so much is given that you might lose some info. The bad guy of the story (Jack Nocholson )doesn't appear to be all that mean and bad. In fact, you don't feel much for any of the characters, except maybe for DiCaprio's. This aside, the movie moves at a fair pace, although the beginning is a bit slow. By the time the movie's over you hardly notice what's going on. This is a finely crafted movie, big budget and stuff and a fine Martin Scorsece film, but, in my humble opinion, don't think it deserved a best movie award. I think most of you out there will agree with me that Scorsece has done way better in the past: TAXI DRIVER, CASINO, GOOD FELLAS, RAGING BULL, etc. I think the Academy felt so wrong and sorry for not awarding ANY of his past movies that they just had to give him an award this time around. Having this said, THE DEPARTED isn't a bad movie by any terms! But it is certainly not Scorsese's best."
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","3","4","6 December 2006"," Superbly intricate and inhumane
","Scorcese is a visual genius, I mean he is able to center the whole film and the whole action on the feelings, suffering and pleasure he can concentrate in the eyes of his actors that are piercing and even branding our own eyes that are trying to imagine the inside of their minds like voyeurs launched onto a world of violence and paranoid thirst for power. The art of this director is to get his actors into situations that will create fear in us and to direct these actors so well that our fear will be the simple reflection of the fright they express in their eyes, essentially their eyes, and also their words. The action of the film is then not that important since it is nothing but rotten cops and rotten gangsters that are trying to infiltrate their respective sides incognito of even the people on their own sides. We are the only people to know who is a mole and who is not, and yet, even so, Scorcese manages to bring a final mole out of the woodwork in the last two minutes of the film. And is the police mole infiltrated among the gangsters really better than the others ? Maybe yes, but it is so tenuous and brittle an impression that we could doubt it. The most important pleasure we find here is that the three main actors are not disappointing our expectations. Nicholson is not abandoning himself to his traditional ticks and habits. Damon is a perfect young prince that can conquer any heart and yet that is so rotten that he appears austere and cold when he turns vicious and fearful. Dicaprio is the greatest satisfaction for us because he is so well directed that he finds some harshness and he uses his eyes so well that we really believe his lovely face is nothing but the mask of a hyena and his straggling beard is the furious mane of some buzzard. And yet we tremble for him and we suffer with every anguished tremor on his face. Apart from that it is quite obvious that Scorcese must have found some tremendous enjoyment in directing three men in that dramatic and tragic situation. No film is wasted on any sentimentalese mash. It is all raw granite and solid quartz.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"

But I made a serious point to go see this, something fresh from on old familiar face, or wait two, maybe three, or four, depends how old you are. One thing I think makes a great director is the use of inanimate objects as characters. If you haven't seen this film, watch the Boston State Capitol building appearances. It says more with no duologue than some entire scripts do. Some songs are used with more visual themes than others, but the audio counterpart to the eye-popping candy is so intense I just couldn't wait for the next scene to unfold. And as for Jack well, very very good, best I've seen him in full tilt since the shining. Many people are saying this is Tarantino Based. I am almost thirty, I remember pre-Tarantino. Well pop Tarantino that is, pre Pulp Fiction who knew about his hits, only a few in early years of high school had even watched reservoir dogs. What happened to him is he's gone Hollywood, who else would take such interest in splitting a feature like kill bill into 2 parts, oh yeah ticket sales, revenues, I say CUT IT!

Even Jack Nicholson didn't overdo it.

","Overall, the Departed can be summed up in 2 words. ""Taxi Driver."" Meaning just like Taxi Driver, The Departed has incredible acting, a powerful story, that had a tonne of potential. But all of it came crashing down when Martin Scorsese directed, almost totally killing the movie. Rendering it boring, lame and impotent.<br/><br/>The movie is about an undercover police officer (Leonardo DiCaprio) who infiltrates a crime boss (Jack Nicholson) who is also looking for a corrupt cop (Matt Damon) who works for the crime boss (Nicholson). And the same corrupt cop (Damon) is looking for the undercover cop (DiCaprio).<br/><br/>A simple case of hunter vs. hunter with ironically a powerful, yet impotent ending.<br/><br/>When it comes to acting, specifically with Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Alec Baldwin, Mark Walberg, and others, they probably would all be competing with each other for the Academy awards for best actor or best supporting actors.<br/><br/>If the Departed were directed by anyone else, Quentin Tarantino, Bryan Singer, Michael Mann, Curtis Hanson, then the Departed most likely have limited competition for both best directing and best picture at the Academy Awards.<br/><br/>But with Martin Scorsese at the helm, successfully diverting our attention away from the excellent acting and incredible story, he guaranteed himself a well deserved Razzie award for worst director and allowed a worst screenplay Razzie award as well.<br/><br/>The brutality and the violence of the movie was very impotent and boring. Though having noticeable amounts of humour, thanks to the excellent acting and stories, they were almost totally overshadowed by the dullness of the movies poor pace, thanks to Scorsese.<br/><br/>From the background, one person said that the the movie was confusing. And another said that it became more stressful, but felt like it was going nowheres.<br/><br/>But if you can only focus on the story and the acting, the Departed is recommended. Actually, either just read the book or listen to the audio book with the actors doing the voices. But if you have to see the movie as a whole, watch something else, cause the Departed is a waste of time.<br/><br/>Future note to Hollywood, let Scorsese set everything up, and leave him out of it after that.<br/><br/>For story and acting alone, the Departed is definitely worth a 9/10.<br/><br/>But with Martin Scorsese successfully putting in his infamous ""going no wheres fast"" feel to the movie, overshadowing everything else, give the departed ....... 2.5 out of 10."

","The Departed offers you one of the best stories of mafia. Certainly the best combination of mob and police in the same movie. There are many good mafia films but this one sticks out because of its great usage of police. The value of this movie does not shrink to the fact that the film is mostly a remake to the Hongkong movie. The value is based how this one has been done. I gotta tell you, it's pretty damn high. And the reason behind that is Martin Scorsese. He absolutely nails this film. He, like Francis Ford Coppola, has a special eye for a mob films. And quite simply, this is his finest product. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio (Billy) is one the best actors around. He is always so good. Never seen him underperformed. He gives a great shot here too. Jack Nicholson (Frank) is always reliable. Matt Damon (Colin) was good. But Mark Wahlberg (Dignam) was most impressive. Quite a performance from him. Very confident. In overall, it's just a first-class cast.<br/><br/>The Departed is perfect film for a movie night. It's intense, has plenty of action, great story and great performances.

","A remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs, Scorsese's 'The Departed' is a haunting film, so effective, that I still have a hang-over of it. Scorsese actually shatters himself by getting into a world of blood, back-stabbing and cruel intelligence. For those who haven't seen this box office smash yet, take time out from other non-sense, and watch this! <br/><br/>This Masterstroke takes place in Boston, Massachusetts, where Irish Mob boss Francis ""Frank"" Costello played by Nicholson plants Colin Sullivan played by Damon as an informant within the Massachusetts State Police. Simultaneously, the police assign undercover cop Billy Costigan played by DiCaprio to infiltrate Costello's crew. When both sides realize the situation, each man attempts to discover the others true identity before being found out. The original Hong Kong flick was a masterstroke! And this is a true and best remake possible! Scorsese has made so many remarkable films, that I've lost count by now. He's at his fiery best and his executes the subject with tremendous ease. A True Legend! His biggest accomplishment was, that, He was finally respected by the Academy-Awards for his work here! Halleujah! Michael Ballhaus's Cinematography is eye-catching. William Monahan's adapted screenplay is marvelous.<br/><br/>In the acting department, Mark Wahlberg steals the show with a brilliant performance. The rawness and overdose of abusive language help the talented actor steal the show in this multi-starrier. Nicholson, as always, is flawless. Leonardo DiCaprio is superb, he lives his character from start to end. Matt Damon is amazing. Martin Sheen proves yet again he's a talent that we'll never forget. He's exceptional. Alec Baldwin is in command after a long. The veteran scores! Vera Farmiga is perfect. Ray Winstone does full justice to his part. Anthony Anderson leaves a mark as well.<br/><br/>'The Departed' is a winner all the way! The film keeps you at grip from start to end, and will leave you thinking about it for a long, long time. It's amongst the finest films ever made! Two Big Thumbs Up!"

","A wonderful cast, an interesting story, reasonably good performances. If only Scorcese hadn't directed it, and whoever edited this over- extended, self-preoccupied and frequently irrelevant series of plot points should be shot. Plainly the stellar cast have congregated around Scorcese and it probably wouldn't have been made without him. Obviously, everyone involved were pretty pleased to be together on the project. That comes through and that's good. However, a whole heap of entirely unimportant, improvised tooling about by the ensemble desperately needs to be hacked out of the final reel, which Scorcese plainly couldn't bring himself to do. His affections for the cast have got in his way.<br/><br/>There is a good film hidden in this bad film. Judicious cutting of VERY expendable material that does nothing for either character development or plot would deliver a terrific, tight-packed little thriller with enjoyable performances by most cast members. Agree Mark Wahlberg did a great job, and Di Caprio was very watchable. Matt Damon extended his range a little, but overall finds it hard to be anyone other than himself, in this film and most others. Fortunately he happens to be an interesting kind of guy."

If you see the HK version you shall see why.<br/><br/>A very poor rip off, covered by well known actors!!and that is all!!!"
"missygoldstein","5","4","6","27 March 2007"," Disappointing
","I usually go to the movie theater when a movie is as hyped as this one. It won an academy award and I still didn't see it. After all the awards, praise....I had this sinking feeling that it couldn't possibly live up to all of this. I finally watched it on cable last night and I have to say it didn't.<br/><br/>While this was not a bad film and it was an entertaining story in my opinion it just did not even come close to living up to all the high praise it received. I heard many times people compare this to Goodfellas. The only possible reason I could imagine they'd make that comparison is because of Scorcese, but clearly that is where the comparison ends. Goodfellas was one of the best movies I've ever seen. The Departed? Not so much.<br/><br/>The story centers on two men both graduating from the police academy, one who has a family history of connection to the mob and ends up working for the police as an spy and informant so they could bring down this mob guy, and the other who was groomed from childhood by the same mob guy to get INTO the police department and get high up in the ranks so he could find things out and shield himself from being arrested through tips and information. So both boys are basically informants, one for the cops, the other for the mafia.<br/><br/>It seems to me that the idea is to show ""good vs bad"". In the beginning of the movie Costello (nicholson, the ""bad mafia guy"") exclaims; ""you can become a cop or work in organized crime. When you're looking down the barrel of a gun what's the difference""? This theme supposedly is to play out during the movie and it is up to us, the audience to figure out what the difference IS. The problem with this movie in my opinion is there WAS no noticble difference between these two characters. They were both young, driven, and dedicated seemingly believing in their cause and the work that they did. They both felt guilt over their secret status. They both were terrified of being found out. Honestly during the course of the movie I found myself getting confused over who's the ""good guy"" and who's the ""bad guy"". Everyone double crossed everyone. Everyone was dirty and corrupt, including the police. I'm assuming that we as the audience are to derive the message that good and evil exist in all of us? Not sure. I personally don't like when movies depict the ""bad guy"" in such an obvious comparison to the ""good guy"", but here I just was confused about the movies intent.<br/><br/>I thought many of the scenes were completely far fetched and over the top, unbelievable and silly. The problem I have with this movie is that I did not have any feelings for either guy, good, or bad. I had no sympathy for Decaprio, and no disdain for Damon. Who WAS the good guy/bad guy? I thought Nicholoson, who I usually like was playing ""the joker"".<br/><br/>In all this wasn't a bad movie. It just wasn't great."
"Buddy-51","7","4","6","22 February 2007"," a good film but less compelling than Goodfellas
","In Martin Scorcese's ""The Departed,"" Leonardo Di Caprio and Matt Damon play dueling ""moles"" working at cross purposes on opposite sides of the law. Di Caprio is Billy Costigan, a rookie recruited by the Massachusetts State Police to go undercover to infiltrate the gang headed by Irish mafia boss, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Damon is Colin Sullivan, a seemingly straight-laced detective who, in reality, is a ""rat"" planted by Costello in the heart of the investigative unit, whose job it is to tip the mob boss off when the cops are getting just a little too close to his unsavory operations. <br/><br/>The film, a remake of the Hong Kong flick ""Infernal Affairs,"" finds Scorcese back in the familiar territory of tough-talking ethnic gangsters (although for once the Italians are let off the hook) and urban violence. In terms of box office receipts and year's-end awards ceremonies, the return trip has certainly paid off handsomely for the director. Yet, for all the accolades it has garnered, ""The Departed"" falls short of the ""Goodfellas"" glory of a decade and a half ago for reasons that are not always easy to pinpoint or fathom.<br/><br/>On the positive side, Scorcese, never one to stint on his performers, has gathered a powerhouse cast for the occasion. In addition to Di Caprio and Damon, who provide some of the most solid and subtle work of their careers thus far, the movie boasts Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg in stellar supporting roles. Nicholson does yet another variation of the sardonic, scenery-chewing bad guy he's done countless times before, but since nobody does that shtick better than he, we don't mind watching it yet another time. <br/><br/>The greatest strength of the film lies in the complexity of the storyline, as the parallel cat-and-mouse scenarios continually twist and turn and ultimately dovetail into each other as the movie builds to its frenzied conclusion. There's a near-balletic beauty to much of the plotting as Costigan and Sullivan both struggle with the paranoia and fear that come from having to conceal their true identities from their colleagues at work and the love interest they unknowingly share on the side. One must credit Siu Fai Mak, who wrote the original screenplay - here skillfully adapted by William Monahan - for much of the film's success.<br/><br/>Yet, despite its many virtues of script and performance, there seems to be something oddly lacking in ""The Departed"" - a kind of unity and focus that turned ""Goodfellas"" into an instant classic of the gangster film genre. The deliberately clipped editing, which results in abrupt, awkward transitions between individual scenes, gives the film a self-consciously hurdy-gurdy quality that seems more artifice than art. The dialogue is often more mannered than it needs to be, and Scorcese has done surprisingly little to make the Boston locale an integral part of the drama (think back to how Sydney Lumet's managed that feat in ""The Verdict""). The story is interesting, in and of itself, but we never find ourselves very deeply engaged in the fate of the characters, which is the last charge one could ever level against ""Goodfellas."" Moreover, even the violence in ""The Departed"" is handled much less effectively than it was in ""Goodfellas."" In the earlier movie, the violence - and even the threat of violence - was cringe-inducing, unsettling and disturbing, with the Joe Pesci character, in particular, keeping the audience in a state of dreaded anticipation throughout, but in ""The Departed,"" the blows land with very little impact, and the violence is really not much different from what one might find in any decently executed, garden variety action film.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's unfair to keep making these constant comparisons to ""Goodfellas,"" a standard that, let's face it, very few directors would ever be able to live up to even on their best day of film-making. It's just that Scorcese set the bar so high, for himself as well as for others, with that film that his own failure to reach it inevitably seeps into our evaluation of his current product. <br/><br/>A good film but not a great one."
"mahen1","Null","4","6","21 February 2007"," The Departed vs Infernal Affairs
","The Departed is one of the best cop moves in years. I hadn't heard of Infernal Affairs before watching The Departed, and had only a vague inkling that The Departed was based on some Hong Kong film. For the first 90% of its length The Departed promises to be a classic, an all time great. It's a film of restrained violence that serves the plot. A cop (DiCaprio) is planted as a mole in a crime gang headed by Jack Nichoson. His task to report on the gang's activities with the eventual object of nabbing the whole bunch including Nicholson.<br/><br/>The ingenious touch is that Nicholson too has a mole (Damon) in the police. Damon's task is to report to Nicholson on the police investigations on his gang, so that Nicholson knows when to go ahead with a deal, when to keep low or in some cases Damon would clear the way of police so that Nicholson can go ahead with his plans.<br/><br/>Both these moles have been operating in their respective roles for years. So much so that Damon is actually becoming quite a good cop with a moral dilemma, while DiCaprio is becoming quite a bad ass with an equally desperate dilemma - he knows if he plays gangster too long he might actually be one for the rest of his life.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is desperate to get out of his predicament and begs the only two cops who know of his identity as a mole (Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg) to let him back into the police. Before his career as a mole began his records with the police were all deleted. Without Sheen and Wahlberg no one could identify Dicaprio as a cop.<br/><br/>This already tense situation is compounded no end when each side discovers at around the same time that each has a mole in the other's ranks. To ensure their own survival Damon and Dicaprio work feverishly to find out each other's identity, and the tension grips you.<br/><br/>We are taken through several set piece sequences to what seems likely to be an unbearably tense finale but at this point the move lets us down. There is one too many killings at the end, and I was left wondering whether the serious film-making I had witnessed approaching the end was meant to be taken seriously as the end sequences are almost comic.<br/><br/>Nevertheless the ingenious plot device, the powerhouse performances by the leading cast led by DiCaprio make this a very good, highly watchable film. But I was a little disappointed by the ending.<br/><br/>Not long after I found out that this was based on the Hong Kong movie Infernal Affairs (made in 2002) and proceeded to get my hands on it. My main motive was to find out if the ending was handled any better.<br/><br/>Since this is a review of The Departed I'll keep my comments on Infernal Affairs very brief. Suffice to say that the latter is much the better film. It's 50 mins shorter, but in no way loses out in terms of character development. As far as I can see The Departed was 50 mins longer only for the sake of character development. The ending of Infernal Affais is more restrained, and far more effective. Indeed Infernal Affairs is one of the great cop movies in history in any language. The Departed cannot be considered as anything other than a remake. All the key set pieces are copied wholesale from Infernal Affairs as of course is the plot.<br/><br/>Martin Scorcese is long overdue for an Oscar, and as everyone knows is nominated this year for The Departed. For a Director who has made such original classics as Taxi Driver and Raging Bull to win for this would be almost an insult. No doubt he feels differently."

","Organized crime, organized crime fighting. Corrupt policemen and undercover agents. They seem to be connected at the hip and this film plays with that from the start to the very last minute of it, telling the tale of the actions of a FBI/police combination fighting to bring a hotshot criminal down. Apparently it is a remake of the Japanese film Mou gaan dou (2002). I have not seen that original but will be on the lookout for it now.<br/><br/>The Departed is intense. A tad slow in the beginning and maybe a little too fast in the ending, but I guess keeping a very good balance in a 150 minute film can be a very daunting task. The most of it is rather interesting and builds a tension that runs somewhere until the last 15 minutes of the film - but - that is where it all fails. For me the last 15 minutes of film feel glued to the rest but not really connected to that rest and that more or less breaks the film in half, destroying its quality.<br/><br/>All in all. A lot of good looking imagery, good sound track, nice story - until just before the end of it. Cut of 15 minutes and you've got a thrilling good film.<br/><br/>6 out of 10 dirty cops"

Judging by the hype that preceded this movie, I am neither surprised nor disappointed by this movie's utter lack of quality. This movie is so bad that the scenes of graphic and gratuitous violence provoked unintended laughter. (By the way, isn't there enough violence already in the world that Hollywood has to dramatize it? Can't Hollywood ease off on the violence? Why show people being gunned down? How does that make the world a better place? How does that add to the artistic quality of a movie?) Also, the story itself and characters involved are so utterly insipid and so lacking in anything that even remotely resembles originality that they cannot be taken seriously. A police officer on the take? A criminal who is also an informant? The main characters in this movie are gangsters and corrupt police officers. It's understood that they are violent. So why show the violence? Remember the hype and judge accordingly."
"dranonyme","3","4","6","23 October 2006"," less is more
","I am an admirer of Mr. Scorsese's work as a filmmaker and cultural documentarian, so it was perhaps with heightened expectations destined to fall short of the mark that I went to see The Departed. Scorsese is an actor's director, and with a cast that includes the abundance of great players assembled for this project, it was hard to imagine how this film could be anything less than exceptional. In my view -- which is evidently a minority view -- it was quite a bit less, and I left the theater frustrated to have endured such a spectacular waste of talent and resources, signifying nothing -- or at least nothing we haven't previously seen from the director in Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, and Gangs of New York, echoing a Jenny Holzer truism from the '70's,""killing is unavoidable, but nothing to be proud of."" <br/><br/>Against the emerging vogue for ""Indie"" films, Scorsese has been one to embrace their antithesis, and he has the clout to summon the financial resources to do whatever he pleases, which has resulted in recent films that aspire to be large, almost as an end in itself. The Gangs of New York and The Aviatior epitomized this trend, exploiting successfully the wonderment that historical films can bring to the imagined past with figures larger than life. Viva Visconti. However, this inflated sensibility falls flat on the mean streets of South Boston in this interminable playing out of double-subterfuge, in which characters (more like caricatures) play out their appointed roles with a noticeable absence of subtlety or nuance. Nicholson is a parody of himself (though wonderful to watch even at his most absurd), Matt Damon seems unintentionally oblivious to the darkness of Colin Sullivan's soul--we have no idea of what makes him tick beyond the small favors offered in the opening scene, while Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen--wonderful actors all--play out their stereotypes with little psychological resonance. Leonardo DiCaprio shows yet again that he is one of the finest dramatic actors of his generation, but there is no catharsis in the inevitable outcome, which takes an impossibly long time to occur. The big surprise is Vera Farmiga, who displays exquisite emotional range and complexity, and should emerge as a formidable female lead worthy of serious dramatic roles, which are sure to come to her (with some help from the NY Times Magazine, which extolled her talents last month -- legitimately, it appears -- in a cover story.) The film also includes a great supporting cast of colorful thugs. But you sit through all the twists and turns of this interminably complex narrative feeling that you're looking at the work of a masterful technician whose infatuation with his cinematic virtuosity has become an end in itself, trumping his capacity, in spite of this film's pretentious title, to tell a meaningful or compelling story, which is easy enough to forget once you have exited the theater.<br/><br/>I remember when I saw Taxi Driver for the first time, not having a clue what it was about in advance. I left the theater rattled, irate, and a bit unhinged, wondering how anybody make a move that was such an assault on my expectations and sensibilities. It was unnerving, politically disturbing, and ultimately a profound expression of the Nixon years--certainly one of the best films of its time. I was fairly unnerved also when I waked out of the Departed, feeling that it was much ado about nothing, a waste of fissionable talent, wishing that I could have departed sooner. Perhaps like Bunuel's Exterminating Angel, Scorsese wanted to see how much misery he could put the viewer through while keeping him squirming in his seat."

In Infernal Affairs the same character is a conflicted man torn between loyalties and gains the audience's sympathy. In the new film you hated Matt Damon and felt nothing about supporting characters. It's really too bad. Scorsese's movie would have been better if the characters gained our sympathy like the original.....that was the purpose of the film.

The expansion of the mob boss character only served to highlight Jack Nicholson. While I enjoy Jack as much as the next person, the story is more about Costigan and Sullivan and their struggle with each other and their own demons. I will admit that the acting was very good. Unfortunately, a great cast does not necessarily mean a great movie. Scorsese was over the top in terms of the violence and side stories. All in all, I was very disappointed.

","Unfortunately there are millions of people out there who will watched this movie with a positive bias as most believe that Martin Scorsese is utterly infallible, but I am strictly in the middle with this director.<br/><br/>I know I am going to be totally controversial (and perhaps SHOCKING) when I admit that I really hated Goodfellas. Now, before you immediately vote against my review, just please read on so I can explain myself. I find Goodfellas to be one of the most ridiculously over-rated movies in history (along with DePalma's phenomenally misinterpreted pile of crap Scarface) but I do LOVE Casino. They are almost two sides of the same coin, so you can see how I am split over Scorsese.<br/><br/>I saw the original Infernal Affairs a few years ago and I hated it too. Yes, some good moments, but mainly an over-wrought bore. It's not because it is an Asian film, as I often enjoy them, but I just found it to be slightly inaccessible and alienating. Scorsese's remake is easier to identify with but is also a whole 50 minutes longer.<br/><br/>The plot has undercover cop Leo Dicaprio infiltrate the Boston Irish Mafia in order to flush out a mole in the Police Department. Matt Damon is that mole and his job is to flush out the undercover cop in the Mafia. Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg and Jack Nicolson play the respective bosses, lawful and lawless. Within this set-up characters bounce back and forth off each other, swearing, shooting, swearing and swearing. Man, this film is effing hardcore! (Sarcasm!) <br/><br/>Asking Jack Nicolson to play evil is like asking a Rottwieler to bark. It's what he does best. 'Ooh, but what about all the subtle nuances?' Come on, it's an easy, easy performance for someone like him and it's nothing you ain't seen him do before. The best performance actually comes from Matt Damon, closely followed by Mark Wahlberg (if you ever had trouble telling the difference between them then don't see this movie).<br/><br/>The cinematography is ugly as sin. Scorsese has gone for the same dull as hell color pallet of brown, brown and dark brown he used in Goodfellas. Yes, I know this film is not supposed to be bright, happy colors and blue skies. But if the dank colors are supposed to reflect the gritty realism of the doomed plot threads then they totally contradict the perfectly set-up camera angles. I am not saying that this film could only have been shot in a Paul Greengrass style jitter but a little less and a little more of the former and latter could have set the balance straight.<br/><br/>And the plot is completely all over the place. If you get into this movie you'll walk out of the cinema shocked and astonished, which will make you forget about some things that simply don't add up. Since I had already seen Infernal Affairs I didn't gasp at the ending when the rest of the audience sucked the air out of the cinema. I was too busy trying to make sense of it all, but you can't because there are too many holes in it.<br/><br/>Remakes are becoming more and more common these days and they are increasingly scoffed at (even when they are really good, such as Dawn of the Dead 2004 or Poseidon) but as soon as apparently unimperfect Martin Scorsese does one most of you turn a blind eye to the fact that the film is near-enough a shot-for-shot remake itself. I don't think it took a great amount of talent to crank out a film like this. And where the hell the $90 million budget went to is the REAL mystery!<br/><br/>But lads will love it. The screening I went to was sold out to many groups of 10 or 15 guys and metrosexuals with their blonde girlfriends. I am mentioning this because The Departed (like 2004's Crash) is a film that philistines go to see because it makes them feel clever. Sort of like penance for watching crud like When a Stranger Calls or The Fog. I just wish that people would find THEIR OWN good movies instead of always choosing what everyone else likes. Which is the only reason I can give for Goodfellas being so mysteriously well-regarded.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese is not the Mafia expert he thinks he is. Boston is not his turf. It's not a world I think he understands. And the result is a cartoonish, exaggerated shoot-em-up in which every character is lined up for the sole purpose of eventually being gunned down."

In this scene there's 4 cops, three of them end up dead except for Damon who later recommends DiCaprio for a medal, so if he didn't hang the killing of the other two cops and attempt on his own life on DiCaprio, then who killed the cops and why? Don't they have forensics in Mass, it'd be pretty obvious that it was DiCaprio's weapon that killed cop #2 and that cop #2's weapon killed cop #3, do they give medals for that in MA? Why would a sociopath killer like Damon leave his pregnant police shrink girlfriend alive to tell? She knows everything, especially after Damon sees her weeping for DiCaprio at his funeral. Damon already knows that DiCaprio was seeing her as his counselor, he has to be wondering if DiCaprio is the father and not him? I did love the part where both Damon and DiCaprio are on the roof calling each other homophobic slurs, LOL, too funny, nudge.. nudge.. wink.. wink.., know what I mean? Come on?"

","i would be lying if i said i understood this film the first time i saw it. and; i would be lying again if i said i understood it much better the second time around, although the message was clear from the beginning. i can only tell you this:<br/><br/>1)the score was familiar. Scorsese loves the stones. there were some great Irish tunes as well, and lots of the incomparable Patsy Cline, and the original music by Howard Shore was very good. 2) this was a dream ensemble cast. why Nicholson, Damon, and Di Caprio were overlooked is beyond me. Finally, some recognition for Mark Wahlberg, 3)the editing, particularly the sound editing, was phenomenal. kudos to the entire sound department. it reminded me of the work by the late great Akira Kurosawa, in RAN....well, maybe not quite THAT good, but good... 4) the production values were second to none. 5) the complexity of this screenplay, quite frankly, is brilliant.<br/><br/>Very much like last year's CRASH, but in a much much different way, Scorsese shows us that good and bad intertwine like the precision of a spider's web. After a while, i couldn't tell who was good and who was bad. Nobody was good. And a mass murderer could appreciate opera and the ironies of life. This was the point in the film. and it was relentless. The satisfaction of the last scene, when the awol Dignam (Wahlberg)shows himself, was perfection. <br/><br/>Even after having lauded this film for it's many areas of pure perfection, it doesn't mean that i particularly enjoyed it. But it was brilliant craft. This is finally Scorsese's year. Best Director is his, despite the very real argument that Clint Eastwood's Letters from Iwo Jima was better directed. If you haven't seen Infernal Affairs, i recommend you give it a watch.<br/><br/>Scum on any surface tends to collect in one mass over time. But life thrives, even in a cesspool."

","I was not sure of how this movie would play out after seeing the previews for it. But I must say it is a fantastic movie in many ways.<br/><br/>Great cinematic vision, filming, and all of that stuff. Excellent story, even if it does start slow and slow down in a few places. This is the kind of thing that you would expect from Scorcesse. Some moments in the movie make you think that you are missing something, because it doesn't make sense right at that moment, but have no fear, it will.<br/><br/>Not a big DiCaprio fan, but I think he actually did a fantastic job. I like Damon in the Bourne movies, and pretty much everything else he is in, so this was no disappointment either. And of course Nicholson is a whack-job, so he fit right in with the character.<br/><br/>A few of the scenes where people get killed came out of nowhere ... and when it happened to DiCaprio ... I jumped ... just a little. Mostly because I thought he would be OK by the end of the movie. But I was wrong.<br/><br/>Great movie all around, anyone that says different has some sort of hatred of why movies are made in the first place."
"Camera-Obscura","Null","7","13","18 November 2006"," An actor's extravaganza
","With this remake of the Hong Kong actioner ""Internal Affairs"", Scorsese makes his mark again with a gripping crime saga in the vein of GOODFELLAS (1990) and CASINO (1995). This time he ventures into what must be somewhat less familiar territory for the director, the Irish milieu in South Boston, but screenwriter William Monahan is a Boston native and seems to know his targets inside out. <br/><br/>The cast is to die for, with a line-up of almost exclusively A-list actors. First there is Jack Nicholson as Jeff Costello (a reference to Alain Delon's character in Jean-Pierre Melville's 1967 classic LE SAMOURAI), a psychotic Irish crime boss. Jack Nicholson simply doesn't give bad performances, but here his performance borders on caricature, but somehow he manages to check it in such away, it remains acceptable. Perhaps Scorsese should have toned him down a little, but who can control Jack Nicholson? Who wants to? Perhaps over the top, but hugely entertaining. Perhaps he is the only actor who can get away with this. The rest of the cast is simply outstanding with Leonardo DiCaprio in a very impressive role as Billy Costigan, an undercover cop infiltrating Jeff Costello's gang. Matt Damon as sergeant Sullivan is somewhat more one-note but it seems to fit his role just right. Perhaps he intended it this way. Mark Wahlberg is very amusing as the most twisted, hostile and foul-mouthed cop in recent screen history.<br/><br/>On a credibility level, the film put me to the test a couple of times. Why is Jeff Costello, who runs multi-million dollar drug transports, still collecting protection money in person from Pakistani shop owners? The sub-plot with the delivery of microprocessors to the Chinese for the fabrication of advanced weaponry was truly laughable, especially the encounter between Nicholson and his cronies and a Chinese gang in leather jackets. It looked like a scene from a grade-Z '80s action flick. At times the setting in the film plays more like the '70s, despite the very 2006 cell phones, that play such a crucial role in the film, they almost grow into a character of their own. This must be the film with the most close-ups of cell-phones so far.<br/><br/>In South Boston all little Irish boys seem to grow up as cops or criminals. I am not sure whether this film should be seen as a realistic depiction of the Boston crime world. In the core, it probably is, but it's more a like a mixture of '70s values, clothes and family ties, with some modern elements thrown in the mix. Irish blokes standing in front of a restaurant with their caps and all, I don't know. Somehow, it seems more like a throwback to another age. Or perhaps in some places, like South Boston, things never change. But probably that's the whole point. Scorsese always presents us an over-inflated dreamworld, where in the end every person runs wildly amok. With Scorsese, bad guys are not just bad guys. They are out-of-control monsters, whether it is Jeff Costello in this film or Joe Pesci in GOODFELLAS or CASINO, they all have an almost comic book flair, which doesn't make 'em any less interesting. On the contrary, after all, this IS the movies. The truth is no excuse. Often, the imagination is far more interesting.<br/><br/>I still have to chew a little on this, but this film is quite an overwhelming experience. One of those films, that was already a classic before it came out. Besides some of the aforementioned reservations, these still were a dynamite 149 minutes.<br/><br/>Camera Obscura --- 8/10"
"sbdjones","7","7","13","25 October 2006"," top ten stupidest endings
","The movie in and of itself was good ... until the last 5-10 minutes. It looked like the writers realized the movie was running long and wrapped things up without putting too much energy into how this would look to the viewer. When Will comes out of the elevator with Sullivan and gets shot, they lost me. Where did the other informant come from?? I know he was a buddy of Sullivan but there had been no indication up to that point that he was anything but a third-tier character so why give him such a pivotal task? It didn't make any sense! I would have thought the girlfriend would have been killed (and I'm convinced the baby was Will's) because she knew the secret. By the way, Jack Nicholson looks as creepy in this film as he does in most of his films so the talk about him winning an Oscar is about as well-deserved as Denzel Washington for ""Training Day"" or Reese Witherspoon for ""Walk the Line"". All in all, it's a rental."
"peterportez-1","7","7","13","18 October 2006"," Why a meaningless and unbelievable subplot?
","I must have read a dozen reviews of ""The Departed"" by professional critics. No one, however, has pointed out the utter meaninglessness of the 20-minute subplot--quickly discarded--involving the selling of mysterious microprocessors to agents of the government of China. It's beyond belief to ask an audience to believe that a local mobster into loan sharking, drug dealing, and the usual local mobster fare would delve into far murkier international intrigue. I guess Scorcese must have had second thoughts, too, since this whole sequence was dropped like a hot potato, not to be mentioned again. Further, and oddly, too, the agents of the Chinese government are seen speaking Cantonese, not Mandarin.<br/><br/>Was the subplot a big mistake or was it an expensive tip-of-the-the-cap to the movie's Cantonese origins? In any case, it merely further bloated an already too-long film."
"RMS1949","3","7","13","18 October 2006"," Good but it's being over-rated
","Okay, yes, it's a good movie. Interesting script, loaded with good actors and nicely directed. But I read one reviewers remarks that said to forget ""Goodfellows"" and ""Raging Bull"" as this is Martin's finest work. To him I say 2 things (1) put down the pipe (2) step away from the keyboard. Goodfellows is still the definitive Mob movie ( The Godfather being the definitive Mafia film ) and there is no movie ever made that rivals the visual style that Raging Bull brought to the screen. To me The Departed is a movie about corruption. I never felt any sense of organized crime ,it was more like organized chaos. Characters are never developed or made memorable , thats all sacrificed to make more room for showing how intense the movie is suppose to be. Maybe because 2006 was such a lackluster year this will get more praise than its due. I enjoyed it for what it offered and will leave it at that. I think Jack Nicholson and Matt Damon were fine but it was Leonardo DiCaprio that gave the best performance. Since Martin Scorsese has never won an Oscar for Best Director he will probably be given the lead to win it come next Spring. Even though I see nothing here that he hasn't done better in other films.. Once again, its good,,just not as good as it's being touted.."

The female actress was added I'm sure just to give us a break from all the testosterone flowing from foul mouth males and she was rather weak and pointless. One scene that really sickened me was Jack in the restaurant scene with his hands and shirt covered in blood...what was he doing? Breaking in a new crew or butchering a pig ? My husband thought the movie too long and and I sometimes felt that the director was just off camera saying...""lights, camera ,action"", especially the scene on the roof top near the end of the picture with Dicaprio and Damon.It looked too staged as if Dicaprio was looking for direction. The blood bath on the elevator was horrible mainly because some of the audience (20 in total) started to laugh and because a second mole was introduced and quickly dispensed. What??? But the last frame(with the you know what)was laughable So did we like it? Well the hype was there so we caved in and spent $17.40 (CND)but it wasn't what we expected.My husband wondered if it was a waste of 2 long hours and I'm still so numb I'll have to get back to him with an answer."

","Never boring, but the actors are so wired, the dialog so colorlessly profane and the plot so thin you realize it's a puzzle where the pieces don't fit.<br/><br/>The most laughable scenes are Mark Wahlberg's at the beginning where he is taunting DiCaprio: it never leads anywhere and you don't know why he is doing it. Martin Sheen sits there doing nothing, either as an actor or a character.<br/><br/>The only female character (who isn't a whore) is part of a plot so predictable you wonder why they bothered it has so little payoff.<br/><br/>There are plenty of good moments, good violence and exciting chases. But the ending of the movie gets so cluttered, with so many twists, it undermines the original cat-and-mouse war between DiCarpio and Damon.<br/><br/>The movie makes you think it is building to this classic showdown, but strange plot diversions, endless double-crosses and lame exposition from secondary characters ruins the tension and you are left with violence as a substitute for suspense.<br/><br/>You have never seen so many great actors assembled for so little purpose and such mediocre results.<br/><br/>""Goodfellas"" represents ensemble work at its best. ""The Departed"" is selfish solo work that allows all the actors to do what they do best...except realize they are in the same movie together."
"ede559","5","6","11","26 March 2007"," It was not that great~~
","Having watched the original Hong Kong version - Infernal Affairs - I personally thought The Departed was lacking in many areas. Leonardo Di Caprio portrayal of the undercover cop character was not as good as Tony Leung. I am a big fan Tony Leung's acting. He has a very good screen presence and has a smoothness and charisma to his acting. In many ways the characters and scenes where better portrayed in Infernal Affairs when compared to The Departed. For instance, when Martin Sheen died (in IA, this was Anthony Wong), Di Caprio's reaction was more 'what the hell' than that of sadness. Also a lot of the 'copied' scenes, was overdone in The Departed. Martin Scorsee always tries to overdo things and he does it again. Trying to re-think and re-do a perfectly fine scene to try make it his own.<br/><br/>A see people, commenting whether or not there will be a sequel. Well in Hong Kong there were 2 sequels. Well kind off. The second was like a prequel that mainly goes back to the beginning to tracks Andy Lau (Matt Damon) and Tony Leung's (Leonardo Di Caprio) rise and how the came to be the person they were in Infernal Affairs 1. The third actually continues from the first film and concludes the trilogy. But it will be hard to re-use this idea in The Departed, cos a prequel was kinda included in the start of The Departed. Also i did not know why Scorsee wanted to create the love triangle when it was not necessary. I mean in IA, they had separate love interests. Tony and Kelly Chen was a good pairing and it allowed Tony's character to put down his guard and be himself when he went to see her (oh, she was his shrink)...<br/><br/>..Anyways I would certainly recommend Infernal Affairs to anyone. If you liked The Departed, you might want to check out Infernal Affairs. I not sure whether or not ppl will like it. I really loved Infernal Affairs. and that was maybe why I found the Departed to be a bit of a bore...maybe you'd feel the same if you watched The Departed before Infernal Affairs...."

Jack Nicholson had his part down almost perfect and Mark Walberg was great as an edgy, cranky cop on the good. But this movie did one thing very few movies can ever claim; it showcased and proved the actor of the decade, Leonardo DiCaprio. Yes, I would not have ever thought I would make this claim but He has earned it.<br/><br/>If you like realistic violence, hard-hitting drama and edge of your seat suspense then this movie is for you.

With such a brilliant director working on an originally excellent HK movie to bring it to silver screens in America, it is hard to see how it would not be a movie that would capture audiences.<br/><br/>That said, it is much better done that other US adaptations/clones of Asian movies such as The Lake House (Korea's Il Mare in 2000), The Ring, The Grudge, Dark Water etc.<br/><br/>I still hope that there will be an adaptation of Infernal Affairs II and III done."

What a let down. There was a star-studded cast, and there were some moments of good acting, but on the whole, the plot line and pace were boring. Beyond the interesting idea of having a mob informant and police informant working at counter-purposes, nothing much of interest was done with this. The movie drags along until about the 2.5 hour point, when suddenly the producers must have said ""hmmm... time to end this... what shall we do? I know... lets just shoot everybody in the head and be done with it!""

"zetes","8","7","14","9 October 2006"," Average Scorsese - which means it's still a fine film, just not one of his best
","Scorsese's long-awaited remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs. Infernal Affairs was a good film, but it always seemed to me like a gimmick, and more like a skeleton of a film than a real film. Scorsese predictably fleshes it out so it doesn't seem as much like just a good concept. The actors add a lot to it, too (though the Hong Kong actors, including Andy Lau and Tony Leung, were very good, as well). I don't think it stands anywhere near Scorsese's best work myself. It doesn't carry near the weight of Goodfellas, for instance. It starts to get a little silly near the end, and the director makes a few really bad choices Â– especially including that awful image in the final shot. That's just plain embarrassing film-making. And that's not to mention the awful choice the filmmakers made to change a certain part of the ending of Infernal Affairs - the original is definitely stronger in that respect. Of the actors, my favorite was Mark Wahlberg. Matt Damon comes in second, and DiCaprio third. Nicholson has a lot of fun as the gangster. The best comparison with previous Jack performances is actually the Joker from Burton's first Batman movie. Alec Baldwin has probably the most memorable moment, where he expresses his love for the Patriot Act. Well worth seeing, but definitely not best-of-the-year material. I would rank it quite below Scorsese's previous two films from this decade, The Aviator and Gangs of New York."

I guess what was more disturbing was when the audience laughed, not once, but every time. The accents were very inconsistent, more of a distraction than anything else. Jack Nicholson did an amazing job, as always is expected, but the only truly convincing accent came from Martin Sheen. Beware that there is some rather realistic gun violence. The blood spattering is very graphic and sometimes jolting. <br/><br/>Mr. Scorsese sorry, but this definitely wasn't one of your better films. Maybe you have already done your best work. Too bad because I used to be a big fan. Hopefully you next film will work up to something memorable."

","The movie had a shot at being good and maybe even great, but ""The Departed"" departs from reality, leaves loose ends, has outrageous plot holes, and is ultimately forgettable, rather than haunting.<br/><br/>Let me outline it for you...<br/><br/>Two kids grow up to be ""Staties"" (Mass State Troopers). One kid planted there by the mob (Matt Damon), the other kid chooses to be there as a revolt to his family (Leonardo DiCaprio). Both actors gave amazing performances.<br/><br/>DiCaprio fits the image of a wise guy, and an eventual fall out - so he is placed undercover with the Mob (Led by Jack Nicholson -- also incredibly excellent).<br/><br/>Damon (practically raised by Nicholson) as a mole in the state troopers constantly informs Niholson that he is about to be caught, thereby providing him with enough getaway time. DiCaprio of course keeps giving away Nicholson's position. Eventually, Both sides learn there is a mole and both sides ask Damon to figure it out. As such, Damon has a large conflict of interest in trying to find himself, and has no access to the under-covers who have been placed in the mob.<br/><br/>Here's where the movie gets bad, stupid, sloppy, ugly.. whatever you want to call it... Damon starts dating a psychologist working for the police, and DiCaprio starts seeing the same psychologist as a patient. DiCaprio eventually ends up at her doorstep and sleeps with her. She has no apparent moral dilemma with the fact that she is cheating on her cop boyfriend and sleeping with who she thinks is a thug.<br/><br/>Marky Mark -- great performance, and in the end, is completely wasted, and there is no explanation as to why he does what he does at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>To make matters more confusing, Nicholson is also an FBI informant. Huh? This subplot was not needed and made no sense. I don't believe the FBI would have the highest man on the mob food chain on their payroll.<br/><br/>Near the end of the movie, DiCaprio gives the psychologist an envelope and tells her to open it in two weeks or sooner if something happens to him. Well something does happen to him, and guess what? We never find out what is in the envelope. So, why did he give it to her? I just don't know.<br/><br/>More sub-plot -- the psychologist gets pregnant. One might assume she is made pregnant to add conflict as to who's baby it might be. In the meantime, she shows an ultrasound and declares that it is a boy (which by the way, cannot be determined until about 16 weeks. So, why was she made pregnant? I don't know.<br/><br/>As the movie moves along, you begin to think maybe there's a twist with the psychologist -- maybe she's running the show behind the scenes, but instead, we are just left hanging with nothing to take home.<br/><br/>All this being said, the movie is entertaining but it's too long and eventually loses itself in it's continual unfolding subplots that go nowhere."

Jack Nicholson dropping in and out of his accent and Martin Sheen sounding like John Kennedy made some scenes look like Saturday Night Live parodies. After the finish that put most of the characters out of their misery, it was a relief to put this movie out of its misery.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to this, hoping that maybe this time Scorsese would finally get his Oscar. After all, had had half of the major male lead actors in Hollywood - Nicholson, Alec Baldwin, Mark Walberg, Matt Damon, Mattin Sheen.

","When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime. It's not my favorite Scorsese film, that honor belongs to Casino for me. But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well, rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond.<br/><br/>Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed, Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime. The film is simple enough, the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello. That was Scorsese's little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day, although his real name was an Italian one.<br/><br/>Nicholson's character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area. He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate. I didn't add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life.<br/><br/>Getting this man won't be easy because he has a full bag of tricks. One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy, concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division. A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations.<br/><br/>But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood. At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side. There are no dummies on either side, the police aren't keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come. <br/><br/>Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast. Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts. Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine. <br/><br/>Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time. The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese. Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year, he might have been nominated himself if he wasn't up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond.<br/><br/>The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson's character is in the film. If you think you know how this film ends, I guarantee you will be wrong. Nicholson's character has survived in many ways, that's all I can say.<br/><br/>Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston's atmosphere, as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas. He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time. The cast didn't let Martin down at Oscar time and they won't let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small."

Cue intrigue en masse, coated with tense cat-and-mouse games and green-and-white Irish culture in Boston, making The DepAHted something of a Goodfellas lite.<br/><br/>This is, essentially, all that is achieves. For a 'Best Picture' nominee, The Departed lacks heart and makes up for it by trafficking in violence, suspense and swearing. The aforementioned naturally gets it a long way with most people, and indeed even with me, but since Martin Scorsese is incapable of making a film shorter than two and a half hours, the substance stretches thin. I'm no math whiz but things simply do not add up to a complete film. Much like in Goodfellas, The Aviator and Gangs of New York, Scorsese gets so taken with the setting and atmosphere that he positively dawdles on scenes and the majority of these serve no other function in the story than to get us a feel for the way--and the venality--with which things are run.<br/><br/>The acting, by contrast, is actually good. Jack Nicholson may simply be rehashing his psycho-Jack routine but it works as well as ever and he chews scenery whenever he is on screen. Leonardo Dicaprio inhabits something of a lead role in the film, but his acting regimen consists of shouting as loudly as he can. Billy Costigan is a difficult character to capture the nature of, for he is both contradictory and confused, jockeyed between the Irish mafia and his allegiance to the police department. Matt Damon's slick character Colin Sullivan is a joy to watch as he ""rises faster than a twelve year old's dick"" in his career, but much credit is also due to Mark Walhberg's streetsmart Dignam who is given some excellent and brilliantly funny dialogue in the script, such as the latter observation about Sullivan. The only problem is that he is at the mercy of a grossly underwritten character.<br/><br/>The big problem that The Departed has is that its story rotates around genuinely unlikeable anti-heroes. I'm not even sure if they'd qualify as heroes, for these are characters with good qualities that are so distant that you need binoculars. It is difficult to slot them in protagonist/antagonist positions because while Sullivan is corrupt and selfish, he is funny, charming and we follow him from childhood. Costigan, by contrast, lacks all the enjoyable theatricality of his polar character and comes across as whiny, moody and desperate in his actions but certainly he is morally right in the film, and quite firmly on the side of good in spite being taken under the wings of Nicholson the mob boss himself.<br/><br/>Without likable characters a wide array of problems follow, but the direction, pace and action of the film cleverly mask most of these. Who cares that all women are hookers (often literally)? Who cares that these is product placement by the bucketload? And who cares that the ending is one huge mess? The fact is that Martin Scorsese knows how to craft a compelling film, and much of this expertise has translated into an enjoyable crime cop drama with Boston accents and slang that snap and crackle like kindling in a fireplace. Ultimately, the actors sing tunes we have all heard before and the story may be intricately-sketched but we have been down this road before, so this is nothing revolutionary. And where, pray tell, is the tracking shot?!<br/><br/>7- out of 10"

","This was a very good film and I would recommend it overall. Riveting and interesting up until the last several minutes.

So much more could have been done after Damon and Di Caprio knew about each other - but the writing tanked at that point.<br/><br/>Overall, very good direction. Fantastic performances from Nicholson, Damon, Di Caprio, etc. But a very flat ending that was done, seemingly, for shock value and nothing more. A disappointment.<br/><br/>For those with a dark sense of humor (like mine) it was very funny - and Nicholson was in his element.<br/><br/>I expect some nominations out of this, some of which would not be warranted (picture, screenplay, possibly even direction).

","It was great acting by everyone involved until the ending. The ending was too incoherent and left too many unanswered questions for my tastes. I felt let down after expecting so much. My biggest problem was why Billy, knowing he has only one person left on the PD who knows what he's doing and also knowing he can't trust anyone else because of the mole, doesn't find Wahlberg before turning himself in. What did the girl getting pregnant have to do with anything? Why wasn't Damon more upset knowing that the girl heard the CD? What about the letter? Did she give it to Wahlberg? Every other person in the movie was a mole in either the PD or the mob including the mob boss. And when Billy mentions to Damon that the only other person he's talked to has been a police psych and Damon got a strange look on his face I thought that was going to lead to some discovery. Nothing. Too many threads that went nowhere. Good grief. Just try to sort out the cell phones. The more I think about it the less I like it."

The film is just too violent and too much swearing when its not needed. the reason why i like the Chinese one more is not because of the originality but because of the smoothness of the story... if that makes any sense! the music sells the film! overall i hate this film... a lot! because its rubbish, too violent when its not even needed, pointless swearing, and worse of all its stolen from a better original film! i don't recommend this to anyone. i do, however, recommend Infernal Affairs the Chinese one. i think it came out in 2001? not sure."
"WriterDave","10","6","12","9 October 2006"," The Renaissance
","Martin Scorsese has reached a point in his career where he has free reign to do whatever he wishes as a director. It's hallowed ground for an auteur, and as such, every actor worth his salt would kill to work for him knowing full well that whatever Scorsese chooses to do will be an uncompromising work of art. With ""The Departed"" he has quite possibly one of the greatest casts ever assembled. The deliciously convoluted plot based on the recent Asian flick ""Infernal Affairs"" showcases Jack Nicholson as an Irish mob boss; Leonardo DiCaprio as an undercover cop infiltrating the crime ring; Matt Damon as the crime ring's inside man with the police unit assigned to bring them down; Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, and Mark Wahlberg as the cops working above Damon and DiCaprio; and a breakthrough role for Vera Farmiga as a police psychiatrist in a love triangle with Damon and DiCaprio. This brief but confusing rundown is merely the tip of the iceberg and reveals nothing of the plot twists and tension riddling every aspect of the film like bullet holes from a machine gun massacre. <br/><br/>By now, Scorsese is to crime dramas what Hitchcock was to psychological thrillers. Comparatively, he's at the same point in his long career Hitchcock was when he gave us ""Rear Window,"" ""Psycho,"" and ""Vertigo."" Scorsese could've directed this blindfolded and it would've still been first rate. What's so thrilling about Scorsese as a filmmaker is that he's always directing full throttle with his eyes wide open. ""The Departed"" is so ridiculously good it left me with chills afterward. After a brief departure to big budget Oscar pushes with ""Gangs of New York"" and ""The Aviator,"" Scorsese returns to the familiar ground of his most revered projects like ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Raging Bull,"" Goodfellas,"" and ""Casino."" All his hallmarks are here: fantastic use of music, brilliantly choreographed bouts of violence, heart-pounding editing, deep and meaningful camera shots and movement, religious iconography, an epic and detailed sense of place (in this case, Boston), and highly quotable dialogue that is dramatic and funny and full of pathos in all the right places.<br/><br/>With its rising tension and cat-and-mouse theatrics, ""The Departed"" is easily the most viscerally thrilling studio film to come down the pike in many moons. Scorsese doesn't just treat us to his usual bag of tricks, he re-imagines them, and in exorcising perfectly balanced performances from an amazingly talented cast that in the hands of lesser director may have gone over-the-top, he delivers a modern day tragedy on par with greatest works of Shakespeare. For Scorsese, the big screen is his canvas, the camera his paint brush, and the blood splattered across the screen his awe-inspiring brush strokes. He's a veteran, he's a master, and ""The Departed"" is his Renaissance."
"sven-58","6","6","12","9 October 2006"," More of the same - good, but the same
","Don't get me wrong, I am a big Marty Scorcese fan, but I want to point out a few things about his latest film that you may not have noticed because he has become so crafty over the years. These are some of the ""tricks"" or ""Devices"" which were cool in ""Casino"" when first used, but now that it is ten years later, they seem a bit tired and overused.<br/><br/>1. The use of Early Rolling Stones music under a scene. Can't you afford to hire a real composer? OK, we get it. Rolling Stones music is cool, but do you have to use it in every movie and have it play under scenes. <br/><br/>2. The steady cam shot into a place of business that the mob guy has dominion over: Although the steady cam shot in this film was relatively short, it still reeked of the same type of shot into the Copacabana club in ""Good Fellas"" <br/><br/>3. The Iris wipe. This, to me was never a good idea and in fact seems like a frustration of the ""limitations"" of film by Scorcese: Basically, the director can't find a way to focus our attention on a particular piece of business in the shot, so he narrows our field of view to exclude everything else except what he wants us to see. <br/><br/>4. Lots of graphic violence. Again, OK, we get it. Organized crime kills people and chops them up and puts their heads in vices and beats them with baseball bats: Hey, Scorcese has an excellent special effects team headed by Robert Legato that make those head splatter shots realistic, but really, there is more violence in a Scorcese picture than most Friday the 13th flicks. Can you tell the story with less on screen violence? It seems that Scorcese forgot that the audience has an imagination and that their imagination is more powerful than his special effects and stunt crew. <br/><br/>5. The ""chop sound with picture"" edit. Again, a cool and effective device for switching scenes, but again more of a crutch device. Can't you just find a clever way to edit from one scene to the next without chopping the music from the previous scene?<br/><br/>6. Stupid women. Aren't you ladies a little angry at how women are portrayed in Scorcese's films? Let's see, Jodie Foster is an under-age hooker in Taxi, Sharon Stone is a drugged-out gold-digger in Casino, and Vera Farmiga plays a Psychiatrist, but is basically pushed around and lied to the whole picture. I am guessing that this is reflecting Scorcese's Heritage's view of women as subservient, second-hand citizens. Imagine how much richer his films could be if he had the ability to portray a strong female character?<br/><br/>In summary, I really enjoy Scorcese's directing and his visual style. I am just disappointed that the little Italian man gets stuck in his bag of cinematic tricks. Imagine Hitchcock using a shower scene in several movies or Kubrick using a steady cam shot behind a big wheel more than once and you get the idea I am trying to get at."
"axeman_z","6","6","12","7 October 2006"," Oscar worth until...
","...Until that is it turned into a retarded Jerry Springer episode. I mean, through the entire move the plot was excellent, the acting superb, the movie just breath-takingly good until the last 20 minutes or so. Then, for no really apparent reason, it turned into a Loony Tons episode and like six people get killed. Now mind you, throughout the entire movie we only see one or two deaths, and it is a long movie, and several other deaths were implied. But in the end, it turns into a three ring circus with people just getting shot in the head for no apparent reason. I understand this movie was based on a book but come on, take a little creative liberty with it like most directors do with good source material. Now let me say some positive things about the movie. The cast was stellar, all involved parties gave one of their best or their best performances ever. And this next comment goes to all the haters of Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Wahlberg, I have been telling you all for years that their acting skills were awesome and this movie proves it. Shame on some of you for not liking some of their early works. In the end, this movie goes from excellent dark, sometimes funny thriller, to just plain silly. This is one movie I would recommend seeing at theaters only if you are a die hard fan of the director. and love horrible endings that last for nearly a half an hour. For anybody else thats more intelligent, wait for the DVD your friend buys then borrow it or rent it from Netflix and form your own opinion as you will be very upset after having sat through that entire great movie for such a crappy ending."

Jack is not only an evil psychopath, but has a prankster, little boy quality as well. Leo shows every emotion there is, Alex Baldwin is hilarious as is Mark Wahlberg. A lot of violence, but aren't all Scorcese movies fairly violent? He knows the mob and how to show their personalities. A big film! Jack is a legend.

","I was surprised by the 8.5 points received by this film. 6 of us went to watch this film and none of us liked it. Considering my other 5 friends have watched the original Hong Kong version, this one is sadly not up to standard. The acting part is excellent, especially Leonardo DiCaprio. I could almost feel his struggle sipping through the silver screen. I haven't watched the Hong Kong version yet and I felt asleep in the middle of the film. This is profoundly related to the weak and insensible sound effect, plateau of the plot (the Hollywood version is subtly different than the Hong Kong one), as well as the abuse of indecent language. All that is enough to spoil the whole image. Last but not least this is the worst cinematography and editing I have ever experience in watching a mega-budgeted film. Cuts from scene to scene are rough and disturbing. From another perspective, the $10 I paid is worthwhile for the good sleep in a cinema's padded chair."

I felt compelled to write this review after I rented Internal Affairs. I'd like to start off first by saying that I had no idea what Internal Affairs was about. After about 30 minutes and seeing all the similarities, it was easy to see that The Departed is a poorly done remake of Internal Affairs. Sure it's not as sexy as the Hollywood version but the acting is so much better to the point that I was rooting for the undercover cop whereas when I watched the Departed, I was rooting for the mole.<br/><br/>The Departed isn't a BAD movie, however watch Internal Affairs and once you get over the Hong Kong camera shooting style and cheesy romantic music, you'll see what real acting and a plot that makes sense is all about (The Departed was a little unclear at the end).

Take the villain as an example. Comparing to Eric Tsang's portrayal of the mafia boss, Jack Nicholson's character lacked depth, unpredictability and bone chilling factor. Eric Tsang convinced us that the character was capable of coldly plotting such a scheme. Costello played by Nicholson was nothing more than just an ordinary mean Hollywood mob character. It's a joke for anyone who used more than 5% of their brains to think that a loud mouth like Costello could come up with a well thought of plot. Similar arguments can be applied to Matt and Leonardo's characters. They all lacked the intelligence of their original counterparts.<br/><br/>All three of them are great actors. I love Matt in the Bourn movies. He's a perfect fit in them. Leonardo's great in Aviator.

But, since Scorsese started from Infernal Affairs, I have to measure his work from there, and it is pathetic. The scene where Leo and Gwen meet towards the end where he's sitting down outside and she holds him to her stomach is horribly shot. At the side angle it looks like his head is at her crotch level, at the behind Leo's head angle it looks like his head is at her breast level.<br/><br/>The two bright spots of the movie for me were Matt Damon playing a prick (as it just came natural to boo his character) and Mark Wahlberg showing he can take on an asshole role and not some guy in touch with his feminine side as all his other characters seem to be that I've seen.<br/><br/>If you're a someone who will never watch a subtitled movie and loves being spoon fed Hollywood crap as well as dick and fart jokes, I mean killing and sex jokes, this movie is great for you, seriously.

Ultimately, I could really see no point to the movie. It is much too long, padded by scenes which are unnecessary to the story-line and are just distracting. I was attracted to the plot. A cop undercover in the mob is old news and a cop who is on the take is also, but both in the same story is good stuff. Unfortunately, there is no character who is sufficiently in focus. The scene where Costigan is trailing Sullivan does not show anyone else dressed the way they are and so when Sullivan kills the wrong guy (dressed in ball cap and hooded sweat) it is not only a cliché but no surprise. The only criticism I have of the acting is the constant and annoying way the actors' accents vary, frequently within the same scene. I have never been in Boston (but really like Dennis Lehane's books) but do fancy high-rise apartments really have rats running across the balconies?

It's in fact quite good, for who have never watched or heard about its original movie: the Asian famous THE INFERNAL AFFAIR.<br/><br/>It is just a less-than-adequate remake to ask for an Academy, especially key awards like best picture, directing, film editing and shamefully, *Screenplay Adapted Writing*.<br/><br/>As one already stated here: ""If The Departed could win Oscar for best picture, then Infernal Affair should have been voted the best film of decade"". LOL. But I agree.<br/><br/>For movie's sake, I beg all of you who praised this and (certainly) have not seen The Infernal Affair, please go to your local video shop and ask for Hong Kong movie titled above.<br/><br/>You would see that someone might have cheated the Oscar this year. For the following reasons: 1- This is a remake (for a *recent* well known movie), not original work of art. 2- Lack of directing role (half load of the scenes, especially good one, stole directly from IA). 3- Poor creativity 4- Even for any ""creativity"" added, they were really silly compared to the original plots. 5- Except Leo and Jack, remaining casts are just adequate. 6- Even for Leo and Jack could not beat the superior acting from Tony Leung and Anthony Wong in IA. Matt also can't compare to Andy Lau in the original (What could we blame it for? director? or screen writing?) 7- Unrealistic and cheap added/adjusted stories: the undecided psychologist's love for both 2 male characters (was totally different from original) with instant hot sex, the never-ending cursing from decent police force, and the *surprise* ending. (For that, I really shocked for the ""Best Adapted Screen Writing"" award). 8- Many good&intelligent scenes, instead, was removed. For example, the Morse Code. <br/><br/>And all experts here have said more than enough about the 2 movies, but I just add my final 2 cents: ""How could Scorsese gather that much courage to bring this *copycat* to the contest? and how could they let this win the important Academy shamelessly?""<br/><br/>Really don't understand. America maybe should have not advertised any about this film, not mentioning giving Academy for it - if they really don't want the rest of earth to see and think Hollywood is declining...<br/><br/>Poor old Scorsese."
"author-21","4","4","7","26 February 2007"," Overrated, silly ending
","I've seen a lot of overrated movies in my life (can anyone say The Crying Game? Gladiator? Million Dollar Baby?) but never has an entire audience been so completely lost by the Director of an eventual Best Picture Winner. In my screening in Gainesville, Florida, the last forty minutes of the film -- you remember, the forty minutes in which nine of the eleven main characters get skull-shot by someone else? -- the audience was so pulled out of the thing that people were actually LAUGHING AT THE SCREEN. This is a truly mediocre movie. It's dreary, it's ham-acted, the dialogue is forced, it's half an hour too long, and its ending is one of the silliest I've ever seen in a film that expects itself to be taken seriously."

But this was not what i was expecting from him. Loyalty has been a bias in many of the reviews of this rushed and inconclusive movie."

But the ending! The stupidest ending in a film in a long time!!! All the main characters have their brains blown out? What the hell were Monahan & Martin trying to say? Stupid. Very stupid. We invest all our time in this story and it ends in an inane bloodbath, without any sense of what the hell the message or point was supposed to be. If there even was one. Guys like Scorsese and the people who do the Sopranos etc. spend so much time glorifying these violent, insane, psycho mofo killers I guess they gotta kill 'em all off at the end to assuage their guilty consciences. Over-rated. Rent some John Woo Hong Kong gangster movies: you'll get the requisite blood and guts, but at least the endings will make sense and be satisfying, unlike The Departed. D ."

"ahodara","3","4","7","1 November 2006"," What's all the fuss about?
","Scorsese wanted to give us cops. criminals, mayhem, and suspense. But he didn't seem to care enough to craft an ending with any subtleties, twists, or psychological resolution. For this we sat through 2 1/2 hours of complication? Some other major failings: the opening is too long with lots of unneeded exposition; and that female lead...what a bore. Did she actually have lines? I didn't notice. DiCaprio was great, Damon wooden, Wahlberg surprisingly good, Sheen likable but the Boston accent unconvincing. And then there was Jack. As one critic says, he plays himself. Note the little ""Shining"" grin at one point. There was no stretching here for the old Lakers fan. Can I get my money back?"
"JoshtheGiant","10","4","7","11 October 2006"," A Quick Review
","I was never one of those people who thought that Martin Scorsese had lost his touch. I just thought that as he had grown older his interests had changed, and that was completely fine. No because I believe this would not say that The Departed is Scorsese's comeback. The Departed is his best film since Goodfellas, and is a complete masterpiece. The performances are top notch. If Dicaprio isn't at least nominated I will be extremely mad. Wahlberg and Nicholson are also both stand outs, and I hope both get nominations. Damon and Farmiga are both also amazing. The rest of the cast are very good, but don't stand out in the amazing cast. The script is also great. The dialogue is brilliant and they manage to give each and every character enough development to work well. I also hope Shore is nominated for his brilliant score. Those Irish strings and bagpipes pipe at exactly the right time. The Departed is Scorsese's best in years, and truthfully one of his best ever."
"Michael Kenmore","3","4","7","8 October 2006"," Not Martin Scorsese's best film; lame towards end & unnecessary profanity as filler
","(Minor spoilers ahead, but nothing crucial)<br/><br/>First off, I admire Martin Scorsese for his immense talent. I consider Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy his very best films, in terms of profound psychological affection as the result of masterly directing from the top-notch quality screenplays coupled with stellar actors, production design & cinematography.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Martin's previous films Gangs of New York and The Aviator, despite the flaws. I went to the movies to see this film and was very let down by the problems laid out below:<br/><br/>1) Way too much profanity and vulgarity! I could have expected this as the movie is a gangster genre. Filler language become obvious whenever actors Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlburg speak dialogues. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, profanity & vulgarity can be artful if written with the sharp-fine barb and spoken with mastered oratory as an actor embody the in-the-character expression with conviction. For example, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown and Full Metal Jacket. This film is right up there with The Last Detail, Scarface, Good Will Hunting and Made as the most colorlessly profane movies of all time that serve to irritate like fingernails scratching the blackboard from top to bottom in 45 degree angle. Filmmakers and screenwriters who over-utilize the F-word and demeaningly vulgar racial & sexual references to the extreme shoot their feet when it turns out nothing more than filler language that pad the mediocrely written & vapid screenplays that translate into even more annoying and vapid movies.<br/><br/>2) Bad acting across the board by Alec Baldwin & Marky Mark. Their so-called ""acting"" in screaming, cussing and assaulting are so over the top it's laughable. Not convincing at all.<br/><br/>3) The first hour is well-paced and tense. After that it went downhill in tedium with awful love triangle that go nowhere and is a plot device to pad the length. The action and twists towards the ending is stretching the reality to the point of having to suspend disbelief. Ludicrously plotted with marginal execution. At least clamshell cell phones have the starring role as the ingeniously written plot device to engineer the suspense. Alfred Hitchcock would have liked that idea if he were alive.<br/><br/>4) Jack sure can act like an evil mobster...at least in the first hour. Again, after that it went downhill with him acting like a clown fool and a prankster. Way to go for being out of character that pull the viewers out of the filmic world and see that Jack is just that -- Jack at his silliest in self-parody.<br/><br/>5) Final closing shot is unintentionally laughable for being so unsubtle Marty thought we the audience patrons are too dumb to get it so he stuck it in there. Even though the character in question seem to afford a very expensive luxury condo with no pests at all. Awfully stupid ending tied up in ludicrously complex double-triple-fourth crossing.<br/><br/>I enjoy Leonardo DiCaprio's role as an undercover mole, he's right for the movie. However, Matt Damon is woefully miscast that made him unconvincing as the first-rate traitor. That actress who play a police psychiatrist is awful in failure to be convincing -- subpar acting trying to look too sweet and cute in angelic form amidst the carnage of brutal assaults & grisly mob murders. Martin Sheen could have done more, but he seemed too timid and meek of a police chief who meets the tragic fate -- on the setting of a television police drama.<br/><br/>Fine cinematography and production design, but they should have tightened the pacing by cutting out the fat to make a lean & mean film. It drag on at times and whenever it drags they thrown in the train of F-bombs which is incredibly annoying after ten seconds.<br/><br/>Not Martin Scorsese's best or better film. Apparently this is a re-make of the acclaimed Hong Kong film which I regret having never heard of but will make time to watch to judge that the original may be better in tightly edited pacing and high-octane suspense.<br/><br/>** 1/2"

No single shot is dull, it is always captivating to watch. <br/><br/>This is the BEST film I have seen in a LONG time.<br/><br/>I can't say anything else but SEE THIS PICTURE.<br/><br/>Thank you Martin Scorsese, you are truly a master."

The suspense of this movie will have you on your a** the entire way. The story starts out kinda slow, but it speeds up as the movie progresses, and never slows down, or becomes to quick for the audience. The ending is very shocking to me, but you will be cheering when the last gunshot is fired. I liked this movie so much, I think it may be nominated for an Oscar, all for acting, Directing, Screenplay, and best picture. One of the best pictures of the year. 10/10"
"bertcampooper","Null","20","55","17 October 2006"," one AWFUL cinema experience
","Since this seems to be the place for overrated and disappointing ensemble movies, this movie should be right at home here. The great cast delivers on the performance end but the story itself is beyond awful. The ending rivals such distasteful and unsatisfying movies such as Road To Perdition or Open Water.<br/><br/>Anyone that says they like this film places style over substance. I don't care how slick or how good the performances are, if the story is this disjointed and unappealing, then the movie is crap. This is simply one awful cinema experience regardless of the cast or their performances."
"MartinHafer","7","7","15","15 March 2012"," It could make a psychiatrist's head explode!
","I realize that ""The Departed"" won four Oscars (one for Best Picture and one for Best Director and one for writing). I know that it has a HUGE overall rating on IMDb. I know it's a very popular movie. BUT, the film simply didn't do its homework when it comes to some of the characters. And, because of this, I was not especially impressed by the film. Now before you slam my review with another NOT HELPFUL, hear me out....<br/><br/>Had the writers cared about consistency and believability, they would have cared about the only major female character in the film. However, she was a caricature--a lady with zero believability...NONE. While it's true that films often get psychologists, psychiatrists and counselors wrong, this is among the very worst cases. While she's described as a counselor, she prescribes medications (that's illegal by the way--only an MD can do that). And, personal boundaries mean absolutely nothing to her...nothing. Here we have yet another case where a supposed professional begins sleeping with one of her patients--and one of the most screwed up ones at that! There is no reason to believe this relationship--there is no chemistry and he clearly is a mess...so she sleeps with him!! Why can't a film show a mental health worker who isn't crazy? Does some Tom Cruise write all the roles for psychotherapists in movies?! How can anyone believe her character in any way?! How does this bad writing get rewarded with all these Oscars? To me, an Oscar implies perfection...or at least near perfection...and this is not it.<br/><br/>By the way, since I am on a tirade, I am also irritated that the main baddie is called 'Frank Costello' (Jack Nicholson). Why pick this name since the real life Costello was a HUGE figure in the underworld and bore little semblance to the guy in the film (who is more like Whitey Bulger, by the way)? What not give him some totally fictional name? Why, if he's so much like Bulger, does his fate have nothing to do with Bulger's? I don't get it.<br/><br/>Now I am NOT saying it's a terrible film or I hate it. It's just flawed. So, despite Leonardo DiCaprio's wonderful performance and a taut script, it is a film that didn't really seem good enough to have received all these accolades."
"luke-rex","7","7","15","8 October 2006"," Over-rated
","This is a good film but not brilliant. I was really looking forward to seeing it as I'm a fan of all of the actors in this film. However, I found the story to be at times a little corny and it lacked soul and depth. It felt as if so much was happening but we have seen this before in cinema. I didn't take anything new away from this film. There were some lovely moments but all being said, I left the cinema a little disappointed. The critics were raving - look at the full page ads in the New York Post and New York Times. The style of the film felt like a non stop video clip. I wasn't keen on the editing in this respect. It was a very different style to Scorcese's other works, brightly lit - it in some ways reminded me of Pulp Fiction - kind of surreal - but not a drama reality.<br/><br/>Worth seeing but doesn't come close to Goodfellas. or Casino."
"quentar","6","7","15","7 October 2006"," Huge disappointment
","""The Departed"" is being hailed in some circles as Martin Scorsese's return to a genre he knows like the back of his hand -- the gritty crime drama. And to be fair, there are moments of grit in the film. The problem is they are just that -- moments. Nothing ever builds to any tangible feeling of dread. The film's effect (if it has any at all) dissipates the moment the credits roll.<br/><br/>The acting is serviceable at best, but the much touted script by William Monahan barely gives the main stars anything to sink their teeth into, with the exception of Mark Wahlberg. He's the only actor who registers anything resembling a real, live human being. Leo DiCaprio and Matt Damon try their best, but when they're not spouting exposition they're floundering with dialogue that tries in vain to give their characters some color. (The session between Leo and shrink Vera Farmiga, for example, drags on to embarrassing length in a dismal effort to give Leo some shading.) And while most reviews praise Nicholson, he's more of a distraction than any kind of menacing character. For all his offbeat touches, his character never come across as dangerous; in fact, the longer the film goes on, the less interesting he is and the more goofy and unbelievable he becomes. (There were times I wondered if anyone could possibly follow him into a life of crime.) As for Scorsese, whatever gritty touch one might think the master would bring to a supposed throwback project is sorely missing. At 2 1/2 hours, the film has a noticeably slack pace, and many scenes are surprisingly flat, considering Marty's way around a camera. The only scene with any real tension is the rooftop scene between Costigan and Queenan. The photography, editing, and acting all combine in a perfect example of film suspense. Nothing else in the film is nearly as exciting.<br/><br/>And the less said about the ending the better. It feels like Marty is trying to channel Quentin, but it just gets more and more outrageous until all connection with reality is sapped away. Too bad. I wanted to love ""The Departed"", but I can barely say I liked it."
"rck1","1","11","27","8 October 2006"," What was he thinking?
","The acting is good. A great cast: Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg. I especially liked Leonardo DiCaprio!<br/><br/>The story is a little hard to follow.<br/><br/>But what was Scorsese thinking? In a world filled with violence, terrorism, fears -- how can another movie like this, about gangsters, help? He already made Goodfellas. This is another Goodfellas. Why?<br/><br/>I absolutely do not recommend this film, regardless of the high marks the critics are giving it. Go rent the Pirates of Penzance and see something of quality that's fun to watch!"
"TooShortforThatGesture","6","10","24","2 October 2006"," Remember when Scorsese used to make GREAT movies?
","This is not a terrible movie, but it's hardly worth the investment of 2-1/2 hours of your time.<br/><br/>Mostly it feels like a well-filmed (and over-long) TV cop show episode. All very tense. All very ""who's really the bad guy and who has figured out who is good and who is bad"" with Boston ethic gloss on it (lots of ""Southie"" accents. Lots of ""F..k you"" ""No F..k YOU"" dialog. Lots of bloodshed at unexpected times (it is Scorsese after all).<br/><br/>But what it seems to lack is that ironic edge that makes the great Scorsese films great. It's just a little too much involved in the plot.<br/><br/>The acting is...expensive. I was mostly impressed with Scorsese's ability to convince a studio to pay to have Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson ALL appear in one movie at the same time and then to also add in Mark Wahlbern, Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen. But none of the performances were anything to write home about (though doubtless there will be a huge Oscar push for everybody -- but I'm thinking no winners because, if nothing else, they may all cancel each other out.) Damon and DiCaprio's important scenes felt a little ""acting school."" Martin Sheen was working hard not to be President Bartlett. Wahlberg was walking through a ""Southie"" caricature and Nicholson was once again trotting out the old crazy Jack routine.<br/><br/>Visually, things were not helped by the fact that the film does a good job of looking like Boston, which I generally find to be one of the least interesting looking large American cities. Even the iconic (in the movie) shot of the State House is sort of dull and when two characters talk about moving to another city, I found myself thinking ""Please do, I'm tired of looking at Boston."" <br/><br/>Some nitpicks -- <br/><br/>1. A slightly big deal is made of the fact that the shrink didn't go to Harvard. Then why is she wearing a Harvard shirt later in Damon's apartment?<br/><br/>2. This is yet another one of those movies that mostly makes sense, until it has a plot point involving technology. The, it behaves as if no one involved has ever really used anything invented after 1970. We get miraculously taped cell phone conversations that clearly weren't being taped when we saw them the first time. Or police personnel records that can be completely deleted by the press of one button by one person. Very Charlie's Angels.<br/><br/>3. In an already long movie, why do we have to see the whole ""giving the envelope to the shrink"" scene when the fact that she has the envelope does not have anything to do with how the last 15 minutes of the movie works out?<br/><br/>...and a couple of other similar silly things that kind of don't really add up when you think about them. They don't ruin the movie, but add to the sense that one is watching a film that is a bit more slipshod than it should be, given the high gloss of its cast and crew. <br/><br/>So, all-in-all, a movie to pass away a slow night at home on the DVD but nothing worth rushing out to the cinema for."

It was longer and more complicated than it needed to be. The Hong Kong versions were three movies and this one tried to put them all in one. No one acts and speaks realistically. It seems like the movie was set in the 80s. Take the cell phones and computers away and it might as well. The ending was ridiculous. BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! with CG blood. People want to believe they are so smart and intelligent for thinking this movie is so great. Just because it has a lot of big names doesn't mean it's good.

"Navaros","4","5","10","18 February 2008"," The Departed is barely better than Mobsters with Christian Slater
","The Departed is barely better than ""Mobsters"" with Christian Slater. For those of you who do not know what that is, it's a really mediocre/borderline crappy mafia movie from the 1990's.<br/><br/>I absolutely love both Goodfellas and Casino. They are both 10/10, no question. Knowing The Departed was made by the same guy and has a lot of good press, I went in with high expectations of that same standard from The Departed. But instead of getting a Goodfellas/Casino quality standard, The Departed instead has a ""Mobsters with Christian Slater"" (much, MUCH lower!) quality standard.<br/><br/>I will concede that The Departed beats Mobsters in terms of acting talent. But that's where it ends. On every other level, the two movies are almost equal. Terrible characters, terrible script, terrible dialogue, terrible story, and no reason to care about any of the above. The Departed and Mobsters are completely on par with each other in these ways. At least Mobsters is better in one way though; Mobsters features some memorable scenes that are hilarious in cheesy way, whereas The Departed does not (maybe 5 seconds of Jack's tool, but that's it).<br/><br/>I was honestly *shocked* that a Mobsters-quality movie has been made by Scorscese. What happened to his very high Goodfellas/Casino standards? Clearly, those standards have *departed* long before he made The Departed.<br/><br/>Jack in The Departed has to be the stupidest Don in the history of mafia movies. Even stupider than the Dons from Mobsters. He had umpteen opportunities to realize that Leo was a rat, starting well-before he even employed Leo into his mafia circle. For him to ignore all those very clear, umpteen warning signs and just let Leo do whatever Leo wants despite that not making any sense whatsoever, shows that he's far too stupid of a Don to be worth caring about (as is the script). Plus doing everything himself for no reason, which even other characters in the movie are smart enough to warn him not to be so stupid about, just adds to the ludicrousity that a powerful Don could be so darn stupid. Besides all that, most of his dialogue was almost completely incoherent. I enjoyed Jack's acting style which was great as usual, but the stupidity of the character's actions/inactions and terrible dialogue makes it so even Jack's great acting can't save the character from being worthless.<br/><br/>Here is a breakdown of the other ""characters"" in The Departed: <br/><br/>Matt & Leo - Generic pretty boys, with no character development at all, and bland generic dialogue throughout the whole movie. Leo did a very good acting job, but again, that does nothing to save the fact that his character had no reason to make him worth caring about. Is the reason to care about him ""technically"" supposed to be; to care about him because he's pretty? Because that's about the only thing that the character has going for him. Not a good reason to care about him, if that is the technical reason one is supposed to.<br/><br/>Shrink woman - Two-timing harlot. *Definitely* no reason to care about her at all. She adds nothing to the movie whatsoever. One of the most worthless main characters in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg was excellent and funny, but way under-used. The only interesting character in the movie, and the only interesting *thing* in the movie at all. But he doesn't have nearly enough screen-time to elevate the movie beyond a ""Mobsters with Christian Slater"" level.<br/><br/>The Departed is *easily* the worst Scorscese movie ever made, and one of the worst movies of the millennium. Mobsters with Christian Slater is worth maybe 5/10. The Departed is worth 5.5/10 at the very most.<br/><br/>Putting a bunch of high-paid, pretty actors in a movie does *not* make the movie into a masterpiece simply because it has a bunch of high-paid, pretty actors in it. Although that *does* seem to be the popular belief about The Departed. That belief is wrong. And it sets a very bad precedent that the bar can be set as low as possible and still a movie will be seen as a ""masterpiece"" by default *only* because it has a bunch of high-paid, pretty actors in it.<br/><br/>The Departed is a mediocre/borderline crappy movie that is almost exactly as bad as Mobsters with Christian Slater is. Christian Slater and the makers of Mobsters got robbed. They deserve Oscars for their work in Mobsters every bit as much as anyone involved with ""The Departed"" does. That a shoddy movie like The Departed received so much critical and consumer acclaim is tragic."

Even the bit parts by Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin were outstanding. The problem I had with the movie was how similar DiCaprio and Damon looked in this movie, I got sort of confused as to who was who. This is a different kind of cop story and I am sure you will enjoy watching the artistry of this unit of actors in this fine movie.

I had people all around saying, ""That looks so bad,"" but I knew it looked like a great movie. How can you possibly go wrong with a cast consisting of Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nickolson, and Mark Wahlberg? First off, the performances were probably what made this movie. If not for the sensational acting, The Departed just would not be worth watching. Leonardo was great as the lead, and Jack Nickolson was classic as the crime boss. Matt Damon was good, but he didn't really play that big of a part until the very end. However, the performance that really stood out here was that of Mark Wahlberg. He REALLY proved he can act here with an incredibly memorable character.<br/><br/>The plot felt like something new, and I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. However, I had many issues with the film. For one, the ending made me want to throw up. One of the worst endings to a film I've ever seen! Secondly, there were just too many plot elements that were left wide open and many things that were never given any explanation whatsoever.<br/><br/>The Departed was good, but if you want to see an amazing crime movie, stick with Alpha Dog. Alpha Dog is underrated, so you won't really know what to expect."

Scorcese deserves the Oscar for Mean Streets, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, King of Comedy, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, but if he wins one for this dreadful movie, well, that's Hollywood.

The Departed is Scorsese good though.<br/><br/>The story takes place in Boston which is a new field for Marty. It's actually quite refreshing. But when it all comes down the city doesn't really matter.<br/><br/>In terms of acting there isn't much to say. Everybody does their job, and well. EVEN Mark Wahlberg and Matt Damon. Dicaprio has really become a talented actor. But Matt is probably the actor that surprised me the most in this movie. I'm not a big fan of his, but he really does a good job here. I expected nothing less from the legend Jack Nicholsen which is one of my favorite actors. And Alec Baldwin probably shows his best performance so far.

","The Departed is the best movie I have seen in years. It's gripping, shocking and hilarious all in one movie. Like the best roller-coaster ride, one second you're laughing, the next you're 'Oh my God!' as something really shocking happens.<br/><br/>Yes this movie is a remake of the classic Hong Kong 'Infernal Affairs.' I loved the original but somehow the movie seems to sit even better among the Boston Irish.<br/><br/>The performances in this movie are all standout, the leads DiCaprio, Damon and Nicholson as well as the support Wahlberg, Baldwin, Sheen and Farmiga. It is their work which makes the Departed special and absolutely gripping. From the hilarious one liners thrown by Wahlberg's Dignam and Baldwin's Ellerby to the intense fear and vulnerability shown by DiCaprio's Costigan as he tries to survive in the world of Nicholson's colourful and terrifying Costello.<br/><br/>Surely this movies deserves some acting nods at the Oscars? I would certainly recommend 'The Departed.' You do need to be prepared for Goodfellas type violence and language but if you can live with this then The Departed will be one of the best movies you have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>10/10"
"refresh_daemon","8","5","10","8 October 2006"," Good, but it lack the resonance of Scorsese's more notable works.
","I watched The Departed the day after it's general release. While watching, I tried to set aside thoughts of the move it's a remake of, Infernal Affairs, aside to be able to assess the movie clearly. Now, I haven't seen Infernal Affairs in a while, so this wasn't too hard to do, however, since I was privy to plot foreknowledge, nothing was all too surprising.<br/><br/>Since I'd lived in Boston for three years, it was quite a treat to get to see that city again (well, some of it wasn't Boston, but enough of it was). The presence of the Yankee accent was okay, although I honestly wished that some of the less successful users had just gone without the accent altogether, because having it come and go sort of dropped me out of believability at times. There are enough long-time Boston natives that don't have it, that it wouldn't be weird for someone to lack the accent.<br/><br/>Almost all of the performances were overwhelmingly solid. At times Nicholson and Baldwin seemed to go a little too over-the-top, but it was forgivable. The direction was canny, careful and generally nuanced. Scorsese has always been an able director of actors and pulled out performances and matched it with an eye for visual that's both invisible, yet entirely specific at the same time.<br/><br/>I did have some issues with the film. First of all, Nicholson's character got too much screen time. He's not the emotional center of the film and a lot of what we see of him throughout the film may do a fine job of characterizing him as a badass devil-man, but we get that at the start. We need to focus on DiCaprio and Damon's characters and their stories (they are the centerpoint to the film); adding in all this excess Jack actually detracts from the film. The film's already a little bloated, running 2.5 hours, so a little chopping of extraneous scenes would've been good.<br/><br/>The ending was another problem. It all came a little too fast and was a little ridiculous--causing the audience to burst out in laughter--when Scorsese should've taken a little care to lead the emotions to that point. And then there's also the groan-inducing last shot--that really just took the ridiculousness of the end over the top.<br/><br/>So, what needed to be done to the ending? More attention needed to be paid to the moles. Towards the end of the film, DiCaprio's Billy comes across as wanting out so much that there's little motive for him to do what he does. The lack of motive leads to a lack of believability. I think focusing a little more on Billy and how the life of crime is breaking him down would've helped the drama, especially towards the end. This also goes for Damon's Colin. The impact of the life of being a good guy on his life really should've played a bigger impact. The events towards the end partially don't make sense because there's not enough motive for him to do what he does with Jack's Costello. Since his characterization breaks down towards the end, the finale just doesn't have a whole lot of resonance.<br/><br/>This movie really needed to be more about these two characters, even with the intricate plot. That's where the core of the drama should've been focused, but the attention of the film was spread too thin to allow the end to be convincing.<br/><br/>Now I'm going to start comparing with Infernal Affairs:<br/><br/>* The encapsulation of the two female characters from Infernal Affairs into one had a lot of potential. In IA, the female characters seemed less whole. Unfortunately, the Departed doesn't give her enough attention to pull any real drama. This is made worse by some cheap dramatics thrown in via a photograph and made a little ridiculous by the change in relationship between her and Billy, which wasn't really believable based on her characterization.<br/><br/>* Although I liked Walhberg's performance, his character wasn't necessary. The only reason for Dignam to even exist is to create the American ending. This is where Infernal Affairs manages to get it better. It better crafts a relationship between Leung's Chan (DiCaprio's Billy) and his police boss--the boss is the only one who knows and so when the later events occur, it's that much more devastating--and gives sufficient motivation for Chan/Billy to do what they do in the finale. It also prevents the believability hole that Billy wouldn't seek Dignam after those events.<br/><br/>* And this is another place where Infernal Affairs shines--the focus on the two moles. The movie really explores how pretending to be someone else can affect the way someone thinks and behaves. Chan is just as desperate as Billy to get out, but Chan also keeps a better eye for justice, despite his problems. Likewise, Lau's character (Damon's Colin) has to grapple with the life afforded him by being a goody-two shoes and figure out just where his loyalties lie and why. This leads Infernal Affairs' ending to be more effective than the Departed's, because it's not cheap and the impact of Lau's decision weighs with him even after the credits roll. No one laughs at the end of Infernal Affairs.<br/><br/>* The Departed doesn't have Infernal Affairs' flash and bang, but that works to its advantage--it's restraint, at least stylistically really helps what drama it has. Having come from a long tradition of Hong Kong films, the style pushes melodrama at times in IA.<br/><br/>All complaints aside, The Departed really is still quite an enjoyable film. The craftsmanship of all involved is highly polished and immensely engaging. Even though they share the same base, Infernal Affairs and the Departed are both different films, although they could've learned something from each other. The Departed is really good, but it lacks the resonance needed to bring it to the level of Scorsese's more notable works. 8/10."

","I'm still in shock that Martin Scorsese (who had such a hungry look on his face all through the preambles) got an Oscar for this senseless, blood-filled, curse-filled, demeaning, poorly acted and executed effort. I saw the ratings on IMDb and thought (after I had sat through the painful time it took me to watch this dreadful dumbed down copy of the Japanese original - Internal Affairs) that this is a joke, right? It must be whole truckloads of families of the many involved in this shambles rating the movie on IMDb. Anyone with even a knuckle-dragging IQ couldn't, couldn't, couldn't, admire this effort.

Irish Mafia. Indeed. More like the court jester to Martin's king.<br/><br/>And on. I could write pages and pages but what's the point. There was no character development, no bonding of the chief and the mole (a very basic part of the original plot) downright plagiarism in parts. I was constantly confused between the characters played by the ingratiating Leonardo DiCaprio and the smarmy Matt Damon. They look/act/behave/hairdyed the very same. The movie paying public shouldn't have to work so hard at character identification with each scene.<br/><br/>A plot and better direction and a modicum of a screenplay would have helped.

","The Departed is the most entertaining kind of non-stop, intense crime thriller of the year, maybe in the past few years. Some critics have said that it's the best film that director Martin Scorsese has made since Goodfellas. I understand where the compliment comes from, though I slightly resent the subtle criticism in the charge as well, meaning that Scorsese hasn't made a film as great or powerful or entertaining in over fifteen years. I would even go far as saying this is Scorsese's best since, well, Scorsese's last film, or at least since Gangs of New York. Some may forget, or maybe just not really take in, how consistently strong Scorsese's career has been overall, how he keeps on taking chances and still keeping his style so instictually 'cinematic' (he is possibly the biggest ""film-geek"" ever), so distinctive, and even so fresh in the 21st century, that his is a career akin to the likes of Kurosawa (many masterpieces, and otherwise very good to excellent efforts). The difference though this time from some of his previous outings- and this is perhaps the correlation with Goodfellas besides the obvious of genre linking- is that it's pure, devilish fun, it goes by quickly but supremely satisfyingly over what doesn't really feel like 2 1/2 hours, and it's cast is uniformly good.<br/><br/>Leonardo Di Caprio in particular is so impressive here- and this may be the first-viewing-buzz talking, it might be my favorite of all the performances I've seen him in up till now. Under Scorsese these past several years he's kind of grown up more and more from the oddly pubescent look to him even in his 20's. His performance as Costigan is often very ferocious and tough, but he also makes it a fully rounded character, one that he makes very much his own. He has a dark past, almost too dark to even be an informant for the Boston PD. His whole family is messed up, and there were even links to Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). So, what better way then to send Costigan into Costello's wing and see what comes out? Then the flip-side comes with Matt Damon's Colin, who infiltrates the police department in legitimate fashion. Damon's is the flip-side as well in performance quality to Di Caprio; while Di Caprio, even when lying through his teeth, is truthful to the bone and always believable, Damon is pitch perfect as a bold-faced liar, as he never flinches for a moment, even when caught like a deer in the headlights.<br/><br/>And the performances end up making a sort of square, with Damon and Di Caprio in their own corners, the bulk of the excellent supporting players (Martin Sheen, Marky-Mark Wahlberg, Ray Winstone, Vera Farmiga in a breakthrough role) on one, and Jack Nicholson all on his own. That was the first thing about hearing of the Departed that had me psyched, knowing that one of the great stars/actors of the past 40 years was teaming up with someone with a stature and track record like Scorsese's. With Nicholson in the role Frank Costello is at first already a character to feel is the 'man' in the room when he walks in and talks. But as far as performance goes, it's vintage Nicholson all the way, digging into it with the style, vigor, wit, charm, and all that and a bag of shark-grin chips that have made Nicholson so remarkable. His is such a dastardly character that it teeters on becoming self-parody, but both director and actor know how to reel the part in to being someone to fear, while also being someone who's a helluva lot of fun. It's worthy of an Oscar nomination, and not just because it's Nicholson in a movie.<br/><br/>As for the director and his crew, they have assembled what could be by the bare essentials nothing more than a genre film with a premise that seems a little cooked-up. But, of course, it is a remake of a trilogy of Hong-Kong police pictures, so that may be why the premise and story feels not completely original, even as it's passing itself off as one. Yet that too didn't detract. If anything, I felt as if Scorsese was doing what very few filmmakers working today- particularly this year if you look at what's come out- don't do, which is to take material, and not just do a simple 'remake', but to do a re imaging, a refashioning, a full-on reinterpretation into the deeper aspects, in this case the morality and sense of loss among all of these characters. There's some religious bits put in, as it IS Scorsese after all, but this time there isn't something like in Mean Streets where it's always there in the background. Here the characters are on, like in Goodfellas, a version of hell, where things all do come to a head; the last thirty minutes had me laughing, cringing, and mouth-agape in equal measures.<br/><br/>In other words, go see this film, if you think it might be up your alley, and you think you were burned by Scorsese ever since he left behind modern-time crime pictures ten years ago."

","I was a skeptic. I saw Infernal Affairs for the first time a few months ago and thought it was an excellent movie. One of the best Asian flicks i've seen (and i've seen a lot of them). I thought ""great....another American remake"". There was a small glimmer of hope. It's Scorsese after all. I waited....great rotten tomatoes rating. Great IMDb rating. Was this the comeback of American cinema? I was excited. It was what a wanted. A great story, great actors (well...more on that later), and a great great director who understood the genre.<br/><br/>Well...apparently, my guess is everyone that raved about this movie hasn't seen Infernal Affairs. This film, in no way, lives up to the original. I think, if you haven't seen the original, you would probably think this is the greatest film ever. The story is that clever, and Scorsese is that good. Unfortunately, it ALMOST all ways (not all...almost all) the Chinese movie betters this one.<br/><br/>You would have thought Scorsese learned after Gangs of New York that Leo does not make a good tough guy. Guess not. I hope Leo plays to his strengths and take roles more similar to Catch Me if You Can or the Aviator.<br/><br/>Martin Sheen's character is no where near as prominent as the Chinese flick. and in the end, as great as Matt Damon and Leonardo Dicaprio are, they do not have the ""coolness"" factor that Andy Lau and Tony Leung brought.<br/><br/>There were some correction of plot holes that were re-written to make more sense, but in general the plot changes were no good. Some scenes were done different to the original, but some scenes were done shot by shot. Unfortunately, even these copies scenes didn't deliver as powerfully as Infernal Affairs.<br/><br/>Infernal Affairs had such a great ""coolness"" factor to it. And the chase/action scenes were executed in a way that built up WAY more suspense than The Departed.<br/><br/>All that said, still a decent movie. But seriously.....if you've seen Infernal Affairs, don't expect this to live up to the hype it's been getting. If you haven't seen Infernal Affairs, I'll leave you with two options.<br/><br/>1) You are OK with watching non-Hollywood films and don't mind reading subtitles. By all means grab the Infernal Affairs DVD and watch this!<br/><br/>2) You hate reading subtitles and dislike non-Hollywood films. Watch The Departed and enjoy it.

","""The Departed"" is arguably the greatest cop movie ever made, and certainly one of the best movies of the 2000s - period. What Scorsese did with this movie was masterful: he took a perfectly good crime thriller (the original ""Infernal Affairs"") and elevated it even higher to become a saga of class, race, betrayal, and ""families always rising and falling in America."" ""The Departed"" is one of the most hard-edged, dramatic, and gripping movies that I've ever seen, with a multi-layered story that keeps you coming back to the film again and again. I love the central premise, which takes classic Scorsese tropes like Catholic guilt and ethnic identity and fuses them with true crime history - Frank Costello, after all, is based on Boston's infamous Whitey Bulger.<br/><br/>On a technical level this movie is outstanding: the direction, musical score, and cinematography are amazing - but nothing is more impressive to me than the editing. Thelma Schoonmaker well deserved the Oscar for Best Film Editing on ""The Departed,"" which might not have been half as good if not for Schoomaker's past pacing and experimental style. As always in a Scorsese picture the performances are phenomenal: everyone from Leo DiCaprio to Martin Sheen is on their A-game in this one. Though by far my favorite performance is Jack Nicholson as Costello - he brings together humor, sleaze, and menace simultaneously and it makes for a truly terrifying villain.<br/><br/>The decision to set the film in Boston, where the movie's rich themes are deeply ingrained in the city's history, was brilliant. The casting of real-life Bostonians such as Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg, and the choice of Dorchester's William Monahan as screenwriter, gives ""The Departed"" an authenticity that many other Boston-set movies lack. After watching this movie again I'll say that I do have a slight problem with the running time - you do sometimes feel the movie's two and a half hour length, and there's a handful of scenes that could either be cut down or removed entirely. But it by no means ruins the viewing experience, in fact despite its length ""The Departed"" remains endlessly entertaining.<br/><br/>The fact that Scorsese took good material and made it even better is the reason why ""The Departed"" is perhaps the best remake ever made and certainly one of my favorite crime dramas. 10/10."

However Scorsese has been continuously snubbed for a Best Director and Best Picture Award which he has deserved many times over. Recently he has taken DeCaprio, an excellent artist, under his wing and finally the favor was returned. At last Scorsese has been rewarded for bringing out the best performances from his actors. This film does an outstanding job examining the mobster lifestyle, authority, politics and corruption. This film has masterful acting, directing, cinematography, editing and screenplay.

","THE DEPARTED is the first Best Picture winner that I've seen in years that I've actually at least LIKED! And I'll go a step further to say that I REALLY, REALLY LIKE it! It is an excellent story, played brilliantly by all involved, and told by one of the greatest directors in all of film history: Martin Scorcese. Scorcese FINALLY won Best Director and a film of his won Best Picture for this modern masterpiece. Of course it's not TAXI DRIVER or RAGING BULL, or even GOODFELLAS, but so what? It's better than 95% of the other stuff thrown at us the last few years! THE DEPARTED stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon as Bostonians Billy Costigan and Colin Sullivan, respectively, both from opposite sides of the track. Costigan's father's side of the family has criminal ties, but he was actually raised apart from that w/ his mother's more uppercrust upstanding side of the family. Sullivan was a poor boy raised in the streets. That's how both characters came to be what they were as grown men: Billy was brought up away from crime and Colin was exposed directly to it. As a boy Colin unwittingly became involved with local crime boss Frank Costello (played by the great Jack Nicholson in typical scene-stealing fashion). Costigan and Sullivan both joined the police academy, with Costigan volunteering to go under deep cover to help take down Costello's organization, while Sullivan worked as Costello's inside man/mole to notify him when the cops were closing in on him.<br/><br/>Costigan's only link to the cops is career cop Captain Queenan (Mr. Martin Sheen in terrific form) and his right hand man Lt. Dignam (Best Supporting Actor nominee Mark Wahlberg in a superb performance). Dignam and Queenan are the ONLY cops who know that Costigan is really one of the good guys as it was set up so that Billy would get thrown out of the police academy and thrown in jail for 18 months to help solidify his cover. Upon release from prison, Billy connects with his father's bad side of the family in order to ultimately get close to the PRIZE, Frank Costello himself.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the 'clean-cut' Sullivan ingratiates himself with the Boston PD's bigwigs, in particular, he is assigned to work with a task force led by Lt. Ellerby (played by the superb Alec Baldwin). Ellerby and Sullivan's job is to take Costello down. Very labyrinthine! The cop tasked to destroy Costello is really Costello's boy (Sullivan) and Costello's new boy in his organization is really a cop truly trying to take him down (Costigan)! The irony! Thankfully, this juicy main plot doesn't fail to deliver the goods. It is very tense, exciting, edge-of-your-seat stuff. You really hold your breath at times wondering what's going to happen. To complicate matters, obviously, neither Costigan nor Sullivan know each other, but both men know that the other EXISTS. Costigan knows that Costello has a police mole and Sullivan knows that the cops have a plant inside Costello's organization, so during the course of the film, they try to root each other out. To FURTHER complicate the proceedings, both men become involved with the SAME woman, a police psychiatrist Madolyn (played by the alluring Vera Farmiga). Sullivan meets her because they work in the same building and Costigan is one of her patients.<br/><br/>Wow! What a cast! What a film! And very well told. I was never a big fan of DiCaprio's until I saw him in this film. He really delivers the goods as Billy, a tortured soul who begins to blur the line between right and wrong. And Damon is truly solid as Colin, a tragic, doomed individual who sadly got influenced by the wrong person in his formative years. Nicholson of course delivers with his flash, flair, and aplomb. And the rest of the cast is solid beyond words. <br/><br/>Scorcese has fashioned a classic for the modern viewer, his best film since GOODFELLAS. This BEST PICTURE winner is a keeper!

"sidyaqub","5","3","5","29 August 2007"," Great opening, slow middle and a poor ending
","After watching 'Infernal Affairs' I thought to myself 'Why are the Americans making a remake of such a gem?' There was no need. (especially after many TERRIBLE US remakes of Eastern movies) Then I heard that Martin Scorsese was at the helm. I thought 'there is hope'. When it comes down to the crunch, it's the weakest crime drama from Marty (compared to GoodFellas, Casino and even his breakthrough Mean Streets), as well as being heavily inferior to the neatly-written, slick Hong Kong original.<br/><br/>When going to see this with a few of my buddies, I was expecting a great film from all the reviews it had received. It had started out great, the use of home footage of Boston riots and great dialogue from legend Jack Nicholson. I thought: maybe this is different from the Hong Kong movie, with excellent use of the song 'Gimme Shelter' by The Rolling Stones. Nicholson plays Frank Costello (the ONLY real life character) an Irish mob boss who takes a young Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) under his wing. Years on Sullivan has become a Sgt in the Boston Police and an inside man for Costello. At the same time William Costigan (Di Caprio) enrolled in the State Police, since he's the nephew of a well-known gangster Jackie Costigan (who's already dead at the beginning) Senior Sgt Dignam (Wahlberg) and Captain Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) allow him to be a cop only if he were to be an undercover and infiltrate Costello's racket as a mole.<br/><br/>Over the year, or 2, Sullivan has worked up the ranks of the police and remains the inside man for Costello. But Costigan has endured a violent streak and mind games from Costello who questions his loyalty over numerous occasions. After a botched deal with Chinese mobsters on both sides of the badge, the moles are aware of each other's presence and must find out who is the 'rat' before they are caught.<br/><br/>When it comes to acting and the cast, it was terrific. Damon, Nicholson, Wahlberg and Di Caprio work their magic really well under Scorsese's astute direction. There is good support from Alec Baldwin as a foul-mouthed Police Captain, yet Martin Sheen and Ray Winstone are badly underused and their characters do not show the best of their abilities. The film begins on a different, gritty note from the original, but halfway through becomes an over-violent, quickly chopped rehash of Lau and Mak's masterpiece (like the writers just thought of something quick), which makes the screenplay seemed hacked up. The original trilogy did a great job of telling the story in 3 parts, exploring philosophical aspects as well as providing a backdrop for characters with a prequel. The Departed crams the Infernal Affairs Trilogy into one nearly-3-hours movie and becomes quite flabby and just tries too hard to be a cool crime thriller than the original.<br/><br/>Scorsese may have won the Oscar, but it's only after being snubbed over many occasions (makes me wonder WHY he never won for 'Raging Bull'), the Academy owed him an Award for his previous work which is a distinct piece of cinema history, so they had no choice but to Award 'The Departed'.<br/><br/>It is a reasonably fare crime thriller but not a classic. Check out the original."
"richnindy","4","3","5","10 August 2007"," Very disappointing
","I hesitate to even add a comment at this late date, especially after so many people have echoed my own disappointment with this movie, but clearly Scorsese won the Oscar because of his fine work on ""Mean Streets,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" ""The Last Waltz,"" ""Goodfellas,"" etc. I know a lot of people consider ""Raging Bull"" his masterpiece, and although I do not care much for it, I would even understand an Oscar given to Scorsese for it.<br/><br/>But this bloated mess? I can't believe how LONG the damn thing is -- especially considering that the original is so much more powerful at only 100 minutes. And don't tell me the length was to provide greater character development -- the characters were much more expressive in the original and their relationships to each other were much better developed.<br/><br/>And as others have mentioned: the profanity is nonstop, and the ending is laughable. And for once I can really say I had WAY too much of Jack Nicholson."

This is way above some of his best works, including Goodfellas and I LOVE Goodfellas. I couldn't believe he could top it but he did with this movie.

","Now, I'm sure a lot of people are going to disagree with me here, because I know a lot of people are DIE HARD Martin Scorsese fans, and some of you guys will blame this review on me having Infernal Affairs as my #1 film in my Top 10, but here goes.<br/><br/>The Departed's first sign of greatness would be the original. It amazed people worldwide for putting a fresh face on an old genre, spanning endless amounts of Cop v Triad Hong Kong movies, which are still coming out today in endless amounts.<br/><br/>The Departed's second sign of greatness would be the cast. A huge amount of famous actors. And this is where I'll begin criticising it. Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Jack Nicholson, Ray Winstone, Alec Baldwin and so on. All these names are great, but the acting was mediocre, Mark Wahlberg seeming to get nominated for an Oscar by his characters dialogue alone. Even veteran actors like Ray Winstone provided little flair.<br/><br/>William Monahan, who wrote the screenplay went far too in-depth on the parts of the story that didn't matter. It took half an hour or so just to cover the opening five minutes of the original, focusing on Jack Nicholson and trying to stick as much swearing and wit into the script as possible.<br/><br/>The film did progress towards the end, after a dire first half it looked as if it could catch up with the original. The cinematography was decent in places, but typical Scorsese. The scenes that mattered, Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) falling off the top of the building was seriously marred, and a disappointment from the original, and the rooftop and elevator scene at the end, was dire. With Scorsese and Monahan ripping the original story to shreds.<br/><br/>Hideously overrated on IMDb with an 8.4 score and 77th in the top 250, The Departed is similar to The Ring. Both alright films on their own, but compared to the originals, they are terrible.<br/><br/>Sorry for the poorly written review."

"Boba_Fett1138","9","3","5","12 May 2007"," This is the Martin Scorsese I missed for such a long time.
","Let's face it, Martin Scorsese has made some good movies the past few years but nothing too brilliant or remarkable, at least not compared to his more early work from the '70's, '80's and early '90's. The last real brilliant Scorsese was in my opinion the remake ""Cape Fear"", which dates back from 1991. But ""The Departed"" is really again a movie that deserves to be on the long list of brilliant Martin Scorsese movies.<br/><br/>From the opening sequence on it's obvious; this is a typical Scorsese movie. For this movie he went back to the genre were he already was successful with in the past; the gangster-movies. It's a nice touch for a change that the movie is set in present time. After all, why should the best gangster-movies always take place in the past?<br/><br/>""The Departed"" is a greatly told and constructed modern crime movie about an infiltrator in the state police and an infiltrator in a crime syndicate who have to hunt each other down. It's a movie that provides the movie with some thrills, unexpected twists (especially toward the ending) and some great confrontations between different characters. The story on its self is already quite good (Just loose the love-story next times. It adds nothing to the characters or story.) and interesting but it's made all the more great by the way it is told. Not only kudos to Scorsese's directing for that but also most definitely for the editing by Thelma Schoonmaker, with lots of good quick flash-forwards and other tricks. All I can say is that she really deserved her Oscar for this movie. It really helps to tell the story and give the movie a look and identity of its own.<br/><br/>The movie its cast doesn't seem like the most likely won but it works out perfect in the movie. I think a lot of people were screaming for Robert De Niro but also Jack Nicholson is perfectly believable and just great as a gangster-boss. Mark Wahlberg was great as a bastard-cop and Alec Baldwin as a nice cop. The other way around would seem more logical but they work out surprisingly well in their roles. It was good to see Matt Damon in a more villainous and tougher role for a change, mostly because it shows how great as an actor he actually is. Leonardo DiCaprio also shows once more that he is more than just another pretty face.<br/><br/>It's not a movie that relies on its action but more on its characters and story. The movie is exciting, tense and spectacular regardless of that it hasn't a lot of action in it.<br/><br/>Of course this isn't Scorsese's best (which really says something about the extremely high qualities of this man), so is it fair that he finally won his Oscar for this movie? I mean after all, if this movie won, then should had movies such as ""Heat"", ""Training Day"" and so on. As a matter of fact it is of course true that if this movie was completely the same but had another director's name attached to it this movie would probably not had been nominated at all. It's just not the Oscar-type of movie but alas, I'm glad that Scorsese finally has an Oscar now, only just 3 decades too late. <br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"nycritic","10","3","5","6 March 2007"," Scorsese at the Top of His Game
","He's one of the few directors who have at least one movie within the top of the critics' lists during the Seventies, Eighties, Nineties, and now this decade. That's consistency in the quality of work, especially in an industry where directors come and go with one big hit, where they suddenly have slumps -- some lasting years and years --, and others make sporadic movies here and there. Martin Scorsese is also one of the few directors to tackle a theme that by now would have run its course: the Mafia movie because there can be only so much you can do with this type of film; however, Scorsese proves that there's still a lot of material that can be molded into compelling, edge-of-your-seat tales like the one he weaves here. Certainly not a ""B"" picture as he called it, yet it has all the elements of a B-picture: the seedy criminals, the sordid locations, the femme fatale, the overall feeling of despair and doom. It certainly is high noir, especially in the fact that all of the characters, to a degree, are under the shadow of this ultimate evil man, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and pretty much there is no escape, especially when Costello's deep ties that corrupt law enforcement come to light. The world of the men in THE DEPARTED is one where everyone is suspect and everyone is at danger of being ""next"". Even golden-boy Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), a pawn of Costello since he was a child, can't escape this fact. Moving upwards, propelled by his good looks and extreme good luck, he's the ultimate patsy who is set from the get-go even as he tries darned hard to elude all evidence that links him to Costello and invisible man William Costigan (a hardened-looking Leonardo DiCaprio).<br/><br/>Scorsese moves throughout his multiple plots with quite a bit of tentative yet explosive meandering. There is a lot going on through the initial portion of THE DEPARTED -- the first 15 minutes, approximately -- I became somewhat baffled he is setting up the intricate tableau which details those who are on the side of Good (represented by Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg) and those who are on the side of Evil (Nicholson). Minor characters pop up here and there and at first there is no real reason as to why they are even there, but that becomes rather clear later on in crucial moments. It's fantastic, wickedly suspenseful, compelling storytelling that draws you in from its opening scenes, and its style indicates that somewhere within the folds of narrative, Sullivan and Costigan, opposites in every sense of the word (Sullivan has led a life of privilege under the aegis of Costello and is now the poster boy of success, rising fast within the police department; Costigan comes from a broken family and is trying to make amends with himself even when he will never become an official law enforcement entity -- he is ""no man"") will have to meet. The crux between them lies in Vera Farmiga who plays the woman caught. She is Costigan's therapist, but is also Sullivan's girl, and her character is tricky, since it balances being the girl who suspects something is wrong with her boyfriend and the professional who feels anger, then pity, and finally desire for her patient.<br/><br/>Stylish, darkly funny (much of the humor coming from Nicholson's deadpan performance), extremely masculine (and what a cast of actors!) with an outstanding soundtrack (can anyone select songs like Scorsese for their movies?), THE DEPARTED is deservedly a winner, a masterpiece. It's exquisite to slowly chew on and then wash down with the most expensive wine."
"rkcrawf-2","10","3","5","14 November 2006"," best mob movie since scarface
","and I love mob movies. I loved this movie. When I think of mob movies, I think of the Godfather(s), Scarface, and Goodfellas, in that order. It's not the Godfather, but it is definitely a classic. The story is better than Goodfellas (yes, I know that was based on a real story, but this one seems more realistic). The violence and dialog are so much more satisfying than Scarface. You feel like the violence makes sense, and isn't there just to decorate the movie. And the characters are nearly as compelling as the Godfather. The acting (and writing) is so good, that I will be disappointed if there are not multiple Oscar wins for the cast and story. I could easily see ones for Nicholson and DiCaprio (and I normally don't like Leo).<br/><br/>I'm not sure what the running time was, but if anything I felt the film was too short. It was paced well, and tidied things up nicely, but I felt like I wanted to spend yet more time with the characters to understand them. Imagine if you only got one movie to know who Vito Corleone was...<br/><br/>And of course, the directing was A++. Scorcese is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. W/o giving things away, some of the duality, and contrasts are brilliant. One guy has one phone which he switches the sim cards. Another has two phones, which he carries around openly.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see this movie again!"
"Galina_movie_fan","9","3","5","6 November 2006"," ""One of us had to die. With me, it tends to be the other guy. ""
","In ""The Departed"" (2006) directed by Martin Scorcese, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is young police officer who has been sent undercover to work for a vicious and powerful Boston mafia boss, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) was handpicked by Costello as a young boy and placed to the Police Academy with the intention to infiltrate later the Boston Police Department. One day, two young men will inevitably meet...<br/><br/>""The Departed"" is a very good film but sadly, it slows down in the final 20 or so minutes and leaves a viewer (yours truly) with several questions and slightly disappointed. Seems that Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello kept all parts of the movie together and after his departure, it became literally empty. As for directing, Martin Scorsese is in the top his form the movie is well paced, suspenseful, and has a great soundtrack (as usual in Scorsese movies). The cast is the closest to perfect it could be. As much as I like Jack Nicholson, it was nothing he has not done before (his Frank Costello is a combination of Daryl Van Horne and Col. Nathan R. Jessep) but Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan played the best role of his career. About a year ago, I wrote about his acting in Scorcese's previous movie, ""The Aviator"", ""Leonardo DiCaprio earns my respect and admiration for his acting - he is one of the most talented young actors now and I will be waiting for his following films impatiently. I trusted him in every scene and he made me feel strongly for and sympathize with Howard Hughes's affliction."" I am very glad to admit that in ""The Departed"" he is even better - the hell Billy Costigan has lived in working undercover for the devilishly evil Frank Costello was absolutely real, suffocating and palpable. DiCaprio had many scenes with Nicholson and he never got lost next to his celebrated partner.<br/><br/>Not as perfect as ""Goodfellas"" which comes to mind while watching ""The Departed"", the newest Scorcese's work is a lot of fun to watch - it is an inspiring film-making, and I believe that finally Scorsese will be recognized by the Academy for his directing."

","Did anyone else notice that there was no plot after 45 minutes in to the movie? The whole laptop scam was the only idea that geared any sort of central plot. The rest of the movie was dedicated to finding the rat which the audience already knew. So, what, the idea of a nice ending was everybody dying? Really original. It may not have been a 2 but I was so angry about the inflated rating that I wanted to make it realistic. The acting was decent but not as good as the actors should have been. Interestingly, Wahlberg has the only dynamic character which is very odd. Damon and Dicaprio have mirror character and both are strong just not very original."

","I haven't read all of the reviews of this movie, but the ones I have read seem to generally fall into one of two categories: (a) I loved it or (b) I have seen Infernal Affairs and this doesn't compare.<br/><br/>Well I have not seen IA (although after all of the positive comments I have read in this thread, I hope to soon be rectifying that) but I was still extremely disappointed by this movie. It contains huge holes in the plot and the ending is nothing short of ludicrous. What's more it is over long and really did nothing but bore me for most of the 2 1/2 hours.<br/><br/>......... Spoilers Here .......<br/><br/>How could Sullivan not be considered as the main suspect of being Costello's mole in the troopers given that he is Irish and from the same nieghbourhood in Boston as Costello.<br/><br/>How could Costello so readily accept Costigan as a right-hand man given his history? Why didn't the Costello man killed in the raid where Martin Sheen's character got killed not explain to anyone else that he had given Costigan the wrong address??? Did the makers really think that exposing Sullivan's buddy from cadet school as the other mole was worth doing. Not only was the 'twist' contrived, but the fact that he gets killed almost immediately makes it completely pointless.<br/><br/>If Dignam was so willing to kill Sullivan without actual proof, why didn't he act earlier, e.g. on Costello??? And so on ...<br/><br/>And on a final note: why oh why did they get the fine English character actor Ray Winstone to try and adapt that oh so poor American accent? I could have (begrudgingly) forgiven a phony Irish one (it wouldn't have been the first) but surely it sounded pathetic to a US audience???

"dfranzen70","5","3","5","28 October 2006"," Very disappointing; poor writing, hamminess sink it
","Matt Damon is a sergeant in the Massachusetts State Police who's secretly working for Jack Nicholson's gang. Leonardo DiCaprio is a former bad boy deep undercover in Nicholson's gang. But whose side is each really on? And will this end in anything but total, major bloodshed? The answer to the first question is, ""Who cares""; to the second, ""duh."" Like many people, I went into this movie with high expectations, but unlike most (judging from the early returns), I was pretty disappointed with the result. Let's take a look at some of the good and bad points.<br/><br/>1. Martin Scorcese directed it, so I was expecting not only a lot of gunplay and a lot of profanity, but a lucid screenplay. I mean, this is the guy who did Goodfellas, for crying out loud, which this movie should have closely resembled. In case you forgot, he also did Raging Bull and Mean Streets. Now, granted, Scorcese didn't write the script, but cmon. He's got the clout to make changes to it on the set.<br/><br/>2. Jack Nicholson is just all right. I like Jack. (Who doesn't? Seriously.) But nowadays, he plays the same basic character no matter the role, no matter if he's a Good Guy or a Bad Guy. He's Jack. Apparently, Robert DeNiro was approached to play the role of Frank Costello, but he was busy working on his own film, The Good Shepherd. So enter Smilin' Jack, and I dunno; I think DeNiro would have been much, much better.<br/><br/>3.Profanity. No, I like profanity. Love it! Even gratuitously, it's usually perfectly okay. See, for example, the aforementioned Goodfellas. But it seemed here that profanity was used merely to see how many times the f word and c word could be said in a movie. After a while (say an hour), it quickly got tiresome, sounding more like a high school locker room than anything else.<br/><br/>4. Comic relief. Who said there needed to be comic relief? Someone must have thought so, because we had not one but two comic roles: Alec Baldwin's Ellerby and Mark Wahlberg's Dignan. Okay, they weren't there solely for comic relief, but they were given funny lines that seemed wholly incongruous with the rest of the picture. Instead of being a subtle change in direction (you're expecting drama and they shift to comedy), the result is jarring. When the timing is right, it works, but more often than not I wondered what the actors were doing in the same movie as Nicholson, DiCaprio, and Damon.<br/><br/>5. Damon and DiCaprio. I've never been a huge fan of either one, although I've like Damon's Bourne movies to a degree. I think my primary complaint is that they both perpetually look about sixteen years old, not the kind of persona you want in a purportedly gritty crime drama. They both have more gravitas now than they did, say, ten years ago, but still nowhere near enough to carry the heavy workload, characterwise, that this particular type of movie demands.<br/><br/>6. Accents. The setting is Boston, and most of the leads are playing Irish Americans. Damon, who's from Massachusetts, and DiCaprio sounded fine, but Nicholson's Boston accent came and went - it was usually absent, come to think of it.<br/><br/>Like I said, the screenplay didn't feel particularly tight; it's as if the writers (William Monahan and Siu Fai Mak) just borrowed from all of the cop films of the past without providing any nuance to hold interest. For example, there was a subplot involving the girlfriend/fiancée/wife of Damon's character. Why? I'm not saying we shouldn't know anything about her, but she didn't seem to be much of an influence on Damon's character anyway, so why bother with her? Oh, I see, so that we could include a second romantic angle with her and someone else. But why would we want that? Bring on the guns, bring on the cussin, and ditch the romance - it neither enhances the plot or titillates the audience. (Kristin Dalton, who played the love interest in question, didn't turn in much of a performance, but I don't think she exactly had a layer-rich character with which she could work.) Then there's the obligatory sex scene, which should have felt erotic but came off as awkward, as did the two (yes, two) first-date scenes. Bah.<br/><br/>Here's a positive remark, though. Kudos to an on-target performance by Martin Sheen, as DiCaprio's boss. Might be his best work in movies in years, kind of an expanded version of his role in Catch Me If You Can, also starring DiCaprio.<br/><br/>Another plus, perhaps, is the high body count. Lots of death in this one, and it's not just unknown extras who get whacked. And the deaths are particularly gruesome at times - bullets through the skull, plenty of 'em, leave huge splatters of blood on the back walls of elevators. That sort of thing. A loudmouth audience member to the left of me wailed that it was ""just like a Shakespeare play!"" True enough, because so many of the main characters of those tragedies were slain, usually quite unceremoniously.<br/><br/>So maybe I'm just a grump. Maybe I've reached the point where no movie can satisfy me, particularly when I pay nearly ten bucks to watch it in a theater full of incredibly stupid and/or rude people. Maybe I'm too jaded to appreciate true genius. But I don't think so; I think a year or so from now, we won't even remember The Departed as anything more than a slight footnote to Scorcese's great career."
"gareth_john_nolan","4","3","5","28 October 2006"," A Scorsese Return To Form?!
","The praise this film has received is undeniable, but it is for quite obvious reasons. How hard is it to make a poorly received film with a pseudo Ocean's 11 style cast? A veritable who's who of Hollywood in future establishment star's like Mark Walhberg, Leonardo Di Caprio, Matt Damon with the establishment proper in Jack Nicholson and Martin Sheen as the Daddy's of good and evil. Throw in the excellent plot of somebody else's film (Internal Affairs), and a director who has an untouchable reputation. In Hollywood terms, its a no-brainer, a sure fire success story, unimpeachable in form and content. For a director of Scorsese's reputation though, this film is an indictment.<br/><br/>I have to hope there are others like myself who can see through this rouse. This film is vacuous, bloated and overblown. It's a rehash of somebody's else's film and even a rehash of Scorsese's own films. It's the best Internal Affairs since Internal Affairs, and his best Scorsese crime drama since every other Scorsese crime drama. This man has built a reputation on a handful of genuinely subversive, ground breaking, and thought provoking films - but when will it be recognised he has simply run out of ideas, as nothing could be more certain when looking at this film.<br/><br/>Scorsese has lost his way, and he knows it (as evidenced by his move to make his own indie flick). People are reluctant to knock him down and hold him to account because they are in love with the sensation that his reputation invokes. He is probably the last man who brings credibility to mainstream Hollywood  but he is ultimately subverted by it. It would seem to me that a vote against him is a vote against a last strand of credibility in this type of feature making  If Scorsese can't help us then who can? It has to be clear that the best work that he has done in the last 10 years have been his own documentary output. His history of the blues, cinema and his Bob Dylan work, are exemplary. But his feature fictions are bloated, messy affairs.<br/><br/>For The Departed, it's shown in a few clear ways, one being musical choice. How many times in one career can he use the iconic but ultimately invasive Gimme Shelter by the Rolling Stones? Moreover, how many times in one film? In one scene alone in The Departed, he plays the song twice, restarting it to use the intrigue of Keith Richards tone setting guitar play. It's as jarring as it is juvenile. The song itself features over three times in the film. Yet, this is only one example of his corrupted sense of film-making style. I can appreciate his attempt to incorporate new ideas into his films, but his attempt to use Wes Anderson's pace setting Spanish Guitar plucking falls on its face, setting a comedic tone in places where there shouldn't be one. Another reference to Anderson is used in his full screen photo flashback device, which is quickly followed in the same scene, by his own more traditional in-scene photo pick up. The result is messy. Scorsese's sense of style is subverted by his inability to go any one way. Sloppiness also features in that Scorsese staple of the continuity error. I can appreciate this lack of attention to detail were it some art house reflection on the nature of reality, but this is mainstream Hollywood and says more about his editorial and film-making laziness than any overarching thematic concern. See Leo without cigarette in hand in one instant, and blowing smoke circles the next. You need only go to the goof's pages on this site for more. For inability to follow his convictions, see a jarring POV shot of Matt Damon in a waiting room looking down at his shoes, held for 1 second. It is a brave attempt to capture a moment between moments in a character's life, but an idea that cannot be pursued in half measures. As for overblown performance and a suggestion of a director losing control, look only as far as Jack Nicholson's fly eating.<br/><br/>An integral part of a director's reputation must always be what he brings to the table as a filmmaker. The reason this film has succeeded has nothing to do with his ability in that regard, in so far as it carried by somebody else's plot and the Hollywood powerhouse casting and acting. When looking at this film it must be asked what did Scorsese actually bring to this project? Is this a man resting on his laurels or an active master of his craft pushing the boundaries of his expression and creativity? His use of violence at this stage of his career is merely exploitative, rather than questioning. His supposed exploration of modern masculinity has never been more stale. For a man of Scorsese's undeniable ability and vision, this is nothing short of a shameful piece of work. Clearly, he is as jaded as the mainstream American cinema which nurtures him. I look forward to his next project because at the very least that can be judged as a real Scorsese picture, a greater measure of the man; and those who praised him for this will hopefully realise their folly as I am quite sure that even he himself would balk at the suggestion that this film was exemplary of his ability."

But there are so many twists and turns that are there in this flick that 2 1/2 hrs just passed by without my knowledge.<br/><br/>Initially i took some time to get into the movie. But once you are there, you will get so involved with the characters that you actually feel whats going on with them. Screeplay was very tight and gripping. To actually make a movie about two guys who don't meet until the end, is quite an achievement. And the last half an hour was amazing. I saw quite a few reviews which said that the climax as not up to the mark. I totally disagree with them. The scene when DiCaprio is shot, the whole theater was shocked and I could hear the sounds like ""Oh!! My God""...Man it was amazing .... I was like ""What the heck was that"" ....<br/><br/>One final word ""Marty! You rock, You simple do!!"" <br/><br/>Planning to catch it one more time this weekend ....."
"salvaggio_john","10","3","5","7 October 2006"," Johnny Sal Approved! Amazing Film
","The Departed is an Amazing Film. I found the film contained good dialog, shot composition, and lighting as well as fantastic editing by Thelma Schoonmaker. Not as long as Gangs of New York (2002) but it still contains the action and clever plot twists and general excitement found in most Scorsese pictures. <br/><br/>The Departed is authentic, captivating and heart felt. I predict Globe and Oscar nominations for Mark, Matt, and Lenonardo. Martin Scorsese's brilliant mind as a director shows up in this work of art and he better get the Best Director Oscar. He has worked for too long and too hard his entire career and has yet to receive one. Possibly best supporting actor for Alec Baldwin, or Martin Sheen. I rate this film 10 out of 10, a superb masterpiece of ""Crime Art"" as i call it. Better than Casino (1995). <br/><br/>The film kept the entire audience intrigued and amazed at the hard depiction of corrupt Boston police, and an eye opener to modern Irish gangs. A grand remake of a Hong Kong film called ""Wu Jian Dao"". The Departed is fantastic."

When the Boston Police send a warrent to arrest the mob leader Matt Damon acts as a rat and make it impossible to find the mob leader, so the police decide to send out a under cover cop (Leo Dicaprio)to be a rat for them.

","Surprisingly ( or maybe not so surprisingly), considering the caliber of the cast, this turned out to be a really ""trashy"" flick! Although the plot was interesting and the story line seemed to be well written, and, although it was a ""star studded"" cast, the real ""killer"" of this movie (unless you're into really vulgar language) was that the ""F"" word (along with several other vulgarities) must have been used about 500 times by ""everyone"", male and female alike, all throughout the movie! It made for a very uncomfortable evening, and ended up a big disappointment to say the least! It's baffling why Hollywood thinks it's necessary to include the basest, most vulgar language in their feeble attempts to entertain us when a movie without it would be much more entertaining and acceptable. I'll never go see another Scorcase(?) film."
"Minerva_Meybridge","1","8","20","18 February 2007"," Scorsese Doesn't Score in This One
","It amazes me how the fact that a director has made his mark will cause him to garner praise from the movie-going masses. It's like all of those who stare at a white canvas with a black dot in the center an proclaim it to be masterful art. Martin Scorsese used to be masterful at generating emotions through violence. Lately, all he seems capable of is generating yawns.<br/><br/>I watched the Gangs of New York for a second time a couple of months ago. I felt like I was watching a National Geographic special. There was nothing particularly special about it and Daniel Day- Lewis's voice/accent in it reminded me of Popeye. Scorsese seems to love irritating accents. The Departed is replete with a Massachusetts grate (among the most annoyingto meaccents the English language possesses.) The movie is overlong and takes forever to get anywhere. I loved Leonard DiCapprio in Titanic, but after trying to watch this blubbering whale of an attempt at good cinema, I kept thinking it would have been so much better if his career had stayed submerged.<br/><br/>Dicapprio, Walhberg and Damon are all identical pieces of cardboard when it comes to acting and they are all the same type. It's like putting Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield and Anna Nicole Smith all the the same picture. There's just no telling them apart. The dialogue is flat. The story moves at soap opera pace. The cinematography is the opposite of John Woo. If I hadn't been watching this at home on my wasted DVD purchase, I would have walked out on it and I was almost tempted to, regardless. I remember I actually did walk out on What Lies Beneath years ago. But here there is no beneath. There are no layers. Hey, give me $90 million and I can make a film, too.<br/><br/>So, watch out Michael Cimino, you have a contender for the Golden Raspberry Award, because this film is a bowlful.<br/><br/>An additional note: Yesterday I tuned in the last half hour of the Academy Awards and have mixed feelings about the fact that the Academy is apparently allowing those who are both blind and deaf to vote the best picture and best director. Apparently, all the sympathy votes for Scorsese finally came in. Argh Gratia Artis!"

","Don't ever go see The Departed. We went yesterday because there were good reviews and good actors. BIG MISTAKE. It had raunchy, nasty language all the way through it that was unnecessary. Then the violence was so graphic. It showed lots of people being shot in the head up close.<br/><br/>I don't like watching violence. I don't understand why people like to watch other people get killed or hurt. Would they want to see it happen in front of them in real life and stand there and say ""cool"" or would they run and hide and be scared? It gives sick people ideas.<br/><br/>I almost had a panic attack in the theater. I was shaking and wanted to run out. Then when we got in the car, I started crying real hard. It really upset me. The world has cried over all the school shootings, but then Hollywood makes a movie that shows that kind of violence up close. Would it make a good movie if those Amish girls were video-taped being shot in the head and it was re-played for everyone to see? Would everyone cry or would they think it was great and want to watch more real people get shot?"

I am very sorry to say that if you are to copy another film there isn't much to be demanded from the actors. I personally have never been a fan of re-makes if the director is not to add a new dimension to the original as it is the case of Departed. The only thing Martin seemed to add is a lot of senseless swearing and mind blowing graphical head-shots. This completely took the audience away from the core of the story, the essence of the plot. The ending is the most dire I have seen yet, it was simply distasteful. I would strongly recommend you to watch Infernal Affair 1&2, before set you eye on this Hollywood trash.<br/><br/>Entertaining in terms of comedy values. watch this but do not expect a thrilling ride."

"blackwalnut","1","4","8","31 July 2008"," Another Serving of Scorcese's Overbaked Ham
","If less is more, then more is less. That is a lesson that, in all his years as a film maker, Martin Scorcese never seems to have learned.<br/><br/>Never satisfied with mere excess, Scorcese continues to take original, intricate and downright terrific ideas, and bludgeon them into twisted ruins of predictable, derivative, deep-fried sleaze. Scorcese never saw a story so simple he couldn't pack a ton of gratuitous mayhem into it, or a concept so straightforward he couldn't belabor with a ton of profane verbiage, or a character so layered he couldn't redraw it as a cardboard cutout, or a plot so complex he couldn't dumb it down to the level of a five-year-old. As has become habitual with Scorcese, none of his characters can get shot just once, or break his neck instead of splattering on concrete, or get cut with a knife instead of an ax, or survive the movie at all if Scorcese thinks he can get a cheap gasp out of killing him off. Perfect fare for an audience so saturated with decades of Stallone, Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis garbage that no one bothers to ask for logic any more, and starts to fall asleep if denied a hemorrhage for ten minutes at a stretch.<br/><br/>The plot developments and time lines in The Departed are so far-fetched as to reek with implausibility. I won't repeat these; others have enumerated them. But Leonard DiCaprio -- a terrific actor, by the way -- is so ludicrously miscast that his own cat would know it. Here he is, flying into a cold rage with his baby face and beating up on gangsters with his skinny arms... If this milk-fed child were put within a hundred yards of the sort of people he so blithely cons and pistol whips in this outing, he would drop dead of fright. His nemesis, Matt Damon, is every bit as cardboard an imitation of evil as Leo is of good. And Jack Nicholson is... Jack Nicholson. Which ain't bad, or at least it wasn't bad the first fifty or so times we saw it, and we've seen him do it better.<br/><br/>Scorcese's female ""characters"" -- one supporting role to a film -- are usually given little more to do than bob their heads up and down in some guy's lap. He departs slightly from his usual crass misogyny in this film. At least this woman has a job she can perform standing up. But one must wonder how effective she can be in her chosen field -- that of psychiatrist -- being so indecisive and obtuse. A head shrinker who doesn't know her own mind, indeed. Scorcese might tell you that the choice is intentional, and ironic, and therefore somehow meaningful. Nonsense. He can't help it. He must undercut and dilute any strength his women might have. His treatment of them is consistently dismissive, stereotyped and mean-spirited. His whole body of work, in fact, is so testosterone-drenched and chauvinistic, he seems to be begging us to believe he's a heterosexual, when no one would think to doubt it if he didn't protest so much.<br/><br/>The only good thing about this hash is the soundtrack. But there's nothing original about it. Scorcese just hired someone to go down to a music warehouse and shuffle out what fit the picture. Not much way you can go wrong, shoving ""Gimme Shelter"" into just about anything. So go buy the originals. Not the soundtrack; it will only add to the profits for this overblown mess.<br/><br/>There is a great story buried in all the junk weighing down The Departed -- realistic, ironic, bitter and layered -- or there was a great story, until Scorcese's ham-handed execution turned it into this childish blood feast. As in ""Casino,"" ""Gangs of New York"" and that preposterous trash about ambulance drivers, there is an underlying reality that could have been brought to life and memorably rendered.<br/><br/>The great pity is that Scorcese has real talent. He has shown it on many occasions, and throughout ""Raging Bull."" It comes through even as he's trampling on his own better instincts. There's a great director in him, but he doesn't trust himself, or the adolescents he is apparently making movies for, to remember that subtlety, simplicity and grace are cinematic virtues, even if employed occasionally. No, he has to ramp up the volume and the sarcasm and the adolescent rage and the bloodletting until the whole business is just annoying to anyone but a pre-teen. He loads every scene down with inhuman dialog, over-the-top action and ludicrously improbable plot developments -- and then presents it as raw realism. If he was dealing in science-fiction, that would be something else. But he isn't. Boiled down to their basic elements, most all of his films are simple, straightforward stories. Seldom does any of the excreta he piles onto them elevate them to the level of originality, and never to art. It only lowers them to run-of-the-mill cinematic pabulum.<br/><br/>Scorcese is bound to share billing in future textbooks on film making with Oliver Stone, another artistic quack who routinely kills his healthy patients by over-prescribing medicines they never needed in the first place, and then chopping them up on the operating table with a chainsaw to compensate. But all this makes heaps o' profits, and ensure that Scorcese will never lack for an audience or his next directing job. Lamentably, all he is really doing is contributing, in his own way, to the lowering of the national IQ. And there are far, far too many vultures — in the media, in politics and in entertainment -- already working that angle."

As the story is pretty much the same, the characters almost identical and even the takes are sometimes shot from the same angle, I am forced to compare both movies, which might not be quite fair. It is not fair because I was not looking just for a good story, but for a better one. Of course this is much more difficult to accomplish since the original was pretty good.<br/><br/>It would be overstated to say that I was disappointed. Not really, that would be to harsh. I definitely even enjoyed watching the movie. But...and it's a big, big ""but"". But, I wouldn't miss something if I haven't watched the movie.<br/><br/>Still, there are some positive things. Marc Wahlberg performed pretty well. In my opinion he outshone Di Caprio and Matt Damon. Jack Nicholson did his best to play a role which was at times implausible.<br/><br/>There were a few changes compared to the original. One of them, namely that the good and the bad guy were sleeping with the same woman was unnecessary and over the top. It was like a void twist that didn't add anything to the movie.<br/><br/>I even think that Scorsese got the Oscar because of his previous works. This one can't match his best."

If Martin Scorsese is a great director, it is certainly not thanks to ""The Departed"", for the simple reason that he didn't have to be creative at all. He just had to find some American actors and translate the original script with his words.

"Chrysanthepop","Null","4","8","4 November 2007"," Generally an okay watch but knowing that Scorsese was behind it makes it a disappointment for me
","I don't see what all the fuss is about. 'The Departed' comes nowhere near the brilliance of 'Mou gaan dou' (aka 'Infernal Affairs'). Not that it's a bad film. It's quite an entertainer but it's far from great and miles from Scorsese's excellent works such as 'Raging Bull', 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' (only to name a few). In my opinion, it's one of Scorsese's weakest films. 'The Departed' is a thriller and yes, it does have its twists and turns but it lacked depth and there are several unanswered questions. It could have worked well as a character study but many of the characters appeared to lack development. Also the pace of the film is a little slow at the beginning and it could have easily done without a few sequences.<br/><br/>Here are some examples of what I disapproved.<br/><br/>I find it hard to believe that Costigan 'masters' being a gangster in four months and Costello easily believes him and almost immediately takes him into the gang. Who is Costello? Once he's portrayed as a kingpin and then we seem him hanging out with small-time gangsters. It's also strange that no one in the force suspected Sullivan AND his superiors so easily trusted him (when everyone should be a suspect).<br/><br/>I found the excessive swearing to be irritating. This isn't a surprise since it's a Scorsese film but somehow here it seemed forced. Sure people do swear but they could have toned it down a little. I mean if this was an attempt to make the film look more realistic then they should have improved a whole lot of other things too.<br/><br/>The love triangle between the psychiatrist Madolyn and the two moles was very weakly portrayed. There was no development at all. What are Madolyn's motives for staying with Sullivan? She only leaves him in the end after discovering his identity. What was her relationship with Costigan? Why did Costigan send the CD to Sullivan and not to the authorities? It's understandable that he wanted to make the arrest himself but he could have sent a copy to the authorities without taking the risk. The climax, though a surprise, seemed a little rushed.<br/><br/>The film is mainly about Sullivan versus Costigan but I think Scorsese could have made these two characters stronger by focussing a little more on their psyche.<br/><br/>As for the performances, most of the actors do reasonably well with their parts. I liked Damon as Sullivan. It may arguably be a one-dimensional role but he played it well. It was great to see him yet again in another different role. Dicaprio too does well as Costigan but he tends to come across as a little too whiny at times. Nicholson is a pain to watch as he hams it up. The actor isn't that different from his other films and he fails miserably because this is a character that required him to act with a different style than he does with his usual persona. He fails to engage. Though Martin Sheen isn't bad, an actor of his caliber deserves far better. Wahlberg is back in swearing mode...again. Vera Farmiga shines. Alec Baldwin is irritating.<br/><br/>Now what's good? Well, for those who haven't seen the original version, it has its twists and turns and the viewerwants to know what happens next and what the fate of Sullivan and Costigan are. The background score isn't bad either. 'The Departed' more an average thriller but still comes as a disappointment because one doesn't expect anything short of great from Scorsese."
"ElmStreetsLastBrat","10","4","8","9 April 2007"," Excellent Film!
","2006's The Departed is an excellent film. I'm not normally a fan of gangster films and really had no intention of seeing this film. But my mom was dying to see it and so I watched it with her. And I'm a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio and seeing that Jack Nicholson was playing a mob boss I knew that it had to be a good film. And I was pleasantly surprised. It was worth the rental price at Blockbuster. Jack Nicholson plays mob boss Frank Costello, who's mole, Colin Sullivan, played by Matt Damon, is a cop who has just been promoted to a detective. But the police academy has no idea that he's Costello's mole. Leonardo DiCaprio is Billy Costigan, a recent graduate of the academy who has been hired to infiltrate the mob and bring Costello down. Mark Wahlberg is Dignam, a tough-talking cop who is working on the Costello case. His partner is Queenan, played by Martin Sheen. The plot gets a little complicated when all these characters cross paths in their attempts to catch Costello but it also is an exhilarating thrill to see who will find out who's the mole and who's the fake. This film kept me on the edge of my seat. There was so much tension that it was almost unbearable. The violence was a little graphic and anyone who doesn't like blood or doesn't like to see a lot of blood will feel a little uneasy watching this film. And anyone who doesn't like a lot of swearing and curse words will also feel uneasy. But The Departed wasn't just about blood and profanity. It gave you a look inside the mob and how ruthless and vile they can be. It showed you what can happen when secrets are revealed and when other people's trusts are broken. The most exciting scene for me was when Matt Damon found out that Leonardo DiCaprio was the one who was bringing down the mob and when Leo found out that Matt was the mole. Leo called Queenan's cell phone and Matt answered! That was such a tense moment and my whole family who was watching with me gasped. When I had rented this film the guy at Blockbuster told me that the ending was unbelievable. And boy was he right! <br/><br/>**SPOILERS!!!** Matt Damon comes home and when he opens his door he stops and is in shock. Mark Wahlberg, the cop, is standing there and he raises his gun and shoots Matt Damon dead. Then the film is over. And in a couple of scenes before that Leo had slept with Matt's girlfriend. And Leo gave her an envelope that said ""if something happens to me, open it"". And then Leo is killed by one of Costello's men. We see her open the envelope but never know what it said. So after the film ended my family and I are all wondering what was said in the envelope and then it came to us. Of course Leo knew that Matt was Costello's mole. So in the envelope he told her about Matt's real identity and that she should let Mark Wahlberg know and do something about it. So that's why Mark Wahlberg killed Matt so he would no longer be a part of the mob and be a threat to anyone. And we thought that was clever. An interesting little plot twist! :) I thought all the actors were top notch. Jack Nicholson never disappoints. He was his usual badass self and you knew something bad was gonna happen whenever he was on screen. Matt Damon was basically his usual self that he is in all his films. But he was good. Martin Sheen was great and I was very shocked to see him die. Mark Wahlberg was his usual badass cursing self too, and even though he did get an Oscar nomination, I didn't see what was so special about his performance that earned him that recognition. The real recognition should've gone to Leonardo DiCaprio!! To me his performance was the best in this film. He was basically the only likable character and he was good and you felt bad for him when you saw all these horrible things that were happening to him. And I was really disappointed when he met his demise. That was totally uncalled for!! I didn't see why he had to die. There were no weak performances in this film and I think that's what made it so great. And Martin Scorsese's direction was top notch too. He deserved that Oscar. And I'm glad this film won Best Picture too. It is an excellent film and I'm glad I saw it. It's definitely one I'd like to own. This is film making at its best!

","No film buffs or Scorsese fans are going to take my word for it, but here goes a warning I need to get off my chest: THE DEPARTED is a wretched way to slowly waste 2.5 hours of your life.<br/><br/>We get Marty's little auteur flourishes, all of which we've seen repeatedly since GOODFELLAS, sprinkled heavily over the blandest spaghetti bowl of a plot.<br/><br/>The actors don't lack for talent, but here they seem to have been directed to give flashy soliloquies and never actually interact with each other. The film is like a whole series of audition readings, where each actor is reading his part alone on a stage. There can't be much chemistry if each chemical is kept in its own test tube! <br/><br/>Jack reprises his Joker role, except here he was encouraged to ham it up a little more. That said, he's the only aspect of this train wreck that kept me from giving the film one star instead of three. (Sorry, Mr. Nicholson; it wasn't your fault.) Sure, sneer at me because Marty won the BD Oscar. I can only conclude that 2006 was a year weak enough to console him for being robbed when he made GOODFELLAS, a great film that he has been remaking over and over. But this version stinks, and its success at the Academy Awards just means we will get loads of copycats who think this is what they should be chasing.<br/><br/>OK, now go ahead and waste your time watching it."

","this otherwise very mediocre movie.<br/><br/>Look, I don't care if it is a remake or not -- not an issue. Both Thomas Crown movies were good, for example. But I am frankly sickened that this movie won best picture, and that Scorsese won his (body-of-work) Oscar for this piece of literal dung. It reminds me of Sean Penn winning for Mystic River when he should have won for I Am Sam.<br/><br/>Wahlberg was off the scale unrealistic. Not at all impressive acting. I may have to move him to the always-avoid category I've affectionately dubbed the Revolta zone.<br/><br/>Nicholson was great, as always. He can truly make any movie work and become successful. So where was his supporting nomination? Damon was OK, given his character's ridiculous behavior (I blame the director and script). Ditto for DiCaprio, who put amazing effort into this lost cause.<br/><br/>This movie has hundreds and hundreds of swear words. Some are EXTREMELY ugly. Virtually all are gratuitous and do NOT help this movie. The lowest of these words make this movie unfit for repeated viewing -- and that is a crime. I blame the super ordinary scriptwriter who shall remain nameless and hopefully career-less.<br/><br/>This movie is overly graphic in places. Add to that a sound track that is one of the worst I have ever heard -- boring, mostly, except when a gun is fired or a body hits the ground.<br/><br/>By the way, the best scene involved the ringing phones (and nary an expletive).<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is disgraceful, Mr. Scorsese. You have made some good movies, (and some excellent commentaries), but this one is unfit for human consumption.<br/><br/>2* out of 4* for those not put off by sickening amounts of swearing and gratuitous violence."

It is neither.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the film is good. But it's not without it's flaws. The film's strong suit is the characters and the dialog. You feel for the characters, and the banter between them is wonderful.The film does an excellent job of blurring the lines of cop and crook, but herein lies a problem. The lines are blurred so much that the film is unbelievably hard to follow, and the plot certainly has holes. There is a lot to catch, even in two hours and thirty-one minutes.<br/><br/>And of course the shocking ending. The last 5 minutes of the movie confused the hell out of me, and I can't help but think that if they gave the movie more time and tweaked the plot and the ending, it could have been what people were hyping it to be. It's got great action, great dialog, great characters, and great acting. What it is lacking is continuity.<br/><br/>Overall, it's good enough for an 8/10, but it is certainly not the best film of the year, IMO."
"baumer","10","4","8","19 February 2007"," Oh what a tangled web we weave.
","Martin Scorcese might be the only man in Hollywood who really doesn't have a misfire. I really can't think of any films he has done that weren't creative, ambitious, well acted and intriguing. With the exception of maybe Spielberg, there is no one his equal. This is just my opinion of course, but when you can say that you have done Raging Bull, Goodfellas, The Aviator and now the Departed, who can really disagree? If it wasn't for the sheer perfection of Goodfellas, I think this would be his best film. The performances, the script and of course the direction are perfection personified. I think this is the best film of the year and this should finally be Scrocese's year to take best director.<br/><br/>The Departed has Matt Damon playing Colin Sullivan, a young Irish boy who grows up in a Boston neighbourhood that is ""run"" by the local Irish mob. One day while eating at the local diner, he meets Frank Costello, played by Jack Nicholson, and like a young Henry Hill in Goodfellas, he begins to do some work for the man. We then skip ahead perhaps 20 years later and now young Colin Sullivan is one of Frank's boys. He enters into police college where his intentions are to get into the police force to keep an eye on things for Frank.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan and he grew up in the mob's shadow. His father ran in those circles and so did his uncle Jackie. Both were respected men and Frank especially has a soft spot for both of them, who have since departed. Billy wants nothing to do with the life so he too enters into police college. Once he graduates, he is pretty much coerced into going under cover to infiltrate the mob. His background and connections are obviously of great value to the Boston police. The two men who recruit Billy are Dignam and Queenan, and they are played by Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg, and again, in my opinion, they both give the best performances of their career. I know Sheen has been around forever, and he was amazing in films like Apocalyse Now, but he is just outstanding here. And then there is Wahlberg who really should win the best supporting actor this year. He is a scene stealer. He has scenes with every actor in the film and he is the best part of any scene he is in. In one scene, another cop , who just messed up an assignment, asks him who the hell he is. Wahlberg responds, ""I'm the guy doing his job, you must be the other guy!"" He is flawless in the film.<br/><br/>The strength of the film is the action no doubt, but the script by William Monahan is multi-layered, labyrinth of a film. It is complex, and rich in character. Every few minutes there is another twist revealed. People that you thought were ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"" get painted with a shade of gray. Scorcese has a wide palette to stroke the canvas with and here he is Picasso at work. I truly can't find a flaw in the film and the 151 minutes fly by. The denouement is both shocking by Hollywood standards and because it is, it is also refreshing. I don't know of another film that can end like this one did and still find a way to please it's audience.<br/><br/>The Departed is a miracle really. It has one of the best casts of the year, it is directed by a Hollywood legend and it is flawless. If Marty doesn't win this year, then you have to subscribe to the conspiracy theory. Babel is a joke, Iwo Jima is a very good film but this has to be the year of the Marty. This is both similar yet different to any other film that Marty has done. It feels a little like Goodfellas, but at the same time, it carves out it's own niche. I also think this is one of the best casts put together, and it is a treat to watch them work under the master. <br/><br/>***One final note*** It's great to see Marty get his Oscar. A very worthy win for both the film and the director.<br/><br/>10/10"
"wandering_rose","10","4","8","15 February 2007"," Unbelievably gripping and a perfect cast.
","I wouldn't want to spoil one second of this perfectly crafted film by giving anything away and you should do the same when recommending it. Often the advertising hype and public frenzy about a movie proves to be ill-founded. However in the case of ""The Departed"" it was well deserved. Martin Scorsese drew stunning performances out of already incredible actors. The seamless dialog and high emotional intensity didn't let up for a moment. Nicholson was the ultimate sleazy sociopath mob boss and Damon portrayed the pretty-faced bad boy to perfection. DiCaprio continues to astound me with his deep complexity as an actor. I was quickly drawn into his precarious situations and often found myself literally holding my breath on his behalf while awaiting the outcomes. Even Wahlberg and Baldwin, though their roles are supporting rather than lead, maintain a powerful presence throughout. Oh, and let's not forget Martin Sheen(Where has he been, anyway?)excellently playing one of the lone good guys in the film. I am not generally a fan of violent gangster-type movies, and I admit to much cringing and eye-closing. But the story, the acting, the dialog and the edginess hooked me right off. Nicholson's voice-over in the first minutes introduce him as a man with a definite idea of who he is, where he belongs and what he wants out of life. The interactions are snappy and believable with a few really memorable volleys between Wahlberg and Baldwin. We actually had to pause the DVD at times in order to fully enjoy them lest we be still laughing instead of paying attention. I appreciated the non-Tarantino-like directing. Rather than making the violence twistedly funny there are humorous moments within an intense and violent story. And the scarceness of ""Naked Flesh"" kept the story true to its purpose. Well done, Mr. Scorsese."

","I finally saw the long-awaited classic film from Scorsese. This is one of the best films in the last decade and I am still having a personal discussion with myself on comparing it with some of the my ultimate favorites such as Goodfellas, Casino, Rounders, A Bronx Tale, The Deer Hunter and I am pondering even ranking it higher than my top 3 films the first two godfather's and taxi driver. I think i will need to watch it a couple more times before making such an important decision, but after seeing it once, one thing is for sure, The Departed is a masterpiece. Everything put together by Marty in his own perfect stylistic fashion. The violence is perfect, the cursing is perfect, the actors absolutely committed. Nicholson, Wahlberg, and Dicaprio check in for 3 of their best performances of their careers (and thats saying a lot for nicholson whose had an amazing career). Matt Damon was also good here, a bit subtle and overshadowed by his peers, but nonetheless always convincing. Vera Farmiga was charming and very good in the female lead. Alec Baldwin, Ray Winstone and Martin Sheen were perfect in their selective small roles as well. Marty did a great job with this one. I liked Howard Shore's score a lot and Michael Ballhaus's cinematography was amazing, absolutely Oscar worthy. IMDb Rating: 8.4. My rating: 10/10"

","I consider myself a very discerning movie watcher, and am completely opposed to cheesy, Hollywood ridiculousness UNLESS it comes from Martin Scorsese. The guy could make an infomercial for spray on pubic hair and I would love it. Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed the Departed, and actually thought that the last shot of the rat on the railing with the government building in the background to be a perfect way to end things. Is this as a result of my devotion to Scorsese? I have read some posts that point out this scene as ridiculous, and I am just wondering what the consensus is on that particular issue? Alec Baldwin gave yet another incredible performance, almost on par with his movie stealing acting from Glengarry Glen Ross. The other thing I could see someone not hopelessly devoted to Scorsese taking issue with was the scene in which Costello's guy died on the couch before revealing Costigan as a bad guy. That seemed a little bit ridiculous. The violence in this film was done beautifully I thought, and yet I read some conments stating that the part where Martin Sheens character hits the ground and his blood sprays up on Costigan as looking fake. I could not disagree more, I though it looked quite realistic. Am i completetly blindfolded by my respect for Scorsese?"

","Since this movie is coming out Tuesday on DVD, I have to remember the night that I saw it. It was opening night, and we went to a theater in Lawrence, MA which is a pretty tough area. The theater was packed, and from the first ten minutes the crowd was going crazy. Whole groups of people were cheering or laughing out loud at some of the films funnier lines. It was the best experience I have had at the movies since ""Gladiator"".<br/><br/>Being a huge Martin Scorsese fan, I was thrilled to see him get back to the gritty movies he was so famous for from ""Mean Street"" to ""Goodfellas"".<br/><br/>Of course the movie is violent, but not in a gratuitous ""SAW"" type of way. When Billy Costigan punches the guy in the bar, he breaks his hand. That is what really happens when you punch someone that hard, and little things like that make the film stand out to me. Being from the Boston area, I know all about what a sicko Whitey Bulger was. Frank Costello is loosely based on him, and Jack Nicholson's performance was chilling. Asking the girl if she had gotten her period yet was something that the pederast Bulger would have done.<br/><br/>Nothing against Mark Wahlberg, but I felt that it was Matt Damon who deserved the Oscar nomination. Colin Sullivan was a sociopath, someone with the looks and charm who will cut your throat when you aren't looking. He was based on John Connely, the scumbag FBI agent who was Bulger's lookout for 25 years. I felt that this was Damon's best performance yet because it was so against his nature. He was just so unpredictable in this movie.<br/><br/>Everyone will be talking about the Oscars and if Scorsese will finally win. With a movie like this, it will be great if he does it on his terms, and not trying to pander to the voters with films such as ""The Aviator"". This is one of his best movies ever, and anyone who likes mob movies will love it, Oscars or no."

He plays an EXTREMELY convincing role as Billy Costigan. The movie kept me intrigued 100% and I was never bored. I knew the ending was coming up (based on the events) but found myself wishing it wouldn't end yet (even though it's actually a longer movie). I consider the movie to be of Matrix style in which you must pay complete attention to really grasp everything that's going on. The movie is complex and has a surprise ending. It does however, explain its title...The Departed. This is most definitely a MUST SEE movie."

Leonardo DiCaprio is great like always he lives with the character, same for Matt Dammon, but what makes this movie even greater is no doubt Mark Whalberg, he is great and different from that what we are used to see him. And in the end Jack Nicholson, well you all know Jack, NO WORDS, he just has to be the best.... like always. So I am very pleased with this movie and I won't think twice about seeing it again.

"brodie_kashmir","10","4","8","31 December 2006"," Best film of the year
","Martin Scorsese's new crime drama ""The Departed"" cements the Irish mob's takeover of the crime entertainment monopoly from the Italian mafia. With Jack Nicholson at his best since 1992 and Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio giving the performances of their careers, it's hard to deny the sheer power exuded on screen by these three fine actors.<br/><br/>Frank Costello (Nicholson) is Boston's top crime boss. The Special Investigations Unit of the Massachusetts State Police in Boston has been assigned to take him down. Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) is sent deep undercover to gather all the information he can on Costello and his organization. The only people who know of his true identity are his two supervisors. Costello meanwhile has planted a mole, Colin Sullivan (Damon), inside the SIU to keep him one step ahead of the law. But being so entrenched in the lies and deception is beginning to take its toll on the two young men.<br/><br/>This is Scorsese's best film since 1990's ""Goodfellas"". There's always been a brutality to his films, and in his nearly 40 year career as a director, it doesn't get any more violent than his saga of two undercover agents on the opposite sides of the law. What's even more intriguing about all the violence and bloodshed is that quite a bit of it isn't shown on camera. Costello walks out from the backroom of a bar drenched in blood, obviously having just done some serious dirty work. It keeps the air of mystery about Costello going around. You don't know what he did, but you know it was big, bad and dirty.<br/><br/>Noted Russian author and playwright Anton Chekov once said that if they see a gun onstage in the first act, the audience will expect it to go off by the third. This emphasizes an attention to detail that Scorsese utilizes to make everything in his entire world, the one he created for his movie, to be expertly planned out. From the cafÃ© Costigan fights the mafia in to the FBI guy sitting in on the SIU meeting. Everything means something. It makes for a much more engrossing, multi-layered film.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about Jack Nicholson. But come on, it's Jack Nicholson. How do you think he did? The three people that really warrant the most praise are younger actors Damon, DiCaprio and Vera Farmiga, who plays the love interest of both Costigan and Sullivan. They steal the spotlight from consummate and seasoned veterans Nicholson, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin. Pay particularly close attention to DiCaprio. He's fully shed that pin-up boyish look from the late 90's and has this brooding, angsty maturity as Costigan that brings his tortured character to life.<br/><br/>One could argue that this just adds to the deterioration of American society. That it's a glorification of violence and crime. With criminals being seen as idols to be worshipped while cops should be seen as oppressors. But looking at the cadre of violent and crime worshipping movies that have come out in the past 20 years, this one would hardly register. It's the most entertaining film of the year, and one the best. It's definitely one to watch come awards season."

","I liked so much of it, but had some serious problems, including (Spoilers ahead ---->) <br/><br/>#1) Introducing the 'other rat' at the end was a little ridiculous. And why would he become a 2X cop killer to save Matt Damon? Did he think Matt Damon would rat him out? Matt Damon didn't even know he existed. Did he somehow still feel loyalty to the 'gang' (which seems ridiculous after he even said that Nicholson had ratted them out) Why wouldn't he have just continued to be a cop or quietly slip away? I know it's a movie, but don't introduce a character that we don't know and expect us to understand his motives.<br/><br/>#2) Di Caprio with the shrink seemed so forced. I have a couple of psychologist/psychiatrist friends and rule #1 is you don't sleep with your patients. You will never work again. She even mentioned how much she liked her job. Obviously she liked random trysts with Di Caprio more.<br/><br/>#3) Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson's 'final shootout' was terrible. Such a staged cinematic moment and then Damon shouts something like, ""I've got him!"" and then the hoards of police happen to notice where the main guy they were after is... That whole scene was just so sloppy and thrown together.<br/><br/>#4) The baby ... Was the baby Di Caprios or Damons? Are we supposed to care? Why even introduce this? Seemed like a story line that they started and then never finished or simply edited out a major scene.<br/><br/>#5) Nicholson was pretty sure that Di Caprio was the rat, but decided to still work with him despite his suspicions. I mean, he was the new guy ... Then all of these tips started coming in. And Di Caprio was a former police agent (which Nicholson knew!) Come on ... So stupid. And the guy dying right before he was able to tell everyone else in the gang that Di Caprio was a rat was terrible. That gang obviously was the biggest bunch of morons if they weren't 100% sure that they should at least stop working with Di Caprio (if you're not positive then wait to kill him ... but come on ... )<br/><br/>#6) Di Caprio scored a 1400 on his SAT's (so obviously he was pretty smart.) He sure let Sheen and Wahlberg play him like a fool. I mean if they weren't going to let him be a cop and that's what he wanted to do, I'm sure there would be plenty of avenues for him to pursue in order to become a cop (other than having to commit a crime, get put in prison, etc...) This just seemed so stupid. 1400 on his SAT's on the Boston Police Force ... Pretty sure he could have found work :)<br/><br/>#7) Leo checking Martin Sheens pulse after watching him violently fall to his death was classic :) Come on Leo, we were all pretty sure that he was dead :)<br/><br/>#8) These gang members seemed awfully prone to killing cops (How many cops a year are actually killed in the US by gun fire? It isn't that many) <--- However, it is a movie, so we can let this one go... But it was a little bit exaggerated in a movie that was supposed to be realistic. It isn't like in Goodfellas the gangsters just kill cops (if they kill any cops at all?) They kill each other!<br/><br/>#9) Matt Damon accidentally kills that Asian guy ... There are clearly surveillance cameras around. No other cop thinks to look at those to see if they can see who it was that was walking out? I mean Damon looked directly at the camera! Certainly they could have seen that he was there. Violent murders in Boston (even if they are Chinese restaurant employees) still get investigated... I promise.<br/><br/>#10) No backlash from the agents within the Chinese government for them being ripped off of a million dollars? Ouch. I mean I'm not an expert on the Chinese mafia, but something tells me that a million dollars and being set up would bring some sort of black lash ... Guess Nicholson is more powerful than the group who is buying nuclear missile trackers. Those Boston mob bosses are evidently the most powerful people on the planet.<br/><br/>I'm sure there are more... But 10 is a good number ! Any thoughts?"

","I went into this with very high expectations. #50 on the IMDb top 250, 92% fresh on rottentomatoes. I was disappointed, but I set myself up for it.<br/><br/>It's a good movie, but after seeing this I'm starting to believe that a lot of the '10s' from IDMb voters, did in fact, come from those that hadn't seen Infernal Affairs. I'm not going to come out and say Infernal Affairs is a better movie. When you add up all the elements of both films, The Departed is the superior piece of film-making. What disappointed me though, was that Scorcese really didn't take it to the dizzying heights I would've expected after such a positive reaction from almost everyone that had seen it.<br/><br/>Probably every aspect is improved upon in terms of the production process, with the exception of editing. I thought some of the earlier scenes about their childhoods were unnecessary and failed to add anything really substantial to the structure of the original... and that's perhaps my complaint for the whole movie. By the end I felt like I'd just watched Infernal Affairs all over again. What was good, didn't really change. What was bad was changed, but not in such a way that it made any dramatic impact.<br/><br/>The romance subplot for instance, was equally as dull as it had been in the original. There wasn't much chemistry between the psychiatrist and the two leads.. it was done well enough to make a point about the two of them, but not well enough to really move me.<br/><br/>The acting was fine, believable, occasionally there'd be something that'd make me draw breath from Jack Nicholas and Leonardo DiCaprio. But most of the time, nothing more.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm trying to say is this: had I never seen Infernal Affairs, The Departed would have been nothing short of spectacular. But I had. And what I got was a very competent remake from the master that didn't take the story or characters to any dramatic new depths. What ultimately kept my attention wasn't anything different that Scorcese did, but the same, tense game of cat and mouse that was lifted straight of the original.<br/><br/>Honestly I wanted to sing this movie praises, but all I can really do is clap and say: 'well done'."

What you expect to happen does not happen. This is a film that kept me entertained throughout and I don't regret going. the best gangster movie I've seen in years. Leonardo Dicaprio deserves some type of nominations for best actor for this film because the emotions he brought to this role was better than great. Seeing the transformation in his character due to the circumstances that he is forced to partake in makes him a hell of an actor that is deserving of a golden globe or Oscar nomination."

","""The Departed"" was good but not excellent. Jack Nicholson hammed it up through most of the movie. If he had less screen time I would have thought he made the movie but there was too much of him being too much. Matt Damon portrayed the nasty little sh!t I always thought was in him. He was great. Leonardo DiCaprio was also very good portraying the mental stress I would think a mob mole would have. Mark Wahlberg could have been a bit over the top but I think his character's personality evolved from working with big ego macho cops and, for me, he was very believable. Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone were good in their supporting roles. Vera Farmiga was OK. I guess I didn't believe her as a therapist. I think she need a bit more meat, emotionally, and as the girlfriend, physically. I didn't see the original, ""Infernal Affairs"" so I can't compare the two. This version's story, especially towards the end, seemed rushed and forced to finish with the big gun battle but the mechanics of the movie's cop story was secondary to the story of the two moles. If the movie is examined for the story of the cops trying to get Jack Nicholson it comes up short but the mole parallel story was intriguing and Matt and Leo were great. It was a violent movie and the ending was a bit much. Well worth seeing but not Scorsese's best. His best are icons, ""Raging Bull"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""Mean Streets"". ""The Departed"" was just a good movie"
"ralphs-3","6","4","8","15 October 2006"," It ain't no good remake and it ain't no Goodfellas.
","Compared to the original, Infernal Affairs, the Departed is a much weaker film: it lacks a whole lot of style and grace. This not only goes for the directing, but also for the main actors, Leonardo DiCaprio (well, he is at least 'okay' for the very first time) and Matt Damon (who is, as always, eh, Matt Damon). In Infernal Affairs the relationship between the two characters is much more layered en also much more equal: the viewer can feel for both of them. In the case of the Departed there is one hero in a very black and white setting. <br/><br/>The greatest disappointment of the movie is perhaps the way Jack Nicholson is allowed to be completely over the top in every scene he's in and do all the tricks we've seen him do over and over again. Why didn't Scorsese tell him to tone it down? All Nicholson has to do to be impressive is walk into a room, he doesn't need all that other stuff (which is proved in About Schmidt). And the thing he does in the porn theater: come on! Since when are wrap-party- jokes put in movies? No, the Departed ain't no Goodfellas."

","Plot Outline: A police plant tries to infiltrate a Boston gang-lord's crime empire, while the gang-lord's police mole tries to expose him.<br/><br/>Talk about the proverbial 'film of two halves'!!<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese's latest film ""The Departed"" is his loose re-working/ trans-location of the acclaimed Hong Kong thriller, ""Infernal Affairs"", which spawned two sequels, one of which was, effectively, a 'prequel'.<br/><br/>When I saw the earlier film on the festival circuit some three years ago, I was bowled over, even more than I had been by John Woo's kinetic thriller, ""Hard-Boiled"" from some 10 years earlier. What made ""Infernal Affairs"" so special, besides the technical excellence of the production and the fast-paced, high-octane action, was its emphasis on characterisations: particularly in what I regarded as the key, indeed the only players of any necessary substance: Tony Leung as the police plant, and Andy Lau, as the crime-lord's mole.<br/><br/>The problem with Martin Scorsese's 're-working', and, while I recognise that he is at liberty to expand the narrative to broaden the supporting characterisations, is the way he allows himself to be compromised by the star turns and the 'alternate agendas'.<br/><br/>So, and in what I refer to as the first 'half' we get too much of: Jack Nicholson, (whose HK equivalent was, at best, a two-dimensional peripheral character), revelling in an excessive quota of 'Jack-isms': think 'The Shining'; ""Batman"", etc, etc. Alec Baldwin, in his latest incarnation of his 'Glengarry Glenn Ross'/'The Cooler' hard-man, seemingly revelling in his ever-expanding waistline; Leonardo Di Caprio, who had to be given plenty of opportunity to emote, his 'Aviator' Oscar play having fallen short. while Ray Winstone gets to drop the Cockney hard-man stunt in favour of its Bostonian equivalent.<br/><br/>Then, just when I was about to doze off, having realised too late just why Martin Scorsese needed 140 minutes to tell his story, he cranked the gears up a few notches.<br/><br/>Matt Damon's gang-lord's police mole realises he's got to move fast before Di Caprio's good guy undercover cop brings his (Damon's) employer's empire crashing down and, in a daring move, orders a police tail on the head of the police undercover unit, thus hoping to flush out Di Caprio: the resultant 10 minutes or so of breakneck, white-knuckle tension, even if it does rely too much on the original and 'The French Connection' for inspiration, is almost worth the price of admission alone,culminating as it does in a tragic death which ultimately precipitates a breakneck pace of cross and double-cross.<br/><br/>This is where Scorsese really comes into his own, with the kind of frenetic, yet sure-paced action sequences not seen since the heyday of ""Goodfellas"". Pausing briefly to swiftly despatch Nicholson's crime-lord, (which couldn't have come too soon, in my opinion), he constantly keeps us guessing as to the next twist and turn of the tail, and which of the 'double agents' will eventually prevail, and at what cost.<br/><br/>A 'film of two halves', indeed, and while the second 'half', of perhaps 50 minutes or so, probably contains more cinematic merit than most Hollywood productions of at least the past 5 years, ultimately this has to be seen as a missed opportunity for Scorsese.<br/><br/>As with 'The Aviator', Scorsese seems these days to be compromised too much in his artistic 'vision', to such an extent that I don't believe that this is 100% the film he wanted to make. 'The Aviator' seemed to me partly an Oscar vehicle for Di Caprio's (admittedly fine) acting, and part Scorsese 'Citizen Kane' homage: granted it was, after all, a Di Caprio vehicle. <br/><br/>Here, once again, it appears to me that far too much screen time is devoted to 'Jack-isms', and more (unconvincing) brooding Di Caprio 'emoting'. As if, 'the Aviator' pitch having failed, they'd make sure of it this time. The trouble is, while Di Caprio is certainly a fine actor, who, I believe has yet to achieve his peak, more often than not he's trying too hard in this film in what is an underwritten role, lumbered with often puerile dialogue. <br/><br/>And, where acting is concerned, don't get me started on Alec Baldwin, (whose acting capabilities seem to decline in inverse proportion to his waistline), or to Mark Wahlberg's cardboard-cutout undercover sergeant 'character'. Matt Damon, who doesn't try too hard, almost reaches what for me was his peak of 'The Talented Mr Ripley' But it was good to see Ray Winstone doing a 'foreign' accent, for a change.<br/><br/>Once again, Scorsese's choice of music was impeccable: And I so loved his apt placement of Roy Buchanan's sublime, bluesy guitar rendition of Patsy Cline's ""Sweet Dreams"".<br/><br/>Would that all of Scorsese's moves had been as sure."

There's no doubt that in the future The Departed will be the new benchmark for this genre.<br/><br/>The cast is brilliant. I have always been a fan of Nicholson, and here he is even better than usual. Some say he is too over-the-top, but I disagree. The character he plays is himself over the top, and I think it is a perfect performance. Damon's Colin Sullivan is a stunning picture of evil. A man with terrific abilities and, the way he looks to that golden dome, a man with dreams of other better things, but he is so hooked into his patron that he can't get out, and in the end embraces the entanglements as what his life is. Leonardo is such a classic tragic figure in this. Unbelievable... To be willing to sacrifice himself in this way. I think it shows a more realistic picture of what this kind of double life must be than anything I have seen.<br/><br/>Every supporting character is just as flawlessly portrayed. I may never vote ""10"" again, but this one deserves it. Scorcese's best ever."

","A brilliant film. Unquestionably his best since Goodfellas. Great Acting and absolutely fantastic dialog. But I have a question. I read a great deal of buzz about the ""strap-on"" scene. Frank (Nicholson) is getting ready to have sex with two women. He grabs a handful of cocaine tosses it and says to one ""don't move until you're numb."" The frame wavers a bit and then we have a close up of Jack's face and suddenly a jump cut to DeCaprio on the street. The only seen of the strap on was in the Porn theater which was very unclear and didn't make a lot of sense. My companion and I both felt as though something was missing. He had not heard about the scene before seeing the film and he too felt the disparity. The Scene was discussed at length in the last issue of Rolling Stone interviewing Nicholson. My question is did everyone see the same scene I did or was it; (pardon the pun) longer?"
"mike-925","6","4","8","9 October 2006"," Without Nicholson, Departed Would Have Been Better
","The Departed is pretty good, but not because its large cast is good or because of Martin Scorcese's direction.<br/><br/>Its good because the original Chinese film its copied from, Infernal Affairs (2004) was probably a superior script. I'm rushing to get a copy from Netflix as we speak.<br/><br/>The story is about two impersonators who have infiltrated the Boston Police Department. One is employed by the Police Department to find any moles who might have penetrated the force. The other works for Boston Mobster Frank Costello, not related at all to the Mafioso who rapped his knuckles on a congressional desk in the fifties during a televised hearing about organized crime.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson plays Costello and wrecks the movie pretty much. In interviews this weekend, Nicholson said he wasn't inclined to be in the film because the Costello role was little more than a cameo. But Scorcese had the part built up for Nicholson, hurting the film in the process.<br/><br/>The film is a tightly wound tale of intrigue about moles inside the Boston department. Leo De Caprio and Matt Damon play the spies. De Caprio is better than Damon but not by much. De Caprio knots up his forehead too often in order to be taken seriously as a slightly troubled cop.<br/><br/>There's a certain amount of advanced technology to sleuth the mystery the audience already knows the answer to. But this is a great script.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson's Costello is over the top, damaging a pretty good film substantially. De Caprio is off his mark too.<br/><br/>But this is the best Scorcese film in years, better than Gangs of New York or the Aviator, both of which were directed by Scorcese and both of which featured Leonardo De Caprio.<br/><br/>Nicholson is so awful and such a gargoyle, he reminds me of Burl Ives, who was terrible as Big Daddy in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof in 1958. Nicholson is almost always miscast and overacting these days. I think the last decent film he did was the Postman Always Rings Twice in roughly 1980. He hasn't been good in anything since, but they keep paying him as if he's a bankable star.<br/><br/>Other actors in what is supposed to be an ensemble film include Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alex Baldwin, Vera Farmiga and Krista Dalton. Dalton is a newcomer and is quite good. But Baldwin, Farmiga and Wahlberg don't get enough time to act with Nicholson chewing scenery all the time. <br/><br/>The film, due to its extraordinary plot and a series of film surprises, is quite good, despite everything."
"etl33","8","4","8","3 October 2006"," pretty good adaptation
","quite good. a little more violent than the hk original though; Scorsese shock value which actually works. plus a bit more humor to spice it up. though i liked both movies, the original turned out to be more suspenseful while this one was the grittier drama. Mark Wahlberg steals the show whenever he's on screen. And his character wasn't even in the original movie. All the major actors did a splendid job. From Alec to Wahlberg, everybody turned in one of their most memorable performances. However, the role of the shrink is just pushing it. Just way too incredible that she's been sleeping with the two guys who are after each other. They could have done away with this subplot, just like in the original. can't say it's Scorsese's best work though. If we are talking crime drama, Goodfellas and Casino are the still the jewels."

","If you're into blood sprayback, bigotry,racism, and misogyny, then this is the movie for you. Jack nicholson gives his standard routine of eye rolls. Wahlburg is a highlight in the acting venue. The star power cast is highly wasted in this blood fest. Matt damon is a wasted talent in this flick. Leonardo is believable but his talent is muted by the storyline. Alec baldwin and Martin sheen are a long way from being Hollywood icons if they continue to jump on a bandwagon created by the likes of Scorcesse. This flick was drawn out. It was also typical Hollywood plot line. Furthermore, it was a gasp at creating a teenage audience for the likes of producers."

","THE DEPARTED is Scorsese's eagerly anticipated remake of the smash Hong Kong thriller, INFERNAL AFFAIRS, which captivated much of Asia and spawned two sequels across the Pacific. The casting of Nicholson, De Caprio et al looked promising.<br/><br/>While there are some entertaining moments in DEPARTED and the film is enjoyable, it falls far short of INFERNAL AFFAIRS. Ironcally, IA feels more like a Scorsese film than DEPARTED: fast-cutting, a rock soundtrack, sharp camera moves and action jacked-up to 11. DEPARTED is inconsistent. At two-and-a-half hours, it moves, slows down, rocks, stops, goes forward, pauses.<br/><br/>There's also a little too much posturing among all these cops and villains and not enough suspense which accelerated INFERNAL AFFAIRS like a rocket ship hurling into space. The central cat-and-mouse premise between the two moles is strangely muted in DEPARTED and that's what hurts the film the most.<br/><br/>Performances are fine, starting with a salty Nicholson. I love Scorsese, but his hallmarks of slick camera moves, swift editing and the perfect soundtrack don't hit the mark.<br/><br/>Not bad, but certainly not vintage Marty."

","Having watched both ""Internal Affairs"" and ""The Departed"" I am thoroughly disappointed by the latter. I had no idea the two films had anything to do with each other, and the disappointment and boredom grew as scene after scene seemed like an American copy of a Chinese quality product (how is that for a change).<br/><br/>More shocking is the overwhelmingly ecstatic reception of the Hollywood blockbuster, which, in my view, is fueled by a range of big names in acting, producing, and of course directing. It goes to show that creative talent has become rare in Hollywood, remakes hit the screen in an increasingly shortening interval, and good advertising and promoting count more than fresh ideas, or truly artistic values.<br/><br/>Did I say there was no creativity in this movie? Well, I take that back. Hollywood being Hollywood, the genuinely dark ending of the Hong Kong masterpiece was obviously too bold for an audience that is more interested in watching the good prevail. Or at least leaving the theater safe in the knowledge that the bad won't walk free. Consequently, the ending is the only creative adaption to make the movie a little more digestible to ensure good reviews, and, more importantly, secure cash flow.<br/><br/>""The Departed"" would have been a good film. The pure fact that ""Internal Affairs"" exists, however, makes it feel like its only intention is to make money from a larger audience the Hong Kong original can appeal to."

","My wife and I could not sit through this movie due to the wall to wall gutter language that Hollywood seems to think adds to the realism and entertainment value. This movie was much worse in this regard than most R-rated movies I have seen. Most people that I know feel that the four-letter vocabulary of Hollywood detracts from - rather than adds to - the entertainment value of a movie. I think that more people might want to watch a movie such as this if it were cleaned up. The question is, how many people refuse to attend a movie because it lacks crude language. There are probably a few weirdos who would not watch such a movie, but most people would probably enjoy such a movie much more without the obscenities. Hollywood seems to be of the opinion that obscenity and crudity equate to sophistication, realism, and entertainment value when exactly the opposite is the case. Hollywood seems to want to create movies that appeal to the less intellectual and more base qualities of their viewers. Unfortunately, there seems to be quite a number of viewers and this includes the Hollywood crowd themselves. They should be ashamed, but I know they are not."

","""I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want the environment to be a product of me."" - Frank Costello<br/><br/>A remake of the Hong Kong thriller, Infernal Affairs, The Departed is once again yet another crime masterpiece that deals with identity and deception, and it's all done in such style that only Scorsese can pull off.<br/><br/>Set in contemporary Boston, it follows Irish Mob boss Frank Costello who plants a mole within the Massachusetts State Police while, at the same time, the police sends an undercover cop to infiltrate Frank's organization. Eventually, both sides realizes what's going on and both moles race to identify each other before their covers are blown.<br/><br/>In an age when remakes are often inferior to the original, there comes a remake where it takes the original concept and gives it its own unique style, and this is no exception. From its moving cameras, to its cinematography, Scorsese incorporates his own style into this film and gives it a gritty and tense feel to it. The editing, for the most part, moves at a steady and flowing pace, even if some moments where the editing moves frantically.<br/><br/>The two major themes the movie deals with are identity and deception. Both moles are simultaneously trying to discover who each other are, but, at the same time, trying to blend into an environment they aren't originally from without revealing their true motives. It's also noted that both men, despite being different from each other, constantly competing in a similar manner is so clear and strong that it makes for some really intense moments.<br/><br/>These intense and emotional moments wouldn't be possible without its star-studded cast, and each one delivers. Leonardo DiCaprio puts on a captivating performance as Billy Costigan, Matt Damon is great as Colin Sullivan, and, of course, Jack Nicholson, who might be the best performance in the movie, is outstanding as Frank Costello.<br/><br/>Overall, The Departed is an excellent thriller. Emotionally gripping, thematic, and elegantly cinematic, it's one of Scorsese's best films and it's one of the best pieces of cinematic art.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 9/10 with an Epic Seal of Awesomeness."

"Dr-Conejo90210","10","2","3","12 January 2016"," Scorsese does it again
","'The Departed' is an American crime-thriller film directed by Martin Scorsese ('Taxi Driver', 'Good Fellas'). The film gives us a poignant look at a fictional war on drugs fought by the Boston Police Department against an Irish-rooted mob led by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), with his protégé, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) helping him from the inside of the police force while Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio) helps the police department by infiltrating Costello's mob.<br/><br/>The story takes place in Boston, following the lives of Billy Costigan, an undercover cop of the Boston Police Department, who is at a crossroads in his life, having just lost all close relatives and with no clear direction in his life, as he infiltrates Costello's mob, and Colin Sullivan, who from a very young age has been the protégé of Costello and who now works for the Boston Police Department, providing Frank with information. As the story unfolds, we see the consequences the characters have to deal with by leading a double life. We watch them as they blur the lines of what's right or wrong, and we get to see just how far they are willing to go to protect what they've built, and to get what they want.<br/><br/>In typical Scorsese fashion, the director dwells into the moral aspect of their characters, exploring the kind side of the villain and the dark side of the heroes. The cast is on point through-out all the movie, with the performances by Leonardo Di Caprio, Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg being particularly fascinating.<br/><br/>One of the strongest points of the film it's is pace, with the story developing in a fast-pace, leaving no dead-time on screen for the viewer to lose attention. One major critic of the film is that it doesn't follow the original, Infernal Affairs, too closely. While this may be true to some extent, it could very well be attributed to the fact that the original is a three-part saga; it's a given that some of the story it's bound to be lost in the process of condensing three movies into one.<br/><br/>While it released more than twenty years into the career of director Scorsese, 'The Departed' is a solid film, with a story that will keep you at the edge of your seat, that's going to keep you guessing as of what's going to happen next. If you're in the mood for a film with a fast-paced, thrilling story, fleshed-out characters and superb acting, then 'The Departed' is a must-see."
"kjarvis1212","10","2","3","10 January 2016"," As Good As It Gets
","Martin Scorsese, perhaps the greatest American film director of all- time, delivers in a major way with The Departed. The movie represents a return to the material that made him a superstar in the first place. And the result is one of the best American crime dramas ever made. Aided by a brilliant script (William Monahan), and an outstanding ensemble cast, Scorsese is in top form here. It should be noted that The Departed is technically a remake of the Chinese action hit, Infernal Affairs, unseen by me. It also uses the true story of infamous Boston mobster Whitey Bulger as a template for the Jack Nicholson character. But I think it would do the film and the viewer a disservice to think of it as a Bulger picture. It is not. It is its own story with its own characters that stands on its own. The film opens with a young Matt Damon in a local diner, listening to Nicholson's notorious local gangster spouting off in his own poetically vulgar way about how cops and crooks aren't so different. Instant flash forward to the future, and Damon's character is being sworn in as a Massachusetts state police officer. Meanwhile, so is another character, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. We learn that Leo's character comes from a family with an unsavory, non-law-abiding past. He's confronted by his superior, Martin Sheen, and his sidekick, Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg might be the single most enjoyable aspect of the film, which is saying a lot. He steals nearly every scene he's in as a foul-mouthed, results-driven hothead. They present Leo's character with an ultimatum: quit the force, or join their undercover operation as a mole in Jack's gang. It's a risky proposition, but one they all know is feasible, including Leo. On paper, he'll quit the force and get back into crime, including an assault conviction and a short jail sentence. Then work his way into the Nicholson character's world. At the same time, Damon's character has been handpicked to run a top secret task force out to snag Jack once and for all. But it appears he's still in Jack's debt. One cop who's really a gangster pretending to be a cop, and another who's really a cop pretending to be a gangster. What unfolds is an epic, wholly believable and ultimately satisfying tale about just how thin the line between good and bad can be. It's difficult to overstate the quality of the acting performances in this film. DiCaprio is incredible as a vulnerable savant looking for some sort of salvation, spending his spare time sitting next to a hospital bed occupied by his dying mother. Damon delivers a strong performance as the wormy overachiever who says all the right things and shacks up with the department's psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga in a very effective performance). Alec Baldwin has some great lines in a small but solid role as one of the squad commanders. Sheen is perfect as the wise and cautious bureau chief (or something like that). When Scorsese has material like this, as in Goodfellas or Taxi Driver or Raging Bull or Mean Streets, its as if he's transported to another time and place that allows him to tell the story with an impeccable sense for placement, color, angle, emphasis, and tone. It's like watching Michael Jordan or Jimi Hendrix. It's a special thing when an artist has such control over their craft. If you're the sort of person who likes a well-written, impeccably acted crime drama, and for some inexplicable reason have not seen this movie, do yourself a favor and see it."

","This is as great of a movie as you can get. Undoubtedly, it is one of the most complete movies of the 2000s. The story-line is engaging, breathtaking, and genius. The cinematography is what you would expect from an Scorsese movie, and directing is top notch. It won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Directing, Best Writing, and Best Editing to back that claim. Then comes the cast of absolute all-stars. DiCaprio, Damon, Nicholson, Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, and Baldwin. In today's movies, it seems like every time too many starts are placed in a movie, it backfires, but not in a Scorsese movie. DiCaprio delivered an Oscar-deserving performance, and was absolutely robbed by the Academy. Nicholson once again proved to everyone why he is one of the best actors of all time, as if anyone would disagree. Damon was great, although he struggled a bit to establish himself in accordance to his character's personality, however, he was able to pull it off one way or another and complete the story. Whalberg was as usual his own self, and somehow his personality translated perfectly to his character. Overall, it was a great all around effort by every actor in the movie, even those who didn't receive much screen time to prove that the casting was flawless. The story developed well, providing the essential back-story and taking the time to develop each character thoroughly. Although it seemed as if the ending was slightly rushed (even though this was a two and a half hour movie), the climax with all its plot twists unfolded as smoothly as the director intended. This is a must see movie for any fan of Crime/Drama/Thriller movies. It is also captures some of the best performances by all the main actors, whose fans can not go on without watching.<br/><br/>-apologies for not putting the time to proof read this review."

","The Departed as many as declared as Martin Scorsese's masterpiece. What's surprising here is that this is not an awards seeking film rather The Departed is purely a thoroughly entertaining mainstream blockbuster designed more to be enjoyed than to be analyzed. The Departed has been praised for several years, especially since it's immediate release. It is a great example of the difference that a visionary director can bring to relatively conventional material.<br/><br/>The overall premise is clever, the action is gripping, production values solid all around. What really makes it stand out though, aside from Scorsese's style, is simply how much good fun it is. Laughs come frequently and loudly throughout the film, with almost all being character based rather than cheesy one-liners or goofy sight gags. The result is some tremendously smart and snappy dialogue interplays mixed with scenes which give the actors room to breathe and add their own style. As a rewatch 03/16/20' the Departed remains a great and highly entertaining watch, and one of the greater crime drama's of its time."
"advaitkamat","10","2","3","6 April 2013"," One of Scorsese's very best.
","How can you make a storyline that borderlines the implausible work? Ask Scorsese. The master director is no stranger to tackling preposterous story-lines that end up becoming some miraculous films. Take for example the masterful ""After Hours"", in which he demonstrated how you can take a ridiculous story and churn it into some kind of a classic with terrific storytelling. Now, with ""The Departed"", Scorsese concocts one of the very best films of his immaculate career.<br/><br/>Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a rookie cop, freshly recruited by Capt. Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Staff Sgt. Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) as an informant to help them implicate the Irish mob boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). He is the perfect bait, partly because of his family's prior involvement in organized crime. Billy starts off slow, catching Costello's attention and slowly working his way up the mob and finally gaining his trust. Staff Sgt. Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is the endearing new officer in the SIU who has everyone's trust, including a psychiatrist Mandolyn Madden (Vera Farmiga). Also, he's Costello's surrogate son who is his mole in the police unit. At first, a simple act of loyalty on both sides quickly turns into a desperate battle for survival when both the men realize the need to locate the identities of each other while trying to keep their identity concealed.<br/><br/>As always, it is a pleasure to watch a film where Scorsese protrudes and dissects a crime story with such glorious skill and fervor. Though I haven't seen ""Infernal Affairs"", I can safely state that ""The Departed"" is by no means a flimsy remake, given the uncanny skill with which the story is handled. Take for instance a well-written and superbly etched-out scene where Costello beguiles a young Sullivan by buying him comic books and groceries. It's an honest portrait of how the ingenuous turn into the gullible and Scorsese works wonders by giving it a little piquant twist with the dark humor. It's remarkable how a Hong Kong-based story can be transported to an American setting with such deft precision and William Monahan writes wonderfully, giving the characters enough time and feeling until they become someone you can relate to. The plot unravels with genuine disregard for what happens to everything irrelevant to the story, and editor Thelma Schoonmaker marvelously cuts and trims to keep it rife with violent tension. <br/><br/>Peopled by some outstanding actors, the cast is to die for. If a Scorsese film stars the ever-magnificent Nicholson, you don't need another reason why it should warrant a viewing. Nicholson is dazzling as the slightly psychotic Costello and it's pure delight to watch him play a creepy mobster with devilish traits. DiCaprio and Damon likewise are excellent in their respective roles, bringing the urgency and desperation to their characters effortlessly. The rest of the cast is stellar, with Mark Wahlberg turning in a remarkable performance as the foul-mouthed tough cop Dignam, something, admittedly, I had not expected him to pull off.<br/><br/>""The Departed"" is Scorsese's best film since ""Goodfellas"" but it's not as good, sadly. But here is a film that respects its genre and it's one that's not all cops-and-guns but instead goes much deeply and illustrates with ruthless candor what circumstances force us to become."

","Now, this is a film I wanted to love. I have a profound admiration for Scorsese which I consider among the best, and probably the most consistent directors, the one who never failed to surprise me in each of his brilliant movies. But if I liked ""The Departed"" as a solid cat-and-mouse thriller, I reckon I expected much more from Marty, and the last 10 minutes of the film confirmed my disappointment.<br/><br/><ul><li>The ending : sure it was one hell of a totally-unexpected climax, sure we already had a first taste of the movie's level of violence, but I had the strange feeling Scorsese let himself go with such 'delightful' visual effects -to create the most gruesome head shots with the most graphic blood splattering- that he forgot the story. It was so repetitive it almost became comical. At one point, I was thinking ""Ok, who's next now?"" It was just like watching a film set in a big city, and at the end, a big atomic bomb destroys everything and everyone is dead. Okay, I knew, this wasn't the kind of police dramas where the good guys would win  I even knew about the elevator scene, but just because something is unexpected and shocking, doesn't make it acceptable. I felt cheated. What's the point of engaging the viewer if it must end in such an abrupt way. Or is it supposed to show harsh reality, in an almost documentary-like style? Well, I expected more depth from a Scorsese film, maybe more poetry. He's one of the greatest film-makers of all-time, and this film left me cold.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The cast : Jack Nicholson did a good job, but I would have loved to see De Niro playing this part. All through the movie, I couldn't stop thinking, why didn't Marty take Bobby for the part? It would've been perfect. Nicholson was good, but he was Nicholson. DiCaprio did a decent job too, but I guess I'm getting tired of seeing him always playing tough guys and banging sexy girls, and I wasn't that impressed by Matt Damon: he was good, but not 'Scorsese' good. And I didn't really care for the other supporting characters who were just your archetypal ""cops and gangsters"". The characterization was OK but would you really compare this to ""Goodfellas""? Consider the female characters; their presence was a convenient plot device, using their sexy tight skirts as a foil for the whole male dominant cliché. Where are the Boxcar Bertha, Karen Hill, Iris etc.? I even missed the annoying Ginger, that's saying a lot.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The writing : it tries too much, it's too smart, too intricate, too serious, too many characters, too much violence and at the end : no heart, not this emotional extra-push of dutiful sin and tormenting guilt Scorsese used to beautifully depict in his films. This torment I need to find in every Scorsesian character, I found it a bit in Di Caprio, but that made the ending even more depressing because once he died, I didn't care for the rest of the film. This is the kind of originality I hate, just like the Coen brothers thought it would be great to  well, those who've seen ""No Country For Old Men"" will know. Here, it's like Marty wanted to make the ending impacting in a stylish way, while there was more to do on the emotional level. All style and no substance. And even the style didn't provide this entertaining energy that made his gangster films so dark and flamboyant at the same time. At the end, ""The Departed"" is just a 'film' with a brilliant premise, and a script so smart every single element is used as a clever plot device: if only 2 persons know about Costigan's mission, wouldn't you guess already that something very bad would happen to them? Anyway ... my criticism wouldn't be so harsh if it hadn't won the Best Picture Oscar.</li></ul><br/><br/>I hated the ending for the same reasons I love old-school Scorsese who made masterpieces like ""Mean Streets"" and ""Goodfellas"", but in ""The Departed"": the bloodier it got, the cheaper it was. And this film ended like a self-parody, relying on cheap shocking effects instead of real character developments, or maybe it wasn't a character-based film, but just a cat-and-mouse thriller, then again, it didn't deserve all this praise. I was talking of self-parody, because sometimes a great director becomes like a label, you insert his name in any film, and it's supposed to be a masterpiece. I read Ebert's review and of course, he went again about the same ""torment/moral/guilt/dilemma"" analysis. There I knew he was biased, I know Ebert is Scorsese's number one fan, but sometimes this passion blinds him so much he loses the neutrality I'd expect from a critic. To give you an example, I liked ""Casino"" a lot, but couldn't help but notice some weaknesses when compared to ""Goodfellas"", a too similar plot line, too much narration, an annoying repetitive relationship between Ginger and Ace etc. Those points were highlighted by Siskel, but Ebert, as usual, started to analyze the traditional Scorsesian themes, the Catholic influence etc. That's how I started not to be influenced by Ebert's reviews on Scorsese, I don't blame him though for being unbiased, he has a soft spot for Marty, and I understand that. Marty remains one of my favorite directors, but ""The Departed"" is his weakest film, which won an obvious sympathy Oscar. <br/><br/>So if this film won the Best Picture Award, fine, but then ""Donnie Brasco"" should have gotten more attention, because not only does the movie deal with (basically) the same subject, but there is a human dimension, a relationship between Lefty and Donnie, that makes it something more than your average gangster film. And this originality, this heart, I didn't find while watching ""The Departed""."
"Jonathon_Natsis","9","2","3","2 February 2011"," King Martin conquers Boston
","Martin Scorsese hits the mean streets again in his triumphant return to the crime genre that has justified his position as arguably the world's greatest living filmmaker. The Departed, a remake of the well-acclaimed Hong Kong grit-fest Infernal Affairs, follows the complicated lives of Billy Costigan (former criminal turned undercover cop), Colin Sullivan (current criminal who's weeded his way into the police force) and Frank Costello (the seemingly infallible Don who's array of memorable quotes have made The Departed the most naturally quotable film since Mean Girls).<br/><br/>This film is always contained in the mind and hands of Scorsese; we never forget that this is his project, and his influence is constantly felt throughout the film. The cinematography employed reminds us of some of the director's earliest projects, and that he certainly hasn't lost his touch. The trademark quick cuts, flashbacks and general detail offered to every aspect of every scene are all on display. The integration of dated yet actual footage of the Boston race riots with the commanding, satisfied voice of Jack Nicholson's Costello creates one of the most engaging opening scenes in recent film history.<br/><br/>Frank Costello reminisces about 'years agowhen we had the church' and that, even today, 'no-one gives it to you, you have to take it' all to the tune of Gimme Shelter, a song that has largely defined all Scorcesean works post-Goodfellas.<br/><br/>But don't be fooled, this is not the stereotypical Don who can't believe business is no longer conducted the way it was in the old country. Flunking out of the Corleone School of Business, it appears that Frank controls every aspect of his universe with an iron fist and a silver tongue, until his own flaws come to the forefront in a denouement scene that could be seen as uncharacteristically cliché, if it weren't so masterfully acted out in front of us.<br/><br/>For all intents, the acting, in its purest form, is the strongest suit of The Departed. Essentially an ensemble film, Dicaprio and Damon exceed expectations while Crazy Jack adopts his most blatantly villainous role since The Shining. Marky Mark is delightfully hateable and the rest of his Funky Bunch (Sheen, Baldwin and Farmiga) make themselves known as well. One of my film-osophies is that one can distinguish a good director from a great one on how they apply a comic-relief character within the plot of their film. Baldwin's portrayal of Ellerby is witty, used sparingly (a crucial quality) and has a genuine respect and passion for his work within the force, giving him a somewhat larger scope for character development than just being the laugh generator in what is otherwise a very serious film.<br/><br/>While The Departed goes against the mould of earlier Scorsese dramas (which typically focused on the goings-on around a single crucial protagonist), it does retain the fact that each primary character has very obvious flaws that will be inevitably extracted and exploited as the film progresses. I find this to be not only a treat to watch unravel from a creative perspective, but also the central message of the film: humans, by their very condition, are morally flawed, and that the consequences of their actions upon society have greater reaches than the effect of those consequences on any one person. <br/><br/>If there was to be any criticism imposed upon this film, it is that the intended plot controls the characters, rather than the character(s) dictating where the story is going. This might need to be made a little clearer. In films such as Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, the story does not go anywhere unless Travis or Jake respectively choose to steer it in that direction. With The Departed, the characters merely serve as a vehicle for getting parts of the story from A to B, or to connect the plot in a plausible manner, and several scenes towards the conclusion seem somewhat too convenient for a film that has a lot to say about the implications humans have on the world around them. <br/><br/>That said, this remains a highly enjoyable film, but one that benefits infinitely from multiple viewings. After eventually deciphering who dies, where they die, and why they died in your first sitting, it is advisable that you re-watch the film. This allows you to delve very deeply into the persona of each major character and gain a subsequent understanding and appreciation of one of the best examples of ensemble cast filmmaking in the history of dramatic cinema.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

"John_Truby","Null","2","3","7 January 2010"," A great plot that spirals out of control
","The Departed is very instructive in showing us how to write a crime thriller, and how not to. It starts with a terrific premise: cops and criminals have a mole in the each other's organization. But this is also a premise that is loaded with pitfalls. In the Great Screen writing Class, I talk extensively about how you develop your premise, to learn not only the potential strengths of your idea but also the hidden structural weaknesses.<br/><br/>In The Departed, the writers must immediately confront the difficulty of two main characters. Again, the need to cross-cut between two leads first takes a toll on the definition of the characters. The writers are so interested in getting the plot going they fail to give Billy (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) a motive for going undercover. As the story progresses, it becomes clear that no one in this movie has a motive for what they do.<br/><br/>Lack of character motive (which is connected to the first major structure step, the Need) is always a big weakness. But in a story already dominated by plot, this is a disaster. The characters are nuts and bolts being moved by plot mechanics.<br/><br/>The premise does highlight the strength of The Departed, which is the plot. But it also shows us how even the best plot can spiral out of control.<br/><br/>Plot in crime stories is all about opposition under the surface, and The Departed is worth studying to see how to create that, not only in a crime story but in any work of fiction. But when you are creating your plot, you have to be aware of the fundamental trade-off between plot and believability. The more you try to hide the opposition under the surface - thus giving you more plot - the more you push the believability of your characters to the extreme. You become so conscious of creating surprise that you force the characters to take actions that they, and indeed no human being, would logically do.<br/><br/>This believability problem surfaces right away when Billy, who has been to the police academy, becomes the mole in the Costello crime family. It would be so obvious that this guy is the snitch that I was immediately reminded of Clark Kent and Superman. Somehow when Superman puts on a suit and a pair of nerdy glasses no one can see that he is Superman. In a fantasy superhero story, the audience accepts that convention and lets it pass. Not so in a realistic crime story.<br/><br/>The writers keep the believability problems at bay for most of the story. But any story that emphasizes plot always pushes the reveals to the end, where whatever believability problems it has will be magnified as the reveals come fast and furious. Sure enough, The Departed rapidly disintegrates into farce and stupidity. The final sequence is filled with reveals and assassinations, but they are based on actions so mindlessly dumb that the audience is left muttering, ""No! No! No!"" Even worse, this sort of false plot, sprung at the end, kills the audience's sense of investment in the film itself. If it's so easy to assassinate these characters, why didn't they just shoot Costello in the first place and save me 2 1/2 hours of my time.<br/><br/>FOR MORE REVIEWS, please go to www.truby.com"

","This could be a good film if it weren't for a few loose ends in the development of the story and a couple of strange coincidences made up to maintain the plot in line with the general structure of the script. This said what is left to remark: first of all the superb performance of Jack Nicholson, perhaps one of the best of his career, as Costello the Mafia gang chief. Then the good technical quality of the movie and the excellent acting of the other performers. One word too for the good form of all the violent scenes which are truly made and convincing. In conclusion, a movie that can have you agreeably occupied for about 3 hours without adding any special event to the history of cinema."
"cwarne_uk","6","2","3","31 July 2008"," Slick and entertaining but no masterpiece
","""Infernal Affairs"" was a fun to watch but totally implausible thriller. It's no surprise that Martin Scorsese's remake is the same. The running time passes smoothly and it never jars in the way that so many Scorsese films do. After you've watched it though the questions start to pile up. The story is basically totally unbelievable and would work much better with a camper approach - John Woo achieved this with ""Face/Off"", a much more entertaining film, mostly due to inspired casting of Travolta and Cage, two actors who can make the best of ridiculousness. Here instead we get DiCaprio seemingly taking it all very seriously and Matt Damon being as dull as he is as Jason Bourne. On the plus side Scorsese remains a technical wizard, a wizardry though seemingly divorced from any insight or guiding intelligence, to the point that he seems to fail to notice the pulp nature of the material here."

The writing, cinematography, direction, and acting are all awesome. It is an intense movie that kept me on the edge of my seat. And the ending is of this movie is beyond words. Blew me away. Damon is in my favorite role of his next to Jason Bourne. Jack is great. And even Dicaprio, who I am not a fan of, is pretty good. Marky-Mark of course is funny and great in his part.

"departed07","10","2","3","18 July 2007"," Cops and Criminals, what's the difference?
","Taxi Driver was hailed at the movie of the seventies; Raging Bull was the film of the eighties; Good Fellas was the film of the nineties; now in this decade, Martin Scorsese returns to his mafia roots, not in New York or New Jersey, but brings his mafia to Boston where in this update of Infernal Affairs it's mean, violent, frightening with full of surprises, and Jack is Back making The Departed Martin Scorsese's definitive film of this decade.<br/><br/>""When you're faced with a loaded gun...what's the difference?"" <br/><br/>In The Departed, Leonardo Dicaprio and Matt Damon play different sides of the law that go in the opposite directions in their careers; Leo is Billy Costigan, a smart recruit who flunked the academy but is hired by Capt. Queenan (Martin Sheen) and the foul-mouth Sgt. Dignam (Mark Whalberg) to go undercover inside mob boss Frank Costello's (Jack Nicholson) team and get any information; Matt is Colin Sullivan who is not only a smart prodigy to Frank, but once he is promoted to the Special Unit Investigations leaded by Capt. Ellerby (Alec Baldwin), it's up to Colin to make sure that he gives Frank the early step.<br/><br/>In a game of cat and mouse, both sides of the law want to find out who the mole is in their operative sources while at the same time both William and Colin are taken in by the father-son figures of their work with Frank thinking of William as a son despite his henchman Mr. French (Ray Winstone) breaking him down. Just like most movies, there is always the love interest. Vera Farmiga who is unknown to a lot of general film freaks like myself plays the police psychiatrist who falls in love with Colin's Suffolk education attitude while she sees Billy as her patient and falls for both characters despite not knowing that both are undercover operatives.<br/><br/>Everyone gives top notch performances, but everybody knows that the one who steals the show is none other than Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello. Nicholson's performance as Costello brings back the devil's grin that made everybody loved villains in the first place; compared to the sadistic Bill the Butcher from Gangs of New York, Jack's performance is one that people will be talking about and reenacting.<br/><br/>On another note about the film, the editing of the film is top notch with Thelma Schoonmaker giving it all she's got bringing energetic life to the movie. The screenplay by William Monahan is excellent after reading the script from purchasing the two disc special edition on February 13, 2007 and this is Martin Scorsese's best film ever."

"guanyu","7","2","3","29 April 2007"," Great, but can't better the original.
","First things first. I watched The Departed before watching Infernal Affairs. So I had absolutely no idea of what to expect from TD.<br/><br/>Colin Sullivan is a criminal undercover in the Massachusetts state police. Billy Costigan, conversely, is a police officer working undercover in the ranks of big shot Irish American gangster Frank Costello. The tension rises as Sullivan is assigned to discover both the mole inside the police and the mole in Costello's crew -- while Costigan tries desperately to discover Sullivan's identity.<br/><br/>Dicaprio turns in a great performance as the tough-as-nails Billy Costigan. Damon is also great as the more laid-back Sullivan. But the best performances come from Mark Wahlberg as hot-headed staff sergeant Dignam and Jack Nicholson as the irredeemable Frank Costello.<br/><br/>But great performances can't elevate the Departed to ""Infernal Affairs"" levels. The movie is full of pointless subplots (such as the love triangle between Madolyn, Billy and Colin) and re-imagined scenes which can't hold a candle to the originals. Queenan's death, for example, is nowhere near as gut-wrenching as the death of SP Wong in Infernal Affairs. The music (""goodbye, policeman"") and suddenness made that scene a real tear-jerker in IA, while the decision to film Queenan's descent in slow-motion damaged unexpected nature of the character's death.<br/><br/>It was also a bad idea on Monahan's part to combine the two female characters from IA into one. That Costigan and Sullivan would be seeing the same woman is far too improbable.<br/><br/>The ending of TD isn't particularly well-written or directed. Adding another corpse to the elevator bloodbath was unnecessary and made the scene almost comical as the body count increased. The decision to kill off Sullivan at the end was another mistake, negating the entire point of the original story.<br/><br/>My main problem, however, is the complete alteration of Yan and Lau's characters. Lau in IA is a decent, albeit misled man who wants nothing more than to leave organised crime behind. While Yan is an internally troubled individual desperate to regain his identity. In TD, Sullivan is almost a comic book villain, working for and against everybody. While Costigan is a wacko who kills people for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>It's also worth mentioning the scene where Costello's gang meets with the ""Chinese government"" guys. Is the extremely negative portrayal of the Chinese (complete with various racial slurs) Hollywood's way of repaying the very people who gave birth to the script?"
"hall895","9","2","3","18 April 2007"," And the Oscar goes to...
","Well, Martin Scorsese finally got his Oscar. Long overdue. Some may quibble and say the film for which he was rewarded was not his best. Those who say that may have a point. But that's really not important. The questions which must be asked are whether this film is worthy of being an Oscar winner and worthy of being forever remembered as the film which broke the infamous Scorsese Oscar curse. The answers to those questions? Resoundingly yes. The Departed stands in its own right as a remarkable film, one of the best to come along in quite some time and clearly worthy of any and all awards it has received. Maybe not Scorsese's best but if not it's pretty darned close.<br/><br/>Where to begin? So many different things come together to make The Departed the standout film that it is. There's a great story, a terrific cast full of big-name performers clearly on top of their games, wonderful visuals, a perfect soundtrack...all capped by that unique Scorsese touch. In this film Scorsese goes back to the familiar world of organized crime. This time the mobsters are Irish rather than Italian and the story unfolds in Boston rather than New York but it will all seem rather familiar to the Scorsese devotee. But this is not just another Scorsese mob movie. It's as intense and gritty and violent as you would expect but The Departed is quite unique, thanks mostly to the wonderfully involved and intricate story which unfolds in the film. For everything else the film has going for it in the end, as it usually does, it comes down to the story.<br/><br/>The plot really revolves around two figures, Leonardo DiCaprio's Billy Costigan and Matt Damon's Colin Sullivan. The two both come from Boston's rather proud but rather rough Irish community. After very different experiences in their youth, both end up in the same place, becoming Massachusetts state troopers. But soon their paths will diverge again and the story really begins to pick up steam. Sullivan has become a cop for one reason, to provide inside information to Frank Costello, the gangster whose presence is always looming over Boston's Irish neighborhood. Sullivan's a mole. Soon Costigan will be too, assigned to go undercover and infiltrate Costello's gang. Quite a tangled web. Soon both the police and Costello are well aware they each have a rat inside their organization and Costigan and Sullivan will be racing to unmask each other before being discovered themselves. A very high-stakes drama this is as the potential consequences of being discovered are painfully obvious for our respective rats.<br/><br/>While the story is thoroughly engrossing, great actors are required to bring that story to life. And one thing The Departed surely has no shortage of is great actors. DiCaprio and Damon are both terrific, each bringing just the right personality to their respective characters who are quite a bit alike but also so different in many important ways. Damon seems more calm and collected, DiCaprio more edgy and intense and those emotions work perfectly for the two characters. Playing Frank Costello is Jack Nicholson who is typically brilliant. Authoritative, menacing, diabolical and always dangerous...that's Frank Costello and who better for such a role than Nicholson? DiCaprio, Damon and Nicholson have the three meatiest roles but there are plenty of opportunities for other actors to shine as well. Mark Wahlberg breathes great life into the character of Sgt. Dignam, one of Costigan's handlers within the police force. Dignam is a man of great conviction and passion and whenever Wahlberg is on the screen you get the sense there is always something fierce simmering just beneath the surface. Well played. There are other big names in the cast like Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin who fall perfectly into their smaller roles. And there are countless less-familiar faces who also do fine work. It seems Martin Scorsese has brought the best out of each and every member of his cast. And in doing so he has been able to wring as much drama as possible out of the terrific story with which he had to work. A great story, performed wonderfully by a terrific cast, all touched by the hand of a master director. Add it all up and you have something truly special, a wonderful film worthy of all the accolades it has received."
"RJBurke1942","9","2","3","14 April 2007"," Double dealing with a vengeance
","The debates will probably rage on for years: Has Scorsese done his best work here?<br/><br/>Like many in this forum, I've seen all of his movies. From the aspect of thrills-a-minute, edge of your seat action, I think I'd say this is his best movie. However, as gangster movies go, I still prefer Gangs of New York (2002). For suspense, Scorsese's remake of Cape Fear (1991) beats them all, I think. And, for characterization, Raging Bull (1980)  the movie that should have got him an Oscar  is still without equal, for me. Having said all that, however, The Departed is still the overall winner, mainly because the story is so well constructed and delivers the best double twist  or is it triple?  I've seen for many a year. In fact, I'd be hard pressed to think of a better one...<br/><br/>So, I won't be saying too much about the actual plot (the sequence of events), but the story is basically this: two young graduates of the police both act as undercover agents, one as a mole inside the Boston Irish mafia, the other as a mole for the same Irish mafia inside the Boston police force. The story centers around the two moles trying to unmask the other and it's a race to see who gets in first, so to speak. Aaaah, such irony...<br/><br/>With a stellar cast of just super actors, this film just had to turn out right: too many careers were on the line, I think. And, it did turn out right. There's not a false note by any of them, with one exception: I wasn't convinced that Madolyn (Vera Farmiga) as the police psychiatrist could be so stupid to become the lover of both moles. I can suspend my disbelief about a lot of things to carry on with a narrative, but that just doesn't ring true. However, it serves a purpose, as you will find out; and that suggests to me that such artificiality was injected for that very reason. But, I could be wrong...<br/><br/>Generally, it's fast paced, as I implied, but there are a few slow spots for me, mostly to do with Madolyn with the moles. To keep pace with the action, the editing is quite the best I've seen; the sequence when a body lands, from a great distance, on a city street in front of one of the moles in unbelievably precise, timed to the millisecond, but believably gruesome.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson is just superb as the gangster boss, affable yet entirely menacing; Ray Winston  always my favorite gangster  is an excellent sidekick and trusted friend for the boss; Alec Baldwin again shows his implacable nature as one of the police heads, Ellerby  just as affable as the gangster boss, and almost as menacing when needs be; Martin Sheen, as Queenan, the head of the undercover section, brings perhaps the only honest face into the story; and Mark Wahlberg, an actor I've ignored for a long time, gives a very good impression of a terrier that just won't let go  he's actually terrific in the role of Dignam.<br/><br/>As to Di Caprio and Damon, the two young cops: both very accomplished actors and both acquit themselves with very believable portrayals  apart from sharing Madolyn.<br/><br/>The only sour note for me was the closing scene, and I mean the very last shot, as the camera pans across the balcony of an empty apartment to show... Well, I'll let you find out. Tsk, tsk  how banal... and how unnecessary."
"Mr_PCM","8","2","3","3 April 2007"," Very good - but not very Goodfellas
","The Departed is a slow-burning simmering thriller, a tale steeped in deception, and gently, expertly brought to the boil - until a slightly overcooked finish leaving a slightly unsatisfying taste in the mouth.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese's latest is a very well told story by one of the greatest directors of all time, and while the Departed does show exactly why the great man is so highly thought of, it also hints that perhaps he is not quite at the peak of his powers anymore.<br/><br/>The film is good, indeed it is very good, but the Oscars for best picture and director feel more like an apology from the Academy for overlooking Raging Bull, and particularly Goodfellas, rather than just recognition for this film. Yes, nobody does gangster films like Scorsese (unless Coppola wants to continue his Godfather saga), but while many directors would be proud to have 'The Departed' in their filmography, Goodfellas was far superior. The dialogue was sharper, the acting crisper, and the story more flowing.<br/><br/>Yet the Departed remains an enjoyable film. Largely the feeling of two parallel intertwining stories feels very effective, with both Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio providing a great deal of conflict in bringing their lead characters to life. Both are all contradictions - Damon is the cop who is a mole for the mob, and is smooth, charming, but yet somehow slightly bland, whilst DiCaprio as the man from the wrong side of the tracks handpicked for a special undercover assignment as a mole within the mob is a violent thug with a turbulent past but desperate to get his job done. With so much deception, you are never sure who knows what, and, rather appropriately, you feel like rats in a maze. And Scorsese does expertly time the reveals of information and keeps you guessing - but yet something about it feels ever so slightly underwhelming. However the action does heat up nicely towards the final third, with an interesting homage to the original by the use of a scene in Chinatown in Boston, creating some genuine edge-of-the-seat moments, until a rather unexpected conclusion that slightly jars against what has gone before.<br/><br/>The acting however is uniformly excellent. One thing that can be said for Scorsese is that he sure can get the best out of DiCaprio, who here produces work to rival that of his portrayal of Amsterdam in Gangs of New York - another Scorsese picture. Damon however seems to be slightly lacking in charisma, although that does not provide a tremendous problem here. But it is the supporting actors who really steal the show. Jack Nicholson as the crime lord produces an atypically restrained performance - never overacting, and producing a quietly menacing performance, relying on his natural gravitas to still fill the screen whenever he is on it. Martin Sheen is as ever a class act, but the show-stealers are Mark Wahlberg as the intensely unlikeable but committed handler, and Alec Baldwin, who is given precious little screen time, but certainly makes the most of his scenes without scenery-chewing antics like those seen in Glengarry Glen Ross.<br/><br/>Overall, while this is a worthy addition to the Scorsese canon, the unsatisfactory conclusion and some of the slightly unsatisfying reveals make this feel a somewhat inferior cousin to Goodfellas, rather than a true companion. Yet any other director would be proud of this work, and rightly so, as there is a great deal to take pleasure from. Maybe Scorsese just set his own standards too high for anyone, including himself, to live up to."
"karlhinze","8","2","3","1 April 2007"," Let's start with the bad points:
","I think that one or two of the performances from the lead actors were overrated.<br/><br/>Matt Damon, for me, seems to fluctuate between good and bad performances. He was great in The Talented Mr Ripley and The Bourne Identity/Supremacy. But I thought this was one of his worse films. His acting seemed quite wooden and forced, and I don't think he was comfortable in his role of a boyfriend.<br/><br/>I also think that, early on, Jack Nicholson showed his age, although he did improve greatly as the film went on.<br/><br/>On a positive note, Leonardo Di Caprio was outstanding. He's one of the most underrated and best actors around at the moment (he's come a long way since his teenage heart-throb status) and could quite easily have added this to his best actor nomination in the Oscars this year. This film would have struggled if it were not for Di Caprio.<br/><br/>As far as the film in itself goes, I hadn't seen or heard much about the original Hong Kong version and was glad of it, as I could judge this solely on its own merit.<br/><br/>It's thrilling, with so much suspense. Who's going to make a breakthrough first? Costello's men or the Police? I hadn't seen this before the Oscars, and at first I couldn't quite work out how on earth best Motion Picture didn't go to Little Miss Sunshine. But now I can understand why.<br/><br/>All in all, simply brilliant."

It's just unable to live up to the hype and I don't see why it won any award.<br/><br/>Read Bigprisc's excellent comments for a detailed analysis and comparison with the movie upon which The Departed is based.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this movie is Donnie Brasco mixed with Reservoir Dogs. Unfortunately, it's not as good as either. Both of these other movies did better at what they set out to do. Donnie Brasco really delved into the tension and emotions of being undercover. And Reservoir Dogs did a much better job of showing how all the rats turn on each other and no one really winds up coming out ahead. Both of these other movies are at the PEAK of their respective categories. The Departed just can't decide what kind of story it wants to tell and doesn't tell any story convincingly.<br/><br/>What IS good? The editing, the soundtrack, and the acting. Those are all wonderful. But as we all know - there's no way of knowing how much of a role the Director played in those aspects. So there's no way of knowing whether Martin Scorsese truly deserved a nod for this movie, or his award was just a ""lifetime achievement"" award.<br/><br/>If you like ""mob"" films - this is another goodie.

"shattenjager777","6","2","3","27 March 2007"," Both fortunately and unfortunately, it's what we've come to expect from Scorsese
","Martin Scorsese was once one of the world's great filmmakers, but the truth is that he has been rehashing some combination of ""Raging Bull"" and ""Mean Streets"" for the last quarter-century. Even his latter-day masterpiece, ""Goodfellas"" repeats the revisionist gangster themes of ""Mean Streets"" with the visual language of ""Raging Bull"" almost exactly copied. In this way it's unfortunate that ""The Departed"" is more of the same.<br/><br/>However, even in his darkest hours of imagination, Scorsese has always been a competent storyteller whose films are filled with excellent, vibrant performances, spot-on editing and of course his much-revered knack for choosing score material. In this way, it's fortunate that ""The Departed"" is more of the same.<br/><br/>The story is one that inherently involves all of Scorsese's favorite themes: violence, identity, and loyalty. It tells two essentially identical inverted story lines: (Slight spoiler, but no more than the commercials told you) A young man who has grown up learning from gang leader Frank Costello becomes Costello's mole inside the state police and a young man who has grown up surrounded by criminals becomes an undercover police officer who infiltrates Costello's organization (spoiler over). The intertwined stories are perhaps the most interesting part of the film, since this take on narrative is something new to Scorsese's repertoire, but it unfortunately is not handled perfectly. Some of the editing is coarse for no obvious reason and yet Scorsese does not provide us with any visual cues that either show that we are supposed to be confused or help us orient ourselves.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the acting is perfect all the way. Mark Wahlberg may be a one-note actor, but his character is his note. Meanwhile, Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio are excellent in deep, layered roles, though Damon does not have the opportunity DiCaprio does to chew up the screen now and again. Martin Sheen is used perfectly in the type of role we're getting used to him playing. Most importantly, the borderline-campy theatricality and evil of Jack Nicholson is used to absolutely perfect effect in devilishly comic portrayal of an underworld kingpin.<br/><br/>Oddly, one place where the film goes awry is in its use of music. While certainly the Rolling Stones' ""Gimme Shelter"" is used wonderfully, to great effect and absolutely appropriately (almost as well as the instrumental section of Derek and the Dominoes' ""Layla"" in Goodfellas), some of the music was annoyingly distracting. This problem also crept up on Scorsese's last film, ""The Aviator,"" at a few points, which is a disturbing and disheartening trend in the director's career. It almost sounds as if he is trying to insert more ""hip"" music with which he is less familiar (and which he may even like less) and thus is forcing it into place far more than when he uses some of the classic rock anthems and classical standards he has used to such great effect in the past and even in this film. The presence of composer Howard Shore obviously doesn't help, either, as the master of the Very Standard Score delivers the same thing he nearly always does--a bag of clichés.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is worth sitting through once, and probably worth more than that if you're unfamiliar with Scorsese's work. However, it's not much more than that. Watching ""Raging Bull"" (or ""Goodfellas"" or ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" for that matter) again is definitely a better use of one's time. It also certainly wasn't the best picture of the year--""United 93"" was."
"maxime-s-laperle","4","2","3","19 March 2007"," If this movie is better than Goodfellas, barely
","Man, after seeing this three months ago, i thought to myself that the man is finishing what he came up to do in this world, and this is getting pretty pathetic, because the crap is hitting the fan pretty hard. First off, this could be the most shallow film, he has ever done. The only thing that could come up with a certain sense of depth, is the notion of identity. But the movie itself is a train wreck, it is horribly clichéd of every crime movie on the face of this earth since Scarface by H.Hawks; and it only seems that Scorsese cannot reinvent himself in the noir or the neo-noir genre. Goodfellas was one-thousand times as better than this film, in content and aesthetic. But in the mob genre, Casino is the ultimate leading contender. When you think about Scorsese, you normally think of three indisputable masterpieces : Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Gangs of New York.<br/><br/>Man, The Color of Money was way, way better than The Departed. When I watched that movie, it only made me think of the other Clint Eastwood, film that borders the same cinematographic style, Mystic River. And for another turn of events, this Eastwood movie also involves the Boston Irish mob. In the other case, Mystic River, in Eastwood's direction and by the great acting of actors, such as S. Penn and T. Robbins; it makes it all worth while. It always seem that there is a hint a plagiarism, or Scorsese was just uninspired.<br/><br/>The only thing that I can really suggest, is to watch all the movies he did in the past, because the man like Coppola, is just losing his touch. And like Coppola, Scorsese doesn't write his scripts anymore, for the shooting script. And the worst part, is that I love Martin Scorsese. I simply love everything that he does, he is an American Luchino Visconti."

It looks nice, nice framing, setting. Very pretty. 2. Everyone looks so gritty and ""real"", did Leo sleep during production? 3. This ""young Markie Mark"" looks just like the real one - only to find out it is an younger Matt Damon. 4. Let me guess, she'll be having relations with them both of them soon. 5.

I ask a few minutes in. When is the ""head to head"" between the ""two"" protagonist to occur? Oh yes, about 10 minutes before the end I suppose. <br/><br/>However, I think the cuter ""one"" of the ""three"" Mark Walberg will prevail. (Oh, and the better actor than the most of the cast to boot. This includes overrated Jack, who has always irked my Mom, and frankly though I'm no prude hearing him say he barely needs a certain feminine part anymore makes me queasy). Gratuitous.<br/><br/>7. Leo died? really? no surprise knew he would.<br/><br/>8. Knew she would be pregnant and called it- typical vulnerability element thing thrown in. Just thought there would be a violent/bloody miscarriage or something for icing.<br/><br/>So for me this is first predictable and then formulaic. These things don't always annoy me, I can enjoy formula. But this movie was rather tedious and possibly too long for its genre, and I felt that whoever was in the cutting room (the woman who now has Oscar somewhere on her mantle)perhaps was too attached to some scenes to let go.<br/><br/>I also think that this was likely a moneymaker formula as well- a crime drama, Martin Scorcese, and that stellar cast. I'm pretty sure it cost a lot to make movies these days and those doing financing don't want to risk much. I think the times they are and have changed since the 70's.<br/><br/>Or, perhaps some directors have lost their youthful edge, fearlessness and integrity. The drive to have to get out here.<br/><br/>Lastly, <br/><br/>Though formula, Michael Mann would have done it much better and for some reason has peaved me off less...<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>""Raging"" bore"

At the same time, Frank has someone from his group within the police department in order to keep from getting caught and for information. Sooner or later both cops discover each other's presence in each other's groups and a game of cat and mouse occurs as they try to discover each other's identities.<br/><br/>Openers: I knew little to nothing about this movie going in. The only things I knew were that it had a cast I knew I'd enjoy, and a very talented director in Martin Scorsese at the helm. The trailer also looked fantastic. I knew nothing of the movie this was based off of and I didn't know too much concerning the plot. So going into this with a blank slate, I really didn't have any expectations. And the two hours that followed completely blew me away.<br/><br/>The Good: This movie has everything going for it. The previously mentioned superb cast, for starters. Leonardo DiCaprio, who I feel is an underrated actor and gets better with every movie, turns in another stellar performance. Matt Damon gives a good show as well. Jack Nicholson plays himself, once again, but he's entertaining and actually a bit more subdued here so I let it pass. The supporting cast, featuring Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin also do a good job. I really liked Mark Wahlberg's show here too. It's been a long time since he's been ""Marky Mark"" and he's showing a lot of acting skill in there. The directing was nice, the pacing was excellent and the story was wonderful. This movie doesn't shy away from the red stuff, which is another good thing. Lots of bloody headshots, a fall that ends terribly are some of the highlights. The blood actually adds to the story, rather than detract for the sake of it. Also this movie has a lot of quotable lines, and a lot of tension that will have you on the edge of your seat. I know I was.<br/><br/>The Bad: Not a bad thing. Nitpicking, you could say the movie runs long, but you never notice. I couldn't find any faults with this movie. <br/><br/>The Ugly: The previously mentioned redness would go here, otherwise this one remains blank as well.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: I had to wait awhile to review this just so I could do it objectively. And looking back I still cannot see any faults and think this is just an awesome movie. The Departed is hands down, my choice for the movie of the year.

","The man spawned legions of imitators and followers, some good, some bad, and some terrible. His style is unrivaled, his violence over the top, his language, coloured, but his expertise, unparalleled. The man has never been recognized by the Academy, and for a crime like that there are no words. But what the man does best is not win awards; it's the gangster movies. And oh how long it's been since we saw one.<br/><br/>Martin Scorcese is back in the vein that made him great, the vein where he revealed a whole new style of film making, a style imitated by many young talents in the industry today, such as Quentin Tarantino. He's respected like no other, and he shows why in his latest gangster movie, his first in 10 years, 2006's masterpiece ""The Departed"".<br/><br/>Starring a cast that fires on all cylinders, never slacking in any department, it is a remake of the Hong Kong thriller ""Infernal Affairs"", transposed to a Bostonian setting in which gang business plagues the city, and investigations on the reigning crime lord, Frank Costello (expertley portrayed by Jack Nicholson in a scene-stealing role), always seem to turn up empty. Enter new State Police officer Billy Costigan (an Award deserving Leonardo di Caprio), a man with a troubled past. His assignment: to lose himself in the world of organized crime and become an undercover unit in Costello's gang.<br/><br/>However, not is all as it seems, with Costello having his own spy within the State Police, a rat of a cop, Colin Sullivan (well played by Matt Damon) who is sent to find the undercover within Costello's crew.<br/><br/>It's a deadly game of cat and mouse, where one false move could mean certain death for either party involved.<br/><br/>The story is excellent and engrossing, but the real star here is not only the actors, but the style. That's Scorcese's bread and butter: the style. Expertly cut and crafted, every shot seems as though it's cool, without even being overly remarkable.<br/><br/>Martin Scorcese has been dabbling in styles unfamiliar to him. While well respected by the Academy (though still never winning, I believe John Stweart summed it up best) it was a departure from his career making mold. This isn't always a bad thing, as Steven Spielberg has slowly undergone a metamorphosis into a very different director than he began as, however, for Scorcese, his newer movies just didn't feel right.<br/><br/>All that changes with ""The Departed"". A crowning achievement for the dismal year of 2006, and definitely a contender at Oscar time.<br/><br/>Perhaps maybe, justice will be served, and Scorcese will finally get his due. Either way, the man remains the best at what he does; and that is, whatever he wants."

","Scorsese fans probably won't be disappointed by this Boston Irish gangster movie, alas, the storyline really isn't up to par. The principle actors make this movie far better than it has a right to be, (that's what one expects good actors to do for just about any film). The plot line seems muddled. There seems to be a lack of motivation for anyone to do anything except beat the crap out of each other, swear, and shoot people for the hell of it. Several principle actors manage to live through moments they should have been killed only to wind up dying later on. Whomever wrote the screenplay seems to have a serious fetish for depicting people's heads getting blown off. The movie leaves me wondering if I'm supposed to see it as just another rip-off of every modern mobster movie since Goodfellas, or if I'm supposed to just embrace that emptiness of not knowing what the point of the movie really was."

DiCaprio's race to uncover the mole who jeopardises his identity and indeed his life is truly nail-biting.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson's performance is electrifying, perhaps soaring higher than his role as Jack Torrance in The Shining. (Particularly in the scene where he enacts a rat gnawing at cheese)<br/><br/>The final scenes & the comedic reference to the rat which scurries along the building is one of the reasons why this film delivers on every level.

That is certainly not lacking here. The Korean original is much shorter, more efficient and intensive, while Scorsese has made his version as long and tedious as possible. There is very little action the first two hours, and mainly only talk and paranoid intrigue. But the worst thing is the language. The word ""f..k"" occurs in almost every sentence and at least in every scene. This extremely base and vulgar language with very little vocabulary and mainly used aggressively in constant outbreaks of anger and violence ruins the film and makes it deplorably void of style. Of what use then is the brilliant technique, the excellent actors and the splendid direction, if the film is just 2,5 hours of brutal criminality, atrocious violence, constant massacres and only foul language?

","The crime epic to end all crime epics- The Departed. The Departed marks Scorsese's return to gangster cinema, 15 years after his genre-defining Goodfellas. This time however, the scene is moved to Boston, the focus on the Irish mob. Two young cadets graduating from the academy; one a devoted law enforcement officer joining the state police undercover unit. The other, a mole from the mob who answers directly to Irish underworld kingpin Frank Costello, his mentor and father figure. <br/><br/>It isn't long before both organizations start to suspect a rat in their midst. The real tension and excitement of the film stems from the two men's circular game of cat and mouse, as they each try to smoke the other out while simultaneously attempting to remain anonymous to their colleagues and each other. It gives a the film an ever-present, immediate sense of dread, particularly for Dicaprio's character which I see as kind of the answer to the typical undercover cop character; it's not some glamorous, slick job, it's stressful as hell! The film gives a more realistic view on what kind of toll that would take on a person, with life on death on the line every minute of every day and no time to cope with it. <br/><br/>None of that to say the film is ""arty"", which it ain't! It's a bloody, coarse, lurid mess of a picture... in the most complimentary sense. While the film has more atmospheric tension, and is more plot driven than some of Scorsese's earlier work, there's still buckets of gore, plenty of shock value and some amusing soundtrack choices for some of the more grisly moments. <br/><br/>Still, I wouldn't say I liked everything about The Departed, and wouldn't consider it in masterpiece territory. Some aspects of the film, and some of the characters I found less believable than others. And I thought Nicholson's character began verging on cartoonish towards the end. However, the film is an excellent showcase for Leonardo Dicaprio, who is electrifying in his frenzied, panicked state, as well as in his dialogues with Costello. While the film is clearly very much an ensemble piece, I would call him the standout.<br/><br/>The Departed is a very good mob film. There're elements of it that have been done before, but the film's particular brand of rawness and high-octane tension elevate it above just another study/comparison of cops/criminals.

","In The Departed, Martin Scorsese makes his return to the mob underworld, and he does it with a thrilling intensity that overshadows his previous films. From the start, to the closing credits, The Departed is an incredibly exciting film, and there is rarely a slow moment. Unlike GoodFellas and Casino, the characters were written in a way that makes the viewer relate to them in a very personal way. Their trials and struggles make them very human, and I found myself very emotionally involved, hoping for the best for the major characters. Speaking of characters, give credit to the acting cast for filling the roles emotionally and intensely. DiCaprio and Damon were excellent in the lead roles, but Baldwin and Wahlberg were an absolute joy to watch as supporting characters. While the writing was intense, I sometimes felt that the plot had no central point, and it seemed to go on and on without resolve. It is sure to keep the audience guessing, but at times this was frustrating and I wanted to know more that wasn't being given to me. The finale, while intense to say the least, didn't fill all the holes created throughout the film, and is sure to leave many questions with viewers. I would go as far to say the acting is some of the best I've seen though, and if you're a classic Scorsese fan, this is definitely a movie well worth your time."
"classicsoncall","9","1","1","2 February 2013"," ""Heaven holds the faithful departed.""
","With it's inventive twists and clever writing, I found ""The Departed"" to be an exceptional gangster film, with a couple of undercover rats (Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio) working against each other on opposite sides of the law. For films like this I find it helpful to keep a scorecard, because after a while things start to get a little confusing regarding alliances, and every new revelation becomes a 'whoa' moment. Like learning that Irish Mafia chieftain Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) is working the other side of the tracks as an FBI informant. And speaking of rats and Nicholson, did you get a load of that rodent impersonation he did? That was so priceless I had to do a couple of quick re-winds just to catch it more than once. It was one of those Nicholson 'Here's Johnny' moments that just cracked me up when I saw it.<br/><br/>Storywise, I'm not naive enough to think this one was entirely credible; I happen to agree with other reviewers who call into question Billy's (DiCaprio) light speed infiltration of Costello's mob and the less than professional conduct of counselor Madolyn (Vera Farmiga) when she conducts an affair with Billy. But those are minor points I'm willing to overlook in the bigger picture. What I was more intrigued by were the double crosses throughout the story and nuances like the cat and mouse text messaging that clued Colin Sullivan (Damon) that Costello's gang had an informer on the inside. Very slick.<br/><br/>Anyway, I like a good gangster flick and the characters and portrayals here are top notch. I especially liked Nicholson even if he didn't make it to the end of the picture. The finish will drop your jaw not once, not twice, but three times with it's unexpected turns, and will make you retrace your steps to reassemble the characters and their alliances. I thought it was very well done."

","This has enough violence and gritty street stuff to be another intriguing descent into the world of crime and punishment for Scorsese and his blend of attractive brutality, but it is vastly overrated. It can be confusing and less than engaging as its myriad of mobsters and cops parade in and out of frame with varying results of believability. <br/><br/>The acting and characterizations are all over the place with wide ranges of volume and machismo. One example is that the affairs of the heart here are never founded and come across as less than real. Take the scene in the restaurant. Is that for one minute real with its forced laughter? Or the bedroom/sex scene. <br/><br/>It is a movie that seems full of itself rather than full. The complexities are so twisted and run by so fast that its hard to keep up with it all. It could be that the pacing is such to give it that dizzying feeling of being trapped like a rat in the bowels of the beast, but its breathless energy sucks the life out of the story and its just whiz-bang, bang, bang, bang.<br/><br/>While not without its attractions of audacious anarchy, and it delivers so much that it is hard not to get involved in the goings-on. But the Director has made many better films and one cannot get the feeling that the adulation for this one is misplaced or in place of past disregards."

The ""villain"" is losing his taste for crime; the undercover cop carries out his mission not for justice, but to get his civilian liberty back; and the undercover mole doesn't care about anything but getting his dick wet and keeping his head above water.<br/><br/>Despite their lukewarm characters, Leonardo DiCaprio (who I normally hate) and Jack Nicholson give outstanding performances - and watching them is what makes this movie worth watching at all. DiCaprio downplays his anxiety at being a fake criminal with expert grace and subtlety. Jack is ever cool and commanding - a prince among thugs. Watch for his trademark speak-singing."

","Martin Scorsese's crime thriller ""The Departed"" doesn't look like the typical Scorsese crime thriller because virtually everybody in it hasn't worked with him. This brilliant multi-faceted melodrama about the tooth and nail struggle to jail a well-known criminal boasts several surprises, primarily at the end and a number of sensational performances, with Jack Nicholson ably cast as Boston crime boss Frank Costello taking top honors. DeCaprio is cast as an undercover cop straight out of the academy who joins Costello's mob, while Costello grooms Matt Damon as his snitch inside the department. This cat & mouse thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat as one mole in the mob circles another mole in the police, and Scorsese and scenarist William Monahan patiently construct this elaborate complex thriller without wearing out their welcome. A must-see for die-hard Scorsese fans as much as crime movie fanatics!"

","IMDb Top 250: 58<br/><br/>The Departed is like Goodfellas for the next decade. It has crime, music, and Scorcese at the reigns. While it cannot replicate the magic of Goodfellas, which will never happen, The Departed tells a different kind of crime story with great success.<br/><br/>If you didn't know, The Departed is about the Irish mafia in Boston shown from both sides of the law. The tale is quickly paced, with lots of angry looking men. There's several twists and unexpected moments that will affect you in various ways. Gritty and violent, The Departed gets in your face.<br/><br/>The film centers on men who are on both sides of the law, or so it appears. DiCaprio is excellent as Bill, a rookie cop in a family with a history of crime, who is sent undercover. His anger is very well conveyed. Leo does a great job. He is backed by Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg). Sheen may be the only reasonable person in the entire film, and he's a good foil for the vulgar Digham, played well by Wahlberg, who acted from experience. They're all going after Costello, in another superb performance, this one by Jack Nicholson. He's a little crazy, and a great villain. His informant in the police is Sullivan, played by a mostly straight Matt Damon. He does the role justice, but doesn't stand out.<br/><br/>This is very evidently a Scorcese picture. Great shots, including a cool intro with Costello where his face is just out of the light until the reveal. The pace is fast, and the film is well edited. Music accompanies, but ends abruptly, or is nearly silenced. It doesn't work as well as Goodfellas or Casino. For some reason, Gimme Shelter is played- twice, as is the most- fitting Shipping Up to Boston.<br/><br/>Crime fans and fans of Scorcese need to see this, and those who can stomach the brutal violence and copious amounts of swearing should see why this won Best Picture. Serious men indeed. 8.6/10"

","I expected a lot from this movie based on its high IMDb rating and big names on both side of the camera but it just didn't work. Most it comes down to lazy execution; average acting, directing and script writing from people you expect better. This movie should have been a tense mole-hunt thriller but there was no attempt to give the viewer any suspense. There were no surprises and no reason to care about the fate of any of the characters. As if that wasn't enough, the soundtrack did nothing to help the atmosphere of the movie and the ending was rather unsatisfying. I wouldn't go so far as to recommend avoiding this movie - just don't expect anything great. Not a patch on the Hong Kong original."

Nicholson, well, he's playing his typical bad guy role but with extra gusto. Damon was pretty good as well.<br/><br/>The selection of music was perfect for each scene.

","The Departed is another classic Martin Scorsese film that can be put near the top of his organized crime genre set that includes Casino and Goodfellas. The plot of a young lad named Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) taken under the wing of a Boston Irish mob boss, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) grooms young Colin to infiltrate the Massachusetts State Police, becoming one of their own and providing the mob with an inside connection or mole. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a young, soon to be academy graduate of the Massachusetts State Police, when approached to serve them by going undercover into the Irish mob. Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Staff Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) convince Billy this is his best opportunity with his family ties to organized crime. This begins the chase of finding who the mole in each organization is, while Billy and Colin struggle with their own identities. The theme is that of identity and how one fits into their surroundings. When Colin was molded as a young boy by Frank, he had a newly discovered identity. Colin is first portrayed as an innocent well mannered boy. The same can be said about Billy, who believed that he was nothing like his father or uncle as he searched for his own identity, which was eventually stripped by Colin. Billy's search for his own identity is similar in what Kane pursues in Citizen Kane. The father-son relationship between Colin and Frank is a motif throughout the movie. The father like relationship between Frank and Billy is evident as the film progresses, not to the extent as Colin's relationship with Frank, but close. Colin calls Frank 'Dad' when speaking with him in cover while at work. Captain Queenan and Billy portray a father-son relationship as well, Billy trusts Queenan with protecting his identity. The lighting in the film was outstanding. The opening scenes with Frank use some high contrast with many different lighting angles for depth. Keeping the foreground of Frank's face very dark with a vibrant background was great. This keeps us guessing on what physical characteristics he may have, which ties into the theme of identity. The theme of identity has many different layers between the characters, as one identity is established another is questioned. The flow of action from scene to scene and the characters relationships tie well with theme. A movie well done!"
"bobsgrock","Null","1","1","15 January 2011"," Return to form, return to greatness.
","Martin Scorsese has long been seen as one of, if not the, great American film directors. Film after film, he has continued to explore new pathways and areas of both cinematic and storytelling greatness in classic films that have stood the test of time. The Departed is such a film.<br/><br/>This was Scorsese's most mainstream film to date (it has since been replaced by Shutter Island), and it featured an all-star cast that very few directors could ever pull together. All gave standout performances, particularly Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon. They are the key characters; everything goes through them and Scorsese uses close-ups of their respective faces to emphasize and emulate all the feelings and ideas he is presenting. With that in mind, they both are very convincing with the Boston accents, with the constant profane interactions and the extreme deviousness. Perhaps because they are both professional liars some viewers tend to criticize them more harshly; it can be difficult to feel empathetic for someone not necessarily true to themselves.<br/><br/>The main underlying theme here is one Scorsese has tapped into again and again: guilt. Ever since his first film, Who's That Knocking at My Door? in which Harvey Keitel played a young man wary of his relationship with his girlfriend after finding out she was raped, the notion of guilt and its relation to faithfulness to the Catholic Church has dominated Scorsese's mode of thought. Here, guilt lies on all the characters. Each of them completely embody the new life they are to now acquire. Colin Sullivan (Damon) is a clean-cut kid with an immaculate record as well as a former gangster turned State Police sergeant. He is the perfect tool for Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) to use to keep the cops on their toes and his business alive. On the flip side, Billy Costigan(DiCaprio) is a kid with family connections to South Boston gangsters attempting to make it into the State Police. He is assigned to inform for the police into Costello's organization. Right from the get-go, Scorsese establishes the pain and pressure these two will face in regards to their professional compromise.<br/><br/>Another buried element here is the idea of identity. What exactly is it to these men? What is their true identity and how can they get it back? Because Sullivan and Costigan spend so much time pretending to be what they are not, eventually they get caught up in attempting to succeed at a job that isn't really theirs. In some ways, Scorsese creates an atmosphere that is deliberately contrary to that of his 1990 masterpiece Goodfellas. In that film, everything rested on the joy Henry Hill had in committing crime and living the mafia life. Here, these emotions must be subdued, lest someone get caught and possibly murdered.<br/><br/>In the end, I believe this is one of Scorsese's best films along with Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, After Hours, Goodfellas and The Age of Innocence. All of the aforementioned films tell stories of men conflicted with living how they are told and how they are able to. Here, Costigan and Sullivan symbolize that. On top of all the underlying themes, this is just a very well-made cop and gangster picture. The acting is superb, the editing is so sharp and jolting so as to keep the tension and suspense alive, the cinematography greatly captures the tender living conditions in Boston, and of course Scorsese's Oscar-winning direction corrals everything together to create one gloriously entertaining film. It is a return to classic Scorsese form as well as Scorsese greatness."

","Although I'm several years late watching The Departed, I was impressed by how real the film holds up, despite time travel. Brutal language, violence, Boston accents, and culture, and the evil conflicts between the Boston and Providence RI mob gangs, creates an unforgettable Scorsese film. Particularly interesting is the birds eye view of the Massachusetts Police Academy, with anecdotes of how people inside law enforcement live seemingly ordinary lives while dealing with the worst evil crime syndicates in the US. DiCaprio is absolutely at his best playing the conflicted undercover PD agent Billy Costigan, who tries to win the confidence of his mob boss (Jack Nicholson) while keeping his undercover identity secret. At cross purposes is Matt Damon, who is doing the complete opposite, as PD officer Colin Sullivan, who tries to keep the confidence of his precinct boss Captain Queenan played by Martin Sheehan. In fact, Sullivan is double crossing his public trust by keeping the mob led by Jack Nicholson's character Frank Costello, in the business of murder and extortion. The Departed is an adult film, period. Nonetheless, performances by the main cast are extraordinary - note Alec Baldwin who holds the viewers attention as a PD facilitator and instructor for the plot to uncover the undercover agents. There isn't another actor I know of who could execute this minor but bridge building role other than Baldwin. Nicholson's evil intentions carry this film's graphic plot, because his performance as a crime boss is totally convincing. Otherwise, Vera Farmiga is a somewhat ambiguous character who is not exactly likable, but she brings the cruel pieces together in the end, so to speak. I would give The Departed a rating of 10, except I did not like the counseling scenes with DiCaprio and Farmiga - they were not realistic. Yet, I believe, The Departed will stand the test of time as one of Scorsese's best films and a great cultural description of America's syndicated crime culture."

"eastbergholt2002","8","1","1","25 March 2007"," Entertaining Gangster Movie
","If you like Scorsese you will definitely enjoy this movie. For those like me who are less convinced of his genius, it is still an entertaining gangster movie. Many critics voted this as the best movie made in 2006. The film is well-made but I have always failed to understand his Scorsese's films are so loved by critics. I know cops and I've worked with the Russian mob and the characters in Scorsese's movies have always seemed phony to me. <br/><br/>Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) and William Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) are Boston police officers. Costigan agrees to go undercover to catch local crime boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Costello runs a protection racket and sells drugs. Some of Costigan's family members have a background in crime, so he is accepted into the gang. Sullivan has known Costello since childhood and becomes his mole in the police department. Costello's tips allow Sullivan achieve accelerated promotion and become the superstar of the police department. Damon and DiCaprio spend most of the film trying to unmask each other. They also become involved with the same woman (Vera Farmiga), a therapist.<br/><br/>In Scorsese's world everyone men are macho sociopaths. There is plenty of high decibel screaming and swearing. His characters don't mind killing and torturing and violence is just another form of communication. Women are either whores or mothers or like Vera Farmiga's character they act like both. The cops and villains seem interchangeable. In fact half the thugs seem to be working for some government agency. Police Captain Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) seems to be the only normal guy in the movie. The police behavior is occasionally so extreme that the movie loses credibility. Sullivan's boss, Alec Baldwin, beats up a police technician because he makes a mistake. Sergeant Digham (Mark Wahlberg)abuses everyone and gets into fisticuffs with both Damon and DiCaprio who are supposed to be on his side. <br/><br/>Sullivan seems to be in it for the money, but none of his colleagues questions how a police officer in his twenties can afford to live in a large expensive apartment in the Beacon Hill area of Boston. It's not clear why DiCaprio, with a 1400 SAT score, would agree to go undercover and mix with psychos for an indefinite period. The movie has a cast of superstars, but Damon and DiCaprio both seem a little too familiar and congenial to be believable tough guys. Nicholson looked as if he had wandered in from a romantic comedy. He seemed too old and lacked the menace the part demanded. DiCaprio gives a one note performance as a grim, angry man. That said, if you like crime dramas you will be entertained. There is plenty of action and the actors ham it up to attract your attention."
"tfrizzell","Null","1","1","24 December 2006"," Say Cheese!!!---Rat Traps.
","Director Martin Scorsese gets back to the seamy mean streets of metropolitan America after a decade-long hiatus that took place after ""Casino"" was released in 1995 with this fiery and mean-spirited masterpiece that focuses on double agents attempting to infiltrate the inner-most sectors of those very groups they want to take down. Matt Damon is the bad guy in deep with the Massachusetts State Police and Leonardo DiCaprio is our hero who may drown in an abyss of crime and wrongdoings with sadistic Irish Mafia crime boss Jack Nicholson. We have law enforcement officials galore (Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen), evil henchmen (led by Ray Winstone) and even a female element (in psychiatrist Vera Farmiga, who gets torn between Damon and DiCaprio herself) in the tangled and winding mixture. William Monahan's script rises above most all other film noir-styled classics of the genre mainly due to the overwhelming star-power (led by Nicholson in arguably his best role since ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"") and of course Scorsese's out of this world talents as a legendary American film-maker. Fast-moving, tense and devastatingly brilliant in most every way, ""The Departed"" is easily one of Scorsese's finest efforts and quite possibly the best film of 2006. Based on a Hong Kong product (titled ""Infernal Affairs"") of the same translation from 2002. 5 stars out of 5."
"pasha25","9","1","1","9 November 2006"," Another great from Scorcese
","A great movie I thought that picked up pace more towards the end of the film. The acting particularly from Dicaprio was great, in particular the scene where he meets the shrink and the moments he tries convincing Costello that he is not a mole. Jack Nicholson played his character fairly convincingly. Despite not having the same menacing demeanour that Pauli's character portrayed in Goodfellas, Costello did look very much like the 'should be retired' rough and mean looking gangster in his own laid back way. I should have guessed Mark Wahlberg's character was still out there at large. He had a big mouth in the film and played the annoying and to some extent a crooked cop well. I totally did not see the ending coming, the twists in the end did not match my guesses but were a welcome shock in the end. Another great film from Scorcese, although Goodfellas still keeps this one in the shadows."

"pocilja","6","1","1","5 November 2006"," Fair, but nothing spectacular
","The Departed left me cold, much as many in the movie end up. It was fair, but fell far short of the hype that has been heaped on this flick. Plodding in the middle, with a lot of unnecessary exposition, the movie is too long - perhaps a sign of Scorcese's age. It is nowhere near the level of Casino or Goodfellas, but the plot is interesting. The last 25 mins make the movie exciting. Unfortunately, it closes on a note that makes me question what the actual point was. Acting was generally good. Nicholson, DiCaprio and Damon turn in decent performances (especially DiCaprio, who I doubted could pull off a tough-guy role). Wahlberg's character is extremely irritating and unrealistic. There is no way that a character like his would be present in such a high-ranking position at the state police level. Sorry - people just don't talk like that. I didn't find the movie any more violent than any of the director's previous work (perhaps even less so). However, a major problem I have is that the movie goes out of its way to be VULGAR. I found it quite tasteless and it detracted from my enjoyment of the film. There was a lot of nasty sexual talk in reference to women, etc that not only made it difficult to enjoy with my girlfriend, but felt unnatural. There is also plenty of racial humor to throw around which could possibly be overlooked for the sake of realism, but in light of all the potty mouths also comes off as a bit much. No better than your average misogynistic rap video, I hate to say it, but I don't think this should've been released as an R. It is worse than that. With its decent acting, witty lines and intensity nearly derailed by it's vulgarity, watch and weep for the end of taste in Western cinema."
"dr_foreman","6","1","1","3 November 2006"," One-third as good as Donnie Brasco
","I guess film critics and movie buffs are going to give four stars to any old Scorcese-directed gangster movie, huh? Even ones that don't deserve four stars, like ""The Departed."" <br/><br/>I must admit that it's not a bad film, by any means. The performances are mostly solid, the Boston setting is unique and interesting, and there are some genuinely suspenseful scenes. But, on the other hand, there are also plenty of scenes that feel either completely unbelievable, or totally flat, or a noxious combination of both.<br/><br/>The plot, which gets needlessly convoluted at times, involves a mob ""mole"" in the police department and his counterpart, a police ""rat"" in the mafia. Apparently, it's based on a Chinese film called ""Internal Affairs,"" but I've never seen that movie so I can't make any valid comparisons.<br/><br/>Personally, I couldn't stop thinking about ""Donnie Brasco,"" the similar Johnny Depp/Al Pacino movie about a rat in the mafia. That film contained genuine emotion, complex character relationships, realism... all qualities that are pretty much absent from ""The Departed,"" which feels like an unrealistic Hollywood production all the way. The only apparent advantage that ""The Departed"" boasts is that it has a trendier director than ""Donnie Brasco."" But I think Scorcese pretty much drops the ball in this case and doesn't deserve to be automatically credited as a genius - just how cutesy and self-indulgent is the last shot of ""The Departed,"" anyway? <br/><br/>Some people complain about Jack Nicholson's performance, but it didn't really bother me. His scenery-chewing is a nice change of pace from watching DiCaprio and Damon act all earnest and depressed all the time. (Incidentally, I also thought Mark Wahlberg's foul-mouthed cop was very funny and entertaining.) The real weak link in the acting chain is Vera Farminga as the love interest. She's supposedly a psychiatrist, but she gets so emotional and confrontational with her patients that she completely fails to come across as a professional. She's also a bit insipid and doesn't really have chemistry with DiCaprio or Damon.<br/><br/>My other major gripe with the film is that the editing is often choppy and strange. Scorcese doesn't linger long enough in most of the scenes - he simply dives into the middle of the action, and jumps out again as quickly as possible. This MTV-style editing doesn't really enable me to get immersed in a movie. And some of his choppy little scenes are downright bizarre and don't seem to fit in the movie (like the weird one where Nicholson goes to the opera.) <br/><br/>I suppose that modern films are so bad that critics freak out when a remotely competent movie like ""The Departed"" shows up in theaters. It's a welcome relief from movies about CGI animals and superheroes, sure. But is it really a masterpiece? A top 100 movie on IMDb? Hardly."

All in all, I'd say it's a great film... great great great!<br/><br/>The film's cast scintillated each character. I could not think of any other actor playing Leonardo's role. Di Caprio is indeed the most underrated actor in Hollywood today. Yes, he's dubbed as a great actor, but no recognition was given to him yet.

I was NOT disappointed...This move has to be the best movie I have seen this year.<br/><br/>The move starts off in the childhood of Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), you see him in a supermarket and you see Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) going into the supermarket collecting his dues from the bookies. You see him later on meeting up with Frank right after graduating from The Police Academy. You see him again later on getting accepted into the top branch of the Police. You also see Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) failing to join that unit. Throughout the whole movie you see Colin receiving and making calls to Frank informing him of the latest things going on in the Police.

","What an overrated filmmaker Scorsese is. I have just seen the film and I was tempted to quit all the way through. This film must be one of the worst film Scorsese has ever made. Worst than the Aviator and yes, even worst then the Age of Innocence, which had put to sleep. The problem it seems is that Scorsese does not know anymore what makes a good script. The script here is simply terrible. It seems a patched up affair of ""yeah I like this lets put it in"" or ""yes this looks good, lets do it"". The plot does not follow any logic and worst of all the film and its characters are totally unbelievable like the police shrink who is supposed to love Damon's character and then suddenly, oops, has a quickie with the other ""rat"" in the film DiCaprio's character, what a small world we live in, eh? Then of course, everybody plays double games, everybody is corrupt and so on all for the sake of convenience and because it sounds good and NOT because the script demands it! The script looks as if it has been written by a film school student. Then of course we come to Scorsese handling of the material and that of course, disappoints too. For the first half of the movie we hare subjected to a mean loud disco music which make the dialogue barely audible but is the overall feel of the film which lacks any class and timing, which is what you would expect from a filmmaker who goes by the name Martin Scorsese.There are simply a ton of bad film-making decisions in this film, too many to tell, think of the final rock song in Gangs of New York, totally out of contest and multiply it by ten. I only save the cast, here Scorsese has cast everyone competently and they all perform to a very good standard for the top actors that they are. My only doubt there being the casting of Walberg in a role where I would have seen better suited an older actor. The soundtrack might do good business and no doubt people who like mindless violence and no plot might find something in this but otherwise don't bother. Not a good movie."
"coolfortheone","10","1","1","27 October 2006"," The Departed
","Yeah so everyone who knows anything about movies has heard the fuss being made over the new Martin Scorsese movie The Departed starring Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Matt Damon. Many critics are saying it is Scorsese's best directed movie since the 1990's classic Goodfellas, and it deserves to sweep the Oscars this year. I have had the pleasure of seeing it twice during its opening weekend and I strongly agree with the above praise.<br/><br/>The Departed is an American re-telling of a Hong Kong movie Infernal Affairs and it has a very complex plot but here is a general summary from IMDb. ""In South Boston, the state police force is waging war on Irish-American organized crime. Young undercover cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio giving some of his best work to date) is assigned to infiltrate the mob syndicate run by gangland chief Frank Costello (the legendary Jack Nicholson). While Billy quickly gains Costello's confidence, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon, also at his finest) a hardened young criminal who has infiltrated the police department as an informer for the syndicate, is rising to a position of power in the Special Investigation Unit. Each man becomes deeply consumed by his double life, gathering information about the plans and counter-plans of the operations he has penetrated. But when it becomes clear to both the mob and the police that there's a mole in their midst, Billy and Colin are suddenly in danger of being caught and exposed to the enemy-and each must race to uncover the identity of the other man in time to save himself. But is either willing to turn on the friends and comrades they've made during their long stints undercover?"" Like I said above it is a very complex story, which is fitting because the two moles in each organization lead very complex lives. It is a thematically rich yet wildly entertaining movie about honor, duty, loyalty, and identity. It is not just an action/crime flick. The movie breezes by at a pace that feels like much less then its 2 hour and 30 minute running time. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers the best acting performance in the film and once again proves he is one of the finest actors of his generation. The terrific acting from the entire cast (also including Martin Sheen, Mark Whalberg, and Alec Baldwin), sharp screenplay written by William Monahan, and Martin Scorsese's brilliant direction make The Departed a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Scorsese is one of the very best American directors of all time. With this film he is exploring the gritty mobster territory that got him recognized over 30 years ago with his breakout hit Mean Streets (1973), yet at the same time telling a fresh and interesting story to make The Departed unique from his other work (unlike 1995's Casino which is basically just a Goodfellas ripÂ–off). I really think he will finally get a long overdue Oscar for best directing, an award he should have received multiple times in the past. The Departed will continue to be discussed in film circles for the next few months until Oscar night comes around, here is hoping it will dominate the ceremonies. It is one of the best films of the current decade as well as one of Scorsese's best films."

","in the end i guess it turns out costello was an Fbi informer. but who the hell did he inform on? wasn't he at the top of the mob? and if not who was above him? it doesn't make any sense. and who was that guy who shot dicaprio at the end? where did he come from? and why did he shoot the black cop? was it important for the fully understanding of the plot? and if he helped daimon, why did he shoot him after wards? i think these questions are important to fully understanding what the film is about. not explaining these details is unfair to the audience. i would love it if someone will explain that to me. i really loved the movie but not knowing these details kind of ruined it for me. thanks in advance."

"andre-250","9","1","1","19 October 2006"," Finally...the Scorcese I like
","What can I say about this movie? Well for starters I haven't watched anything that stands less than a mile from this movie for quite some time. Scorcese is back with a vengeance and for all those people who loved Casino and Goodfellas, I have three words for you: watch it NOW!! Scorcese somewhat deviated slightly from the habitual Italian mafia movie style in the sense that the film is based on the Irish organised crime in Boston. Having said that, mafia is always mafia and if you're turned on by ruthless killings, major drug deals and gangster etiquette, this is the right film for you.<br/><br/>The story line is very gripping and the ending gives credit to its master mind. I expected something more when it came to the dialogues between characters, however that's just me wishing that De Niro was part of the crew...everything else is just perfect."
"tcweyers35","6","1","1","16 October 2006"," A Film that was So Close and Yet so Far from Perfection.
","The only reason I gave this movie a 6 is because of three people. The first two are Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin. They are entertaining, fun, and terrific. Their acting in this film is worth half the price of admission. The other half comes from Leonardo DiCaprio. I truly believe that he is the greatest actor of the last two decades. Morgan Freeman and Russell Crowe give him a run, but he takes the award. He is perfect in this movie. I have to spoil it here by saying that the moment he is eliminated from the film, it is over. The whole thing goes downhill. Scorsese is a great director, and he is great for two hours and fifteen minutes of this film. It is solely the ending that ruins this movie. It is almost as if he quit directing and just said F it and shoot everybody in the head...boom, over, role credits. There are so many things left unanswered in this film. I remember looking over at my brother at the two hour mark and saying, ""Wow, this is fantastic."" And at the end of the film I looked at him and said, ""This is going to upset me the rest of the night."" This had all the makings of being the best film I have ever seen, and the ending seriously ruined it. I don't blame Scorsese completely, I truly believe this is the direct relation to horrible screen writing. I could go on forever about how this ending ruined a great movie, but I will focus on the positives. The main positive is Leonardo. I can't stress enough that he is the real deal and deserves a statue soon. He won't get it for this, but I believe he will at some point. Also, the female lead in this..Vera Farmiga...is beautiful and fun to watch, but her character was filled with holes. She is unexplored and yet she is suppose to be important. She is left with an unopened envelope from DiCaprio's character and a baby that we don't know who the father is. Not to mention, she is week at her profession for all the education credits she seems to have. Like I said, I don't understand how such a great movie can have so many holes and a horrible ending. I am not an expert and this is just my opinion, but I hope the DVD releases an alternate ending that explains some things. I would spend the money on the Director's Cut just to find out. We can all hope."
"gcarreon","6","1","1","15 October 2006"," Not the Best Movie Ever
","First, I like to comment on the brilliant performance by Leonardo DiCarpio and Jack Nicholson. I'm not a film critic, but DiCarpio and Nicholson had the best lines and the best scenes in the whole movie. The scene in the restaurant where Leonardo pleads his case that he is not the ""rat"", while Jack Nicholson sniffs his wine glass, eats a bug, and pulls a gun out on DiCarpio was entertaining, gripping, and climatic. Mark Wahlberg also put in a great performance with the limited facetime he received in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie had twisting plots that at times confused me, especially at the beginning where I actually didn't know if DiCarpio was undercover or not. The scenes that he busted up the two guys in the store and him selling cocaine with his cousin probably was the reason why I was confused for so long. I know that some movies are not suppose to be spoonfeed to the audience and sometimes it takes mentally looking back at scenes to figure details out. This I don't mind at all, it's rather interesting.<br/><br/>Overall it was a good movie, I don't give it the credit that many give it because the past week I was hearing it was Scorsese's best film, but it was lacking what films like Goodfellas, Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, and Raging Bull had. What I'm saying is that the movies I mention above had the street elements involved which in turn described how the characters grew up and acted like they were. This movie didn't have that, it had the accents, but I feel it lacked the quality neighborhood addage that many of Scorsese's films have.<br/><br/>I do recommend this movie, it has some of the best current actors at or near their peaks. You may want to keep the children and wife away though."
"clouded_eye","8","1","1","14 October 2006"," Wow!!!
","This is hands-down Scorcese's best film since Casino. I was amazed.<br/><br/>Not only at the great storytelling, but at the performances as well. I am No fan of either Leonardo DiCaprio or Mark Wahlberg, but they both gave excellent performances. Again, amazed.<br/><br/>The rest of the All-Star cast gave performances on par with their best. Alec Baldwin has sadly become a scarcity lately and he is without a doubt the funniest man on the screen. Admittedly, watching Ray Winstone with an American Accent is odd, although he does it well. Jack Nicholson: what can you say, really? Jack's always great, but this is the best I've seen him do in years. Just great all around.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that The Departed was the best movie I've seen in the theater in a long while."
"egarry","9","1","1","11 October 2006"," One of the best movies I have seen in years
","This was without doubt one of the most entertaining edge of the seat clever thrillers to come out in years and I hardly noticed the two and a half hours going by. The cast is the strongest i have ever seen assembled and no one disappoints. Jack Nicholson is awesome in the sleazy old time gangster role and Mark Wahlberg puts in one of his best performances ever. The two lead characters who I have never liked in most f their movies before are strong and Dicaprio obliviously likes working with Scorsese. All in all a classic that is up there with Goodfellas, Scarface and Carlitos Way. Superb Stuff. If this does not get Scorsese a long awaited Oscar then it is a crime."
"freaky_dave","9","1","1","11 October 2006"," Unbelievable film
","The Departed was one of the best movies I've seen in awhile. The characters, including the minor roles, were spectacular an humorous. The story itself was well done and for a movie over two hours long, it sure wasn't boring.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese is one of the premiere directors of his generation. He helped make Robert DeNiro one of the greatest movie actors ever, and with the Departed he shows that he still has what it takes to make a clever movie. With movies like Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Mean Streets to his credit, The Departed fits rather well in that great selection of movies.<br/><br/>The plot is not real complex. Jack Nicholson plays Frank Costello, the leader of the Irish Mafia in Boston. The police department is trying to find hard evidence on him so they can finally arrest him. They use a spy of their own named Billy Costigan(Lenardo DeCaprio) to try and get the information they need too finally catch the man. However unknown to the police department, Costello has his own mole planted in the FBI. His name is Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), and he always lets Costello know what's going down before the police can ever catch him. This cat and mouse game is played throughout the entire movie and has the audience wondering how both characters, Costigan, and Sullivan, are going to manage this all without being caught themselves.<br/><br/>This all leads to a violent conclusion which had everybody in shock. Some people were disappointed and some were just plain surprised. I was one of those that was surprised by what went down because it happens so quickly that the audience of the film has no time to react. The final scene on the other hand is somewhat predictable and that alone is probably the only weakness of this film.<br/><br/>Overall this film is probably one of the best I've seen all year. All the characters were great, even the minor ones. Mark Wahlberg in particular has a hilarious role, and I mean that in a good way. Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin were also very good as was Vera Farmiga who plays a clinic psychologist for the police department. Very well made movie and worth the ticket price."

"ddogsmith","1","6","15","19 February 2007"," Worst movie I've seen in a long time
","This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. If you like violence, profanity, lots of testosterone and bad acting (Jack Nicholson ""out-Jacks"" himself) then this is your movie. It is neither smart nor well-done. Scorcese should give it up, and go play golf. And why does he think Leonardo is so great? Didn't the debacle of Aviator show that these two just don't make that great of a team? This movie has two goals: glorify violence. And glorify violence. The fact that it is nominated as ""Best Picture"" is unsettling and tells you where this country is at this time -- at a very low cultural point. When I saw that Brad Pitt was one of the producers, my opinion of him as world do-goody dropped by two-thirds."
"be_headed","7","6","15","3 October 2006"," Better than Aviator or Gangs, worse than Goodfellas
","If The Departed had been directed by anyone else, especially someone without the pedigree of Scorsese, I would have been pleasantly surprised and left the theater more than satisfied. However, movies like Goodfellas, Raging Bull and Taxi Driver have infected me with an extremely high standard for anything with Scorsese's name on it, and while this movie is good, it is not in the same league as those classics.<br/><br/>To begin, Scosese probably went a little over the top with casting. I realize that big names bring big bucks, but having dominating talents like Alec Baldwin (if you don't agree, see Glengarry Glen Ross or any one of his stints in SNL) or Martin Sheen in supporting roles is distracting. Such recognizable faces removed any sense of anonymity or realism from those roles -- they felt more like cameos than real characters. Not that Scorsese is the first to make this mistake; The Thin Red Line suffered from this same fatal flaw.<br/><br/>There were also some underdeveloped relationships that I had trouble sinking my teeth into. In particular, the affair between Vera Farmiga's and DiCaprio's characters seemed contrived, particularly later in the movie when I wondered what exactly DiCaprio ""wasn't there for."" It's not that the actors failed to do there jobs adequately; it's more like there was some critical scene left on the cutting room floor that would have explained the characters' behavior towards the end of the film.<br/><br/>On the plus side, for the first time in a Scosese movie, I was not annoyed by DiCaprio's presence. While he still looks young, this movie called for a younger actor. This is in stark contrast to The Aviator, where DiCaprio looked like a child with a mustache glued on his lip. Nicholson was fun to watch, of course, and Damon gave a particularly strong performance as a charming alpha male with a menacing streak lurking just beneath the surface. Mark Wahlberg is from Boston and therefore has the accent down pat, but I thought his dialog was a little over the top. This is not his fault really; the writers probably could have better developed the reasons behind why Wahlberg's character hated DiCaprio, and most the other characters for that matter, so much.<br/><br/>I suppose I probably went into the movie having the wrong expectations. Not every movie can detail the rise and fall of a criminal family. Had this movie been too much like Goodfellas, I'd be complaining about Scorsese riding his own coattails. Looking over the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, apparently I'm alone in thinking this movie is not the next American Classic. I wish there were some way to see Scorsese's next movie without knowing he directed it."

The movie ended suddenly, and I felt very unsatisfied at the ending, and would have liked to have more questions answered at the end. The movie had an all star cast, but I felt the studio could have saved their money by using lessor known actors, and they would have received the same results. I had trouble making a connection between the Title of the movie and the story. I kept waiting for a surprise that never came.

","No offense but it is so obvious that TD is far worse than IA: from the plot, the directing to camera and story-telling. The original lasts for less than 2h and it blows audiences' mind with intense and unexpected twists. This one has more than 2h and a half and the best it can do is re-telling the original'story without any improvements but even worse. I fell asleep after half of the film. The characters are very poor- developed. Leo's and Matt's character get the top-rank position in about 4 months?! I mean come on, are you kidding me? We're not kids to be fooled like that. In IA, Yan and Ming in IA took almost 10 years to earn their credibility in the workplace. Yan had to work undercover for many bosses and live the life of a true criminal: assaulting, drugging and killing. Not just hanging around and beating up some guys like Leo did. And since when a just graduated-fish like Matt's guy can become an inspector in matter of months. My goodness! Also, why was that stupid screen writer so fond of swearing? He made all character say bad words in every line of the script. This makes the movie sound cheap and low. Next time, if you want to look cool and play smart, stay out of dirty words please! You guys made Mark's character like a psycho when swearing every 5s and screaming like an idiot. Well, I guess that Academy Award Best Supporting Actor was to reward his ability to swear consistently in this stupid film.

"ac4aq","2","4","9","20 December 2007"," An utterly depraved production.
","The Departed is the film which sets a benchmark for depravity in a production by a major motion picture studio in that it amounts to little more than star-studded snuff porn. It features filthy dialogue, completely implausible when spoken by disciplined law enforcement officers in an open forum. It includes murder by gunfire ad nauseam, not unlike viewing the Zapruder film of the assassination of President Kennedy a dozen times in swift succession. The script is mechanical, the plot turns are shocking but certainly not surprising. The development of the characters is poor, just the usual suspects.<br/><br/>On the lighter side, the demise of Det. Queenan (Martin Sheen) provides comic relief, falling to his death in the manner made famous by Wile E. Coyote in numerous animated short subjects, all that's missing is the whistling sound effect. Regrettably Queenan is not indestructible and is not resurrected in the next scene.<br/><br/>What remains to me the greatest shock of all is that this feature release won several awards, including Best Motion Picture of the Year! It must have indeed been a vast wasteland in Hollywood in 2006 for this can of raw sewage to be so voted. I must look in the almanac and see if Private School (For Girls) won Best Picture in 1983, as it certainly was a more deserving production.<br/><br/>Folks, life is short. Don't waste on hour of it on The Departed. And don't reward those who profit from it with so much as a nickle.

"fejimanz","10","4","9","9 October 2006"," Scorsese back to form
","The Departed (2006) Dir: Martin Scorsese<br/><br/>Rating:<br/><br/>If you like good things... go see this film. Scorsese's best film in years.<br/><br/>What's Good About It:<br/><br/>They say that people elevate the level of play if they believe in their coach, (Which is evident this year in the miracle that is the Detroit Tigers) and it is evident that every one of these actors (great in their own right) upped every ounce of their game for Scorsese. Scorsese is back to what he does best, (after more than a decade since Casino) and he shows that he hasn't lost any of his balls in the decade, despite the scientific likelihood that his ability to procreate has decreased with age. Anyways, despite a couple things I didn't like on his end, this film was gloriously directed, with the pace of a healthy bowel movement (slow and steady with spurts of speed and spatter). It also brings back a lot of the directorial instinct I liked from Taxi Driver, and haven't really seen him explore again. Some people say that being a child, and being elderly are very similar, and I hope that this is the beginning of Scorsese's second childhood, where he re-finds what made him a unique voice to begin with.<br/><br/>OK, the acting in this film is some of the most top notch acting by a group of individuals I have seen in a long time. They don't act like an ensemble (ie United 93) which is what made the film a lot better, all were individuals who were after their own goals, and all even appeared to have their own mini film within in the film. It's something that doesn't work very often unless you get the right mix of actors, and this mix of actors is glorious, all of which I would love to work with.<br/><br/>I would love to write a paragraph on all of them from Ray Winstone to Alec Baldwin to Kevin Corrigan but that would take FOREVER... so I will talk about the highlights. Finally... FINALLY!!! someone cast Leonardo DiCaprio in a role that he was suited for, I didn't like him as 'Howard Hughes' in the The Aviator, I thought there were dozens of actors better suited for that role that Leo (I am not saying that he was bad, he just didn't have the tools or the look). I am of the belief that Leo gets miscast more than any other actor, just because people really wanna have Leo in their films, and in only 1 out of 4 films is he ever cast correctly (Such as; Catch Me If You Can, Titanic being the reason people wanna cast him and do so incorrectly for everything he was casted in before this i have no qualms with) I think Leo really defined himself as an adult actor with this role, before he was playing roles that he was still coming of age, or still the young kid. This was an adult role that he took and hit out of the ballpark, out of the number of Oscar nominations I assume this film will get, his will be one that was actually deserved (not to take anything away from the rest of the film, its just a film that the academy will over praise... I am sure).<br/><br/>I was happy to see Martin Sheen kickin it again on the big screen, and he was great. The team up with Mark Wahlberg's character made for some of the most memorable portions of the film. Both these actors are actors that I have enjoyed for a while, and I am happy to see them both doing something other than The Italian Job 12 (Wahlberg) and small screen fare (Sheen).<br/><br/>That will be all that I go into detail about what is good, for there was so much that I can't really get into it all unless I write an epic... and I don't write epics unless its about 'poo' or 'holes in my shoes' so I shall move on to...<br/><br/>What Was Bad:<br/><br/>I am going to go out on a limb and say Jack Nicholson. He is so close to brilliance in this film, but I feel it crossed over into ridiculous cartoonish evil. Really I hate to say it, because there is so much to like about the performance, but I even feel that the film makers saw what I saw, and his part in the film feels edited down (also from the information I have read in interviews, and other literature on the film). Though I will give him praise for taking risks in his character (for there were many), because there isn't enough risk taking in Hollywood today, and it was great to see a well established actor (who is known for taking risks) take some.<br/><br/>Also I will say this, and I won't write any spoiler, though it doesn't hold a bearing on the story... the last frames of the film, almost ruined it for me... They did something I despise, and that is toss in a simple ass visual metaphor and symbolism just so that the idiot average film goer can think he figured out a ""subtle"" insinuation from the film maker... when and if you see the film you will know what I mean... it's literally the last frames of the film before the creds.<br/><br/>Epilogue:<br/><br/>If you like any Scorsese, see this film. If you like any Quentin Tarantino (specifically Reservoir Dogs), see this film. BUT DON'T TAKE YOUR MOM'S OR YOUR KIDS!!! This film is rough... so show it to people judiciously."

I can appreciate the lure of profanity and guns, but this was overkill. The violence in this movie was so insensitive, people in the theater were laughing as nearly all the main characters got picked off one by one in the final minutes.

","(Synopsis) The city of South Boston has been taken over by the Irish mob boss, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). The Massachusetts State Police Department has set up the Special Investigations Unit to collect evidence and put Costello and his men in jail. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) has just graduated from the state police academy, and has been assigned to infiltrate Costello's gang by the unit chief. Billy joins the mob and begins to earn Costello's trust. Years earlier, Costello was able to get one of his men, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), to infiltrate the state police. Colin is assigned to the Special Investigations Unit, the same unit that is trying to take Costello down. The only problem for the police is that Colin keeps Costello informed as to what the police are about to do. Eventually, the police and the mob discover that a mole has infiltrated their ranks. Each man is living a double life where one misstep will mean life or death if he is caught.<br/><br/>(My Comment) This was a noteworthy movie with many memorable performances. Jack Nicholson's performance as an evil psychopath will get him an Oscar nomination. Several others probably will also be nominated for this film. The movie is graphically violent and shows the dark side of crime. It shows what it takes to work uncover as a cop or as a criminal. Costello said, ""does it matter who is holding a gun to your head, it is all the same."" Both sides risk their lives every day. It is a long movie, but the time passes very fast.

","Saw this again as a friend hadn't previously & I actually couldn't stand to watch anymore the first time due mainly to damon.The highly forced & often disappearing accent & totally,broomstick up my ass,wooden 'actng' from damon just drove me crazy.Even Jack,of whom I'm a big fan,really overdid it where as the joker etc was great this was just poorly & tackily scripted.<br/><br/>The story of the newcomer becoming the boss's main man has been done to death & as mentioned by others out of small crew suddenly can't figure out who's the mole.Then there's whiny DiCaprio taking on 2 mafioso's,the meteoric rise through the ranks of both characters,no IAD or senior officials investigations although the mole in the department seemed to be common knowledge.
Anyway the whole thing seemed overdone,forced & disjointed compared to the IA it's based on & nowhere near Goofellas etc..The only really convincing one in the whole thing was Ray Winstone,as usual,everyone else seemed either too forced & stereotypical or just pointlessly bickering.But the main reason I couldn't watch the whole thing the first time was damon I just couldn't take his terrible 'actng' there's plenty more to dislike about this but enough for now."

","'I don't want to be a product of my environment, I want my environment to be a product of me.' The film starts with this dialogue. A question is also popped at the very beginning- ""When you face a loaded gun what's the difference,if you're a cop or a criminal?""At the very outset the mood which is started, is kept till the end.<br/><br/>Billy ( Leonardo) is from south Boston, has a family with criminal background, which makes him a suitable undercover in his criminal neighborhood. He is a mole in Costello's( Jack Nicholson)outfit. While, Colin Sullivan(Matt Damon)is a Sergeant in Massachusetts, is actually a mole working for Costello. Throughout the movie Billy & Collin try to figure out each others identity.<br/><br/>As referred to as Rock star of the gangsters Costello by Alan Baldwin, truly in this movie Jack Nicholson outshines everyone. His character is so insensitive in this film. Everybody has done justice to their characters. Again , Leonardo proved why he is Martin scorsese's pick. Mark whalberg's character of insulting everyone was very unique, also with Mark's Massachusetts accent, adorned the character.<br/><br/>Matt Damon was also very good. One more thing I want to say about this film is about its dialogues. I don't remember hearing so many crispy dialogue exchange, after Pulp Fiction. This movie is very intense throughout, with some twists and turns, that keeps you at the edge of the seat. This movie touches everything like, racial discrimination which was there once in Boston. And, bravely puts forth its opinions.<br/><br/>I have seen this movie more than 50 times. But, whenever I see it, it never bores me. This movie teaches you a lot of harsh realities of life. Martin scorsese dished out so many good flicks. But, according to me this has to be his best film. He gave it all. Deservedly, it won an Oscar This is one of the best crime thrillers of all time. I would recommend everyone to watch this great flick.<br/><br/>Hats off and all my clothes off to Martin scorsese for giving this incredible film. I'd like to finish this review off with a quote in this film- "" No one gives it to you, you have to take it."""

","Crime is my least favorite of all the genres. I tend to find myself not liking any of the characters because of the amount I despise crime in all its shapes.<br/><br/>However, I l-o-v-e The Departed. This is a sophisticated and very involving story. From the screenplay to the music, the execution is outstanding, and Marting Scorsese deserves the Academy Award he got.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Monahan is very good. The dialogue is harsh, crisp, and clever. The action is stylish, and the bloodshed is as well. The continuing deception on all sides can make the sturdiest brain ache, making it a film well worth watching a couple more times to understand it better.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is great in his role, as well as Jack Nicholson, and especially Mark Wahlberg (whom I cheered for at the Academy Awards). A great cast of people, such as, Martin Sheen, Matt Damon, and Ray Winstone. Each of these characters are interesting, complete, and have their own conclusion.<br/><br/>Howard Shore has made a ""toe-tapping"" score for The Departed. The use of the guitar in the majority of the music makes it worth a buy -- probably one of the best scores of the year 2006.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a pretty epic crime film. I was enthralled every minute, and hoping for the good guys to win. The ending couldn't have been better, for it was more than I wanted, and left me ultimately satisfied. See this film."

This was definitely Scorsese's best film since Goodfellas. I truly think that it was the right choice for Best Picture.

Obviously the greats like ""Goodfella's, Pulp Fiction and Donnie Brasco"" but i have to say that this film was refreshing to watch. I think this is partially because of Leonardo Dicaprio. What an amazing performance, for me it was worthy of an Oscar. I've always regarded him as a great actor but this just solidified it for me. The way that both him and Damon played each other out throughout the film was brilliant. Always trying to out do each other but they had no idea what so ever, excellent! and i suppose thats down to the writer for the intertwined twists involved in the plot but i don't think that any other actors would have played these roles anywhere near as convincing as they did.<br/><br/>For me this was the movie of 2006 i throughly enjoyed every bit of it and was greatly pleased with the end credits thinking WOW!"

","I found this movie to be rather boring. I love Martin Scorcese's other films, and when I saw this one win so many Oscars, I expected something as good as Goodfellas, which is a true masterpiece. The acting was great, and the cinematography was pretty good, but the story barely held my attention. About an hour and a half into it I wanted to turn it off, but was compelled to finish it, hoping for some really cool plot twist. I figured that must be the reason that everyone liked it so much. Perhaps there was too much hype, but I was extremely disappointed. I just don't see what all the fuss is regarding this movie. Most of the movies that are coming out of the studios nowadays are complete garbage. So now Scorcese makes a pretty good movie, and people think it belongs in the top 50 of all time. We're becoming complacent and settling for less. This movie is good, but not that good."
"Isaac5855","9","3","6","19 November 2007"," Scorcese's Long Overdue Oscar win is quite simply, a masterpiece
","Martin Scorcese finally snagged a Best Director Oscar for THE DEPARTED and though there are some (myself included) who do not feel this was his best work, the film is more than worthy of the Director Oscar it finally nailed for Scorcese as well as the Oscar for Best Picture of the Year that it also received. This exquisitely mounted epic tale looks at the war between the police and the mob in South Boston, supposedly during the 70's and 80's, centering primarily on three characters. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio)is a young cop with a shady family legacy, who is sent deep undercover to get the goods on renowned Boston mob boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Matt Damon plays Colin Sullivan, a young man who grew up working for Costello,a la Ray Liotta's character in GOODFELLAS, but also becomes a police officer. A two-way cat and mouse game ensues as Costello tries to learn which member of his organization is a cop while the police try to figure out which one of their officers is a stooge to Costello. The race to learn which rat is where advances to the point where Sullivan is actually assigned to, in so many words, rat out himself. Scorcese offers one of the greatest examples I have seen in years of storytelling on screen with a meticulous and detailed screenplay that requires complete attention, not to mention multiple viewings to fully appreciated the multi-layered story presented here. Scorcese's direction is crisp and in-your-face, as always, and surprises are offered around every corner of the story told here. Every time you think you've figure it out, the story takes another detour and if you miss anything, you will be confused. DiCaprio offers the best performance of his career as the tortured Costigan and he might have won the Oscar if he had been nominated for this instead of BLOOD DIAMOND. Matt Damon's richly complex portrayal of Collin Sullivan hits the bullseye as does Nicholson's expectedly ruthless mafioso. Mark Wahlberg received a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his razor sharp performance as DiCaprio and Damon's 2nd commanding officer who allows matters to get personal. Alec Baldwin, Martin, Sheen, Ray Winstone, and Anthony Anderson also register in strong supporting roles, but it is primarily the compelling story, masterful direction by Scorcese and the three electrifying lead performances that make this film an instant classic not to be missed."
"nuhc","9","3","6","5 November 2007"," Scorcese does it again
","What can I say? This is the best gangster flick I've seen since Goodfellas. This movie had me engrossed the entire time and I definitely was not expecting the ending at all. I love movies like that. An all-star cast doesn't hurt either. The acting was excellent, though I think Mark Wahlberg's character was a bit over the top. His character was unlikeable, though at the end of this movie it works out, because the ending wouldn't have worked if he wasn't such a high-strung A-hole. The plot was simple yet intricate. A special unit of the police is out to round up a bunch of gangsters by placing a rat in the gang, only there's a slight problem. The gangsters have a mole working in the police department. <br/><br/>I will say that I'm going to have to rent this one again to catch a lot of stuff I missed the first time through. I'm sure I'll enjoy it as much as I did the first time.<br/><br/>Go out & rent this one along with Goodfellas, The Godfather, and Casino and have a great night of gangster action."
"stefanbe","10","3","6","5 August 2007"," The Departed: An ode to the great William Shakespeare
","For years, William Shakespeare has been regarded as the greatest writer in history and his works have been studied, analysed and influential ever since his quill first touched a sheet of paper. He had the ability to take familiar stories and turn them into something triumphant. He managed to enthrall audiences with his witty and fascinating dialogue and tales of star-crossed lovers and brave Moors, among others. This year, The Departed was honoured with the Academy Award for Best Picture and many that considered a triumph for Martin Scorsese, one of the greatest modern filmmakers still standing strong since he first came to prominence in the 1970's. However, I would not be surprised if Shakespeare was watching from above and applauding the win along with everyone else in the Kodak Theatre. After all, if he was a screenwriter in Hollywood, The Departed would certainly be a work of art he would produce.<br/><br/>Unlike the typical action film that Hollywood likes to churn out every week or so, The Departed has actually an intelligent and well thought out plot that one needs to think in order to make sense of it all. Not surprisingly, this is due to it being heavily inspired by not only the Bard but also the Chinese film Infernal Affairs. Billy Costigan is a mole for the police who has been placed in the middle of the Irish Mafia of Boston, headed by the ruthless Frank Costello. Costello himself has placed an informant of his own in the police sector, Colin Sullivan trusted by the gangster since the boy's youth. Tensions run even higher when both learn of a mole on either side and with guns ablaze, the plan is to get them sniffed out. As the film's 152 minute running time comes to a close, identities are revealed, lives are lost and Scorsese adds another triumphant production to his filmography.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese, deservedly so receives the bulk of acclaim for The Departed as his eye for detail and clever camera-work is enough to make any film of his the heart of a film school course. Despite this being an American remake of an already great foreign production, Scorsese allows it to stand on its own and even surpass its inspiration. His talented ensemble of actors are also intelligent enough not to ham it up as they bring their characters to life easily. Leonardo DiCaprio sheds his pretty boy image, playing Costigan as the rebel who much like his actor wants people to forget his history and just see him for who he currently is. Matt Damon disappears into Sullivan and much like DiCaprio, plays a man leading a double life but not certain which one to choose. Jack Nicholson, always known for playing evil yet lovable villains portrays Costello as the ultimate of evil and a man you're cheering against and not for. However, the actor who gives the most enjoyable performance is Mark Wahlberg who plays a character who isn't even in the original. The film's writer William Monahan gives him some of the film's best lines and he delivers them with a sharp tongue. Wahlberg allows his f-words to be the most fun to listen to since the Canadian sung tune from South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut.<br/><br/>As the film proceeds at its surprisingly fast pace, the film gets more and more exciting and us, the viewers, get more immersed and fascinated in the story. And then the last half-hour comes along and each character meets their demise, we're reminded of the triumphant finale Shakespeare wrote for Hamlet, his magnum opus. Each character, good and evil, dies and the audience laughs, not because it's ridiculous but because it's done in such a light tone. We gasp as blood gushes from their brains but even on the second viewing, when I knew a character's death was arriving, I couldn't wait for them to happen. I'm not a sick individual but it's so much fun watching one right after the other dropping down on the ground. And as Sullivan falls to the ground in the film's final scene and we watch a rat scurry on his window sill, we look back and want to see that last half hour again. Just for the fun of it."
"Murdoch584","7","3","6","13 July 2007"," Not Bad, But Not Great Either
","I have become less impressed with Scorsese over the years. His earlier movies had an authenticity to them which right now is sorely lacking. It seems he's become a lot like Travis Bickle in the sense that he reacts with more violence and sex the more disillusioned he gets with the world (watch Scorsese on Scorsese on disc 2 of The Departed to see what I mean). Which brings me to The Departed.<br/><br/>I had seen Infernal Affairs before The Departed and was naturally somewhat jaded. The plethora of American remakes of Asian movies has made me somewhat irritated as with each successive remake, the quality has decreased. The Departed is no exception. To make things simple, I'll make a list of problems with this movie.<br/><br/>1. Acting: I couldn't help but compare Martin Sheen to Anthony Wong. Wong conveyed confidence and power in his role whereas Sheen always looked like he'd be better off being an accountant in a side office somewhere. Sheen can play confident too, just watch The Dead Zone (of course he was a villain in that movie, that's beside the point). And that brings me to Walhberg. Forget that his character wasn't in Infernal Affairs. Ask yourself why his character even needed to be in the movie. He served no purpose except to show everyone that he was unable to utter a sentence without saying the f-word about 500 times. And he got an academy award nomination for that? It certainly was not that difficult of a part. In any event, his antagonism is, I believe, to make him seem like a drill sergeant but in the end it makes him seem more like fifth grade bully. The rest of the cast pretty much sleepwalks through their roles, each on one setting. DiCaprio and Damon don't give the audience a sense of their torn duty which was such a powerful element in Infernal Affairs. It was that inner conflict in IA that made the audience empathize with the main characters. In TD, there is no grey area (which is odd since Scorsese says on disc 2 that everything is grey), the cops are good, except for Damon, and the bad guys are bad except for DiCaprio. But enough on that, on to...<br/><br/>2. The Direction: Overall, relatively unspectacular even from a technical standpoint. At the very least, Scorsese usually works in some unique camera shots (extended steadycam mostly). Not this time. Also, I really wish Scorsese would stop putting music over almost every single scene (he really overkilled this in Casino). Fellini, of whom I'm not a particular fan, once said something to the effect that when the director uses music too much it means there is nothing interesting going on with the story. He didn't take into account that maybe the director was manipulating emotions, which is fine. But that's the thing. Scorsese's use of music doesn't fit what's going on on the screen. He's become obsessed with musical counterpoint which, ever since Goodfellas, he's overused so much that I no longer pay it any mind.<br/><br/>SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS (for both IA and TD) <br/><br/>3. The Ending: It almost comes across as a slapstick comedy with people getting shot in the head left and right. The real crime (no pun intended) was the killing of Damon's character. In IA, the fact that his character had to live a lie despite the fact that he tried to make things right was so much more powerful than the bland ending of TD. In IA, that character had to live with the knowledge that he was responsible for a good cop's death. Since it's already been established that he's been trying to be a better person, this makes it all the more potent. Damon's character is a robot set on ""bad"" and therefore there is no empathy for him at all.<br/><br/>In conclusion, TD is a decent movie, but nothing more. It's not a masterpiece. And if any parts of it are, it's because of the movie it's based on."

","Talent and tape wasted. All the actors almost are top notch yet how can it fail to deliver on so many levels so frighteningly? Is it that perhaps Scorsese is now seriously getting old and losing it? Is it because the script gets nowhere? Or is it that even Nicholson cannot salvage this unfortunate movie from the baptism of criticism that it will get? Or is it Di Caprio who cannot shake off the novice look whatever character he portrays? Just another sad awful chapter in the saga of the withering directors work ( For reference please see The Black Dahlia by Brian De Palma). Cannot, in any way, be compared to the classics such as Scarface, Donnie Brasco, The Goodfellas, and the like. As for the Irish Mafia portrayed, I believe somehow something is amiss. Somehow, it lacks credibility, perhaps yearning too hard to be credited as tough as its Italian counterpart. And this movie being nominated for Oscars, that would be another thing coming..."
"ednsyl","1","3","6","13 May 2007"," Most confusing picture I've ever seen
","The opening credits confused me and I remained confused until I saw, ""The End"", up there on the screen. There was more foul language used than an aircraft carrier of sailors all hitting their thumbs with hammers at the same time. Matt Damon and L. DeCaprio looked so much alike that most of the time I didn't know which mole I was looking at. And Nickolson, one of my favorite actors, should have watched ""The Godfather"" to learn the ways of a Don. He played it as a soldier, not as a boss. Best Picture Oscar? Now, really, a Razzie maybe. What happened to the lady shrink? She is the only one in the entire production that doesn't get killed. What was in the envelope she had? Who is the hero? Everyone was the villain. Alec Baldwin's lines were much clearer on his tape of the conversation with his daughter than his lines in this turkey. How many gallons of blood were used, a tanker truck perhaps. Just a rotten waste of time. Is there any way to retract the Oscar?"

"contact-447","6","3","6","11 April 2007"," Disappointing
","As a big fan of both Martin Scorsese and the Hong Kong movie Infernal Affairs that The Departed is based on, I was looking forwards to this film. Sadly I've come away somewhat disappointed.<br/><br/>Taking it on its own strengths, it's a decent thriller with a good premise, but it really needed another pass on the script to tighten it up and (sad to say) stronger direction. I love Goodfellas, Casino, Taxi Driver, even The Last Temptation Of Christ. The Departed can't match the narrative or visual flair of those films.<br/><br/>The script is full of dead ends and wasted potential, and it doesn't help that the editing is choppy at best, downright sloppy at worst. It's almost as if (despite the two and a half hour running time) half the story and character development has been left on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>The FBI connection never really goes anywhere, the pregnancy comes out of nowhere and goes straight back there, the love triangle never gives the pay-off you expect at the end (such as the identity of the baby's father), Costello's wife is a waste of space who doesn't add anything to the story, the envelope Billy gives Colin's wife is never used for anything, the mainland Chinese gang with their corrupt official in tow seem to have wandered in from Infernal Affairs 3 and are totally irrelevant to the plot, and when they get arrested (off-screen) a couple of scenes later, the target of the bust on Costello's gang just switches from the stolen micro-processors (which vanish into McGuffin Land almost without comment) to a drugs shipment (which appears from much the same place).<br/><br/>On the other hand, while Monahan and Scorsese find time for all these narrative cul de sacs, the characters and core storyline are poorly developed. Only Leonardo di Caprio's Billy is really fleshed out, and it's no coincidence that he comes out of the film with one of the strongest performances. The supporting cast in particular is woefully wasted, with actors of the calibre of Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg reduced to virtual cameos.<br/><br/>Where the film really suffers though is in comparison to Infernal Affairs. For example -<br/><br/><ul><li>Matt Damon's Colin is one dimensional and uninteresting compared to the equivalent character that Andy Lau plays in IA.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Martin Sheen's Queenan doesn't have the same close relationship with Billy that Anthony Wong has with Tony Leung in IA (or the screen time to develop it), making his death far less moving and Billy's extreme emotional reaction to it somewhat bizarre.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Making Matt's girlfriend and Billy's shrink the same person was a good idea, but the relationship between Billy and the psychiatrist isn't given as much time to develop as it was in IA.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The numerous scenes that The Departed lifts almost verbatim from IA (from Queenan's death and the elevator shoot-out to the encounter at the movie theatre and the smashing of the cast on Billy's arm) mostly come across as pale imitations, lacking the emotion, tension and visual flair that cinematographer Christopher Doyle and directors Alan Mak and Andrew Lau brought to IA. It doesn't help that some of these scenes have been lifted entirely out of context and inserted into a different place in the story.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>IA's intro is flashy and concise, getting you straight to the heart of the story in double quick time without leaving any room for confusion. By comparison, The Departed takes far too long to set up all the pieces at the start of the film and does it in a rather clunky manner, making the opening a little muddled and long-winded.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The constant texting and mobile phone calls in The Departed lack the tension of Tony Leung's morse code messages in IA.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>And so on and so forth...</li></ul><br/><br/>It's no surprise to me that fans of IA found The Departed a bit of a let down by comparison. It does surprise me to see so many Scorsese fans here waving the flag for what is in my opinion one of his weaker movies.<br/><br/>Is The Departed a bad movie? No. Is it a great movie? No. Is it one of Scorsese's best? Definitely not. Is it as good as Infernal Affairs? Not even close."

","Great acting. Jack N. is good just reading a phone book and Caprio did his best work. Writing seemed sloppy and contrived. Editing had some bad cuts. At times it seemed they were racing against a schedule to complete the film. I think Scorcese has seen too many Tarantino movies. All the shooting, blood, dead bodies and gore was a bit over the top. Departed is not one of his best works. But what the heck, I liked it, but it didn't live up to the hype. The movie is based on the career of Whitey Bulger, a Boston mobster, who got away with scores of crime because he was an FBI informant, recruited by a boyhood friend who was in the FBI. Why they gave Nicholson an Italian name is a mystery. Martin Sheen should sue the writers for his role. He did the best he could with some dialog that seemed almost ad lib. <br/><br/>One of the glaring omissions was the very obvious omission of the role of the media. In the real world the media would have been a major player in the movie. As usual, the photography was outstanding. Cinemaphotography has become so good that it can make up for poor writing, mediocre directing and bad casting. Sometimes its great to just sit back and marvel at the incredible camera work."

I find them, almost always, tedious and unsettling, the exception being movies like the Godfather series which were able to transcend the genre. However I told my son I would see the movie if it won the Oscar for best picture which, to my regret, it did. A promise is a promise so I sat through the entire movie even though I wanted to leave many times. Setting aside my ingrained distaste for movies of this sort and trying to look at the film objectively, I would argue that it fails on many critical levels. The acting performances range from adequate to indifferent. Jack Nicholson plays his usual Jack Nicholson role which is good or bad depending on whether or not you like Jack Nicholson. Matt Damon's character is bland and motiveless. Mark Walhberg's character is just bizarre. Leonard DiCaprio's performance is probably the best but that's not saying much. The script never calls for any real character development so the actors basically have one mood and that's it for the rest of the show. All we have throughout the movie is people swearing at each other, menacing other people or being menaced. The whole set up and execution of the plot, the obligatory love affair, the violence and the twist at the end is so just so improbable as to be ludicrous. At the other end of the spectrum in the Academy Awards Best Picture nominees was Little Miss Sunshine and though this movie had its flaws it had, at least, an original idea which, of course, never appeals to Academy voters. It was intelligent and infinitely more entertaining than The Departed which does not even rise to the top when compared to great gangster movies like The Goodfellas, Get Shorty, Snatch, Scarface etc. If you like gangster movies you will probably enjoy The Departed, even though I doubt you will find the hype justified. If you don't like gangster shows there is certainly nothing here to make you change your mind."
"dcfilmgoer","Null","3","6","26 February 2007"," Copycat script unseemly in a film with such pretensions
","I saw Infernal Affairs just two weeks before I saw The Departed. I can't understand how a film (and its director and screenwriter) that so completely mimics the Chinese original, scene for scene, with bits at the beginning from the old Boston Globe series on Whitey Bulger's predatory treatment of young Southie girls and their families, has received so much praise, let alone Oscars for scriptwriting and direction, which would seem to require some substantial originality and creativity. The acting and technical aspects of the film, e.g., cinematography, were fine, but the copycat nature of the script, taken from a fine foreign film that was barely out of production itself, left me feeling like someone had cheated.<br/><br/>Perhaps I am missing something, but I did not feel any such disappointment in the American remake of the Seven Samurai, i.e., The Magnificent Seven, because I felt that the scriptwriter and director in the second of that pair, while keeping the general plot outline, made many more substantive changes in the story."

The whole cast was absolutely great in this movie. but i think Dicaprio was the best performance and i think he really should have got an Oscar nom for this and jack Nicholson because he is just great in almost everything thing he appears in. don't listen to any of the negative reviews, deffinutly watch this movie"
"ExpendableMan","9","3","6","20 February 2007"," Give the man an Oscar already!
","The Departed is another knock-out blow from director Martin Scorsese. A gritty, fast paced and highly impressive cops versus robbers fable that is reminiscent of his old classics and makes for a riveting cinema experience. With the awards ceremony season in full swing and the Oscars just around the corner, it'd be a real shame if he didn't walk away with at least one golden statue having been denied them so long, as it is a very impressive movie. At turns, it is both tense, violent, funny, dark and packed with so many terrific performances it is hard to pick a standout and should hopefully be remembered as one of the best films of 2006.<br/><br/>Returning to gangland sees Scorsese tackling the underworld from a slightly different perspective. Set in the world of the Irish mafia, it differs from his Italian-American gangster pictures by showing us contrasting elements on both sides of the law in the shape of Leonardo Di Caprio's police mole within the gang and Matt Damon's gang mole within the police. As the police force led by Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin struggle to take down Jack Nicholson's kingpin, the two moles become aware of each other's existence and are soon caught in a deadly game of cat and mouse.<br/><br/>All of which might sound familiar and to no surprise, for as has been widely publicised, The Departed is a Western riff on the classic Hong Kong series Infernal Affairs that told the same story. It might be a little unoriginal, but with a pro like Scorsese at the helm, it avoids the inevitable disaster that awaits most Hollywood remakes (stand up The Ring, The Wickerman, The Fog, The Omen blah blah blah) by the twin virtues of having its own identity and a terrific cast. For where the Hong Kong original was a slick thriller, this one is covered in dirt.<br/><br/>The Boston underworld here comes across as a bleak and unwelcoming landscape with little of the criminal romance of Goodfellas to be found. The gangs do not lounge in jazz clubs or casinos here but dingy, whiskey soaked bars and quayside warehouses filled with rats. Urban decay is all too evident and when the violence comes, it hits you like a jackhammer. The gun shots sound incredibly loud and forceful and when they strike human flesh, heads are blown apart with stark realism and zero fanfare. Fist fights as well remain taut and ugly, Di Caprio breaking his own wrist in a brawl through punching too hard as his foe is rammed through a glass window. Violence here has pervaded even everyday life and when Jack Nicholson emerges from the back of a bar drenched in blood with no explanation, it is treated as just one of those things that needs no questions.<br/><br/>As previously mentioned as well, the cast is on fire. Di Caprio has banished all memory of the floppy haired teenage heart throb and emerged as an unquestionable successor to De Niro's place as Scorsese's on screen muse. Faced with a life or death situation, he throbs with nervous, aggressive energy and his eyes have never seemed more dangerous, yet he is supposed to be the good guy. Jack let go Rose, Jack let go. Matt Damon meanwhile proves himself once again, his role as Detective Sullivan overflowing with moral dilemmas as the polar opposites of his situation come into conflict.<br/><br/>They are not the only ones to be celebrated though as Jack Nicholson puts in one of the finest appearances of his long and glittering career. As mafia kingpin Frank Costello, he moves from one dirty situation to another, delivering racist barbs to Chinese gang members and having people murdered with a wicked grin etched on his face, displacing his venom with a malicious sense of humour. Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin deliver fine performances as reliable old hands but perhaps it is Mark Wahlberg who comes out strongest. His Captain Dignam is one of the most hard-assed police officers you're ever likely to see and he encapsulates him perfectly, as well as getting some of the film's best lines. With this and Four Brothers it could be argued he is trying to cap the market for overly macho, angry young men but it must be said, he is one of the most memorable things in the movie.<br/><br/>However, if one thing stands in the way of this film and the Oscars it is the undeniable remake syndrome. For all its strong points, it is still a retelling of an existing story and the lack of total originality might be to Scorsese's disadvantage. Nonetheless, it puts paid once and for all to the argument that remakes are a waste of time and is a very worthy version of the Hong Kong original."
"MovieChickie","10","3","6","16 February 2007"," Amazing Film--Stays With You Long After It's Over!
","OK, so I'm one of those people who likes indie films, and usually roots for them at the Oscars and so on. I watched Babel a few weeks ago, and that movie is REALLY GOOD (and I laughed so hard at Little Miss Sunshine, I think I peed myself a little), don't get me wrong, but there is something about The Departed that makes it basically a perfect movie. Obviously, the acting is perfect, so I won't waste your time on that. Why should you see this movie? Because of the incredible directing by Scorcese (who is not usually a favourite of mine) (I'll get back to this in a moment), and the characters that form from both the actors and the writing. So, the movie is about (NOT REALLY A SPOILER, but if you know nothing about the plot and don't want to, stop here) a cop who spies for the local gang lord, and a cop who is undercover in the gang lord's ring. But here's the thing, (and if someone has already pointed this out, I apologize for the repeat) and it's totally brilliant, they are basically the same character. They're from the same background, same age, roughly same characteristics. They are two sides of the same coin. And what makes it better is one leads a life of seemingly happiness, while the other just can't seem to win. To me, that's what makes this movie so incredibly GREAT!! And Scorcese directs this aspect of the film so perfectly, I just can't explain it. It's just perfect. Props to Monaghan (and the original Hong Kong writers) for doing this so well. And the thing I love about this is that as far as I can tell, it's really meant to be more of a gangster or action film, or that seems as though it was the original intent, but instead this jewel emerges and it's not about gunshots and running through dark alleys, drugs, strippers and whores, but about these two men and their lives in this brief intersection. INCREDIBLE MOVIE!!! SHOULD BE SEEN BY EVERYONE!!!"
"tetsulovespunk","3","3","6","16 February 2007"," It is not as good as it is
","I gave this movie 3 score because of the performance,and it was the only reason that the Departed got its applauds. I watched the original Hong-Kong movie before so I am able to know how bad this adaptation as. The music is bad taste. The plot is not well organized. After all, I became to hate the Director who didn't give a damn to other country's people in that he took no responsibility to convey to the ordinary Americans that we Chinese were war-lovers who always wanted to throw bombs on Taiwan's land. It's bullshit! I can't believe that it's the same director who shot so many masterpieces such as Taxi driver and Goodfellas. In the end, I really recommend you Americans to take a try at the original Hong-Kong edition!"

But as the film wears on and the body count piles up, the twisty plot becomes formulaic and predictable and the Southie accents (""fahk you ya queeah!"" is a common turn of phrase for example) start to grate on the viewer's (well, this viewer's) nerves. After 2 hrs and 30 minutes of bloodshed and screamed curse words, by the end I was left cold and unmoved by the spectacle, and left wondering why this thing was nominated for an Oscar."

","The best movie of 2006! Brilliant casting & acting. Scorsese did it again! Topcast: Nicholson, Baldwin, Sheen, Damon, Wahlberg, Di Caprio. The Irish accent of one Nicholsons helpers is just marvelous. This masterpiece has the same quality as Goodfellas & Casino. Nicholson is one of the better and sure the most sadistic & flipped godfather in movie history! I'm not a big fan of Leonardo but I must admit that his acting in this movie is the best i've seen from him so far. Everyone who likes gangster/mafia movies has to see this masterpiece.

"rbverhoef","9","3","6","4 December 2006"," Martin Scorsese as we like it
","Leonardo DiCaprio shines in Martin Scorsese's new gangster movie 'The Departed'. Mat Dammon, Jack Nicholson, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen and especially Mark Wahlberg throw in their talents as well to make this one of the most entertaining films of the year. I would go as far to call this the most entertaining film Scorsese had made since the great 'Goodfellas', although his 'Casino'' came pretty close. This is simply what the man does best, lifting an average story up to greatness. This is not an attack to the original 'Infernal Affairs' on which this film is based on, which was great as well, but the Scorsese magic is seen here in all its glory.<br/><br/>The plot circles around two infiltrating people. One of them is an undercover cop named Billy (DiCaprio) who joins the team of a gangster named Frank Costello (Nicholson). The other is one of Costello's man named Colin Sullivan (Damon) who joins the Boston police department. These two young men are trying to discover the identity of the other and at the same keep their own identity covered. Sheen, Baldwin and Wahlberg belong to the Boston police, all playing their part in this complex tale. I say complex, but Scorsese makes sure the audience knows who is who and why they act the way they do.<br/><br/>I have said about enough about the plot, which is more fun if you do not know too much. For this film is probably best if 'Infernal Affairs' is not seen either. If you do not have too much problems with the bloodshed we have seen in earlier Scorsese films this is the film for you. Technically brilliant, uncompromising, and arguably the most entertaining film from 2006, from start to finish."

","Scorsese taking a good movie and turning it into a cinematic masterpiece that will always stay with us. Lots of people did not enjoy the movie because it felt as if it were dragging which i believe is completely wrong. The movie didn't drag, allot of people thought the movie should have ended after Frank Costello got shot. The point of the movie was that there was a rat in the mob helping the cops and a rat in the cops. So now we had to find out what was going to happen. the story is pretty much based on the inner man giving info to the enemy(rat). I think this was portrayed in beautiful fashion with an all star lineup including Mark Wahlberg,Jack Nicholson at his best, and Matt Damon maybe one of his greatest career moves. I thought this movie was excellent another great hit from a hall of fame director Martin Scorsese. 10 out of 10."
"daveysnoek","10","3","6","22 November 2006"," A triumph
","Scorsese spend a lot of years lingering on different projects. Gangs of new York was okay, The aviator was quite good but every fan of Marty was secretly hoping for a new crime flick from the master. And this is the one! The Departed is brilliant. Absolutely stunning. Like Goodfellas, it's one of those rare movies where everything just..works. The acting is amazing. I was never a big fan of Leo DiCaprio but the performance he gives in this changed that. His character is very well developed and you feel for him right away. Matt Damon gives a surprising turn as a underhanded moll infiltrating the police. And of course there is Jack Nicholson in a blistering performance. Jack radiates menace, madness and charisma as Irish mob boss Frank Costello. A true legend at work. And he hasn't lost his touch. There is a reason for his 12 academy award nominations. And for this he will undoubtedly get his thirteenth.<br/><br/>In the supporting roles Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin deliver the goods. Wahlberg is a scene stealer with some of the best lines and he has fabulous chemistry with both Sheen and Baldwin. Ray Winstone also shines as Costello's right hand man, Mr French. His part in this movie is overlooked in many reviews. But it is a golden one.<br/><br/>The crew knocked this out of the park once again. The camera-work looks effortlessly smooth and Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is impeccable. To top it off there is a very strong soundtrack with the indestructible Scorsese-favorite Gimme Shelter.<br/><br/>The Departed is Scorsese rising back to the up. even though he was never really away."

Anyone out there who previously disregarded Leo DiCaprio as an actor will be totally converted as he delivered an astounding performance and showed a gritty side to his character. In fact, he was so good that Mr Nicholson didn't act him off the screen when they shared screen time together. Accolade also has to be heaped on Damon also as he came into his own as the sneaky but smooth rouge cop. Add Sheen, Whalberg, Baldwin and Winstone to the mix and you have the best cast assembled for a motion picture this year.<br/><br/>the directed are great the casting was great.<br/><br/>the writing are great . the sound track are great too.<br/><br/>i wait this movie win many Oscars and golden globes!

Good surprise Vera Farmiga, really in her foot in the role. Simply fantastic the direction. The fights scenes and the Opera one, masterpieces inside the masterpiece. Really good all the actors and usual great editing by Thelma Schoonmaker. Ready to be beaten by usual Clint? Sounds always like a joke to me.

You cannot like Matt Damon as you could like his counterpart in Infernal Affairs, but that's a little thing, they were all good. Every character is well defined, it doesn't leave space to imagination. You know what they are. A little change from the original one. The had more ""heart"" then in this movie.

","It would be a shame to compare this film to the Infernal Affairs trilogy, though I would admit that I enjoyed Infernal Affairs(still didn't watch the later 2) but you shouldn't look at this film like it was the finger print copy of the Hong Kong version because it's completely a different film. Yes the story and everything else is identical to Infernal Affairs, apart from the language and location. All cars are running on the same concept since the day they were born, you need wheels to drive you, you need an engine to drive the wheels, you need a fuel to drive the engine, yet how come we got over a hundred different car manufacturers when its the same design under the hood?...think of it like this, The Departed is a luxurious Italian car while Infernal Affairs is a luxurious British car :), the problem is people's taste, not everybody in the world love football. This is a great movie, great acting and the cinematography is just simple and yet so complex. Jack Nickolson is still a great actor, though he did act like he was the joker from batman.

"Barky44","10","3","6","21 October 2006"," Scorsese Needs His Oscar ... and This is Worthy
","""The Departed"" -- what an awesome *expletive* movie! Yeah, it's another of those cop vs. bad guy vs. cop movies, but this is probably the best interpretation of that style of film-making that has come out in years, perhaps even decades. It's gritty, and vulgar, and violent, and yes, a bit overacted. But it's fraggin' entertaining, I tell you what! This film has so many great elements. First, and most importantly, it's a great movie to watch. It's very rare for a movie to be entertaining through-and-through, ""The Departed"" pulls it off. Most movies make me look at my watch several times, as if saying ""um, are they getting near the end?"" Not ""The Departed""! Most of the actors play their characters slightly over-the-top. Matt Damon's vulgar turncoat cop is excruciatingly squeaky-clean. Alec Baldwin's vulgar police captain is excruciatingly by-the-book. Martin Sheen's vulgar police lieutenant is excruciatingly trusting, loyal, and competent. Mark Wahlberg's vulgar sergeant is excruciatingly tough, combative, and vulgar (yeah, I used ""vulgar"" twice, and for good reason). And Jack, what can one say about Jack? His portrayal as crime lord Frank Costello is both over-the-top and subtle, for he really sells the idea of a powerful crime boss realizing his empire is falling apart.<br/><br/>Now normally one would see these exaggerated characters as a negative in films, but in this case it works brilliantly. The film's core is Leonardo DiCaprio's conflicted undercover cop, Billy Costigan. He plays this very straight, and does a great job. What we are seeing is the world through Costigan's eyes, a regular guy's view of the ridiculousness of office politics in crime and law enforcement. When you're an undercover cop, the straight-laced police hierarchy (Baldwin and Sheen) seems comic. When you've overcome a tough childhood, phony toughness (Wahlberg) seems ridiculous. When you've struggled to make it in life, those who've had it easy but act otherwise (Damon) appear pathetic. When you're an honest guy thrown into a world of crime, the paranoia and wrath (Nicholson) seems otherworldly. By having these supporting actors put that bit of ""top spin"" on their characters, it gives us the viewpoint of the main character.<br/><br/>This movie (as also suggested) is quite vulgar. Expletives tossed out at every turn, the petty (and not so petty) bickering and demeaning that fills up this world. This movie is *highly* quotable (something not said about too many movies today). Some of the lines are hysterical! Of course, this is Martin Scorsese, so the film is quite violent. But these comical interchanges between bitter rivals keeps it light, you're not drowning in a sea of blood but are peppered with comedy amongst the carnage.<br/><br/>The writing, of course, is really top-notch. This is a clear case where the writing makes the movie. The writers did a great job keeping the plot complex and surprising, yet intimate. The banter between characters is superb. The plot itself is not wholly original, so you may think ""I've seen this before."" I suggest you pay attention to how the pieces are put together: this is more of a character study than an action film, although there's plenty of the latter. And they did a beautiful job making an ending unlike most films of this genre. You do want to watch it all the way through. I don't know what the qualifications are for an Original Screenplay Oscar, if this fits the rules then these guys should surely be nominated.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is also terrific. I don't know who's doing that Irish-ska-punk sound heard at various points, but I'd love get one of their CDs.<br/><br/>I would love to see Martin Scorsese get his Oscar. I'm not entirely sure if the Academy will give it to him for ""The Departed"". Personally, I think it's a great movie, well-crafted, and Oscar-worthy, but I could see how the voters may be put off by the violence, vulgarity, and over-the-top acting by the various leads.<br/><br/>However, if the rest of this season is like the season that has already passed, full of uninteresting crapola, ""The Departed"" should be a shoo-in for at least a nomination.<br/><br/>10 out of 10, a ranking I haven't used for many movies in 2006.<br/><br/>Barky"

","I saw The Departed last night, and already expecting a great movie I got even more: the BEST movie. I officially declare this the best movie of 2006, without a doubt.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson plays an Irish mafia boss, who is hunted by a rat in his mob. He also has a gang member who is a rat in the police department. The two rats do not know about each others' double identities. With Matt Damon, Leo DiCaprio, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg and more...<br/><br/>What is great is not just the great double embedded story, but the way the two chase each other without knowing who to target. And the acting is phenomenal.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson returns as a villain and is the most evil and ruthless he's ever been (compare to ""Batman"" or ""The Shining""). DiCaprio is intense, and delivers some of the best fight scenes captured on film. You will believe assault can be an art form. Matt Damon is in top form. Wahlberg is the most Irish you'll ever see him. And Martin Sheen is the father figure he obviously wasn't in real life.<br/><br/>I want to pay special attention to the music. Twice, they use the Dropkick Murphys' cover of Woody Guthrie's ""I'm Shipping Off to Boston"". Once when Leo goes to jail and again later when the mafia marches into battle. This tune is loud, intense and violent... pure perfection. Scorsese could have just used incidental music, but he knows when to get a modern rock song and this was one of those times.<br/><br/>Go see this movie and love every minute of it, just like I did."

","Critics and fans alike are hailing ""The Departed"" as a return to form for director Martin Scorsese, and though I don't exactly know what a return to form is for a director who's made such a list of diverse films, I understand the sentiment.<br/><br/>""The Departed"" is not as good as ""Taxi Driver"" or ""Raging Bull,"" but it is as good, and maybe even better, than ""GoodFellas."" Like ""Fellas,"" it's fast, brutal and wildly entertaining. But also like ""Fellas,"" it comes off as fairly glib and lacking in the greater psychological or social meaning that made ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Raging Bull"" such great films.<br/><br/>It's nearly intolerably exciting at times; I came out of the theatre actually sweating. Scorsese gets terrific work out of his male ensemble (and lone female, Vera Farmiga), especially Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, who play moles on either side of the cops and robbers divide and end up hunting each other. Scorsese's point, that the line between those that break the law and those that enforce it is hopelessly blurred, is obvious and easy. But the film is so well acted and so technically accomplished that you feel that you're in the presence of greatness, even if the story itself is standard-issue pot boiler stuff.<br/><br/>The ending is somewhat of a let down. It feels like the screenwriter got lazy, and instead of resolving matters in a creative fashion, decides that the best way to tie up loose ends is to kill off virtually the entire cast, with one blow-your-brains-out shot after another. But the overly tidy ending does not diminish the impact of this propulsive, addictively watchable and disturbing film.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

Alec Baldwin gets the He-really-looked-and-acted-like-a-local-Irish-American-bully-cop Award. No awards for Marky W... he was just playing himself back in Southie. Great retelling of a notorious Boston story. Can't wait to see the one about the Big Dig, Mr. Monahan. I hope Whitey and his brother Billy Bulger got a chance to see this one. I think Scorcese went a little Little Italy on the violence. Too many bullet wounds and not enough baseball bats and beer bottles, the more traditional weapons of Boston hoodlums. A gripping suspense thriller most of the time. A short 152 minutes. It's a shame that Monahan's villains met a moralistic end. Life here in Boston just hasn't worked out that way."
"Romster","3","3","6","19 October 2006"," Awful
","If you have seen the original this film is awful in comparison. Read any of the reviews by people that have seen it. The average rating among them is probably 4/5, not 8.6. Its a shame more people haven't seen the original. <br/><br/>To quickly sum up:<br/><br/>1) The characters are weak compared to the original (apart from Sam) 2) Infernal Affairs (the Original) is like Heat but shorter. This is a poor remake - just like all the Hollywood remakes have been<br/><br/>Infernal Affairs is miles better - and this is from someone that hardly ever watches foreign movies (because I can't be bothered reading subtitles) :)"
"revival_in_canada","10","3","6","11 October 2006"," Best Movie This year!
","There were many reasons why i wanted to see this movie. The handful of talented actors, Martin Scorsese directed it and even the commercials were pulling me in. I couldn't help but go, which was a good thing i did. The movie had me leaning forward and gripping my arm rests the whole time. Martin made Boston seem like Brooklyn New York. A dangerous daring gangster movie. I was happy with every actors performance in this movie, Jack Nicholson was very different from his usual character, of course he's been evil before but he made his character menacingly evil. Other actors such as Mark Wahlberg,Matt Damon,Martin Sheen and Baldwin had stellar performances but what I think made this movie excellent was Leonardo Dicaprio. He was very involved with his character, made you involved with his character. You felt pain when he did. Made the movie almost seem real. If you watch this movie you won't get it out of your head until you see it again, which you will. I watched this movie get onto the best of all time list within two days, I'm not the only one who's impressed. I expect this movie to win awards, countless. Even in the Oscar department I wouldn't be surprised to see Leo win an award. Now could you say this was Scorsese's best movie, no, that's hard to say but this movie no doubt is one of his best."
"guitarzank5","10","3","6","11 October 2006"," Hands down the best movie I've seen all year
","I expected The Departed to be an excellent film, but the final product blew me away. The story, the cast, and the direction were amazing. DiCaprio has improved with each performance he's given, and he is at the top of his game in this one. Damon plays a perfect foil, a smooth and sneaky character that was so easy to hate and yet remained empathetic. Nicholson was memorable as mob boss Costello, a twisted character that was made for him. The supporting cast, especially Baldwin and Wahlberg, were just as great.<br/><br/>The story was engrossing from start to finish, and Scorcese presents it with style and visual flair. He uses music and camera angles to great effect. No one can deny he is a master of the trade. Monahan's adaptation is tight and balances story with character perfectly.<br/><br/>Look out for The Departed come Oscar season. I have seen a lot of movies this year, but The Departed blows them all out of the water. Easily the best Scorcese film since Goodfellas, The Departed deserves your hard earned money more than anything in the theaters this year."
"tghoneyc","9","3","6","11 October 2006"," Scorsese's Back!
","As an avid fan of the original ""Infernal Affairs"" I can say this one just about equals it. Borrowing a premise and a few memorable scenes, it creates an original vision by substituting the Irish gangs of South Boston for the Chinese mob of the first film.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson, as mob boss Frank Costello, creates an honestly larger-than-life character. A monster who chews scenery as only Jack could. The first scenes feature a younger Costello, roaming his neighborhood in the mid '80s, and help set the pace of the entire movie as he recruits and trains a young boy named Colin Sullivan--later to join the State Police in the form of Matt Damon.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio gives what is probably the film's best performance as the other side of the coin, Billy Costigan, recruited by fatherly Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) and his controversial colleague Sgt. Dignam (an explosive Mark Wahlberg). With few exceptions, DiCaprio has never really fit his roles (he was great in ""The Aviator,"" but he looked too young). Here he perfectly portrays the manic, stressful situation he's been placed in as the cop infiltrating Costello's crew of thugs.<br/><br/>Both men end up falling for psychiatrist Madolyn (the very talented Vera Farmiga) in what feels like a Hollywood love-triangle. But given the rather low-key way it is played out, it doesn't feel too corny, despite the improbability.<br/><br/>Alec Baldwin offers some hilarious scene-stealing moments as Damon's superior. And British actor Ray Winstone gives a cold, menacing performance as Costello's bodyguard, Arnold French.<br/><br/>Scorsese's direction feels fresh, not necessarily from his style, so much as the cross-cutting style he uses feels so totally different from anything else out there recently. And his use of music, as always, works to great benefit.<br/><br/>The cast is absolutely stellar. William Monaghan really gives these characters depth. Jack does too. And Scorsese is at the top of his game once again.<br/><br/>All I will say about the ending is, I thought I'd never see a movie end this way. But to be vague, it's all tied up in the end.<br/><br/>Will this movie win Oscars? Maybe. It's got the acclaim, but I still wouldn't be surprised if it gets overlooked for whatever reason."

I almost can't come up with the words. All I can say is this had better win some Oscars, especially for Scorsese and DiCaprio, they both deserve them. Everyone must go see The Departed!! Now, I do agree with the last comment, though, if you have a weak stomach or don't like violence then this is definitely not the movie for you.

"Da_Playboi","9","3","6","10 October 2006"," My favorite film of the year!
","Martin Scorsese's newest film, ""The Departed,"" will be sure to take audiences on a thrill ride they won't soon forget. The film has a great ensemble cast that's headed by: Leonardo DiCaprio (Billy Costigan), Matt Damon (Colin Sullivan), and Jack Nicholson (Frank Costello). <br/><br/>""The Departed"" is a character driven piece that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The film follows an undercover cop, DiCaprio, as he attempts to infiltrate a deadly mob ring lead by Nicholson. Not to be out done by the police, Nicholson installs a rat of his own (Damon) to keep him abreast on police activity. The movie evolves into a cat and mouse tale like no other, with each side trying to determine who's the rat.<br/><br/>For Scorsese fan they will be delighted to see that the man has not lost his touch. The films brilliant editing and camera work will make sure that your viewing experience will not be a dull one. Along with, the film comes with a great soundtrack, invocative of the streets of Boston.<br/><br/>Great dialogue, directing, and performances make ""The Departed"" a must see film. Action, drama, comedy, this movie has it all. After seeing ""The Departed"" I cannot wait to see it again, and I encourage everyone to go see for themselves."
"Nightman11","10","3","6","10 October 2006"," It doesn't get any better than this
","Martin Scorsese has been a renowned film maker for quite some time but he has just now reached his peak. I was in sheer amazement after seeing his newest The Departed, remake of the Japanese version Infernal Affairs. Scorsese mixes his classic style of films like Goodfellas and Taxi Driver with a new age swing that makes for the ideal film.<br/><br/>The film is about an undercover cop(Dicaprio), a high ranking police official(Damon), and an underground city crime runner(Nicholson). Also starring is Mark Whalberg, Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin. The movie is action packed from start to finish as a plot continually unfolds about a mole within the police station during the pursuit of Nicholsons arrest. All of these premier actors live up to their name as DiCaprio and Nicholson lead the way. Don't be surprised if Leo's name comes up during Oscar season. He really put on a performance not to be forgot. Nicholson also succeeded admirably. He creates a sense of intimidation up to DeNiro status.<br/><br/>This film is by far the best picture I've seen this year and I don't see it being topped. I simply cannot think of a more entertaining, riveting, and well acted film I've seen in many years. I can't recommend it any higher. 10/10. Bravo Scorsese!"
"eckhouse24","10","3","6","10 October 2006"," Scorsese is Back!!!!!!!
","The Departed **** out of ****<br/><br/>Over the past 5 years, it seemed as though Martin Scorsese was spending too much time trying to win himself an Oscar for best director that the films he was making, though good, were not typical Scorsese films. Gangs of New York and the Aviator were both good films though it seemed as though I wasn't watching a Scorsese film. After viewing The Departed, all I can say is that Scorsese is back.<br/><br/>This film almost seems to be a screw you to the Academy. He did his best to conform to Academy style to win his award and when all was done, Scorsese was left standing statue less. Now, Scorsese returns to a genre that has made him one of the best directors in the business. The Departed is a crime drama that is bloody and vulgar just the way Scorsese has made films in the past.<br/><br/>The Departed has an all-star cast that includes Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg.<br/><br/>Nicholson plays Frank Costello, a villainous crime boss who under the eye of the Boston Police and FBI. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan, a police cadet hired to go secretly undercover to be an informant Sheen and Wahlberg. It is later learned that not only does the authorities have an informant in Costello's crew, but Costello has an informant in the State Police.<br/><br/>All the cast members give an outstanding performance. It is hard to say who had the best performance because they were all great. Nicholson, who has been doing a lot of comedies lately, reminds us just how great of a villain he can be. DiCaprio reminds us once again that he is a better actor then Titanic would suggest.Damon once again shows us why he is one of the better actors today. And though both Wahlberg and Baldwin both have small parts, they come across as great performances.<br/><br/>The film runs in at about 2 1/2 hours but it certainly doesn't feel like it. There are no slow moments which is good for a long film. Scorsese has a brilliant talent for mixing a great soundtrack with a great film. Look at Goodfellas and Casino. Both of their soundtracks help push the films along. The violence is in your face as it should be with a story like this.<br/><br/>In doing this film, Scorsese may bring himself a best director award at the Oscars without trying as hard as he did in the past. Many feel he was robbed back in 1990 for Goodfellas and it would only be fitting that he gets an award for this film being this film is his most violent since Goodfellas. Lets just hope that Kevin Costner isn't working on Dances With Wolves II."
"crex0408","10","3","6","10 October 2006"," Brilliant
","This was easily the best movie I have seen this year, maybe even this decade. This is the ""Goodfellas"" or ""Pulp Fiction"" of this decade. The story is put together by Scorsese so well that when it hits you it never lets up. The performances are top notch. Leonardo DiCaprio steals the movie from power man Jack. His character is so perplexed and caught up in this mess, you begin to feel his pity. Damon is excellent as someone who truly only looks out for himself and has no heart. The surrounding cast is also excellent surrounded by the power. Kudos to Mark Walberg and Vera Farminga. The Departed is so well paced that when the climax his it leaves you stunned.Unfourtanly when the climax begins it obvious the fate of all. Scorese gets this genre better than anyone. This is a movie about crime, but so much more. See it ASAP!"
"LTCRKeats","9","3","6","10 October 2006"," Betrayal at its zenith.
","The Departed is excellent entertainment from some of America's best actors and one of its best directors. Not a totally believable story line, but who cares? It was believable enough to entertain and not lose the audience. It allowed good actors to do excellent work.<br/><br/>The basic story is the head of the Boston Mob (Nicholson)plants an informant in the Massachusetts State Police (Damon)and the State Police plant an informant in the mob (DiCaprio). Both sides figure out there is an inside informant and go looking. The chase and final chapter are great action and great drama. The final 5 minutes are not what you expect which adds to the fun and entertainment. If you have trouble with blood and bad language, this is not your movie. The language and blood are not inappropriate to the story, these are mobsters not school kids.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson is still Jack Nicholson. With the right part, he is still one of the best. Matt Damon is wonderful as the mole and does some of his best acting. His character has no conscience and that fits the part. DiCaprio is a more difficult and troubled character, but he carries it well. Wahlberg (a state trooper supervisor) is an unlikable jerk, but does redeem himself in the end.<br/><br/>If you go to movies to be entertained and enjoy a mobster movie, don't miss this one."
"tomrito","10","3","6","9 October 2006"," Best American movie in a long time
","Martin Scorsese was already a great America artist but what he has done here transcends mere movie-making and restores my faith in the ability of people today to make a masterpiece. Every week I go to the theater hoping to see a film that will blow me away, and it was getting to the point where I was really thinking that will never happen again. Thank you Mr. Scorsese for a truly great American film. Everything is almost perfect, great story telling, great acting, and great musical score. It's very telling when a crime drama, lased with violence and corruption, still manages to have more humor then most of the comedies produced today. The characters are so well developed and intense, that every scene, every piece of dialogue is mesmerizing. All set to some of the best backdrops ever seen on film. Oh, and one last thing, anyone who thinks that Jack's portrayal is over the top, doesn't have a clue. I have been around people like that and the one thing that comes to mind is that truth is stranger then fiction. All of the characters were spot on and if they offend your sensibility, maybe you should stick to TV."
"RandomTask-AP","9","3","6","9 October 2006"," A big, bad, brilliant Scorsese thriller that even gets Boston right.
","Martin Scorsese turns Boston into a bristling stage for a vicious adaptation of 2002's ""Infernal Affairs"". It seems an unlikely transition to make: Hong Kong to Boston. Going from a huge Asian industrial metropolis to a small burg that still looks as though half of it was ripped right out of England would contradict the very basis of the plot. Even the trailer fails to give the feeling that the setting is anything more than Pick-Your-City, USA. It just doesn't seem possible, but Scorsese with writer William Monahan bring their whole adaptation of ""Infernal Affairs"" to life and succeed in making it actually be about Boston. The powerhouse cast (with two hometown consultants built in) doesn't hurt one bit either. This review is certainly not alone in declaring that Mr. Scorsese has just turned in one of the best films of his portfolio and possibly the best film ever set in Boston.<br/><br/>Frank Costello is a deeply entrenched criminal resident who has won the early loyalties of Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon) before Sullivan rises into the upper echelons of the Massachusetts State Police. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) comes from a family of screw-up criminals, but he makes it through the police academy before his relations get him noticed. Those experiences and connections get him set up to be the police mole into Costello's crew. Sullivan's and Costigan's very separate paths bring them both ironically closer to one state psychologist, Madolyn (Vera Farminga, a sharp and talented newcomer). Both cops and criminals make small victories until the need to eradicate the other's mole comes boiling over. The hunt is then on, and no audience sensibility is spared as the reaping begins.<br/><br/>The cast disappears into the story. Matt Damon is a duplicitous bulldog who slides scams by in a hair's breadth. DiCaprio uses an extensive palate of subtle expressions to make Costigan's own double-dealing troubles tangible. Vera Farminga crams more strength into her light frame than many A-list divas. Nobody, including the unpredictable and frightening Nicholson, is winking at the audience. That is not to say that there are no laughs to be had. Every time Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) ends up on screen he steals the scene by pouring a river of endless epitephs, slang and slander on whomever his target happens to be. He and Alec Baldwin's dedicated Ellerby are both priceless verbal whirlwinds.<br/><br/>Scorsese is, of course, a master of his craft. The camera work is never more than it needs to be and he does jarring edits with sound to create a rough feel. Although this is Oscar-level work, there is never a moment that says this is what is on the great director's mind. ""The Aviator"" comes off as a BBC production of a Jane Austen novel by comparison. He wants the story to blow the audience out of their seats and does everything to facilitate that. This is not a moralizing tale, and the blood flows freely. Scorsese places events in front of you and lets them unfold across the screen. Location, production design and story all melt together. <br/><br/>Boston is a difficult city to get down on film. History and politics permeate its often-twisted one-way streets. You can walk from Paul Revere's house past sites of the bussing protests and cross the river to the corporate headquarters of companies that are forging the future of medicine. Ask for directions, and they'll be given with geographic references that consist of Catholic parishes, bars and Dunkin Donuts shops. It's not the sprawling smörgåsbord of interchangeable scenery that LA provides. Although three-quarters of the production was in New York to take advantage of the more economical tax breaks in the Empire State, each location feels distinctly Bostonian. They even get the State Police office building right - and that is one of the most uniquely ugly buildings ever constructed. Places are specific and so are the people. There's no element of camp like Lloyd Bridges's big shamrock hot tub in ""Blown Away"", and nobody in the film is named Murph. Southie and the North End are dead on and actually were among the favorite roosting places for the infamous James ""Whitey"" Bulger, upon whom Jack Nicholson's linchpin character of Frank Costello was based.<br/><br/>(If you're curious about how such a man could exist in this small city, pick up the book ""Black Mass"" by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill. Stories about the real Whitey are even more terrifying than Nicholson makes Costello.) <br/><br/>Wai Keung Lau, Siu Fung Mak and Felix Chong brought that rare new kind of plot thriller to the world with ""Infernal Affairs"". See the original because it is a sharp modern classic. See this film because it is perfectly breathless in its pace, and it never lets you go.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"
"cheezsjm","8","3","6","9 October 2006"," By no means an ""Instant Classic"" but still worth your time
","Well, I must admit this was the first movie I was dying to see in theaters for a long time while it didn't quite live up to the expectations I set, it was still worth seeing.<br/><br/>The Departed sets the mood pretty quick which is good bad thing, as with most movies that follow that format, it quickly reaches a point where it begins to drag some when it came time to wrap up the film, things seemed a little rushed.<br/><br/>Here's the basic premise Matt Damon's character is and up and coming Massachusetts police detective who has deep ties to a high profile mafia member in Boston (played by Jack Nicholson) he uses that connection to help further his own career while also keeping Nicholson's character from being arrested. The other main character is played by Leonardo DiCaprio Leo is sent undercover to keep tabs on Nicholson.<br/><br/>So the plot of the movie becomes, who can catch who first? Damon is trying to help Nicholson find the ""rat"" in his group, while DiCaprio is trying to find the ""leak"" back at the police department who keeps tipping Nicholson off.<br/><br/>It's a pretty cool premise that leads to some great dialogue and tense scenes. DiCaprio does a good job of portraying the ""tormented soul"" part who's in constant fear of blowing his cover Damon does alright playing the dual role of ""poster boy"" cop and smug, crooked cop Nicholson's plays his bad-guy character a bit over the top, but adds a nice comedic element to it in the process there are several ""laugh out loud"" moments in the film which don't disrupt its intensity.<br/><br/>But what helps make The Departed an even stronger film is its supporting cast. Both Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin serve as scene stealers who will have you chuckling to yourself. Martin Sheen turns in a nice performance as the head of the task force looking to take Nicholson down. Relative newcomer (at least in a movie of this scale) Vera Farmiga plays the love interest of Damon and holds her own. Anthony Anderson makes an appearance as well, but really seems out of place in a non-comedic role.<br/><br/>Overall, The Departed was a very well written and entertaining movie my only quarrel came towards the end when there was an element introduced that produced one of those dreaded ""aw, come on"" moments from me.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if this movie will have quite the replay value as some of Martin Scorsese's other works have had but it is definitely worth seeing if you're a fan of the genre or of movies in general."
"stevencrozier","3","3","6","9 October 2006"," Is a coherent & satisfying story too much to ask for?
","I'll give Scorsese credit for assembling a crackerjack cast and borrowing an intriguing Asian action flick plot and hiring a clever American screenwriter to Westernize it. But am I the only person who's angry that he took all those promising elements, spun them out in 2+ hours of pretty entertaining cinema and then wrapped it all up by unveiling a second ""surprise"" rat w/in the police department who proceeds to casually blow the brains out of everyone who could rat out the first rat that we knew about for the whole movie? (And how, by the way, did the 2nd surprise rat know that Damon and DiCaprio were going to be up on the roof of the deserted building having a secret meeting?) This is lazy, sloppy, bad film-making, which Scorsese then tops off by having the first rat (who, surprise surprise, blows out the brains of the surprise rat) whacked to cap off this symphony of carnage and draw his film to a conclusion. Pathetic storytelling, rendered even more pathetic for having been committed by a man who knows better, or at least USED to know better. Hats off, ladies and gentlemen, Martin has departed the building."

Too bloody right they have! This film seriously kicks arse. Scorsese is truly at the top of his game, the action is beautifully filmed. Some top performances from DiCaprio, 2 Whalbergs & Matt Damon. My only criticism is the that there seems to be less of an emotional connection between Sheen & DiCaprio that in the original, but it is more than made up by fast paced intelligent & often hilarious dialogue.

Why cant they just promote the originals instead, since those who thought them up did a great job and a much better job than Hollywood can ever do.

If it weren't for Scorsese's name on the credits no-one would be looking for one either, so you could say it starts off at a disadvantage. This is solid studio formula film-making, trying to give the illusion of substance by overloading the cast.<br/><br/>In story terms it's a good premise with some good scenes that don't really compensate for the weak spots. It's at its best when De Caprio or Wahlberg are on screen, and at it's very worst when Sheen and Nicholson are centre-stage. Both elder statesmen turn in over the top cartoons that just stop the film dead for a bit of grandstanding. The rest of the cast vary, but Ray Winstone really should find a new ac, because his tough guy act is almost as much self-parody as Nicholson's scary monster mobster.<br/><br/>Don't expect too much, and you'll probably feel satisfied. Just don't go looking for something this film isn't. It's just another studio picture that wants to be a blockbuster more than it wants to be a really good film."

"gromit-17","4","24","97","3 October 2006"," A Very Disappointing Re-make
","I went to the screening with high hope but was very disappointed for several reasons: 1. The movie is way too long. It added too many uninteresting sub-plots which distracted from the original taut and suspense story. It's confusing and anti-climax. One time during the screening, my friend turned to me and whispered he's lost with what's going on. <br/><br/>2. The movie has a very inconsistent tone to it. From the trailers, most people would think the background of the movie was set a while back, and it said 'Some Years Ago' at the beginning of the movie. However, if you count how many scenes used the compact cell phones and annoying text messaging over and over and over again, then it didn't look right! The mob still acted like mob in 60's but they were using latest cell phones dealing with 'micro-processors'. Eh?! The movie feels and looks like an extra long version of cell phone commercial. What happened to the original nail-biting Morse code tapping scene? <br/><br/>3. The cast has no chemistry! It took me ½ hour into the movie to distinguish Leonardo from Matt. The lead actress is very 'ordinary' and not very interesting at all. Jack is Jack, doing his psychotic hybrid of 'Shinning' and 'Joker' from the Batman. Mark Wahlber (who I usually like) was obnoxious! Alec Baldwin thinks he's still in 'Saturday Night Live' doing all the gay jokes. That lefts Martin Sheen very little screen time to gain my sympathy for his character's death.<br/><br/>4. The key pivotal scenes were let downs from the original, including the falling body and elevator scene at the end of the movie. It supposed to evoke sadness and shock, not disgust and laughs. (Seriously, audience in the screening started to laugh at the elevator scene, which I don't think is the response the movie intended to get out of viewers). And the 'extra' ending was so lame! OK, it got the cheers from the audience, but it was so art-less from the original. Sometimes the ultimate punishment is not death, but to be alive and to carry the burden of shame and guilt forever. <br/><br/>I'd rather watch the stylish original 'Infernal Affairs'."

The bottom 250 would be more appropriate.<br/><br/>I reckon the reason Martin Scorsese has never won an Oscar is simply that he's never deserved one. As the master of overrated films he should be avoided, The Departed continues this trend.<br/><br/>Gratuitous and often unexplained violence is liberally scattered around the hour too long the film lasts.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson plays Jack Nicholson,. Ray Winstone plays Ray Winstone,. Leonardo DiCaprio starts OK and then over acts his way into making me laugh almost as much as he appears to be ready to burst into tears.<br/><br/>I cannot understand how this film has been rated so highly by so many, I can only assume that the recent reduction in numbers of bloody and vicious films has brought some sadists out of the woodwork.<br/><br/>Films need a steady storyline, either flowing or twisting, with a little consistency, the Departed doesn't possess this, instead my feeling after seeing the film, added to one of great disappointment, was that the story was made up as the film was being made, and that much of it had been left on the cutting room floor."
"dcw-12","5","4","10","1 January 2008"," The most overrated film of all time perhaps?
","This film is so overrated it bugs me badly. I simply do not get how this can be considered a good film. I will detail the problems with this film.<br/><br/>1. Jack Nicholson is totally and utterly unbelievable as the 'hard' mobster. He carries no weight with him, his presence commands no respect. He appears as he is a decadent and overblown 60 year old in a sweater. Yes he does some horrid things to make you go 'oooh he's nasty'. But it all feels hollow, and manipulative. He never brings any menace to the screen at all.<br/><br/>2. I love Leonardo DiCaprio, but Leonardo as a mobster. Come on. Not believable. He also horribly overacts the scenes where Nicholsons character is sniffing around him to find him out if hes a rat or not. In fact he overacts through the whole thing. Was endearing when he was a kid, but now its OTT.<br/><br/>3. Characterization is sorely lacking. Marky Marks character is terribly 1 dimensional and all he ever does is attack everyone in front of him and scream 4 letter words. Sheens character seems promising but is another empty shell who is never explored. The only full and believable character in the film is Matt Damons character. Everyone else seems like a cardboard cutout. Baldwins character seems like a guy out of a bill brasky skit.<br/><br/>Bad script, mixed acting, totally unimmersive and unbelievable from start to finish. With no real redeeming observations or commentary on all the violence and destruction we're seeing.<br/><br/>Crummy movie and the most overrated movie I've ever seen. Unbelievable I feel like i'm in some Citizen Kane reality where you can throw a bunch of big names in a movie directed by a big name and people will pretend garbage is actually a good movie."
"MiloMindbender","5","4","10","2 March 2007"," Tries too hard to be clever & fails miserably
","I rented this because of all the rave reviews, though I must say that after Goodfellas, I don't expect much from Scorsese. While it is watchable & not awful, there are at least 100 films in my queue that would have been more worthwhile. Almost every scene in this movie plays out like a rehash from another movie, so I was surprised to see that this was supposed to be a remake of Infernal Affairs (which I thought was quite good). Nothing in this movie rings true (a psychologist that dispenses drugs to patients after they've asked for them, a chief of police who hires a rat to find out who the rat in the department is, a graduate of the police academy who works his way up to the top in less than a year....the implausibilities are endless). The dialog & plot are quite contrived, the acting is always over the top (everyone has to use expletives all the time). The movie just spends too much time trying to be clever and not enough time developing any believable characters or plot. It's a sad commentary on the poor taste of the masses that a film this bad can get such a high rating."
"laura-727","Null","4","10","10 October 2006"," No disrespect to the fans - help! does anyone else think this film awful?
","I would like to say this is just my opinion, and I wanted to post a message to see if I was totally alone in it! I am meaning no disrespect or saying ""you are wrong!"" to the people who liked this film! I saw this film the other night, and well from the off I thought it was absolutely terrible. The script just seemed to be full of macho swearing nonsense and very little else - however the premise of two parallel characters was very interesting, and I thought DiCaprio did his role justice - but the film never took them anywhere near the depths that would have made it truly engaging. There seemed to be lots of contradictions - jack nicholsons character was painfully 2 dimensional and so very unrealistic. I mean no one is that superficial are they? Banging on about p***y and money to illustrate a personality doesn't seem to suggest much of one, especially not a complex individual who would be dancing the fine line of crime and citizen. Even the tag line is a bit of a car crash cliché (the one about barrel of a gun blah blah blah). Is anyone else fed up with this Hollywood-fed nonsense dressed up to be ""gritty"" or ""real"" or ""profound""? People seem to love this film - what has happened to telling a good story well!"
"imdbuce","5","4","10","9 October 2006"," Less than the sum of its parts
","How can a remake of a great film by a great director with a good cast end up being less than the sum of its parts? We can blame it on the writer, William Monahan, who adapted it from the film Infernal Affairs. In Monahan's hands, he managed to rip out the heart of the original film leaving only the superficial cops and robbers story. Monahan turned a psychological thriller about the difficult choices complex characters face into a standard ""I-am-undercover-and-I'll- do-anything-to-cover-my-butt"" cop movie. Not that the superficial cops and robbers story is bad, it just isn't enough of a reason to remake a movie.<br/><br/>If you have not seen Infernal Affairs, see it. Then go back and see this movie again. Then tell me that they really needed Mark Wahlberg's character and the Hollywood ending."
"phenomynouss","1","4","10","8 October 2006"," It was very good, but the ending left me unfulfilled
","Coming in to ""The Departed"", I was lucky to already know what the plot was about (some trailers are so obscure as to not mention jack-crap about the plot, to hide the fact that it sucks) and it got four stars (highest rating) in my local newspaper's movie reviews, with lots of great mention on acting and drama and directing.<br/><br/>The movie was very well-done. It was a bit confusing in the start as some of the actors mumbled and made it hard to understand them, but this didn't deter from the plot as though you missed something important. The directing style wasn't too special at first, but showed some definite high points and strengths later on (the scene where Martin Sheen's character, chief Queenan, is thrown from the roof of a building in slow motion, a bunch of people in the theater I was in gasped audibly, and even more so when he hit the ground)<br/><br/>The acting of Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon, not just in the movie, but in their roles as rats, were very convincing (some scenes with DiCaprio, and Frank Costello suspecting him as the rat, made me genuinely think he wasn't a rat, but rather pretending to be one.)<br/><br/>The dialog is crisp and never seems to falter with uselessness or insanity or something off the wall completely. My only complaints were that Matt Damon's character Colin Sullivan had some unexplained obsession with the golden dome roof of a church, in which he'd constantly stare at in his apartment. This was never explained or even delved into in the least. Another was the mild hint at Costello slowly going crazy over the course of the movie. I didn't see this at all. He did some eccentric things in the later course, but nothing to truly qualify as ascending derangement.<br/><br/>The movie peaked when the two rats discovered each other out (after Costello's death) and DiCaprio's character William Costigan went out trying to expose him, even going so far as to lure him into a trap and trying to arrest him, despite not being a cop (his identity was erased for secrecy reasons during his mission, which only the police chief who was killed knew, and the Sergeant played by Mark Wahlberg, Seargent Dignam, who left the police force rather than hand over the identity of their rat in Costello's group).<br/><br/>It all seemed to go downhill from here as Billy Costigan is killed by an officer who was revealed to be a second rat working for Costello, who then let Sullivan go. He then killed one of the officers who was friends with DiCaprio's character, and then was killed by Sullivan. Then he went home, to discover Dignam there, who then killed him and wandered off.<br/><br/>The final scene is that of Sullivan's balcony, with a view of the golden dome church, and a rat on the banister sniffing something. For some reason, this ending left me unfulfilled, and a bit disappointing, almost anti-climactic for a movie which was building up so much intensity, complexity, and drama."
"oodarkstalkeroo","5","4","10","7 October 2006"," wow.. sorry it wasn't what i was expecting
","Taxi drive, Raging bull, Goodfellas, Casino...those Martin Scorsese films i have watched over and over again, every time finding a new reason why to watch it again. compelling plot, gripping character and a solid story from the beginning to end. Unfortunately (and I'm sure some wont agree) this movie only had one, the gripping characters. its almost like having the recipe down pack, and just letting it burn in the oven in the last step, and as a Martin Scorsese fan, i was not happy. Jack, Damon, Mark, and Leonardo all did a marvelous job in the movie, but unfortunately that did not safe the fact that a 2hr and 30min film managed to wrap up the entire story plot in a mere 5mins and 4 bullets. now its not like I'm expecting a long dramatic cliché ending where the good guy prevails, but with all the detail that was put in the earlier part of the movie, you would expect more satisfaction, maybe in the form of detail, when it came down to wrapping up a Scorsese film. now I'm not going to say it was not a good movie, because i know a lot of people have put this on their top 10, but for the quality that some of us have come to expect from Martin Scorsese, the ending was too cut and dry for the endurance of an 2hr rat chase.~darkstalker"
"Vinegaroon3","5","5","14","10 October 2006"," Bloated....overly long....but decent
","I do not understand some of the raves about this movie. It was simply an average to slightly above average 90 minute thriller stretched into 140 (or thereabouts) minutes.<br/><br/>The premise was sort of astonishingly unbelievable. Nicholson's character is a street wise gangster....who for reasons not really clear takes on a crew member who had just completed (or nearly completed) the State Police academy. ""I am not a cop...honest"" seems to be all he needs to say in order to go DEEP undercover in the Boston underworld. Right. There is no ""trial period"".....immediately this ex-cop turned gangster is made privy to the gang's most critical secrets, including murders and assorted other felonies. THEN, when it soon becomes apparent that there is an informer in their midst, they are unable to focus in on the obvious suspect. In addition, despite having irrefutable evidence of crimes that would put Nicholson's character UNDER the jail for 300 years, that is not enough for them to move forward with arrests and prosecutions...???? The movie also seriously drags in many places, like the ridiculous relationship with the police psychiatrist. The ending is completely unimaginative, and actually was sort of a surprise because it was so predictable. I was expecting at least some sort of a plot twist to be revealed. Wrong.<br/><br/>This movie might be worth watching on DVD if you have no other good choices, but don't waste your money at the theater."

","Two just-graduated officers from Massachusetts Police Academy follow opposite sides of the law: William Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is assigned to work undercover with the Irish mobster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) to get evidences to arrest him. His true identity is only known by his superiors Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) and Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen). The protégée of Costello, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), is promoted in the Boston Police Force and is the informer of Costello. Each police officer gives his best effort trying to disclose the identity of the other ""rat"".<br/><br/>""The Departed"" is a good movie, with a great cast, but never deserved to be nominated to the Oscar. There are dozens of better movies, and even ""Donnie Brasco"" is better and better. The exaggerated and absurd story and situations have no credibility; some dialogs are simply ridiculous; shows prejudice against the Catholic Church with free aggression; the romance between William and the incompetent psychiatrist is senseless; and the character of Jack Nicholson is full of clichés and awful lines. A guy with such stupid attitudes could never be a powerful boss. Now I understand why Martin Scorsese asked to double check whether his name really was in the envelope of the Oscar. He probably knew that this movie could never be an Oscar winner, and he was afraid that it could be a joke. Actually it was another shameful joke of Hollywood.

Matt Damon was OK but even he couldn't save it. If I could give this film a rating of negative 20 stars, I would."
"rmax304823","7","3","7","26 May 2007"," Pulls you in.
","""The Departed,"" a complicated story of two cops undercover on each side of the law, one of them in the pay of head Irish mafioso, Jack Nicholson, has Martin Scorsese's usual dash. It would be hard to mistake the film as having been made by some unimaginative dullard. The camera swoops grandly about, punctuated by the odd overhead shot, the actors perform at their peaks, intrigue informs every act, the violence occurs as necessary and isn't exulted over. Scorcese knows what he's doing.<br/><br/>I'm not sure, though, that he's able to get inside this loosely organized bunch of non-Latin thugs, or inside the justice system of Boston. This is a kind of tense story that really belongs in Sidney Lumet territory -- marginalized spies with multiple identities, and lots of frustration. Neither of the spies (Leonardo DiCaprio, the good spy, and Matt Damon, the boyishly charming instrument of Nicholson) manages to show any guilt or ambivalence about their jobs, which leaves the film with a considerable psychological and ethical lacuna. Damon is full of zest and worried about nothing but keeping his gangster boss informed of everything the cops are up to. DeCaprio is a neural shambles but not because he feels queasy about being a spy among people he's come to know. He's just frazzled over the possibility of being outed and killed. Still, everything rolls along so quickly that we hardly miss it. And everything is aided magisterially by the quick-witted dialog. Alec Baldwin, head honcho at the State Troopers asks Damon what happened to a suspected murderer. Damon: ""He got knifed in the hawspital."" Baldwin: ""Yeah, but what I want to know is cui bono? Who benefits?"" Damon: ""Cui gives a ****? It's all wrapped up with a bow on it."" Baldwin blesses Damon, making the sign of the cross in the air, says, ""I think you are on your way to becoming a cawp,"" and buries his face in a bowl of ice water. We have just witnessed about fifteen seconds of cinematic delight.<br/><br/>Any weaknesses are not Scorsese's fault, though. Here he's working from a screenplay written by an Irish-American who's given him what amounts to an unusually mechanical plot, and the story itself is lifted from a Chinese source. So it's already gone through three step-up transducers and it's no surprise that it lacks the emotional grip of Scorsese's best work.<br/><br/>It's still successful and it gets a lot of help from the cast. Nicholson is hilariously evil with his goatee and those of his improvisations that have been preserved. (When he shoots a babe in the back of the head, he looks down at her body quizzically and remarks, ""She fell funny."" And, ""When there's a cop in my gang and I don't know who it is, I usually kill 'em all."") Matt Damon does a fine job too, and he has his Boston accent down pat. He's so business-like and full of zest as a sergeant in the State Police that he comes across as the kind of cop we all wish were on the job. I haven't seen that much of Leonardo DiCaprio's movies but of the performances I've seen, this is his best. He's rather rattier looking than in the past and he demonstrates a convincing loss of control. There's a woman, too, who physically links the good and the bad undercover cops, who do not know each other. Vera Farmiga isn't synapse-fusingly gorgeous. The bony structure of her face is askew. She looks like a dozen actresses who might be found laboring in the fields of afternoon romantic dramas or support in modest situation comedies, but there's something still that distinguishes her from so many other women who resemble Jennifer Aniston. She can really act. She's not given the best dialog and her character is a little confusingly written but, boy, she can make a simple movement of her hand into a statement. Also she's built. Imagine Cate Blanchett, more petite and slightly lopsided. Ken Wahlberg, as Sergeant Dignam, may give the best performance of all.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it. Maybe not immensely, but enough to have found a good deal of pleasure in it."
"vargasje","2","3","7","27 March 2007"," Very poor quality
","Sorry to disagree with those who liked the movie, but I have to say that I found it totally unmemorable. This work is definitely not of Oscar quality. I have seen many other Scorsese movies, and frankly, his later work (Gangs of New York, The Aviator) is just terrible. In the Departed the story line is not well presented, there are severe problems with continuity, many dialogs are poorly executed, and I could go on and on. In my opinion, these defects reflect a severe deterioration of Scorsese's craft. I hope he can recover his touch and go back to the excellent craft that he exhibited in his early days. This year there were several movies by far better than the Departed. One has to wonder why the academy gave an Oscar for a work of such a low quality."
"recordplayer","2","3","7","7 March 2007"," Ching Chong Chinese American Gangster??
","Excuse my poor English in this review yet I am addressing everyone to excuse the embarrassing and irrelevant Chinese dialog and characters in this film. Before I divulge as to why this disastrous verdict for The Departed - much of what was going through my mind was not only Asians. The annoying coincidence of romance with the same woman between the 2 protagonists (shallow plot), DiCaprio's identical acting to Blood Diamond (research boys?), same body language and facial expressions... (too easy), Jack Nicholson was someone you really aren't scared of... and Matt Damon was just a dumb a**...long drawn out scenes made the whole film slow and dry...weak acting from the Psychaitrist.<br/><br/>OK back to the Triads. I could not get over the fact that they used American Chinese guys to play the supposed local Chinese triads. Their Chinese dialog was atrocious and embarrassing.Like Westerners trying to talk Cantonese. Did they run out of people to hire?? Whoever wrote the Chinese dialog part of that scene should be sacked. Very unlocal Chinese pronounciation the Chinese right and the dialog was like formal Chinese. Can you believe there was NO swearing at all???!!!... Weak. So if they had such a bad Chinese accent, why speak Chinese at all? They are obviously brought up in the USA. Sigh, another sad moment in a US film. That killed the film completely. My advise is to go see Infernal Affairs and realize that the original film is smart, original, very intense and at least you did not want the film to end!"
"babasarah","1","3","7","1 March 2007"," Stupid Ignorant Garbage
","I love the director for some of his former movies however this was one of the dumbest movies I have seen. In reality people that have to use such derogatory language to such an extent do so because they do not have the education and/or intelligence to express themselves properly. This movie did not have any redeeming characters that a person could empathize with. No one's death made me sad, not one character had any depth. The story was convoluted and ridiculous. The only reason I watched the whole thing through was because we were with friends and we both mistakenly thought the other couple were enjoying it. When it was over we looked at each other and shook our heads and felt cheated for having spent any money to view it. Dumb dumb dumb. After seeing it win the Oscars I can only concur with another person that commented, that Scorsese won the sympathy vote and everyone else is caught up in the wave. Sad that such wonderfully talented actors were subjected to such drivel."

If you like chick flicks, you'll love this. Its kinda like a wanna-be sopranos. So my final words are rent it if your out of ideas. Just a really bad storyline. You can tell someone was out of ideas or the movie was going over budget. They should have made it last 3 hours long and made a much better ending. Way too many ideas in the movie and plot really doesn't go anywhere. My advice is if your very intent on watching the movie, watch it until 32. After that your in a state of WTF."

","First off, when I heard the Rolling Stones song that was also played in Goodfellas playing in The Departed, I knew we were not going to be seeing a film with too much of its own merit. It makes it weak enough in the first place that it is based on a Hong Kong film.<br/><br/>Here's my other complaints with the film: - Why is William taking painkillers? So, he drinks cranberry juice (like a woman on her period? I'm a woman, and I've never heard of that. Perhaps it is something they do in backwoods Boston?). Oh, and he drinks cranberry juice, not alcohol, so we are to believe that he would be OK then with popping Oxycontin or sleep meds? Hmmm...<br/><br/><ul><li>Oh, but then later, we see him guzzling from a bottle of wine. Uh, when did that start? Please, if you're going to make a point about a character's character, be consistent.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why does the shrink go to coffee with William? Even Kelly McGillis' character in Top Gun had a REASON for having dinner with Tom Cruise's character: she wanted to hear about the Mig. So, we are to believe the shrink goes to coffee with William, because, uh, because he's Irish and impervious to psychoanalysis, so she wants to be the first shrink to crack an Irishman? - And how did William find out where she lives? He just shows up there, comments on her photo, then they go at it? - What was up with Sullivan's reaction to the shrink's photo anyway? I never figured that out. Besides the fact that when she was a child, it is doubtful that she would have been wearing a helmet when riding a bike. The photo was a little anachronistic frankly.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Finally, why didn't the shrink open the letter William gave her? And why did Dingham kill Sullivan (nice booties, Marky Mark!) like that? Wouldn't it have been better to take him down, defame him, strip him of everything, and put him in prison where policemen are not treated no nicely? As the shrink said, death is easy, but life is hard. But this movie didn't follow its own wisdom anyway as Costello said that it was always the women that bring the crooks down, and the shrink had nothing to do with the takedown.</li></ul><br/><br/>I could go on with a few other pet peeves I had (did anyone else think that Jack was slipping into his Joker character there for a few scenes there? And what an inconsistent Boston accent he had!). But it just suffices to say, it is a dry season indeed when an eyedropper of a film creates a tidal wave of awards.<br/><br/>""Evuh dance wit' thuh devil in thuh pale moonlight?"" - Joker with Boston accent"

The movie goes in crescendo, the distress and the tension are increasingly strong, up to the final explosion. The plot keeps the spectator interested at all time. The actors are incredibly well directed, emphasizing undoubtedly Jack Nicholson (there can be a better actor in the world?)and Leonardo DiCaprio.

"befrank-1","1","3","7","11 February 2007"," Martin screwed up
","The Departed, a movie by one of the best directors in the world, the one of great milestones of film history such as Taxi Driver, Good Fellas, Cape Fear, Casino, etc. So must be something worth, you think. Sorry to tell you: not at all.<br/><br/>The movie is interesting about movie language, meaning an editing very intense, which wants you not to elaborate what you see but tries to make you absorb it without thinking, which is definitely an important choice, something not easy to realize, something only a great director can do if he has the best professional people around him. As it often happens, when you try to build the pathos in such a way, you may loose the reality. That's what happens to the movie, to say the lesser problem of it.<br/><br/>So we have here a team of policemen who, for doing their daily job of fighting the crime, keep on treating each other very badly (to use an euphemism), keep on insulting each other and on punching each other every time there's a decision to be taken. Imagine if you should work in such a way in your office, if you should punch your colleague every time he has a different opinion from yours... And this is just for the beginning...<br/><br/>Later, in the most dramatic moments of the movie, you will hear the audience laughing. That's the best critic to a movie you can have. When you can't trust trailers and advertising (of course), when you can't trust interviews, reviews, box office result, Academy nominations and eventually awards, best signatures of the world... Than you have the only review everyone HAS to believe: the reaction of the audience. If they laugh, when they should be shaking on their armchair, that means something is wrong, something doesn't work. We saw something like that in The war of worlds, by another promising director named Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>An explanation for that may be that Hollywood has to make movies. If the script is good or not, if it's a serious operation or not, there's a budget to be spent soon and they have to make the movie. In such cases the hope is that, maybe, during the shooting, the right idea will come out to solve that problem of the script. Well, this time the right idea didn't come out. And you'll find it out with surprise.<br/><br/>The movie has some qualities, as I said. We have some good acting performances, especially from Matt Damon, able even to show when he is lying, and in this I recognize the acting directions from Scorsese. Than we have Leonardo Di Caprio who, in order to get rid of his good-boy-face, has to tense all single muscles of his face in every scene...<br/><br/>Mr Scorsese may be running for 10 Oscars, he may have sold for 200 millions, but, together with the audience, we can say Martin, this time, you screwed up."
"charliegeeza","7","3","7","16 October 2006"," Not as good as people say
","I must say, I went into the cinema with high expectations (always a bad idea) and this film did not live up to them. It was ploddingly slow at times. Scorceze is one of those directors whom people loathe to criticise but I think he is also one of those directors who is beginning to believe his own hype. This movie takes time to overemphasise things which add nothing to the plot, such as the religious attachment of Matt Damon's corrupt character. Too much of the movie is reliant upon the charisma of the core actors, especially Nicholson. It almost feels lazy in it's direction.<br/><br/>There are some very good performances. Leonardo Di Caprio is excellent, Jack Nicholson is charismatic. Matt Damon is OK.<br/><br/>Other than being glaringly slow, there were not many problems with the movie. Some careful scene culling and it would probably have engaged me a lot more. Do not believe the hype nor all the ""this is the best ever"" comments from people here. Don't get me wrong, It is good. But it's nothing special. I prefer the Chinese original over this remake - even though I have to read the subtitles! The Departed lacks the flair of Gangs of New York, and lacks the cohesion of the original Internal Affairs."
"ghbscreen","5","3","7","11 October 2006"," Nowhere near the resonance of his earlier work
","I find it amazing that people actually give this piece credibility. I am a massive Scorcese fan, his earlier films were classics, but this is vacuous and dull, and haven't we all seen this kind of thing so many times before? Am I really expected to be shocked by the corruption of police? Goodfellas was a landmark piece with pace and involvement and memorable characters, this doesn't come near.<br/><br/>I'm afraid to say that it seems M.S. has lost his way. This is repetitive easy fare. Looks like he directed this in his sleep. No surprises, no depth of character anywhere and Jack Nicholson doing what he always does. Of course it was well shot with good pace, but with this cast you expect something better. An irritating story, an avalanche of swear words that are debased by their familiarity, and characters you don't care about."

The movie spans more than 2 hours, a lot of which are used to re-iterate irrelevant minute details that don't contribute much to character development, plot, or the general theme. The movie is plain in trying to create a complex story which basically is not all that complex..2 simple parts that cocoon the overall story. watch this movie and judge for yourself, but don't follow the general wave that gives this movie excessive credit where it does not deserve it. Think about it from a third party perspective for a minute..Would this movie be as highly acclaimed and rated if it wasn't directed by Martin Scorcese and starred A-list celebs? imagine a normal cast, I'm pretty sure this movie would be in the same rankings as the lethal weapon series.. 5-7 but definitely not top 250."

","For me, 2006 has been a fairly mediocre year at the cinema. Too many films with excessive special effects that weren't essential to the plot of the film (aside from the fact that most of them had razor thin plots anyway). For me, Departed has blown all the other films I've seen this year clear out of the water. I've been reminded why all of the major actors in this are rated so highly. They've all turned in either medium or mega sized turds in their careers, but they should all rightly be proud of this.<br/><br/>I'll spare you the synopsis of the film. IMDb's own synopsis plus other comments have done that for me. I'll go into the performances themselves.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio turns in arguably his most gripping performance since Basketball diaries or Gangs of New York. A slushy lovable character he certainly isn't in this film; self assured and confident at the beginning, by the middle of it Billy Costigan is a total wreck - still on the right side of the law but losing his mind as he comes ever close to being uncovered and brutally, viciously killed.<br/><br/>Nicholson's Irish accent is next to non existent, but you don't care. He's menacing beyond belief, a particular scene coming to mind between him and DiCaprio when he nonchalantly waves around a severed hand whilst having breakfast to make a point. DiCaprio's character is terrified.<br/><br/>Damon has always been pretty damn good with everything he touches seemingly turning to silver if not gold, but he effortlessly plays a bent corrupt cop who is ultimately out of his depth. Colin Sullivan (his character) will stop at nothing to protect himself and you get increasingly incredulous at how low he'll stoop. Watch for the scene with him in his office on a walkie talkie as he tries to frame another member of the unit to save his own neck (I'm not saying who). It's chilling.<br/><br/>Mark Whalberg provides some black comedy, useful for breaking up the tension and rebuilding it once more. He might (or might not) be bent, but ignore his character at your peril - he's more key to the plot than you realise. The dead pan double routine about sleeping with his bosses sister (played very well by Alec Baldwin - the boss who is out of touch with the brutal truth) who in turn asks how his mother is is great fun.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, Scorsese makes a film with good potential in a fabulous film and will deservedly take much credit for it. It's pretty damn impressive right up until DiCaprio and Damon come face to face; the conclusion of the film will ram itself right in your face and leave you outraged, brutalised, exhilarated and stunned. It's the fastest 2 1/2 hr film I've ever seen and I am seriously contemplating going back to watch it again - something I've not wanted to do since I saw Sleepers - and wasn't that a long time ago... This is really as good as I (and everyone else) is making out. A definite must watch, it's bound to pick up a couple of Oscars next year.."
"nickfonehome","10","3","7","9 October 2006"," Masterpiece!
","I don't get it... How did Martin Scorsese manage to make this movie so great? Well, more or less, everything was at least close to perfect. Somehow, Scorsese figured out a way to combine violence and humor in a way that is anything but cheesy. And that's only one of the incredible accomplishments of The Departed.<br/><br/>Above all else, the characters are so well developed and so likable that even if the plot was awful, I'd still watch this movie. You're looking at a diverse set of characters, who all have some little thing about them that makes it impossible not to find them interesting. I couldn't believe it! And then, you have the plot. Just what you might expect, there are a good many peaks and troughs of action in this movie. But the whole time you're wondering how it's going to end, which makes it possible to avoid the ever-so-cheesy extreme plot twist, while still keeping the audience guessing. And as complex this movie is, everything comes to its neat little conclusion at the end, and there isn't a single question that hasn't been left open beyond necessity. Well done, Scorsese!"
"saintorr","10","3","7","9 October 2006"," Perfect
","The perfect ensemble delivering believable dialogue in a marvellously photographed movie. What more can you ask for £6? I was a little nervous going to this film (I still haven't got over Gangs of New York, which IMHO was a shadow of the film it should have been). Could Marty serve up a spectacle that matched the hype? Would he be able to corral the all-star cast while still allowing enough artistic freedom? Would Jack chew every single scene to shreds? The answers to these questions is an unequivocal YES, YES, YES.<br/><br/>I loved every minute of it and was wrong-footed more than once by the surprise plot twists. What could have been a very predictable good cop/bad cop movie was lifted to Oscar favourite status by sublime direction and a rich screenplay that will, I'm sure, become every bit as quotable as Goodfellas in the years to come.<br/><br/>DiCaprio and Damon are fantastic as the hunters/hunted. DeCaprio has one brilliant scene in particular where the stress of living the undercover life is obvious in his nervous twitches but the Oscar will surely go to Jack Nicholson. He overplays his role to perfection and effortlessly dominates every scene. He plays a perverted psychotic killer who clearly enjoys his job but it's still our Jack and I couldn't help smiling as he revelled in his g(l)ory.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg also deserves a special mention - haven't seen him do anything half as good as this before.<br/><br/>Go and see this film and expect to be entertained."
"adam4432","10","3","7","7 October 2006"," I'll Keep it short for now - excellent!
","I will start by saying what a massive fan I am of foreign cinema - I love the original trilogy - Infernal Affairs. When I first head that a remake was being made I instantly took a harsh stand against it - thinking how could they destroy such a masterpiece of a film (hence what will happen with the Oldboy remake). I watched this last night - had high hopes - excellent cast, excellent director.<br/><br/>The film ultimately was amazing for me - yes the script is very much based on the Infernal Affairs (hence it being a remake). But I can't help but feel that Scorscese really has made this shine.<br/><br/>Another huge surprise for me was Leonardo Di Caprio - thoughts about his role before watching the film I felt I was going to be very disappointed. But I really do feel he deserves an Oscar for this.<br/><br/>Watch it you will not be disappointed - especially if you are a fan of the original trilogy.<br/><br/>Glad it kept it's ""18 / NC-17"" certificate Utterly Adult humour, violence and story in every sense of the word!!<br/><br/>Definite 10/10 for me."
"hpioch2","10","3","7","7 October 2006"," Home Run Scorsese
","This film not only met the high expectations I held for it, but SURPASSED THEM. The Departed was expertly written, crafting each character's development thoroughly, without useless background information that would drag the length of the film. Everything took place ""in the now"" and kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. In fact, the movie flew by, but left me completely fulfilled and overly satisfied, well more like BURSTING AT THE SEEMS WITH EXCITEMENT!<br/><br/>I was very impressed at how the plot took shape, and how every twist that was thrown into the mix never pushed the border of believability, but still wowed the audience entirely. The violence was exceedingly well done and strategically placed, adding the right amount of muscle behind the film, which only enhanced the color of each of the characters. The plot took into account the mindset of it viewers, and gave us an excellent scope into the undercover world of police officers. Whether or not there is complete validity to cut throat mentality surrounding this line of work didn't matter, it had me in complete belief of every character, and every piece of action. In addition to a brilliant script containing superb characters, the directing was also top notch by mister Scorsese. I enjoyed many of the artistic flares and interesting shots, but mostly the artful way he kept that dissonance of the two main characters in the forefront of the viewer's mind, making me as an audience member, really take interest into what was to come of each of them in the end. The finale of this film is bluntand perfect.<br/><br/>I LOVE THIS CAST. Many times star studded movies can fall flat, as they rely on names, rather than writing an performance to draw money to the box office, but this was not the case. Leonardo DiCaprio was astonishing at every moment, and he plays this role PERFECTLY. I personally loved Mark Wahlberg's performance as well, and Alec Baldwin delivered an excellent supporting performance, truly allowing his character to shine, and adding high quality comic relief when needed.<br/><br/>The soundtrack also surprised me slightly, and I loved the Irish flare the dropkick murphys added. It kept things interesting to say the least. Overall this is an EXCELLENT, WELL CRAFTED PIECE OF ART! It will keep you talking for hours after seeing it, and only make you want to see it again, I adore this movie, and without contemplation, it is now one of my new favorite movies of all time...well done, HOME RUN MARTIN!"

Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon, Wahlberg, Sheen, Baldwin even, had some of the best performances I've seen in a long time. I knew this movie was gonna be good, but I had no idea it was gonna be THAT good. I'm not exaggerating when I say this movie is amazing.

","Wow. I'm just speechless. I just got back from seeing this movie, and I still can't believe how incredible this movie was. What I saw tonight was what all movies should try to live up to. Martin Scorsese has created an instant classic with this movie. First of all, this story was an intense thriller that captured my mind from the first scene. It was a good cop/bad cop scenario taken to the next level. This movie forced me to think about the twist turns and connections between the characters. The acting was incredible. Every word, every line, every gesture was true to the character and enhanced the story to the point that I cared about each of the characters and was worried about what would happen to them. To be honest, I expected this this to be a good movie, but I wasn't ready for the awesomeness that pervaded the theatre. Not a word was spoken, because everyone was on the edge of their seats.<br/><br/>P.S. The one-liners were incredible. Be ready to laugh in the midst of everything else taking place."
"adsdmnel","10","3","7","6 October 2006"," Excellence in contrast and delivery
","As ever Scorese has brought together an array of outstanding actors. Jack Nicholson's performance is as usual competent and a well thought out character study. But the gem of the film is Di Caprio, he is awesome it is as though he is growing in stature and becoming a much more grounded actor with immense passion. He really does enlighten the scenes as his character continues to struggle with the conflicts and demons that he faces. He is in the same form as he was in The Aviator in which he deserved an Oscar nomination, maybe a little early to tip him for an Oscar, but certainly worth another Oscar nod for Best Actor.<br/><br/>Scorese is such a clever director, this is probably the only mixed form film he has made. The film ventures to the two extremes of comedy and drama within this film, Scorese carefully delivers the most appropriate balance of comedy to lift the gloomy content within this film (for example the very last shot on the window as the film ends). He continually shows his early influences in many scenes, particularly the scene when Di Caprio is following Damon after the cinema visit (enough said don't want to spoil the story), this reminded me of Taxi Driver and Mean Streets.<br/><br/>Another great partnership is the combination Scorsese with Schoonmaker's editing. She has won several Oscars when working with Scorese and this is certainly her best work. The editing is snappy and executed superbly, creating immense tension especially towards the climax of the film. Thelma Schoonmaker is an outstanding editor and deserves another Oscar, well done.<br/><br/>The complex, clever and intertwining narrative enables the script to follow an excellent structure which never detracts itself away from the core action.<br/><br/>Overall an excellent film, well done Scorese!"
"Danusha_Goska","1","4","11","26 June 2007"," Strictly for Fans of Exploding Heads and Naughty Words; Otherwise, a Complete Bore
","""The Departed"" is garbage.<br/><br/>I don't care how many awards it got. I don't care if Martin Scorcese is such a capital J Genius that his feet don't stink. I don't care if critics reached for their thesauruses in competition for synonyms for ""Brilliant!"" ""The Departed""'s appeal is strictly to those who like watching heads explode on camera and think that if a movie uses every naughty word in the book -- in every line -- that makes it deep and profound. Anyone who swallowed ""The Departed"" needs to have his stomach pumped.<br/><br/>Good grief. Shakespeare, the Greek tragedies, classics like ""The Third Man"" would be lost on these people. As would a truly fine movie from 2006, ""The Lives of Others"", beside which ""The Departed"" looks, at best, amateurish and adolescent.<br/><br/>I want my money back. And I saw this movie for free.<br/><br/>I was so bored I started rearranging the groceries in my bag about ten minutes in. I looked at my watch at least half a dozen times. I thought up drinking games you could play every time Jack Nicholson utters the word *&^%.<br/><br/>Several characters are shot -- or dropped -- to death on camera. A man's eyes are poked out. One character is reduced to a drug dependent, quivering wreck. I didn't care.<br/><br/>I was amazed at how much I didn't care. I thought about why. I examined the desert emptiness of the script, other than for its resplendently brandished naughty words; reflected that the plot was so bankrupt it could be in chapter 11; I noted how absent characterization was, except to mete out how often each character said %$#^, or his posture when exploding a head.<br/><br/>I pondered gossip column narratives involving Alec Baldwin and remembered how cute Mark Wahlberg was in that Calvin Klein ad; I wondered if Leo were still dating the model.<br/><br/>An hour into the marathon that was this Guantanamo torture, I realized that I had been so pounded into boredom and apathy that the only thing that would have aroused me was if the entire oh-so-manly cast were, suddenly, to don black net hose and stilettos, and sing the rest of their lines in Gilbert and Sullivan musical style.<br/><br/>I hoped against hope that Leslie Nielsen would appear and reveal the entire thing to be a very obscure farce whose humor would gel once Nielsen put it all into ""Airplane""-esque perspective.<br/><br/>Was Martin Scorcese trying to prove his own manhood by creating a dystopic Disneyland in which every ride is manned by a cop or a mafioso exploding heads and blurting out swear words? Scorcese insults manhood worse than Andrea Dworkin.<br/><br/>As for art? I guess Scorcese never heard the phrase, ""less is more."" As it happens, I had just seen 1947's ""The Third Man"" the night before. ""The Third Man"" is black and white; its budget, compared to ""The Departed""'s, was tiny. The cast, excepting Orson Welles, consisted of character actors or unknowns.<br/><br/>In ""The Departed,"" Jack Nicholson, playing a Very Bad Man, toys with a severed human hand. What hits you is not the shock and awe the scene demands, but the pathos that the movie is so desperately needy for its audience to respond, and so without skill at provoking that response, that it resorts to the kind of gory tricks a Halloween prankster would pull.<br/><br/>In ""The Third Man,"" Orson Welles delivers ""the cuckoo clock speech."" All he does is talk -- and what he says chilled me and frightened me so thoroughly I'll never forget it.<br/><br/>Now *that's* a classic film.<br/><br/>""The Departed""? Garbage."
"lee_eisenberg","10","4","11","24 February 2007"," This time, they gotta give Martin Scorsese an Oscar.
","The 79th Annual Academy Awards will run tomorrow night, and ""The Departed"" is one of the Best Picture nominees. All that I can say is that they have to award Martin Scorsese this time. ""The Departed"" hits you like I have almost never seen in a movie. It is an absolutely great movie in terms of the acting.<br/><br/>First, we get narration from aging mafioso Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). He's been pragmatic about many things throughout his life, but he's never given up his life of crime and being one of the nastiest people whom you could imagine. Then, there's Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), joining Boston's police force but secretly infiltrating the mafia. Next, there's Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), one of Costello's acolytes secretly infiltrating the police. Add psychologist Madolyn (Vera Farmiga) to the mix, and you have a practically explosive situation.<br/><br/>One thing that you should understand about this movie is that almost every character is a total creep and there are basically no good guys; Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) is particularly bad. With all these characters being so vile, it is no surprise that we see violence and brutality that movies almost never show. It's the sort of stuff that makes you feel like the characters are pounding your face in. Don't be surprised if you walk away from ""The Departed"" feeling very shaken up. And you'll probably never want to be a cop after watching this.<br/><br/>Anyway, I say that even if they don't give the movie Best Picture, they gotta give Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar. His direction is top notch (as is almost every other aspect of the movie). I wholeheartedly recommend it. Also starring Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Kevin Corrigan."
"panquin","3","4","11","20 February 2007"," Pretty awful...I have to say, I hated it
","I'm giving The Departed 3 stars pretty much for getting the film in the camera, and those cameras' ultimate direction by one of the greats, Martin Scorsese. But I'm being nice doing that, because this movie is really quite an awful thing to deal with. Awful to watch; awful to hear; awful to experience. Just plain awful.<br/><br/>Where do I begin? First, the script: it's DOA. I've not seen the original movie The Departed is based on, but apparently the script is tighter than a flea's a**. If so, The Departed does indeed vary from the original in that regard - not Swiss cheese-style holes, but not exactly seamless and tight either. Second, the cell phones. I wanted to laugh out loud in inappropriate places when a cell phone in the movie went off for the 1,000th time. Laughable, and utterly without grace, and if you hated cell phones before, you'll really despise them after The Departed. Third, I didn't care about any character enough to care about what happened to them, whether maimed or killed or something in between. That's not good, you know? That's just about the worst thing you can say about a given story in general/film in particular, but The Departed has not-caring in bucketfuls when it comes to character. Take your pick, try to adhere to the character's base, see if you give a crap whether they're blown to smithereens or not. You won't.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson was ludicrously over the top - a Caligula for the ages who has (possibly) lost all respect for the acting form. Am I saying he's lost his acting chops? No; hardly. I'm saying that respect for the craft of acting has gone into utter and complete hiding. He treated his role in The Departed as a raft of pleasure built solely for his riding, a king both on screen and off, and I could care less, normally, except that Jack's character suffers due to Jack's excesses. And who wins when that happens?"
"Boyo-2","10","4","11","6 October 2006"," See it and you won't be sorry
","I just saw it this morning. 10:00am, Upper East Side. Not what I would call a crowded theater, so that was great.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into the plot or the details, because you've read all the reviews by now.<br/><br/>After about an hour, I said to myself ""well this is not so great, what's all the fuss about?"" I started to think that everyone is so desperate for a good movie they've gone overboard in its praise. I know that the last two Marty/Leo movies had their fans but they had their detractors, too. Scorsese has been accused of trying too hard to appeal to the Academy, and Leo has as many fans as he has people who cannot stand the sight of him.<br/><br/>At one point it all just came together. I guess you could say it snuck up on me, had an 'accumulative' effect. The last 45 minutes are just remarkable. Its so great to leave a movie with that rare 'I just saw a great movie' feeling. I'm still pretty buzzed from it.<br/><br/>I didn't fell like Jack was just being Jack (playing to his audience, with whom he shares some sort of secret that just they know..WINK WINK), I felt like he created a larger-than-life character who's, of course, memorable as hell. Costello is perfectly suited to his legendary ability, and he delivers, and then some.<br/><br/>The real substance is the contributions by Leo and Matt. Playing two sides of the same coin could not have been easy (how did they know what the other was doing? they rarely are on the screen at the same time) but it goes to Scorsese's skill as a director that they work so well together, even though, like I said, they are almost never together. Once review I read put it perfectly - Leo is fire, Matt is ice. You see all of Leo's turmoil just by looking at his eyes. They show you Billy's soul, his conscience. You do not see Matt's conscience, because he does not have one.<br/><br/>Much as I love and respect ""Gangs of New York"" and ""The Aviator"", let's be truthful here..Scorsese is at his very best with this type of thing, and ""The Departed"" makes that point again and again. Nothing wrong with that either.<br/><br/>A movie like this makes it hard to consider seeing something else. Why would you bother? So don't! I might not be able to go on reading that lousy book I started the other day for a couple of days. The movie really does stay with you. 10/10."

But nevertheless, it's a cool flick.<br/><br/>The movie is similar to The Wolf of Wall Street, in that the scenes change rather quickly. It has a fast pace, and never gets boring. There are plenty of memorable actors playing cool character. In fact, the list is endless.

","The actors of Departed are a combination of well known actors: Jack Nicholson, Leonardo Di Caprio, Matt Damon etc.
All actors have their own way of acting. Jack Nicholson is able to act almost everything. If it is a nutcase, a Joker or even a full grown top gangster, Jack Nicholson is able to do this role. The same goes for Leonardo and Damon and all the others. I like the combination of these actors in this movie.<br/><br/>A couple of youngsters who have successfully graduated the police academy and the FBI academy, are ready for the job. However there is one little angle. These youngsters do have attachments to the local mafia ran by Jack Nicholson.
The state police as well as the FBI are more than willing to put Jack away, whether that is behind bars or 6 ft down below, that doesn't really matter. What matters is, is that peace and justice will return.<br/><br/>Like any other American movie where multiple federal police forces are involved (CIA, FBI, State police, DEA) they all have one thing in common. These forces should be on the same side, but at the end they fight amongst each other. The same in this movie (Ok, CIA and DEA are not involved).<br/><br/>If you are looking for a good action movie, the Departed will for sure not let you down!"

Legendary star Jack Nicholson brings his maniac charm to his role as big time gangster Frank Costello, a superb performance from Nicholson who is both funny & scary at the same time!!!
Matt Damon is great as the slimy ""Rat"" who is a cop but works for Frank Costello, a good solid performance from Damon.
Mark Whailberg is excellent in his role as mouthy police sergeant Dignam, he's an intense presence & a cool character.
Legendary old school actor Martin Sheen is also excellent as Queenan, the detective working with undercover Billy & he has some incredibly intense & scary moments.
The beautiful Vera Farmiga gives a great emotional & torn performance as girlfriend of ""Rat"" Sullivan (Damon) & Doctor/love interest to Billy (leo).
Legendary British tough guy actor Ray Winstone is brutally scary & gritty as Mr.French who is Costello's right hand man.

"bbird-29353","3","2","4","22 May 2017"," Too Complex For Its Own Good
","Plot complexity does not necessarily a good movie make. When a drama's events become so complex that they couldn't happen in real life, it loses its link to reality. First of all, we have two moles who work their way to positions of unquestionable loyalty in their respective organizations in very short periods of time. When bad things start happening, they aren't the first ones sidelined to see if the bad things stop. Incriminating conversations & texts take place on unsecured cell phones that are never wiretapped. The main villain is an FBI informant, known as such to 2-bit punks he extorts money from, but not known as such to the ""cream of the crop"" Boston police or State Police units. A real forensics unit would tear Colin's (Matt Damon)final story to shreds. The ""real"" mole Barrigan (James Dale) gets shot with his own service revolver -- which has no prints on it. The same gun manages to kill Billy and Trooper Brown before that. How did Barrigan use it and then manage to lose it? That's the only gun that does the final shooting, so it's changing hands but manages to wind up with no fingerprints. Finally, Dingam (Mark Wahlberg) takes the law into his own hands and executes Colin in the final scene. The way he insures he'll get away with it is by wearing protective booties, but not gloves. No one sees him enter or leave, hears the gun, and he doesn't leave any hair strands behind for DNA evidence. At that point Colin is still believed to be a hero and the resulting investigation would be relentless.<br/><br/>If you're willing to overlook all these (and more) inconsistencies, the story line is entertaining."

","The Departed is a remake of the two year old Hong Kong hit Infernal Affairs (a superior film in my opinion) and concerns an undercover cop (DiCaprio) in an Irish mob in Boston and a mole in the police force (Damon) who attempt to weed each other out before they themselves get caught.<br/><br/>Its 20 minutes into the film before any of this happens, or even the title appears for that matter. Before it does we get something of a prologue with Irish mobster Frank Costello (played by Jack Nicholson and based off of real life Irish mobster Whitey Bulger) narrating about his environment, the Knights of Columbus, JFK and black people. It's the only narration we get throughout the whole movie and immediately after the Rolling Stones' Gimmie Shelter is unleashed at full volume accompanied by short and slightly fragmented scenes of violence from Costello's heyday and DiCaprio and Damon's introduction into their fields of play in the film. It's all a bit disorderly and has an amateurish feel to it, as if someone told a random fan to make a short Scorsese movie and they proceeded to throw all the clichés at the screen – DiCaprio, narrations, Gimmie Shelter, people getting shot in the back of the head, lengthy tracking shots, 'the whole nine yards' as police captain Queenan (played by Martin Sheen) would say.<br/><br/>If I was to find a rational explanation for the way the opening of the movie feels so detached from the rest of the film I'd say it's because the start of the film showcases an older time, a previous generation. It was a time more wild and animalistic where the only surviving character of that environment is Frank Costello. It reminds me of Gangs of New York and the opening battle sequence, where the only person to come through the endeavour was Bill the Butcher. Everyone else involved in the battle had either died when the film's main story happened or took their place in the new world of (somewhat) order and stability. It's why the Butcher sticks out so much in the movie. Not only because of the terrific and wild performance by Daniel Day Lewis, but because he is essentially a caveman in an insurance salesman's world and towards the end of the film even he knows he has no place in the new ever-changing America. Similarly, Jack Nicholson's Costello comes off as someone who belongs in a different time away from the tuxedos and police warrants. It's not only him though; many of the characters in The Departed come off as lions and wolves used to roaming the wild trapped in suits and behind wooden desks and piles of paperwork.<br/><br/>The jarring pacing of the film was a real problem for me. I had no sense of how much time had elapsed over the course of the movie and the one time a character had the chance to explain he merely shrugged ""long time, long ****ing time"" which I agreed with completely. With a runtime of 2 and a half hours the movie is unable to match the brisk pacing of, say, Casino or Goodfellas and instead comes across as a dozen or so clumsily put together scenes in which characters talk tedious topics to each other, with the odd frame of unadulterated violence garnished in. I'm serious – while watching a Scorsese mob & cops film I was actually checking to see how long was left because I was so bored. There is no tension throughout the movie at all which made me unresponsive to scenes that were clearly meant to shock and awe. The dialogue is often vague and meaningless, and only of service when it is used to forward the plot. Take the scene between DiCaprio and Nicholson at the dinner, where they talk about DiCaprio's father, school, sadnessall until I thought to myself what the hell are they talking about? To which, to my amazement, DiCaprio responds by asking ""what the **** are we talking about?!"" Yikes!<br/><br/>The ambling and dreary nature of the movie might have been elevated by some decent acting. But despite the cast including Leonardo DiCaprio, Alec Baldwin, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone and Jack Nicholson it pains me to say the performances were shambolic: DiCaprio was shaking, shrieking and squirming so much that it made Costello look like an idiot for not realizing that he was the rat in his crew, Damon looked like an awkward schoolboy as the 'villain' of the picture, Sheen seemed to be attempting to say his lines without spitting out his fake teeth, Winstone decided that the shooting schedule was the best time to start experimenting with every accent known to man, and Wahlberg's profanity-fuelled, nostril-flared cop with little-man syndrome was so irritating that I hoped he would get shot in the head or thrown off a building. Ironically, he's the only major male character that survives the runtime. Nicholson was the best of the bunch, bringing weight to his role where his presence is felt throughout the whole movie in spite of him playing an extension of his Joker/R.P McMurphy characters. But even he, it seems, is somewhat sleepwalking his way through the film only waking up for the odd rat impersonation here and there. And nobody is buying that Boston accent for a second.<br/><br/>Editor Thelma Schoonmaker adopted a frantic style that didn't sit well with me. Some cuts ran for a spit second and we were constantly jumping from scene to scene, camera angle to camera angle. Maybe it was supposed to come off as sharp and gritty, but it just felt unprofessional and clunky. Maybe substituting Scorsese's coked up direction, which undermined any possible nail-biting from me, for a more subtle but equally stylish director would have been better. I always thought the plot to The Departed would fit snugly into Michael Mann's filmography."

","THE DEPARTED, Scorcese 2006 Viewed at the first Rome Film Festival, October, 2006. A Misguided Missile by a fading maestro of the Mob Movie and A bloated regression into crass commercialism. An undercover cop and a mole in the police attempt to identify each other while infiltrating an Irish gang in South Boston. NOTA Bene: The Departed is a remake of the 2002 Hong Kong actioner, ""Internal Affairs"" ~ This one shoulda stayed in China.<br/><br/>Today's email from colleague and editor Tom Dirlis, in Prague; ""Ahoy, Alex: Sounds like you're having a helluva time over there — la dolce vita and all that! Did you see the new Scorsese flick? How was the press conference? Haven't been too impressed with him lately and Di Caprio can kiss my butt, but Marty did make a few great ones. Always waiting for the comeback. Tom"". ————— <br/><br/>REPLY : Ahoy, Tomasso — Yep, Life is pretty sweet here in Rome at the moment, and I'm glad you asked about Scorcese! I was just getting ready to knock out the usual cagey, journalistically correct (JC) review of ""The Departed"" but with you I don't have to hedge my bets and can tell it like it is — the Hole Truth, and nothing but The Truth So, for openers; The bottom line is, NO –this is NOT the great comeback for Scorcese — in fact it's a regression even further back into obvious crass commercialism than was ""Aviator"", which was pretty damn regressive, not to mention a pile of horse manure.<br/><br/>To start with, both Nicholson AND Dicaprio were SERIOUSLY miscast — The best role in the whole film is MARK WAHLBERG, who should get a Purple Heart for having to give his all in the company of the phony stars who get to walk away with all the credit (as if there was anything creditable to speak of) while he actually keeps this monstrosity afloat whenever he's on. The interview following the press screening was FAR more interesting than the film itself, which I found hard to actually sit out and squirm through.<br/><br/>For one thing, too much rapid artsy intercutting between the parallel stories of how Dicaprio and Damon infiltrate the police department and The Mob, respectively. The whole shebang was far too intricate for a Boston based gangsta Story and shoulda ""stayed in bed"", which is too say, in Hong Kong, where it started out, and where it belongs. An exercise in bloated glossy bullshit all around. According to Scorcese in the following Press Con, this was an exercise in ""experimentation"". Well, maybe that was the problem — It's so Experimental that it falls apart in every other scene without ever getting it together anywhere in between. <br/><br/>The only thing that makes it more or less tolerable are the very good supporting roles by Alec Baldwin (always good), Wahlberg (always superb), and Martin Sheen (always interesting, especially now with white hair), but there is one key supporting role that is pathetically bad –the police psychiatrist, played by an unknown (and unappealing) actress by the name of Vera Farmiga. For Christ Sake — Whoopy Goldberg would have done a much better job! This gal must be a friend of the family — in fact the whole film feels to me like an expensive home movie made by Scorcese for and with his family and friends. The bottom Line? P. U. — ""The Departed"" sucks heavily. Glad you asked.<br/><br/>Given the obvious star power of the main cast and the advance (paid-off?) press hype to the effect that Marty is ""back in stride doing his gangster stuff"", I would be hesitant to predict that this awful picture will flop in America, but somebody watching the parade just has to come out and say it –when the king ain't wearing a single goddamn stitch!<br/><br/>As for the main roles, it's maybe not so much that Jack Nicholson was miscast as an Irish Maffia don, but rather that he's gotten to be such a gigantic Ham that all he ever does anymore is imitate himself as the Devil in ""The Witches of Salem"", or play an old creep on constant viagra overdose. To my mind, he's had an interesting career, but it's time for him to stay in bed –for good! Nevertheless, because of some sort of star-inertia principle -- (A moving Hollywood Box Office Force tends to keep moving in a straight line as long as money can be drained out of it) -- his face and name still sell tickets at the B.O. Viggo Mortensen would have been more credible in the role. <br/><br/>As for Leonardo — well, to see the way he beats the living govno out of all kinds of heavy thugs in this pic, with the greatest of ease, you'd have to think he was the baddest ass who ever lived. A bare-knuckled Billy The Kid, when actually we all know he's a frail, sensitive, loving chap who wouldn't hurt a fly. This all has about the same credibility level as a tubercular looking Montgomery Clift knocking John Wayne for a loop in ""Red River"". Matt Damon, the third big name in the cast, is acceptable since he's not called on to do anything but what he always does best — a grown up hoodlum with a working-class Boston accent who wishes he could have made it to Harvard. Hate to disappoint you, pal, but let me know what you think when you get to see it — and just remember: Never trust a film critic! — not even Yours Truly.<br/><br/>Ps: Marty did get his long overdue Oscar in 2007, providing him with official entry to the exclusive Spielberg-Coppola Club -- which only goes to show that the Oscars are more about anointing selected breadwinners than recognizing art."
"ninako124","6","2","4","29 September 2012"," Shallow remake
","Before I start the review, I have to mention, I watched Infernal Affairs before seeing The Departed. Despite my best intentions not to let this cloud my opinion of the latter film, I'm afraid that it did have some influence. <br/><br/>As far as The Departed goes, I have to admit to being rather disappointed for several reasons. The first, and most disappointing aspect of the film, is the acting. Having seen Scorsese's previous works, I expected tight and controlled acting. The performances in this film are anything but. There is a lot of screaming and cursing and overall whining going on. But screaming and cursing do not equate to showing (acting) true anger, and whining has never equaled frustration, hurt or pain before. I don't know how many times I felt like laughing at seeing DiCaprio's or Damon's little whiny boy expressions - which they were, quite frankly, donning the entire length of the film. Wahlberg's constant use of profanity and idiotic lines was also rather morbidly hilarious; I simply couldn't take Dignam seriously. Overall, the acting was rather shallow and uninspired; I still can't understand what so many of the other reviewers found so praiseworthy.<br/><br/>Secondly, the entire story falls rather flat for me. The film is overly long, many scenes are rather pointless. Conversely, the timeline is ridiculously short. I mean, what was the reason for spending an entire hour showing the training sequences, then suddenly skipping forward about 4-5 months, during which time DiCaprio has become part of the gang and Damon has been promoted multiple times? This simply does not feel realistic. Also, the film has more plot holes and illogical actions than Swiss cheese. The most glaring one being, why does DiCaprio go for a showdown all by his little lonesome with Damon? If he wants his identity so much, why doesn't he simply contact Dignam? Or send the police force the recordings? Why doesn't he make any of the more logical decisions? <br/><br/>Lastly, I couldn't really see any reason for showing the dead bodies so long. I mean, I have nothing against violence in films, with films such as Oldboy and Reservoir Dogs being favorites, but I didn't feel that the long shots of Nicholson's, DiCaprio's and Damon's bodies after they were shot were necessary. Their characters never elicited enough sympathy to make the viewer feel sad about their deaths, thus these scenes felt simply forced.<br/><br/>Overall, I have the feeling that the film would not have been half as praised, had not Scorsese been the director. But quite frankly, his days of churning out tight, masterfully crafted films seem to be over."
"Hunky Stud","7","2","4","8 November 2010"," The original was not that long, and way better and intense.
","This movie is too long, and it has too many twists which made it less intense than the original movie.<br/><br/>There was no reason to put in so many twists and killings which only made this movie a little confusing and illogical. Even gangsters don't just kill random people everyday. They could have focused on the two main characters, made this movie shorter, that would be a little more interesting to watch.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure that this was the copy of the Hong Kong movie until I saw cpt. queenan got thrown from the roof top.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a bad copy of the original movie due to its bad storyline. Of course, it had so many famous actors. Otherwise, it could never have got such a high rating, even higher than the original movie."

I predicted how it was going to end and who was going to die. <br/><br/>Shame on us Americans for stealing other imported ideas, like Ringu, Rec, La Femme Nikita, Let the Right One In, and now this. I am sure the originators in China are getting credit of crafting such an incredible story line and the producers and the writers of The Departed have done their best to warp the script and implement new intriguing characters the best way possible. But everything else is an obvious carbon copy of Mou Gan Dou.<br/><br/>It was well acted, produced and directed. I can't possibly give it a higher score because I saw the derivative of this movie first. If I saw this movie first, I would have liked it more and I probably wouldn't have noticed the Chinese Predecessor.<br/><br/>Overall, I will still recommend it.

"dermottferry","8","2","4","5 August 2008"," ''give me that Oscar''
","As Martin Scorsese collected the Best Director Oscar for The Departed he jokingly began his speech by asking 'Could you check the envelope again??' This came after an extended show of respect from the crowd for a man who should have walked those steps many years ago. It is a fact of life that you aren't going to win every time. But to not win at all with movies like Taxi Driver, Casino, and especially Goodfellas, well, thats just an injustice. As his name was called out it seemed a collective sigh of relief swept over the film industry as finally the man who has battled long and hard collected his award.<br/><br/>Scorsese stepped outside his gangster film making home last time out to tackle the biopic with 'The Aviator', with mixed reviews. Although not a bad film, it wasn't the Scorsese we've come to know, and it was time to get back to basics in the search for that elusive Oscar. <br/><br/>'The Departed' tells the story of two men from opposite sides of the law ,undercover within the Massachusetts State Police and the Irish mafia. The State Police's aim, led by Detectives Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) and Queenan (Martin Sheen), is to take down Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), who has been terrorising the City for years. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), is assigned the unattractive role of going undercover in attempt to do so. Costello's hand is made up of Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), who is his mole in the Police Department. To add to the tension, both Sullivan and Costigan fall for the same girl, shrink Madolyn (Vera Farmiga). The story is as intriguing as it gets, and the acting is superb on all corners, including the terrific Alec Baldwin. <br/><br/>Jack Nicholson is immense, DiCaprios improvement away from the bay faced actor continues, and Damon is one of the best actors around full stop. My only annoyance is that Robert De Niro, a man who has forged a great partnership with Scorsese over the years, didn't feature in the film that finally got the great man an Oscar."

"dan_woodward","5","2","4","6 November 2007"," Gone, pretty much forgotten
","Having seen The Departed I'm The Disappointed. It's not in any way a bad film but it is a bad Scorsese film. The premise of the movie is fantastic but neither the plot or the characters ever really develop throughout. It's just too similar to Infernal Affairs, pretty much a remake, and it should have been so much more. The best part of the film for me was the brilliantly shot pursuit from the cinema, sadly it's virtually a lift which is what the film suffers from. There is too little jumping off from the original and too much retreading.<br/><br/>The cast by and large do a good job. Mark Wahlberg's excellent and Leonardo De Caprio is extraordinary, I've never been knocked out by either in the past but they're great in this. Ray Winstone gives the same performance I've seen for the last five or six years but with a slight brogue and there are a couple of horribly hammy Nicholson moments that should have been jumped on.<br/><br/>One thing I did like about The Departed is the look of it. It's really beautifully shot and the locations were perfect.<br/><br/>If this had been directed by someone else it would have been decent enough but against Scorsese's best films it just doesn't cut it."
"dmbroome","8","2","4","30 October 2007"," 25 years in the making...and worth the wait
","In 1981, Martin Scorsese was nominated in the Best Director category for Raging Bull. That he didn't win then was criminal, that it took 25 years for him to get his hands on an Academy award is simply felonious. And so it is perhaps apt that it was The Departed that won it, being arguably his best crime picture to date.<br/><br/>I have just re-watched the epic on DVD, after being blown away in the cinema, and I was struck again by the level of humour it boasts. The film is a masterpiece, as good in my opinion as Goodfellas, Casino or Taxi Driver - if not directly comparable - and a welcome return to form after the trudging blockbusters that were Gangs of New York and The Aviator.<br/><br/>'The Departed', as a title, works on many levels. It refers literally to the numerous deaths in the film, but also reminds us how far 'departed' the main characters of Billy Costigan and Colin Sullivan have become from their original selves.<br/><br/>Costigan (Leonardo di Caprio) and Sullivan (Matt Damon) are, respectively, a cop from the wrong side of the tracks and a choirboy turned crook, acting undercover in each other's organisations. Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) is the mob boss, and Martin Sheen plays Captain Queenan, ably aided by the excellent Mark Wahlberg as Sergeant Dignam.<br/><br/>I could eulogise at length about how much I enjoyed this picture, or explore some of the many themes, from the many religious connections (Nicholson as Costello is the devil incarnate for sure) to the clear juxtaposition of the lives of Costigan and Sullivan (e.g. when the latter is buying a flat or having a date, the former is in jail or in a fight), but instead I would like to focus on the humour.<br/><br/>Productions of this ilk, (and by ilk I include the likes of Donnie Brasco, Pulp Fiction, Goodfellas or The Sopranos), generally succeed where others fail because of the human side to the story. It's all very well having a killer plot, plenty of violence and lots of gangster patter, but if people can't relate to the characters it is unlikely to engage them.<br/><br/>Think of the most memorable scenes from the afore-mentioned films and in your list is likely to be Joe Pesci asking ""What do you mean I'm funny?"" in Goodfellas, Johnny Depp explaining what ""Forget about it"" means in Donnie Brasco, ""Royale with Cheese"" from Pulp Fiction or any number of one-liners in The Sopranos. These jokes, while they would never bring the house down, remind you that these are real people rather than just killers, gangsters or crooks.<br/><br/>And the Departed delivers as well as any of these, whether it's Dignam's insults: ""My theory on Feds is that they're like mushrooms, feed 'em sh*t and keep 'em in the dark"" and ""I'm the guy who does his job. You must be the other guy""; Captain Ellerby's quick-patter: ""I'm gonna go have a smoke right now. You want a smoke? You don't smoke, do ya, right? What are ya, one of those fitness freaks, huh? Go f*ck yourself""; or Costello's big-talk: ""One of us had to die. With me, it tends to be the other guy."" This aspect of the film kept me engaged, and meant that I was alert enough to the action to spot other subtleties, such as the references to ""Psycho"" and ""The Third Man"" in the shower scene and at Billy's funeral. One reference though, also I feel the film's weakest point, was more rammed down my throat than slipped into my subconscious. This came right at the end of the film, where the ""rat"" runs across Sullivan's window. A little too literal I thought.<br/><br/>I probably wouldn't have remembered that had it not been the last scene of the film, and that aside, this is easily the best film I have seen in the cinema in the last decade. It certainly deserves to become in time a classic to be mentioned in the same breath as Scorsese's finest and is fitting to be the one that finally earned him an Oscar, after 26 years of being a bridesmaid."

And it doesn't go overboard with the dialogue. With the exception of some parts, it was evened out nicely. I won't give it away but the ending in particular stood out most for me because it wasn't happy or sad. It was just an ending. A very original movie by Scorsese.

","When I went to see The Departed, I was left with a feeling I very rarely have after watching a movie. I usually either feel satisfaction or disappointment, but The Departed left me craving. I wanted more! I did not want the film to be over! There is never a dull moment in this film! I really do not care if some people feel it is a copy-cat film of the Chinease movie ""Internal Affairs"". I absolutely love this movie and I am glad so many people enjoy it as much as I do.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese is able to somehow grab a certain story from real life and just turn it into an unbelievably good movie. He does that here. He is able to take the terms and lifestyles used in an original historical Boston setting and incorporate them into this film. The story itself is terrific. It focuses on the part of two ""undercover"" agents working against each other! One is a police officer inside a Boston mob organization and one is a member of that organization inside the police force. The entire story sets up nicely and builds up to a huge climatic point where to put it simply, ""the $hit hits the fan!"" The filming of this movie is fantastic! Every scene looks perfect! There is plenty of action in this film and a lot of humor. There is never a point of boredom or uneasiness! The movie flows so perfectly that you can follow it easily! If I were to put this film into a genre, it would be a mixture of a comedy/action/drama/suspense/thriller.<br/><br/>The casting in this movie is self-explanatory. Just look at the names; DiCaprio, Damon, Nicholson, Wahlberg, Winstone, M. Sheen, and Baldwin. Everyone plays their hearts out! DiCaprio and Damon are good in their two lead roles. Nicholson was up for an Oscar Nomination for his role which is fantastic! He plays the stylish and dangerous mob boss Frank Costello. Alec Baldwin is pretty darn funny, he plays the head of a special investigation unit of the police department! But the best actor in this film is without a doubt, Mark Wahlberg. He got an academy award nomination for best supporting actor for his character, Dignam! He stole every scene he was in! He was extremely funny and serious at the same time. A terrific performance on his part. All the actors in this film feed off of one another brilliantly. You can pick out the intensity they have when they are shooting this film. It is phenomenal! And although the actors do a great job in their roles, the characters created for them are perfect! Every character created for this film has an important part and they all do something memorable for this film. Everything about the actors and the characters in this film rocked! <br/><br/>I love Martin Scorsese and I truly believe, in my own opinion, this is his best film. I know it is my favorite but I think it may also be his best. This film has everything a good movie needs! Yes, you can expect violence and a lot of vulgar language, but it is worth it! The vulgarity in my opinion only adds to the intensity of the film. I truly believe everyone should see this movie. It may seem long at 2 and half hours but it is worth it. If you (the previewer) does watch this film, I hope you gain the same respect for it I have. Because 30 years from now, people will still remember this movie and those people will remember how fantastic it was."
"echozdog","10","2","4","20 June 2007"," Best movie I've seen in 20 years
","I caught this on DVD last night. The rest of the family was asleep while I sat in living room, slowly moving from chair to chair to get closer to the TV. This movie grabbed me and pulled me in hard. It had everything that I like in a movie. It had suspense, characters (that I care about and ones I hate), unpredictable, twists and a great ending.<br/><br/>The movie basically is the story of two police officers coming out of the academy. One was sent there to be a spy for the mob (Damon), the other is recruited right away to be a mole in the mob for the cops DiCaprio). We watch as each reported to there boss's and tries to not get caught. Meanwhile a lot of people die around them (the departed).<br/><br/>The suspense in this movie was so high I couldn't stand it. I sit here at work the next day and I'm amazed at how much I'm still thinking about it. The reason the suspense is great is two fold. One you feel like these characters (all of them) are in danger, real danger. Two you don't know what's going to happen next. All this makes for a great ride.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie unless you don't like mob movies. This is very much a mob movie. 10/10 <br/><br/>BTW DiCaprio got robbed for not getting an Oscar nomination. I really don't care for the guy, but he did a hell of a good job. Walberg deserved his nomination. Damon was good but played it a little too cold. Nicholson, Sheen and Baldwin were great stars willing to play their parts to the hilt as supporting actors. If Martin Scorsese had not gotten the Best Director then the Oscars would have lost ALL credibility.<br/><br/>Good Day!"
"joaocruzferreira","9","2","4","13 June 2007"," Best Movie Of The Year
","The real story in ""The Departed"" is in the dualities of DiCaprio and Damon's characters. Di Caprio is a cop with familial ties to crime who works as an undercover spy, whereas Damon is Colin Sullivan, ganglord Frank Costello's (Jack Nicholson) plant posing as a cop.<br/><br/>Each frame of this crime drama crackles with the kind of visual energy that's trademark Scorsese. We thrill to every cut and camera movement here because, like all of Scorsese's movies, they try to push the boundaries of cinematic language. <br/><br/>The cast is terrific, with the standouts clearly being Matt Damon and believe it or not, Mark Wahlberg. There were also outstanding performances by: Jack Nicholson, Leonardo Di Caprio, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone and Vera Farmiga.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a very fascinating look into the meaning of what it is to be a rat within a morass of a world in which everyone is a rat of different sorts.<br/><br/>This movie confirms that Leonardo DiCaprio is Scorcese's new Deniro. Another excellent work by Scorcese! 9/10"

","What's so special about this movie?! Looks like Hollywood is concentrated on entertainment only so when something ""serious"" comes out, it is called art. Oh come on! This movie is not a bad one, but it is also far away from being called a masterpiece. At the moment it is on #33 on top 250 of the best films of all times. Just one question for Mr. Scorsese: how many times will you shoot the same movie again and again? I mean, this one is the same as Casino, which was the same as Goodfellas... OK, the stories were a bit different, but they all look the same (the structure, the music, the acting). Hollywood has definitely lost the magic, all the movies are done the same way - you know what to expect. Just like you know what you'll get when you order a Big Mac.

"goodmanhunting2003","9","2","4","24 April 2007"," A far *departure* from the others!
","There are films, and there are films.<br/><br/>""The Departed"" is a cult film. A classic.<br/><br/>When Matt Damon--hunting a rat with bad will--was plotting, prosecuting his diabolical agenda, I swear I saw vestiges of ""The Talented Mr.Ripley"" at work.<br/><br/>Condemnations--excessive almost--by his character Sullivan about gays and queers did not only have an uncanny parallel with Mr.Ripley (who is queer), but about the Sullivan character who was this side of a bit bent...to the other side.<br/><br/>More like the other side... of good! Sullivan certainly looked like a bad guy--exuding arrogance and criminal intelligence in an explosive mix--trained from his youth by crime boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) to not just be a bad 'un, but be one who would be able to strategically fill him in on information from no less than the elite police unit that Sullivan had, ironically, worked hard to get into.<br/><br/>And what of Costigan? Another bad 'un--or so we thought. He wanted his identity back; he got something else in return.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg's wit would have been legendary if only it had been him--and not his character Dignam: a no-nonsense hardened cop with a penchant for the 'f-word'. Loyal. Trustworthy. Like his avuncular boss, Queenan (Martin Sheen), whose end was far from pretty.<br/><br/>The cinematographic characterisation of Costello in the beginning was cute: he was shown with a half-darkened face; a gruff voice; erudite-sounding tongue. Truly a paradox.<br/><br/>He liked to say: ""no-one gives it to you; you gotta take it!"". And he took alright! But you kept wondering--was he the Devil incarnate, or a glorified criminal? Truth is when you have a gun in your hand, ""what's the difference?"" The difference, like the devil, is in the film's details.<br/><br/>The accents. The Irish pedigree; the seamless time; the increasingly sadistic and desperate nature of Costello. His slow-and-sure distrust of Sullivan. Costello's strength (Sullivan) in weakness (his impotence?). Nicholson's reminisces of ""The Shining"".<br/><br/>But I digress.<br/><br/>If I never used superlatives for this film, it's because I do not have to.<br/><br/>Suffice-to-say, Damon excels; Nicholson outdoes himself'; Sheen and Baldwin are there; Wahlberg, too.<br/><br/>But the real prize goes to the real (state) trooper, who was told he would never be a state trooper: Di Caprio as Costigan.<br/><br/>The writers pulled an excellent piece here. <br/><br/>Any writing class teacher will tell you to ""begin with then end in mind"". They certainly began with the end in mind. <br/><br/>But if there's anything about this classic movie, it's a cautionary tale of minding one's ""beginnings""...because you never know where it might take you.<br/><br/>Go get this film now!"
"Villemar","9","2","4","24 April 2007"," Martin Scorecese is finally liberated...
","There is not too much to say that hasn't been already said. Let me just add that with this movie, Scorcese has been liberated from the cultural obligation to make an EPIC movie. With this, he has been freed to just make a great MOVIE. There are no grand passion plays here. Just a damn good story.<br/><br/>The ending was a little bit ruined for me because IMDb or Yahoo entertainment news or some other piece of fluff article spoiled it when they speculated on the possibility of making a sequel. Shame on them! Also, why does Scorcese have to include ""Gimme Shelter"" in all of his trailers and movies? I can just imagine him trying to include it in ""Kundun"" for crying out loud! Although with that one exception, the soundtrack was superb.<br/><br/>This is Leo's best performance to date....clearly the most understated yet. It amazing to watch him get exponentially better and better with each and every role. All of Leo's past sins have been completely, 100% absolved at this point as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>All in all, a superb and riveting movie."
"farhad_hamed","10","2","4","20 April 2007"," Fabulous Scorsese movie, watch it 3-4 times
","The movie starts from a childhood of Matt Damon and then he is in military training courses with Dicaprio. At the final stage, Damon is accepted to be police but Dicaprio is rejected. Police and Mafia want to have rats in each organization. Damon and Dicaprio, who was once rejected are employed. Many meetings of Mafia and the reactions of the police are betrayed. So the police decides to choose Damon to find the rat inside, unaware of he is the rat himself. After lots of great scenes, the rats are found. This movie has to be watched at least 3-4 times. But I think it had some mistakes, i.e. ending parts of movie, in the elevator, Dicaprio is very amateur, never a police stands besides the hostage, always behind it. But the death of Capitain was wonderful. It shook me up. Martin Scorsese's movies are always great."
"lazyboyholla","10","2","4","19 April 2007"," Scorsese Departs from the Norm
","Are you wondering what you should do with your Friday night? Well you have come to the right place to, this movie had it all from bloodshed to romance it told the story in a way that keeps you wanting more. This movie was an amazing, psychological thriller including nonstop action, and a love triangle, that would give most movies a run for their money. The Departed starts out with two Boston Police trainees, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), two very different men on opposite sides of the law. Colin Sullivan is best friends with South Boston's local mob boss, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), whom he has known since he was a child. However Bill Costigan, whose family has quite the criminal history, is suspected of being a dirty cop due to his family history. In actuality Colin Sullivan is the dirty cop. After Costigan is subjected to interrogation from his boss he finally gives in to the fact that he can never be a cop with his family being a bunch of criminals. His boss offers him the job of infiltrating Costello's gang and finding out the identity of the mole in the police force. At the same time Costigan has fallen in love with Sullivan's girlfriend, the police force's psychiatrist. This movie takes so many twists and turns but it is all worth seeing. But be cautioned this is not a movie to bring young children to, the movie is aptly rated, this movie contains gore, and foul language, therefore it is not for a younger audience. This star studded cast was sure to attract a few moviegoers, but who knew that it would be enough to give the director, Martin Scorsese his highest grossing movie to date. This movie also has a great soundtrack that is sure to attract the older audience, including tracks from the Rolling Stones, and Pink Floyd, but the soundtrack also includes newer tracks by the Dropkick Murphy's, which contributes to the Irish theme in the movie, because the Dropkick Murphy's are known for incorporating Irish undertones in their music. Overall this movie is quite amazing, it is the best movie I have seen in a very long time. This movie deserves a 10 stars out of 10 because of its originality and its amazing acting."
"indy-39","Null","2","4","11 April 2007"," separating the pretenders from the contenders...
","I kind of love films like The Departed. With its big name talent, long running time, and compelling (if somewhat hard to swallow) story it sends many wannabe film critics off to their pc to rave about using words like ""classic"", ""brilliant"", and even (gulp) ""masterpiece"". Let's start with the positive...the story, basically adapted from Infernal Affairs (which I purposely have not seen yet)is interesting and draws you into the film. Matt Damon and Mark Wohlberg were very good. Damon is so good he throws the film out of balance, since he is supposed to be the ""mirror"" of DeCaprios character. DeCaprio, alas, is not up to the task of holding up his end. He seems to be growing up (applause) but he has really grown little as an actor. Some of his scenes here were painful to watch: the ""rat"" scene with Nicholson (in which he was ""acting"" all over the place) and one scene where he pistol-whipped someone was only slightly better than Donald Trump vs. WWF. But don't blame Leo- the blame must fall directly on Scorcese for letting him get away with such an amateurish performance that even the academy (which is rarely too embarrassed for anything) was too embarrassed to nominate. And you can't say Scorcese doesn't know good acting from bad. It's too bad that he seems to have lost some of his passion for film-making, he was one of our very best edgy directors. This film looked like it could have been directed by just anyone. On the plus side I did remain interested until the end, unlike Gangs of New York and the Aviator,but on the minus side the last fifteen minutes of this film are so bad it makes you leave thinking the film is worse than it really is. It isn't a bad film, it's an over-hyped mediocre film done by big names. Just the kind of film that trips up...the pretenders."

","In simple words this movie is just what it takes one man to see beyond entertainment. Though my favorite actor has always been Tom Hanks, recently when I watched Leonardo's 'The Departed' & 'Blood Diamond', I can say one thing he (Leonardo Di Caprio) has really evolved as a great actor. His performance has evolved beyond doubt if one has already seen his other movies like 'Gangs of New York', 'Titanic', 'Romeo + Juliet'.'The Departed' has a good storyline and gives an everlasting impact on the viewers. It really has been successful to portray the risk involved for men working as under cover police. This movie has everything that viewers can ask for 'action' and tons of 'thrills'. I will not go into details on the main plot as it will ruin the excitement for those who have not yet seen."

Matt Damon, DiCaprio, and Nicholson all have a great take on an Irish accent and play their part well. Especially Nicholson. ;)<br/><br/>So yeah, in closing, take some time out to watch this artistically beautiful movie, and remove the fact that it won 'Best Picture' from your head."

","I did not know this was an Internal Affairs remake. But Scorsese & Nicholson made me curious enough to watch it. I have to admit I didn't understand the story at all (Goodfellas HAD a life-like human story), except for the trivial fact that there were mutual rats in both police and mob force. Nicholson played well and energetic, I think, but the rest of the actors sort of too much engaged the f-word instead of making something out of their characters. I have seen all of the IMDb Top 250 movies (and some more) but my guts tell me this is not a good film. A good film is when you are so stunned afterwards that you watch until all the credits are finished. And then you don't get up easily from your cinema seat and you just go on pondering or being overwhelmed outside. Nothing of this happened to me with this movie. The amount of blood spilt should not outweigh the amount of philosophy as we can find in Pulp Fiction (or maybe in Kill Bill). Too many characters without any character."

Also the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio was starring in it made me think that it wouldn't be all that great either as i had only seen 2 movies in which i thought he was good (Gangs of New York and the Beach). But then i heard the rest of the cast (Jack Nicholson..come on!!) and the plot (an urban crime saga) and i thought that Martin may very well make another classic. When the trailer came out i was blown away and couldn't wait to see. When i finally did get that chance i thought it was cinematic genius. a not too complicated storyline, great acting, well known actors and edge of your seat suspense.

The film just wanted to be ""different"" by being like every other piece of crap Hollywood has put out lately.

","Simple. Infernal Affairs(the film that this was adapted from) does a better job executing the story in 90 minutes then this does in 150. The screenwriters/adapters(which i believe Paul haggis might be involved) felt that inserting the word ""f-u-c-k"" about 750 times provided realism. In fact all it did was make the dialog more ridiculous. Infernal affairs stuck to its through-lines, whereas in this film the through-lines are more like short outbursts that are supposed to make you go ""ohhhhh i got it now"". Do not get me wrong, Jack, Leo, and Mark have exquisite performances. But Andy Lau's performance in Infernal Affairs blows Matt Damon's out of the water. The adaptation to Boston is good, the performances are good, the direction is good, but it is not great. And that is what one must look at when rating film."

","Martin Scorcese is back with his new film, ""The Departed, which brings cinematic dysfunction on to the big screen. ""The Departed"" was one of my most anticipated films of the year. Well, I highly regret that now.<br/><br/>This film begins with the a self-reflexive narrative provided by a Wonderful actor, (who essentially saves the film from complete darkness) Jack Nicholson. He explains, ""When you Have a gun pointed in your face, it does not matter if your a cop, or a mobster."" Later the film incorporates Matt Damon, who plays the usual role with that smirky face of his. He plays an investigator who secretly works for Frank, but at the same time is a mole in the special police unit force, or something like that.<br/><br/>On the other side, is Leonardo DiCaprio who plays the opposite. He is an undercover cop who works for Frank. Such a wonderful role he plays. Honestly, in previous films, DiCaprio has managed only to distinguish himself as one bad actor. In ""The Departed"", part of the 4 good points it got was DiCaprio. He has finally found himself a role. Very good DiCaprio! The other points go to Mr. Nicholson. He is flawless. Completely flawless. DiCaprio and him tandem, to make ""The Departed"". If ""The Departed"" Were to prove anything, it would be that Nicholson has not lost his touch. And that is magic.<br/><br/>So what's so bad about ""The Departed""? let's say it is only a failed attempt to bring Goodfellas back tom the big screen. The viewers can probably imagine seeing Mr. Scorsese sitting there, thinking of a way to bring back the Goodfellas ""Pop"" into our junky Modern Cinema. Mr. Scorcese has failed his old but magical touch in bringing back Gangster classics (this is one is even copied! from Internal Affairs). Oh boy, I can't until next year."
"MrGKB","7","2","4","12 March 2007"," This won Best Picture?
","I caught Scorsese's latest at a second-run house after the Academy Awards had been dealt out, and was left perplexed that this remake of the Hong Kong quickie, ""Mou gaan dou (Infernal Affairs),"" garnered Best Picture and secured Scorsese's long-overdue win as Best Director.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, ""The Departed"" is an entertaining thriller, well acted for the most part, well-directed, shot and produced well, but Best Picture? I think not. Scorsese has done much better, more memorable, interesting films. ""Gangs of New York"" and ""Goodfellas"" spring instantly to mind. My opinion is that the Academy has simply finally given Scorsese his long-awaited props as a filmmaker, nothing more. It won't be too long before ""The Departed"" joins past Oscar winners like ""The English Patient"" in the ranks of attractive, but totally dispensable film entertainment.<br/><br/>That said, I thought the film was overly long. The subplot involving the leads' mutual paramour, the lovely Vera ""The Manchurian Candidate"" Farmiga, was mostly unnecessary padding to the slim story. Matt Damon is fine as the flip side to Leonardo DiCaprio's heads-up coin, although original choice Brad Pitt would have served equally well, and DiCaprio shows that he's here to stay as a talented and bankable star. Jack Nicholson does what he does best (chew scenery), but strikes me as about as Irish as--oh, I don't know--Mr. Whipple. The rest of the cast is competent, but not overly distinguished; virtually all of their roles could have been assayed by other actors. Wahlberg's nomination for Best Supporting Actor is an equal mystery to me; he did nothing he hasn't done before, and better.<br/><br/>I just don't see ""The Departed"" having much to offer beyond a few hours of idle entertainment. It's a good movie, but hardly a classic, and definitely not one of Scorsese's best."
"doctorx2","6","2","4","7 March 2007"," More style than substance
","Had The Departed been released in, say, 1986, it would have been stylish, edgy, and intense. But in 2006 it comes across as more an homage to the violent organized crime film genre (e.g., LA Confidential, Goodfellas, Traffic) than a stand-alone original work. After his many decades of solid direction, it was kind of the Academy of Motion Picture Artists to finally bestow the Best Director Award on Martin Scorcese for The Departed, although his 1990 effort, Goodfellas, was tighter, more innovative, and overall a better film.<br/><br/>In The Departed Scorcese is assisted by an A-list cast of male actors: Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, and Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio and Damon deliver solid performances, although Damon's portrayal of the ethically flawed man (a la The Good Shepherd, Syriana) is becoming almost type-casting for him. Nicholson is big box office and always amusing to watch, but similar to the big stars of old Hollywood (e.g., John Wayne) he is more Jack Nicholson than any character he portrays, and not a truly great actor. In The Departed his on-again, off-again Boston accent was distracting. It also seemed that Jack's ""screen persona"" was being capitalized upon, with the florid torrent of obscenities and outrageous facial expressions his character displayed for the duration of the film.<br/><br/>Conspicuously absent were A-list female actors, which also became distracting as the love triangle evolved between Damon, DiCaprio, and the female lead, Vera Farmiga. The viewer repeatedly wondered ""who the heck is that actress?"" The most solid and impressive performances were delivered by the supporting cast, notably Alec Baldwin (who is becoming the most venerable character actor of our generation); Martin Sheen (sort of the Hal Holbrook of our time, oft cast as ""the man of integrity""); Mark Wahlberg (whose somewhat limited but important role was delivered with more energy and sincerity than any of the three principal players); and Ray Winstone, whose Mr. French was 100% on the money.<br/><br/>The Boston setting is to die for, and the apparently unlimited budget allowed for elaborate sets, location shots, and special effects (shootouts and the like), so the film is visually appealing. The soundtrack weaves in and out with contemporary and traditional music, which feels stylish and modern, if not especially innovative. Sadly, the scripting was a bit flat, and many key scenes plodded along without evoking a lot of tension. The story itself was entirely predictable, with the exception of the ""twist"" ending, wherein another member of Nicholson's organization emerges unexpectedly as one of the cops who's been there all along, but only makes himself know at the very end of the film. This kind of writing is dismaying; it defies continuity, is thrown in merely for shock value, and cheapens the integrity of the entire story. It confirmed the sense of ultimate disappointment this viewer got from this film.<br/><br/>All that being said, IF you are in the mood for a violent cops and robbers film, it is worth the cost of a rental. I am not sure what female viewers would think of the film (having heard from only two, who didn't enjoy it), but my impression is that The Departed is best viewed with some male friends, or alone with a six pack."

Story is flawless except for a banal ending. Narration is very regular;three stories very obviously connected run parallel and meet after almost half the film is over. It opens in layers and is a sheer joy to watch the character finally crossing each other's territory. Dialogs are punched and speed is fast. Editing is a little shoddy in a few scenes but may be footage weren't too helping i guess. <br/><br/>Its a definite Oscar winner. 'Gimme Shelter' works again for Scorcese. John Lennon reference was damn funny :> Everyone is extremely good but its just impossible to not mention Caprio. He is so gifted and he is so good. He plays a perfect undercover policeman. Popping down tablets of speed, short tempered, a nice guy playing a bad guy trying hard to get back to his real side. He plays it so beautifully.

However, when Billy Costigan (Played by a surprisingly on-fire Dicaprio) goes undercover for the MPA, in order to infiltrate the Irish Mafia, both begin to smell a rat in each others organizations and things get tense and let it be said, violent.<br/><br/>Superbly done, intelligent, cleverly-crafted dialog and a genuinely simple story with underlying complexities makes The Departed an intense, intriguing thriller, coupled with a fantastic cast makes this a personal favorite and no doubt the feeling is mutual amongst many others.<br/><br/>Simply a must see."
"RainDogJr","10","2","4","2 March 2007"," Scorsese's best film????? for the Oscars yes, for me no but....
","Is difficult to say what is the best film of Marty, in my opinion there are three films: Taxi Driver, Goodfellas and Raging Bull, maybe Gangs of NY, Casino and The Departed also, but in my opinion the first three are the best. Well about The Departed: this film is one of my favorite films of the 2006, with a great performance by Dicaprio and by Jack Nicholson and of course a great history about mafia, corruption and cops. I have seen this film like three times and every time i found a lot of news things and i think that is why this film is a masterpiece but for me is not the best of Marty. <br/><br/>And of course we have to give some credit to ""Infernal Affairs"" in which this film was based and that is also a great film.<br/><br/>About that this film won the best picture Oscar: for me the prizes are not important, because the art of a movie can't be compared with others, and for me the Oscar or the golden palm or all the other prizes are not important because when a movie is excellent, it is excellent with or without prizes.... but is a shame that a lot of people don't think that because they only see The Departed ( or whatever film) because The Departed won an Oscar. That is a shame but is true that a lot of people only watch film because some others say that is a good film ( like the jury of the Oscars), but well thats my opinion."

","Not a terrible movie, but WAY overrated. Ridiculous dialog, predictable, and scenes that run on forever. Jack Nicholson overacts to such a degree that I laughed at several scenes that were supposed to be dramatic. And if I were the Boston State Police, I'd be furious at the depiction of unprofessional, irrational behavior exhibited by the central characters. Damon is a terrific actor, but seemed oddly miscast as a corrupt cop. I actually think Wahlberg would have been better as the morally bankrupt cop and Damon would have been better as the good cop with the anger management problem. So, not a bad movie, but I was terribly disappointed based upon the reviews and ratings listed here."
"howard.schumann","6","2","4","26 February 2007"," Fails to provide genuine emotional satisfaction
","Based on the popular Hong Kong action thriller Infernal Affairs, Martin Scorsese's The Departed has kinetic energy, an outstanding ensemble cast, a world-class director, and tense non-stop action but ultimately fails to provide genuine emotional satisfaction. Scorsese, whose Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas are classics of the genre, has come up with another gritty urban drama but, unlike his earlier efforts, it is filled with casual, ""cartoonish"" killing and a point of view that the excesses of organized crime and law enforcement are virtually indistinguishable. In an environment that does not distinguish between ends and means, there is no one to root for and those that do find a character to cheer for are begging for disappointment.<br/><br/>Set in the mean streets of South Boston, The Departed is the story of an undercover cop (Leonardo DiCaprio) planted in the Costello crime syndicate and a mole (Matt Damon) who infiltrates the police force, pretending to be a cop. The film comes out of the gate roaring with the Rolling Stones Gimme Shelter providing the background to a street fight. The first Irish Mafioso we meet is Frank Costello, played by Jack Nicholson. In a flashback, Costello recruits a youngster named Colin Sullivan by buying groceries for his family. Later, Sullivan goes to work for Costello when he becomes a detective sergeant in the police force. Unfortunately, Mr. Nicholson performance is so over-the-top that we are all too conscious that we are watching Jack Nicholson, the actor not Frank Costello, the mob kingpin.<br/><br/>Sullivan is played by Matt Damon as a one-dimensional Southie character just out of Good Will Hunting (I was half expecting Ben Affleck to wander into the scene with the rest of his drinking buddies). Sullivan's superiors are devout Catholic Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Sergeant Dignam in an Oscar-nominated performance by Mark Wahlberg. Dignam has the most quotable lines in the film, but his character is so foul-mouthed and antagonistic that he soon becomes tiresome. The most accomplished performance in the film is that of Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan, a tough but sensitive undercover cop who comes from a family with a criminal background and fits into the Costello organization but has to swallow Valium just to stay on an even keel.<br/><br/>There is some love interest in the film as well. Both Billy and Colin fall for the police mental health counselor Madolyn (Vera Farmiga). Ms Farmiga does a creditable job but her part is so underwritten that it feels extraneous. Both Costello and the police soon discover that they have a rat in their midst and Sullivan and Costigan are assigned the job of finding the fink. As the noose tightens, both men desperately strive to avoid detection and there is lots of action as the dead bodies pile up.<br/><br/>The Departed is a finely crafted film, excellently photographed by Michael Ballhaus and for the most part very well acted. Unfortunately, the plot is very thin and there is little character development or seriousness of purpose. While Scorsese should be acknowledged for telling the truth about the thin line between criminals and the law, the ending is so downbeat that it leaves us wondering what point other than futility the film is trying to make. During two and one-half hours of gratuitous violence, betrayals, double-crosses, and one-note characters, the departed may include members of the exhausted audience."
"rehren75","10","2","4","25 February 2007"," This movie isn't just another cop drama. The lives of the main characters will overlap creating an intriguing work of art.
","A movie that cast Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Matt Demon, with the direction of Martin Scorsese is a mixture for success. The intrigues triangle is well planned, and effectively keeps the audience in suspense until the end. The sound track and the shoot techniques point out significant developments through the movie. All in all, The Departed is the greatest movie of the year. In the opening scene a magnificent Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), introduces the evolution of the South Boston's Irish mafia, and sets the roots for the entire film. It takes about five minutes into the movie, to see Frank's face, and exactly when he says /we could become cops or criminals when you are facing a loaded gun what's the difference?/. The choice of the director to introduce Frank, one of his main characters, with a mysterious darkness around him, perfectly defines the nature of this man. Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon) and Bill Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) are introduced, as adults, almost at the same time. This choice demonstrates duality between them; simultaneously their roles are inverted to create misunderstanding in the viewers. Collin appears to be the perfect man, rising fast and with enough attitudes to be promoted into the Special Investigation Unit. Bill on the other hand, is treated like a criminal, because of his affiliations with the organized crime. Scorsese's choice to initiate Bill as a non welcome addition to the State Police is brilliant. The prelude of the two characters overlaps defining the title of this movie. The title, The Departed, is obviously associated to Bill Costigan's change of identity, where the cop in him dies. The music is well chosen, and it helps associate the different situations. For example, the song I'm Shipping Up to Boston, by The Dropkick Murphys, defines two significant events of the story. The first time, it is used when Bill begins his new undercover life. The second time, the song is used to define the state of actions that will bring Bill back to his real identity. I'm Shipping Up to Boston, is the perfect song to classify the two moments especially because of the Irish Folk in it. The multitude of shot techniques makes the viewer understand, and concentrate on significant details in the movie. It also defines the personality of the main characters. Collin is prevalently filmed from a high angle, which indicates submission. Bill on the other hand, is mostly filmed from a low angle, which represents superiority in values. Frank is filmed up close and mostly by himself, which symbolizes power and domination. In conclusion, The Departed is a masterpiece. Scorsese was able to create something, which will become a cult for generation to come. His choice of actors and filming techniques are appropriate to the subject. Whoever, can understand the brilliancy of this movie will be satisfied with it."

","""You accuse me once, I put up with it. You accuse me twice... I quit. You pressure me to fear for my life and I will put a f*cking bullet in your head as if you were anybody else. Okay?"" - Billy Costigan<br/><br/>Walking into 'The Departed' the latest Scorsese picture I didn't know what to expect. The way it used to be, back in the 70s and 80s, was when Scorsese released a film you knew it was going to be spectacular and a contender for 'Best Picture'. Now, unfortunately, you cannot say the same thing. Besides blessing us with some of the Best American Films Ever Made (Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, GoodFellas), in his recent years some of his other films have been more than a little disappointing (Kundun, Bringing out the Dead, Age of Innocence, The Aviator). I wanted to think positive, and think maybe this could be on par with Scorsese's early efforts. Despite the talent of Jack Nicholson of the bad guy, I was pretty sure it was going to be good, but the same old disappointing stuff we got from him in recent years. But, when those ending credits started to roll, I realized, I could NOT have been more wrong. Believe most of the critics and myself when we say 'The Departed' is not just excellent, but a masterpiece, and one of the best films Scorsese has EVER made.<br/><br/>'The Departed' is based on the superb 2003 Hong Kong thriller 'Infernal Affairs'. Remakes usually are inferior to their originals, but in this case, 'The Departed' is 10 times better than 'Infernal Affairs', featuring acting and direction that is literally 20 times better. Instead of Hong Kong, the story of the remake is set in Beantown, or Boston. An up and coming rookie cop with a criminal family history, Costigan (DiCaprio), is commissioned by his superior officers Captain Queenan (Sheen) and Sergeant Dignam (Wahlberg) to go on a secret undercover mission and infiltrate the crew of the charismatic yet incredibly violent crime boss, Frank Costello (Nicholson). At the same time, a street hood practically raised by Costello, Sullivan (Damon), is commissioned by Costello to go undercover and infiltrate in the Boston Police Department. The film quickly becomes a thrilling cat and mouse game of wits between Costigan and Sullivan, to see which of the two will come out victorious. Scorsese's riveting Boston crime drama also stars The War Zone's Ray Winstone as Costello's equally twisted #1 man, Mr. French, The Manchurian Candidate's Vera Farminga as a psychiatrist working for the Boston P.D., who forms a relationship with Colin, and Alec Baldwin as the sarcastic, easily-irritated, but constantly fun to watch police Lieutenant who tells Colin one of the benefits of getting married is that the other cops won't think you're a 'homo'.<br/><br/>Analyzing the different aspects of this film, there is really nothing to complain about, but so much to praise. First off, the acting is perhaps the best out of any motion picture released this year. Jack Nicholson is absolutely outstanding not to mention bone-chilling in his supporting role as Frank Costello, creating what is his best 'bad-guy' yet. It will be virtually impossible for Nicholson to be denied an Oscar nomination for his work in this, seeing as though whenever he's on-screen he steals the film, even if he doesn't have lines. Matt Damon is magnificent in his role as the calculating gangster posing as Bostod P.D., but the real breakthrough and the finest performance of 'The Departed' is Leonardo DiCaprio. In a tour-de-force performance that gave me goose bumps, DiCaprio completely makes up for some of his lack-luster performances in the past and then some. I predict DiCaprio might receive another Best Lead Actor Oscar Nomination for his work in this, God knows he deserves it 100%. In smaller roles, Mark Wahlberg is hysterical and scene-stealing as the demeaning police Sergeant who always has some smart-ass nasty comment to say to someone. Martin Sheen is solid to say the least as the Police Captain, Alec Baldwin is quite humorous in a tiny role as the Lieutenant, and Vera Farminga is fantastic in her role as the precinct shrink. Rounding out the cast, Ray Winstone is perfect as one man no one wants to screw with, Mr. French, and The Shield's Anthony Andersen is merit-able in an almost unnoticeable role as another cop who works with Sullivan.<br/><br/>William Moynihan provides a masterful screenplay which redeems him for the scattered and stilted screenplay he provided for 'Kingdom of Heaven'. The dialog in 'The Departed' never seems stiff, and most of the time it is laced with side-split-tingly funny yet gritty one-liners from both the criminals and the cops. The cinematography and film editing are astounding, but the real secret to the success of 'The Departed' is Martin Scorsese's breathtaking directing abilities. Scorsese outdoes himself with 'The Departed' which is as stylish as 'Raging Bull' and as entertaining and engrossing as 'GoodFellas'. Scorsese has been nominated seven Academy Awards for 'Best Director' and has never actually won, but mark my words, 'The Departed' is probably going to be the film he finally gets the trophy for. Not just because he's overdue, but because his surprisingly exceptional work in 'The Departed' is more than deserving.<br/><br/>Out of all these nearly perfect aspects of the film, the only down-side is that the first fifteen minutes of the film aren't very gripping. No worries, though, the rest of the two hours and fifteen minutes fly by and will have you pinned to your seat. It's one of those films you don't want to end because you are having such a fun time in the movie theater. 'The Departed' is the best film of the year, thus far, and is a reminder of why we as a people go to the movies. Grade: A (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, AZ, 10/07/06)"

","I just couldn't get over to what seems to me to be a truck-sized hole in the story line. If Sullivan was on tape with Costello's lawyer as being in the cahoots, how could Sullivan possibly think he was walking away from what he did to Nicholson, and then Costigan after he had already shown up in the office and had been seen by the entire staff?<br/><br/>Otherwise the film was all Scorcese, brings back memories of Casino and Goodfellas with the language. I've always thought Damon was a fine actor, the scenes were you could see the wheels turning in his head when trying to figure a way out were conveyed well.

"victor-macedo-1","6","2","4","21 February 2007"," Interesting, but certainly not Scorsese at his best
","This film is based on the Chinese (Hong Kong) thriller ""Infernal Affairs"", which in my modest opinion was much better than Scorsese's version. Certainly the editing, the directing and the acting of The Departed are all more sophisticated and more spectacular than in the Chinese film, but they sometimes tend to outshine the plot, like people wearing dinner jackets at their children's birthday party. The Departed is basically the story of two police officers working as undercover agents: Leonardo DiCaprio (who is the good guy) infiltrates a criminal organisation run by Jack Nicholson (whose performance is sometimes too over the top to be credible), whereas Matt Damon (the bad guy) is a mole for that same criminal organisation but working inside the police headquarters. The characters, though generally well played, are therefore not exactly ""deep"", so the film basically focuses on the twists of the story line, which had to be adapted to American tastes: there had to be a bit of romance (which might as well have been left out, as it is not essential to the film), a few references to growing up in tough neighbourhoods, a lot more violence than is absolutely necessary, a scene where Chinese criminals try to buy technology to develop a nuclear bomb (the ""Iranian"" and ""Korean"" scare), etc. These new, extra elements make the film much longer than the original version, and the last hour is painfully long as viewers are treated to a succession of boring scenes that only delay the conclusion everyone is hoping for. Martin Scorsese directed his best films in the 70s and 80s (especially classics like Taxi Driver and Raging Bull), but his more recent works have been rather disappointing: Gangs of New York was a rambling mega production about two-dimensional characters settling their scores amid no story at all; The Aviator was another mega production without a real story; The Departed is yet another millionaire production with a stellar cast but badly in need of a good plot. Has Scorsese lost his touch? Or are some viewers just not as easily convinced by his work when there are much better films like The Queen, Pan's Labyrinth, Babel or Little Children around?"

Another state police officer named Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is under cover as one of Costello's guys. Costigan is so deep undercover that he spends six months in jail and is made to look like he is kicked off then police force and the only people who know that he is still a police officer are Police officers Queenan and Dignam (Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg). The movie is about Costello trying to find the rat on his team and the cops trying to catch Costello and find the rat on their team. <br/><br/>I enjoyed The Departed very much. The movie had a very good story to it and a lot of good action. I bought the DVD without ever seeing the movie before and it was money well spent.

"ryan_kuhn","8","2","4","18 February 2007"," ""I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me.""
","The first lines of this movie are said in a monologue by Jack Nicholson's mob-boss character Frank Costello. He starts with, ""I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me."" This line essentially sums up the movie even before it begins. The Departed is an Americanized version of a Hong Kong filmed called Infernal Affairs, and tells the story of two Boston state troopers--one goes undercover and works against the Costello gang from within (Leonardo DiCaprio's Billy Costigan) and one works for the Special Investigation Unit while still on Costello's payroll (Matt Damon's Colin Sullivan). Each one lives in a world of deception, each trying to keep their real motives a secret from their adoptive bosses, each trying to out maneuver the other. The Departed ends up being a 150 minute long cat and mouse game between two guys who are referred to as rats in the entire movie. At first, each takes to their responsibilities with vigor and enthusiasm, with Costigan having the more difficult assignment, trying to infiltrate a gang who all knew he was once a cop. As the movie goes a long, we feel the noose tightening around each, as both characters go through moments of dread and loss, until the bloody ending where all of the characters who deceived and schemed ended up getting a suitable punishment. Each character in the movie imposes their outlook on the world on their situations, as each one makes their own luck, so to say, as the first line uttered by Nicholson alluded to. None of the characters are the result of a predetermined destiny, as everyone made decisions on their own and had to live with their results. As Costello said, their environments were all products of their own actions. As far as Scorsese's direction goes, it is as usual top-notch, with quick cuts when quick cuts are needed, a neat opening that gives about as much background information as we viewers could possibly need in a fast-paced 15 minutes before the opening credits even finish, a fine selection of music (almost Tarantino -like in how the music matched each scene), and as much violence and obscenities as you could possibly get in two and a half hours. Boston makes for a fascinating location for a movie such as this--a rich subtext to each character, the possibility for interesting supporting players, and a gritty street life that makes it a poor man's version of New York City, without having thousands of movies made about it already. The one problem with the Boston setting is the accent thing--some of the characters lose the accent then it magically comes back. This is always a concern when it comes to Boston movies. Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen are terrific as high-level police officers, and Mark Wahlberg goes all in with his portrayal of the salty Sergent Dignam. But the real stars are DiCaprio and Damon, each young actors who have really developed into well-rounded portrayers of emotion and gravitas. Yes, DiCaprio may never really leave the Titanic, but here he shows he can act in a subtle, yet strong roll in a Scorsese movie that is almost as good as Goodfellas."

It has a great cast no doubt, but it is an action packed violent movie, it was not pleasant in any way, the viewer does not develop enough association with any character, this is meant to happen in a movie with a grand cast. There is rarely a moment when a scene touches your heart, though it does leave a bad taste of memory on your mind, something that you do not want to think about again. <br/><br/>I only watched the movie because of the cast and the probability that it might be an Academy Awards Movie.

One a ""bad guy"" who gets everything and the ""good guy"" getting basically nothing.<br/><br/>However, I did not expect the end to end up the way it did. I mean, everybody died! I was completely convinced that Costingan would arrest Sullivan, then a happily ever after with Madolyn. But the end was so different from what I thought it would be, so Kudos for the unexpected.

"divine_fire","6","2","4","16 February 2007"," Scorcese is Michaelangelo
","In my view, Martin Scorcese, like Michaelangelo, is a great artist and sculptor. His medium is film rather than stone, but he has a similar capacity to create memorable images. The Departed has proved thought-provoking and I greatly enjoyed the story elements dealing with the machinations, the double-crosses, etc. Scorcese's films, with their ferociously kinetic forwarding devices and no-explanations action sequences make violence incredibly seductive. For me, this is due to the chiaroscuro simplicity inherent in the characters that create it. There is no hand-wringing, no questioning. In Scorcese's filmed world, this is simply the way things are, the way things are done.<br/><br/>This said, Scorcese's similarity to Michaelangelo extends to the fact that the man is brilliant at drawing male characters, but horribly deficient at rendering females. Michaelangelo's drawings and sculptures of women (when he did them at all) looked like men with breasts stapled onto their chests. The women in Scorcese's films aren't characters, they're plot devices and interruptions. He seems to use them to establish a quiet respite of a moment. The problem is that such respites are anathema to his style of film-making and so the women are relegated to the sidelines, except when they get trotted out to forward a specific plot device. By and large, the women are never as vital, as supercharged, as fascinating and charismatic as the men. Instead, they're usually passive leeches who are there to be sexual vessels, doormats or harpies. Like the Catholic Church and old school Police Departments, Scorcese's films are a clubhouse that says ""NO GIRLZ ALLOWED"". Most of the times I have come away from seeing a Scorcese film with equal measures of admiration, resentment and sadness. If only Martin Scorcese could make a movie where his female characters were as cool, as fascinating as the men. Alas, I don't ever see this happening and it is a true pity that an artist as great as Mr. Scorcese should have this regrettable, glaring lack."

However, Scorsese did an excellent job directing The Aviator. That was not an easy one to do! I thought that movie was great. 2 1/2 hours of pure entertainment. Then we can down the whole list of his Oscar nominated movies. What was the movie he lost to when he was up for Raging Bull? Yeah exactly it's already forgotten.

","I really wanted to like this movie. It had so much hype, nominations for several academy awards and a great cast. Not to mention a great director. But I found this film to be very average. Dicaprio is not very believable as a mole and his character development seems rushed and routine. Wahlberg was good but I don't think his performance warrants an academy nomination. I actually thought Damon gave the best performance here. And Nicholson is chewing the scenery a little. I compare this to goodfellas and goodfellas had a very authentic feel to it. The characters were more fleshed out, real and believable. Dicaprio is just kinda like hey Im undercover, Im posing as a hoodlum, this is my whole life. I wanted to know more. We didn't see him really bond with the crew or really earn their trust at any point other than getting hit with a shoe on his bad hand. Here the characters are a more two dimensional. And at the end everything seems wrapped up too quickly. The elevator shootout scene was almost laughable the way people kept walking in and getting shot. And where the hell was Dingham. He was told to show up at the rooftop. No real explanation why he didn't. And why would he quit his job to protect Costigan but not find some way to get him out? If he cared that much he would have got him out or let him know he is in trouble and his cover is about to be lifted. Especially after his partner got thrown off a rooftop. And why the hell didn't costigan just meet with dingham and turn over his evidence to him and go from there. The reason to meet on the rooftop was to get his life back? That was a little idiotic. Overall I sadly give this a 5. Knowing in my mind this could have been a perfect 10"

I thought his acting was wooden at best and compared him to a poor man's Christian Bale. But after seeing him in this I have to change my view. He is outstanding, as is all of the cast, with exception of perhaps Martin Sheen who I think was perhaps miscast but still does a great job. But that's my only fault. This is Scorsese's masterpiece and I only hope that if they do make a sequel/prequel... that they don't bastardise what is truly a great film. The film has been called a shot-for-shot retelling of Infernal Affairs... but this doesn't begin to describe just how good this film is. Infernal Affairs is an amazing film, but The Departed takes the story to new places and does something that no film in the past five years has done... be re-watchable."

After disliking Matt Damon's performances in every movie since ""Good Will Hunting"", I have to say that he did a great job here, particularly on the long pauses before dialogue. It was those shots where you can watch people calculating things in their minds that makes this movie truly powerful. Mark Wahlberg stole the show every time the camera was one him. Even the old war horses Sheen and Baldwin were believable as too tough cops. Kristen Dalton was perfect as the gangster gal, how come we haven't seen more of this beauty in other 'A' films? I have to get the DVD."
"mr-siyi-deng","10","2","4","9 February 2007"," Truly a master piece. Pwns the original Hongkong one.
","It is no secret that The Departed is a remake of the successful Hongkong movie Infernal Affairs. I watched the original one in 2002, right after it was out. I wasn't so impressed then, plus it has been quite some time, so I barely remember any details. But I still can recall the general idea I got. It has a script with intertwining clues which generates considerable intensity, even if several leading actors' performances are mediocre at the best.<br/><br/>I mistakenly extended my old opinion to the Departed, and delayed watching this masterpiece because I thought it could be overrated. As soon as I finished watching it, I realized that I want watch it again, right then. It is a completely new movie, spiritually. The affiliation in the screenplay to the original one is unavoidable, but Martin Scorsese did a great job in substantiating the cop and criminal story with his own interpretation. If the original Hongkong movie delivers the sense of cool and cool (sorry I couldn't find another proper adjective, since all what they tried to do is to be or pretend to be cool; anybody, anytime, anywhere.), The Departed is on the other hand all about crime, homicide and deep unrest. Infernal Affairs attempted to get into various profound philosophical topics such as causality, karma, the nature of human being. In my opinion it overextended itself to gain ground for none. The Departed starts less ambitiously and puts more effort on setting up the backgrounds. The psyches of the main characters become subtler and more authentic. DiCaprio's role rooted in the Irish Section with a family heritage being either bankrupt or criminal. This setting credibly fits into DiCaprio's expertise and explains why he is picked to play the mole. Another bold but effective modification of the original script is to combine the role of the 2 lead actress into one, a change proved smart in that it not only reduces redundancy but also creates an convincing love triangle.<br/><br/>Even better is the award-worthy performance of its shiny all-star cast. Matt Damon (as Colin Sullivan) persuasively presented us a deceitful rouge cop, especially considering those dutiful roles (Private Ryan~) he used to act. Jack Nicholson (as Frank Costello) skillfully portraits the aged corrupt boss with a strange paternal charm. Vera Farmiga's Madolyn is gorgeous. Intellect and sensual, she is just the right person for this character. And Leonardo DiCaprio, eventually get enough matured to break the Jack-of-Titanic prince-of-charm stereotype, really outperformed himself in his rendition of Billy Costigan. (BTW Leo also did a great job in Blood Diamond, another highly enjoyable Oscar nominee.) In my opinion Dicaprio is the biggest surprise I got from this movie.<br/><br/>Some people have been concerned about the excessive curse and violence in this movie. To me these are necessary materials to faithfully depict the restlessness of those who plays with darkness so intimately.<br/><br/>The Departed is a timely reminder to the industry that good movies are made of solid storyline and engrossing acting, not of superficial CGIs or eye-candies. Cheers Martin Scorses, Cheers all men behind this great movie. If The Academy won't give you the deserving awards, surely the audience will hold a place for it in their memories."
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","10","2","4","8 February 2007"," Deserving of every accolade it received. The rebirth of gangster film.
","I'm not going to pull any punches here. 'The Departed' is the definition of a crime/thriller. Any fan of Martin Scorsese, Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg, and gangster films will absolutely love 'The Departed', which deserves to go down as one of the best films of the last 25 years, if not of all time. It is near perfect in every aspect of film making, and is a non-stop, heart pounding, gripping, and brilliant thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting more.<br/><br/>Gang lord Frank Costello (3-Time Oscar Winner Jack Nicholson) is practically the most feared man in all of Boston. For years, he has controlled the streets with unparalleled authority. But now, that could change. The police has assigned a young man from another gang family turned police officer, Billy Costigan (3-Time Oscar Nominee Leonardo DiCaprio), to infiltrate Costello's system with hopes of bringing him down once and for all. Meanwhile, Costello has assigned his most loyal and trusted friend, Colin Sullivan (Oscar Winner Matt Damon), to be a mole within the Massachusetts State Police Department. When both sides discover that they have a mole in their midsts, it's war between the police and Costello.<br/><br/>The real standouts of the film are DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg, Jack Nicholson, director Martin Scorsese, and writer William Monahan. The cast is phenomenal, probably the best ensemble acting this year. DiCaprio gives the second best performance of his career (only to Blood Diamond, an Oscar nominated performance), a role which really is an actor's role. There are so many emotions involved with the character of Billy Costigan, and DiCaprio expresses them naturally. The feelings of fear, hate, depression, and indecision are displayed naturally and perfectly. It would have been very easy to nominate him for 2 Oscars in 2007, but they don't allow that. Mark Wahlberg gives the best performance in the whole film as the menacing cop Dignam. He steals the show in every scene he's in with his intensity and no holding back approach in this Oscar nominated performance. He upstages just about every other actor in this film, and looking at DiCaprio and Nicholson, that's extremely impressive. Jack Nicholson is the villain of the film, and he is just plain scary. There are moments when you will jump in fear of him, and you won't laugh at his jokes (not because they're not funny, but because you're scared to laugh at him). DiCaprio and Nicholson feed extremely well off of each other. DiCaprio has a thing for working well with other great actors (see Johnny Depp, Daniel Day Lewis, Cate Blanchett, Djimon Hounsou, and Tom Hanks). The other stars, while they are great, are not at the level of Wahlberg, DiCaprio, and Nicholson. It's not really his fault, but Matt Damon just doesn't seem right with a Boston accent. He does capture the essence of his character very well. Colin Sullivan is a character you may not understand at first, but as the film progresses, you'll know his motives and understand his actions. Well done by Mr. Damon. Vera Farmiga is proving to be one of the next generation up and comers with her second golden performance of the year (Running Scared was the other). Her ability to display powerful emotions such as anger and sadness pave the way for her to eventually become a leading lady in the caliber of Hilary Swank or Reese Witherspoon. Her performance as the conflicted and truly good Madolyn is one of the best of the year, and it's a shame she's been overlooked so much in the awards field. It must be because her character has the least connection to the main story, while she is strongly connected to Damon and DiCaprio's characters. Alec Baldwin and Ray Winstone give great performances, both being in small supporting roles. Winstone in particular stood out to me. In the smallest supporting role is Anthony Anderson, an actor generally known for comedy. With Hustle & Flow, and now The Departed, Anderson is proving that he is one of the more versatile performers in the business with a good and likable performance.<br/><br/>Writer William Monahan pens an excellent script adapted from the Asian thriller 'Infernal Affairs'. Monahan does not allow the story to slow down at all, making it feel much shorter than the 2 and a half hours it runs. Monahan develops every character extremely well, and that is the strong point, because there really aren't that many twists, and no huge one either. Monahan won the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar because of the excellent characters he created.<br/><br/>Legendary director Martin Scorsese won his first Oscar for this film because his film-making here, and all the time, is simply amazing. From the cinematography, to the sets and backgrounds he created, to the direction of a trio of phenomenal leading performances and a couple great supporting performances, Scorsese is at the top of his game in 'The Departed'. It's his best in a long time, possibly his best film. It's extremely hard to find fault with 'The Departed', except that I wish Mark Wahlberg had more screen time...but that was just because he was so damn good. 'The Departed' is one of the best films of the last 25 years, and should not be missed by any true fan of the movie industry. Remember, it won Best Picture of 2006, which it rightfully deserved. I absolutely loved this film, and recommend it to everyone age 16 and up, due to the brutal violence, strong language, and sexually explicit dialog. The 'f' word is spoken over 200 times, if you need an idea of how severe it is.<br/><br/>10/10 --spy"
"NateW","9","2","4","8 February 2007"," Far from departed for America's modern movie master
","For over two decades, Martin Scorsese captured the essence of the modern mafia and street-wise tough guys so distinctly and vividly that the very idea of anyone else trying to so seemed infeasible. With Mean Streets, Goodfellas, and Casino, Scorsese molded ugly, violent and unrepentant criminals into captivating and even likable characters that are impossible to forget. After going off the beaten path with past efforts Gangs of New York and The Aviator, the man most people (myseslf included) to be our greatest living filmmaker has returned to his roots with The Departed. Simply put, it's the best film of 2006, if not the last several years. From the first words, there's no mistake that Marty has crafted another masterpiece like only he can. Obscenely crackling dialogue, in-your-face blood and brutality and a soundtrack that hits all the right notes are only a few of the familiar fingerprints left in the reels by Mr. Scorsese. It's funny, it's startling, and it's spectacular. How good is it? This could very well be the work that finally gets Marty the Oscar gold that he should've gotten a few times by now. We'll have to wait a few more weeks to see if that happens, but it takes much less time to see that The Departed is a masterpiece of film-making from a director who has made a living out of creating them."

","What a cynical film. I don't believe (maybe I don't want to believe) the police are this corrupt. I don't believe that if you try to arrest the bad guy you get shot. Nor do I believe the only effective way to take down the corrupt is vigilante justice. I was becoming depressed and cynical about us (America) about half way through the movie. By the end, I was more disillusioned. The only way to take down the bad guy was to shoot him?! There was no hope to arrest and prosecute him? The guy who grows up on the wrong side of the tracks and tries to live the American dream (pick yourself up by the bootstraps) gets screwed throughout the movie by everyone who should be protecting him. He is thrust into a world where he's killing people (and it bothers him), he becomes increasingly addicted to prescription meds, the girl screws him over, and he get's unceremoniously shot for being the good guy. The guy who comes out of relative wealth and privilege gets the beautiful condo, the girl, the baby, and gets all this because he's corrupt. I'm no idealist about the ""american dream,"" but this was just tragedy."

Usually Scorsese's worst is still OK, but The Departed was so predictable I was seriously bored.<br/><br/>Anyways, in addition to the default point, one point for decent photography and one for Nicholson, who is always splendid, even at his worst. Matt Damon was again as good as he was in Team America and Leonardo tried hard to get rid of his boyish appeal again. I recently heard he had threatened to quit acting after Titanic, I wish he would have."

","The Departed (2006) Dir. Martin Scorsese by Connor Bailey 9/10<br/><br/>It's a shame that dear old Marty hasn't yet received an Oscar for his good work. I'm sure that he'll be nominated this year, as will the movie (although I'm tied between Marty and Alfonso Cuaron).<br/><br/>Anyway, the Departed is a remake of a Japenese thriller called ""Infernal Affairs. This film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon in the leading roles. Jack Nicholson also takes a smaller supporting role as the evil and psychotic mob boss Frank Costello. Damon plays Costello's police informant, while DiCaprio plays exactly the opposite--the police informant inside Costello's outfit.<br/><br/>Both DiCaprio and Damon are charged with finding each other's identities, while Jack does his own thing. Through a series of close calls and wonderfully suspenseful moments, the film builds into a climax that you will still be thinking about after you've left the theater.<br/><br/>As with any Scorsese picture, there is lost of violence, language (which I was a bit turned off by, so call me a wuss if you must), suspense, and, of course, great acting. Nicholson easily delivers a powerhouse performance as Costello. DiCaprio and Damon are on equal footing with Nicholson for an Academy Award nomination. But I have to say that Jack impressed me the most. <br/><br/>Others like Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Mark Whalberg, and Anthony Anderson give great performances as side characters. Whalberg is particularly memorable, and gives a whole new definition to the term ""loudmouth"".<br/><br/>And finally, onto good ol' Marty Scorsese. One would hope that he gets an Oscar this year. He will certainly be nominated, I'm sure--although, if it comes down between him and Alfonso Cuaron, I hope neither of them win, because I want them both to win equally as much.<br/><br/>If this film is not nominated for best picture, then I swear to God I won't watch another Academy Awards show."

This film is a work of art and will be a talked about movie for years to come. The only thing this film needed was a lower rating so other people can see it and agree with how much of a good movie it is. If it had a lower rating then they would have made more money because it was a very big talked about movie so people would recommend it and people would go and see it.

"frankwhat","8","2","4","2 January 2007"," ""The Departed"" Won't be Leaving Anytime Fast
","There were a couple complaints about this film's length during my screening, as clocking in at just over two and-a-half hours, it's a long movie. But there's a big difference between good long movies and bad long movies, which this is most certainly the former. The time flew by and not once did I find myself checking my watch. That being said it was also a fairly original idea, despite actually being a foreign remake. I think it's definitely safe to say that none of the important parts were lost in translation during the conversion. The finished product easily did justice to the original, especially considering how poorly the majority of Americanized releases have turned out lately.<br/><br/>As far as the acting as a whole was concerned, it was way above par. Jack Nicholson effortlessly played a great insane gangster, whose level of psychosis steadily increased. Alec Baldwin was hilarious as the dedicated but extremely sarcastic administrative officer. In fact I think it was the combination of these two characters that led to the perfect blend of comic relief that made it much easier for the conservative audience members to digest some of the harsher subject matter. The star turn was definitely put in by Leonardo DiCaprio, who displayed such naturally conflicted emotions and added so much inside depth to his role that at times it was even scary. Leo's both physical and various forms of mental anguish could be felt by all. I could really feel what he was going through the whole time without ever having those exact same experiences. This is one time where it'll be tough to ignore him at the Oscars again. Matt Damon gave a pretty flawless performance, but it also felt that he had the least interesting of all the characters despite having a lot of screen presence. Mark Wahlberg was surprisingly good in a different role than he's accustomed to, although he did drop his accent a couple times. Somewhat newcomer Vera Farmiga was passable, but not overly convincing and did seem to get clunky.<br/><br/>Overall the character development could've been better as the viewers just received a surface glance at them, but I wound up caring for most of the individuals regardless. The cinematography was excellent and contained some beautiful scenes of Boston along with some not so desirable shots of its seedy underground. The soundtrack was amazing and not just for the wonderful songs themselves. They really heightened the emotions by being blasted at some intense scenes as well. Needless to say this particularly grabbed my attention. Finally, the editing was tight which also helped with the quick pacing and the script was smoothly written into several layers but at the same time not being formulaic. Even if the scenario mainly dealt with translating the ""Infernal Affairs"" story for audiences over here.<br/><br/>This was a highly enjoyable flick and I fully recommend it on just about every level. In fact, my only real problem with it was that the ending felt rather contrived and was a letdown. It turned messy quickly and was going all over the place when the filmmakers were trying to tie everything together. Not too mention also highly improbable. Notwithstanding, if you can overlook that, then you'll be in for a real treat as usual from Martin Scorsese. This is without a doubt his best film so far this decade, and could quite possibly be right there under ""Goodfellas"". It's fairly ironic that the title is ""The Departed"", because I was so intrigued that I didn't want to leave."

"lazarou789","10","2","4","13 December 2006"," Scorsese proves himself once again
","**Contains spoilers** The departed is a great cop thriller that works on every level. Scorsese's direction is amazing proving once again he is one of the greatest directors. The editing is also great. The movie paces very well, and there are some very nice cuts that editor Thelma Schoonmaker uses. The story is great and has a lot of twist and turns that you don't expect (even though I still can't understand why Costello doesn't try to find the rat the old fashioned way and has to gather everyone's records in an envelope). The dialog is also great and fun especially from Mark Wahlberg who has a lot of nice one-liners. He also gives a good performance even though I didn't really like him as an actor. The performances are amazing from everyone. Jack Nicholson, may be a bit over the top but Scorsese knows how to control him. DiCaprio is amazing and proves again his acting talents. He is on the verge of mental collapse and has violent outbursts and DiCaprio seems like he's living his situation not acting it. Matt Damon is also great as the corrupt and sleazy cop and is the perfect actor to play DiCaprio's mirror character (the rat in the police-DiCaprio is the rat in Costello's gang). Vera Farminga does an excellent job as the only female character and Scorsese did well not to choose a famous movie star, and Martin Sheen is great as the head of the head for the investigation against Costello and I was really shocked when he was thrown out of the building. Which brings me to the ending. Though I was a bit annoyed about the way everybody got shot in the head, after I thought about it a little I realized that there wasn't any other way to end the movie. By killing all the 'rats' (Costello is the rat of his own gang to the FBI, DiCaprio is the rat in Costello's gang, Matt Damon is the rat in the police), Scorsese gives a message that betrayers will get what they deserve and makes the film theme of trust and betrayal even stronger. Now to see Infernal Affairs and compare the two!"
"almajo","7","2","4","11 December 2006"," A successful operation, but the patient died on the way to the ER!
","""The Departed"" - like most other Scorsese movies - focuses on hormone-troubled males who hardly ever learn to grow up, entangled in an unforgiving society, playing their little games until they hit earth. The mob movie master has delivered another solid piece, with all necessary ingredients, but the result's rather half-baked.<br/><br/>The whole Irish/Catholic setting introduction in the first few minutes, with a roaming, literally shadowy Jack Nicholson appears to be some kind of an odd mechanism, as it changes the focus and shifts the weight of the story towards him, a move he doesn't really deserve. It seems like today's moviegoer is inept at guessing the bigger picture of a story: Whereas it was intriguing to figure out who's who in ""Infernal Affairs"" as the movie progressed, here it's all laid out from the start: What an insult to an intelligent audience. <br/><br/>Therefore, the initial 10 minutes could've been left out entirely, but my guess is there were some contract ties interfering with the artistic concept, resulting in a beginning that serves but as one big show-off for key-player Nicholson. Speaking of cutting, the crude editing style took me by surprise: At various points throughout the movie, cuts are made in the middle of an action, especially the case with inserts, resulting in a sort of staccato-like viewing experience. In addition, the jump cut approach doesn't quite succeed: The various, random back-and-forth jumps within the storyline left me questioning their real purpose.<br/><br/>When it comes to the plot, Scorsese adapted most crucial elements 1:1 (even going as far as stealing shots), but the remake boasts way too many extended scenes, including an Italian mafia subplot and trying to disguise the fact that Scorsese simply worked from a foreign template, thus culminating in a total running time of a close-to-unbearable 150 minutes. Unfortunately, many important puzzle pieces and details are dropped: The police academy background is nearly left out and also the fact that the original mafia boss once served as an instructor in the police squad. Other critics have already pointed out that the subplot involving the police chief (Martin Sheen's character) and his mole (DiCaprio's role) is entirely missing, and to make ""The Departed"" even less convincing, DiCaprio's infiltration duty is reduced from an impressive 9 years (for Tony Leung in ""Infernal Affairs"") to a meager single year. Furthermore, I didn't particularly like the whole ""swearing competition"": For Scorsese, grown-up men are always ruled by their inherent animalistic nature, including excessive verbal and physical violence, but the amount of repetition in this picture distracts from what makes the actual script so fascinating - how and when the two snitches finally find out about one another. The dialogue is very poor for most part and the few instances where Nicholson is allowed to throw in some classic philosophy are rare. ""The Departed"" also changes the conversation by the two mob members outside the cafÃ© by a complete 180 degrees. Instead of unmasking undercover agents as people who ""look at you"", it's now the ones that ""look away"". <br/><br/>As for acting performances, I give an entertaining Mark Wahlberg the Number One spot (although his character doesn't exist in the original), closely followed by DiCaprio, who delivers a fine portrait of a troubled youth from South Boston that can't really cut his ties to his past. Nicholson does a memorable job at being displeased about life in general, as a fatalistic, old Irish mafia boss, although his decreasing physical agility and somnambulistic appearance makes me question his dedication for the movie. Sadly enough, Matt Damon does what he always does best in a movie he appears in: playing an unconvincing role. Not really being a character actor, equipped with an neverchanging haircut, stone-cold facial expressions, it feels to me as if he's never really emotionally present. His lacklustre involvement is a real letdown, and a definite loss for the picture. Compared to ""Infernal Affairs"", there's only one ""big"" female character, and even though Vera Farmiga manages to play a psychiatrist torn between the two sides of the same coin, the role demands way too much from her. I feel sorry that ""The Departed"" omits a second girlfriend from the original (Andy Lau's annoying female sidekick), which makes it incredibly difficult to portray two women in one. Scorsese adds more responsibility to Farmiga's role, but in the end, she suffers the same destiny like her Hong Kong counterparts: she's too weak, too unimportant in the big scheme of things. What the pregnancy's supposed to add to the storyline, I don't know.<br/><br/>Something quite distracting that I noticed were the constant background songs. Rarely does the film give you some quiet time, silence is a foreign word for Scorsese. As if the combination of hard-boiled, simplified dialogue and smashing action wasn't enough to please a younger audience, ""The Departed"" serves you song after song, randomly piling up a plethora of music tracks that don't really serve any purpose. On the contrary, they are a real issue. They're neither location background music, nor a true soundtrack.<br/><br/>To come to an end, I ask myself why the remake is almost an entire hour longer than the original. This movie is so artificially stretched and chewed out, hosts unnecessary lengthy scenes that don't really enhance the storyline or the movie overall. The original suspense is lost and makes way for a exhibition of overpaid actors. Two and a half hours for a tale that can be told in a much more concise and straightforward manner, as the four-year old Asian installment deservedly demonstrated.<br/><br/>I doubt that the change of East Coast scenery will Scorsese do any good for next year's Oscar race. I fear that an aging man of such lasting creativity and intelligence has lost the plot yet again, after an abysmal ""Aviator"", and that he'll end up just like Robert Altman did, with the possession of a statuette he won't really be able to cherish."

A lot of one-dimensional characters, one-dimensional violence and over the top language. 273 times the word 'fuck' seems a bit overdone. On the other hand, diCaprio portraying a multi-layered character, full of doubts, was an absolute joy to watch. This in contrast to the other leads, which gave a rather charicatural performance. As for as Oscar-night concerned, we would be very surprised to not see diCaprio at least get a nomination, but that's it!

","Scoresese has made some fantastic films, but constantly struggles with telling a story in anything like 90 minutes. Alright, this is a growing trend across the pond - possibly due to pressures to satisfy an American audience which needs to be told not shown (after all the American trailer is typically the summarised plot, rather than the European teaser approach) - but quality story telling without undue length is something that strong directors (like Scoresese) ought to be pushing past the strangle hold of Hollywood producers. My own suspicion is that there's a certain amount of Lucas-syndrome amongst those who've aged with success.<br/><br/>The Departed features a strong cast and is well acted. Locations and set pieces do make an excellent job of transporting the original plot from Hong Kong to seedy US streets. However, the story is not Scorsese's invention, so the film really should be adding some extra value in its retelling. Sadly, this does not happen. The brilliance of the original plot remains (just), whilst all that is added is time.<br/><br/>Certainly not the best film of the year - although could be the best gangster flick of the year.<br/><br/>Worth seeing, but to truly appreciate see the original Hong Kong film instead."

","The twist and turns in this movie are unpredictable. But the plot, perfectly simple. This all adds up to a flawless emotionally packed who's-who crime drama with a bit of pulp to say the least. There is no one better to direct a crime drama, then Martin Scorsese. There's only one powerhouse director that could have pulled this cast of many superstars together, yet it not get in the way of the characters. You can't find a better cast! To top it all off, Scorsese once again merged music into film better than anyone, where the emotion of the music enhanced the image on screen. Having said that, and of course the soundtrack had to be a throwback to my favorite kind of music. As the classic rock soundtrack magically weaved itself from the beginning scene until the end, the cast of music stars seemed to echo the film stars. The music artists and song choices were if God came down to Scorsese and said that he has one list of songs that he can take with him to heaven. It absolutely hypnotized me. Ironically, the soundtrack gave the movie a modern or more perhaps shall I say timeless feel. I can't wait to see this movie again and again on DVD."
"reidster21","10","2","4","19 November 2006"," Worth seeing twice
","I really liked this movie. A lot.<br/><br/>Frequently when a movie with this much talent is put together, it seems like a lot of it gets drowned out by some other element of cinematography, but here, the film making process actually did what it was supposed to do--it acted as a supporting mechanism for the brilliant actors.<br/><br/>I have to admit that the casting was superb. Leonardo did a great job... he really came through in the clutch with one of the most difficult acting jobs he could have been assigned. Likewise, Nicholson was AMAZING. He was the absolute perfect man for the role and he will leave you wanting to like him, but the whole time knowing he is the bad guy. Damon again does what he can with his rather bland personality, which happens to be perfect for this role... he was the right casting choice and fits into the movie perfectly.<br/><br/>The two big surprise actors in this movie are Wahlberg and Baldwin. Both have minor roles, but are hilarious. Wahlberg especially. He provides the necessary comedic relief to make this movie feel like a dark comedy at some points rather than a drama. Also the Boston element really comes forth within this movie... there is a heavy emphasis on the Irishness of the town not seen since Boondock Saints.<br/><br/>The character development that we see is really a major plus to this movie. Watching the characters change and suspicions arise does just as much for this movie as the action does.<br/><br/>The reason that I didn't give it a ten is because the ending leaves a few questions that give the viewer a solid amount of confusion, and in a movie like this I feel like it would be best to answer those questions. However the ending is great--its shocking and brilliant and leaves the viewer with a deep satisfaction that most movies these days do not.<br/><br/>This is the epitome of a good film, don't let this one pass you by."

","This is the best film i have seen in God only knows how long. It was amazing.<br/><br/>Every performance in this film is flawless. Mark Whalberg is amazing, i didn't know he was that good. Jack Nicholson is the top of his game. Yes he is always amazing but in this film i think he is extra wonderful.The scene where he is talking about smelling a rat is stunning. I could go on and on but as i said there is not a bad performance in this movie.<br/><br/>Now let us talk about the genius that is Martin Scorsese. Now i am a little biased on the judging of directing because i think Scorsese is brilliant but, if you don't already agree with me, see this film and i am sure you will. The film is stunning. This has to be Scorsese's year at the Oscars or something is up.<br/><br/>The writing of the film is brilliant. You must see it to believe it.

"lemon_magic","9","2","4","18 November 2006"," Simply the most gripping movie I've seen this year
","Not everything about ""The Departed"" is perfect, but I don't care. I was absolutely knocked out by this movie. I'll put it this way: I have never been a real fan of Damon, DiCaprio or Mark Wahlberg, thinking that they were all somewhat-to-highly overrated. But not anymore. Given a real story, and real direction, they all jump off the screen in the best performances I've ever seen from any of them. (Wahlerg's part is relatively small but he is 100% better than anything else I've seen him in). I'm even ready to forgive Alec Baldwin for becoming a bloated self-parody; he's taken what he's become and used it to great effect here, and I can hardly wait to see what he does next.<br/><br/>The darkness, the violence, the bad language and the bleak cynicism of the screenplay may make ""The Departed"" a tough view for the average ""soccer mom"" and Oprah follower; but anyone who appreciates complexity, ambiguity and genuine moral anguish in their movies will find this movie well worth their time.<br/><br/>In addition to all this, Jack Nicholson seems to have physically transformed into actor Rip Torn for this role, which is great...because the only actor I would have preferred to Jack in this role would have BEEN Rip Torn.<br/><br/>I never saw the original Hong Kong movie this is based on, so I can't say how it compares, but it doesn't matter. Scorcese has proved, once again, that he is still one of the greatest directors of our time."

","Jack Nicholson is widely known for playing characters like himself. The question for the audience of his latest film, The Departed, is, will you be watching his character or the grinning Nicholson we know and love? Veteran Director Martin Scorsese opens the film in a way that any speculation of whether Nicholson can pull off his nastiest role to date (his turn as The Joker in Batman comes close) vanishes on the spot. Scorsese shows Nicholson in shadows during the opening sequence, aided by The Rolling Stone's Gimme Shelter. Not until the audience has been truly sold that this is the brutal, malevolent, and immoral Frank Costello, does Nicholson's face reveal itself from under the shadows.<br/><br/>The Departed, based on the Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs, carries some large star power. The director, Scorsese, is arguably one of the best working directors to date. The cast includes Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan, Matt Damon as Colin Sullivan, the aforementioned Nicholson as Frank Costello, with supporting roles by Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Vera Farmiga, Alec Baldwin, and Ray Winstone. Catch any wind of that list of names and any expectations of this film go sky high. Yet despite gargantuan expectations for a film that was rumored to have so much tension on its set, the movie succeeds on almost every level.<br/><br/>First off, the screenplay by William Monohan is brilliant. The fast, often surprisingly hilarious dialogue is coupled with the gripping story of two informers, one infiltrating the Boston State Police (Damon) and the other the Irish Mafia (DiCaprio). Scorsese's stylistic direction and old film school techniques assisted by Michael Ballhaus's slick cinematography make the story flow smoothly yet surprisingly fast-paced for a two and a half hour movie.<br/><br/>The acting is phenomenal all around. DiCaprio proves his skill to everyone who denied his talent, even after his award worthy role as Howard Hughes in The Aviator (his second pairing with Scorsese, the first being Gangs of New York). He truly gives a layered, emotional performance, and arguably his best. Matt Damon reminds us that he is still an extremely capable actor, yet his role feels overshadowed by DiCaprio's. Nicholson gives one of his best performances with his wild turn as Frank Costello. However, the very underrated Mark Wahlberg gives a scene stealing performance as Dignam, giving his best work to date. Just about every single word that comes out of his mouth is absolutely hilarious. Sheen also gives a surprisingly great supporting performance, as do Farmiga and Baldwin.<br/><br/>The film is nearly perfect until a scene during its climax, where the action might appear over the top to some. But not to worry, the film's ultimate ending provides all the satisfaction one could hope for. The Departed is a remarkable film, proving that Martin Scorsese still has it after all these years, churning out what is possibly the best movie of the year."

","One of best movies I ever watched. It thrills you, it makes you send the messages in the middle of the cinema, because you can't handle excitement. I mean , the end is terrible, but I expected that it will be half tragical, and that leading role will die. Also I shared shympaties for the bad guy, who is acted by Mark Wahlberg, because we have something in common, and I knew that he is good, and that he will stay from the beginning to an end. Direction is more that good, but they are very poor chances that Martin Scorcese will won the Oscar for this movie, because today, ''hard'' movies full with moral which talk about racism, homosexuality are very fashionable, nor crime-drama and Thriller. Sometimes scenes are too brutal, with no reason. That is only bad thing about this movie. First time in my life I like Leonardo Di Caprio. Good movie."

OK, so the language is a bit choice and some of the violence is a bit full on but it feels at home in this kind of movie - certainly not inappropriate.

","Absolutely brilliant, super performance from every actor especially good old Jack and Dicaprio. And there are no excuses for not giving the Oscar to Scorsese this time !!! Also a good job by the pretty unknown Vera Fermiga who shines among the stars. Scorsese has done it again. My opinion is that this present time mob story actually is better than one of my favorites The Goodfellas. Very commendably. Problaby an Oscar for Dicaprio and another nomination for Nicholson. Its along time since we have seen Martin Sheen in a great role as Inspector Qeenan, Wahlberg does it good to. His role is a bit annoying but very important in the end (say no more). Damon is as always doing a good job but not as remarkable as Nicholson and Dicaprio who really shines. I haven't seen ""infernal affairs"" yet but after seeing The Departed I definitely have to see it."

"chowy-1","9","2","4","14 November 2006"," Better than the HK version
","I've seen the HK version, Internal Affair, of this movie long before it became available in movie theater. I think the delivery is much better in The Departed than Internal Affair. I have seen countless of Hong Kong movie, believe me, I was born in Hong Kong.<br/><br/>In the HK one, the dialogue were just not there. I think in general, dialogue in HK movie need a lot of works. Second, the role of each player wasn't very clear in the HK version. Remember at the beginning where both of the cadets started from the same Triad group, i.e. the temple sense at the very beginning. So it makes audience wonder who is really the bad guy. Third, in the end, the police guy (the real bad guy) trying the be good after the head detective was killed. I think that confused the heck of the audience there. The role switching near end of the movie is a big no-no and just don't make sense. If I was the mole in the police force, I would have done what Matt Damon did, killed everyone to protect my identity.<br/><br/>The American version has a much more powerful delivery of the story. It is very good in showing how Leonardo DiCaprio nearly becoming insane for being a mole in the Mob. The 3-way relationships between Matt/Leonardo/Vera Farmiga is a good tying-everything-together development. The brain splatter scenes simply drive home the fact that its is not a nice job to work with the Mob. It is expected because it is an action movie, period.<br/><br/>In all, I like the American version over the HK one is not because the story but its delivery and logical way of laying out the characters. It make you think twice on becoming a mole...."
"thechosen1","9","2","4","14 November 2006"," Brilliant, brilliant performances
","OK now... I've never been a big Leonardo DiCaprio fan, but I have always believed that he is a brilliant actor. ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"", ""Gangs of New York"", ""Catch Me If You Can"", ""The Aviator"" and now ""The Departed."" All fantastic performances. This might be a bit premature for me to say, but after four Golden Globe nominations with one win, plus two Oscar nominations... come on Academy people, hand over an Oscar to this guy, he deserves it. (Martin Scorcese's is a whole other request... I've given up on that one). He really held his own against an acting powerhouse like Jack Nicholson (who was, of course, great as well). In fact there were times when he actually stole the scene from him. If ever there was a character you sympathised with from the very beginning, it was this guy. And DiCaprio's performance really helped build that feeling.<br/><br/>Matt Damon has been steadily pacing himself as an actor of immense worth as well. His career speaks for itself. Solid performances every time. It was nice to see him play a character like this though. I agree with people here who say he should do this type of role more often. He was believable, it worked.<br/><br/>Martin Sheen was, well, Martin Sheen. Great screen presence.<br/><br/>Alec Baldwin was hilarious. I love the way he just disappears into his characters. He just 'blends in' with the atmosphere created by the scene. Swift, sharp dialogue execution. I love it.<br/><br/>But Mark Wahlberg stole the show for me. He didn't have as much screen time as the others, but man oh man, he just killed it. Brilliant performance. There are times when you wonder whether he's going to be in the next scene just so you can see him again. He stood out in every scene he was in: in the beginning with Sheen and DiCaprio and then later with Nicholson, Baldwin and Damon. I think he's always had this in him, but he really needed a quality film like this (Scorcese being the director has gotta help) to show what he can really do. I was blown away by his performance.<br/><br/>In fact there wasn't a hair out of line in all the performances. We've all been hearing it for weeks and I'll just say it again... this is a superbly-cast movie.<br/><br/>Now with the acting out of the way, let's get to the rest of the movie. It was thrilling, it was suspenseful and it took me a few minutes to get used to the ending, but the longer I thought about it, the more I liked it. I haven't seen ""Internal Affairs"" so I have no idea how similar this is to that. But I don't like making too many comparisons anyway. This movie stands out quite prominently on its own. A bit of a slow start, but things really heat up after the first hour.<br/><br/>Highly recommended. :-) ****/***** 9/10."

","The film is very violent indeed, but its artistic merits are truly overwhelming. It is rare to see such a high standard of acting, and this unqualified praise is for the entire cast. It is too neutral politically but one can draw one's own conclusions. Directing and editing are excellent, too. The film makes a Compelling viewing and it is even thought-provoking. A word of polite criticism: the violence is sometimes excessive and I detected at least four or five people at the theatre who actually laughed as if they witnessed a slapstick-type comedy. I feel that some creative restraint would have been helpful. Fortunately, the assured handling of the plot by the director has proved to be the decisive factor in the film's outstanding overall impact. I am almost certain that viewers will Cherish it even in 40 years time."
"DickNay","9","2","4","12 November 2006"," Finally!
","Finally, Martin Scorsese returns to the gritty underworld of crime in the United States. After ""Casino"", he left it - for whatever reason - and made a few bombs, followed by ""Gangs of New York"" and ""The Aviator."" One could say that after so many years away from the crime underworld (over 10) Scorsese could have lost his touch. This is just not so. The camera flies around just like in ""Goodfellas"" and keeps us on the edge of our seat for the two-and-a-half-hour run time. The violence, Scorsese's trademark for so many years, is kept in check by the director up until the bloody end - and that's not a British-ism; it's quite gruesome at the end. Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio are superb as the rat of Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and the rat of the Boston PD inside Costello's crew, respectively. The plot is simple, but through his mastery of the camera, Scorsese keeps us interested and engaged. William Monahan's script is simple, but relatively well-done (this is only his second produced screenplay; his first was ""Kingdom of Heaven."") The supporting cast is excellent; Martin Sheen plays a high-ranking official in the Boston PD, Mark Whalberg plays his slight subordinate (Whalberg's Dingam is a real prick, but ultimately, a hero - kind of), Alec Baldwin plays the head of the Special Investigations Unit, who's tracking Costello (Costello's mole is within the Unit.) Scorsese has brought us back to the American crime underworld, and it is a journey that makes us realize: films like these are why we go to the movies in the first place."
"Sparrowmaniac","8","2","4","11 November 2006"," Scorsese hits the jackpot..... again !!!
","The Departed is one of the best contemporary thrillers that I have seen. True its a remake, and critics will be be saying,""So what the Chinese did this before and even made sequel to it.."" But Scorsese's Departed is a whole new thing. Firstly Jack Nicholson.(Screw me, but I'm a big fan of him...) Even though Nicholson is the villain, the movie doesn't give him much of a headway. He starts off as a local absconder and rises up to a mafia boss, but throughout the movie he rules about every other actor. Be it DiCaprio or Damon. Even in the scene where he dies he commands an aura of respect. Second point making this a must see, is undoubtedly its marvelous star cast. True again that some of the actors were not used to their potential like Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg but still no one would be able to resist the temptation of such an unbelievable cast. Thirdly Martin Scorsese. The bloke has given Hollywood some amazing movies over the years. He may go down in history as the greatest director not to get a Academy Award(I cant see him bagging an award for this, since its a remake) but he truly is a genius. And lastly Pink Floyd. If you people are wondering if I have lost my nuts, then no. Indeed Floyd's most remarkable song,""Comfortably Numb"" does feature in the movie in the love making scene between DiCaprio's character and Vera Farmiga.<br/><br/>No point harping about the story cause many people saw the smash hit, Infernal Affairs and its a clone of that. Every odd scene, leaving out the ending. The technical bits was good. Screenplay was solid, acting out of the world, there was some bits for comic relief. Some real cool stuff shown with cell phones. Matt Damon, DiCaprio and Martin Sheen all were very good. Vera Farmiga also looked good, even being a new face. Alec Baldwin was vastly underused, so was Mark Wahlberg. But end of the day Jack Nicholson owned the movie. He set the tone, and even at the age of 75, he commands such respect. The scene at the porn theater, I couldn't comprehend Nicholson enacting that masturbating drama, but he pulled it off. Its like a tug of war, with all the heavy weights on one side and the 75 year old man on the other. So bottom line Departed is one hell of a movie, a rated must see. 8/10 !!!!"
"matt-stabile","7","2","4","9 November 2006"," Pretty Good, But From Scorsese We Expect More
","Read This and Other Reviews at TheExpeditioner.com<br/><br/>I know that this next statement is irrelevant regarding my review but I feel obligated to state it anyway for the sole reason of justifying a perhaps more critical review than I otherwise would have written: Scorsese is easily one of my favorite directors. Not on only for the films that he has made, but also for his passionate involvement in elevating film as art outside of the realm of his own film-making. From his documentary work to his stature as this country's Movie Laureate, Scorsese is ever-present discussing film, throwing his two cents into a wide variety of cinema documentaries and retrospectives -- which I wonder if he agrees to do when he hears that his absence would cause the documentarian to interview Brett Ratner regarding Rossellini's influence on neo-realism.<br/><br/>But with great power comes great responsibility, and for Scorsese this means film-making that lives up to his name, which unfortunately ""The Departed"" does not. Which is not to say that it is a bad movie, it's just not what one comes to expect from a true genius in the field. In ""The Departed,"" the swift dialogue and intricate plot is weighed down by its notable plot holes and manic roster of male leads which looks like Ben Affleck's Friday night poker game spilled out onto a Hollywood sound stage after one too many double espressos.<br/><br/>The two exceptions to this is not surprisingly Damon, who once again puts in a rare performance of a lead star adopting a character rather than vice-versa, and to my surprise DiCaprio, who when he steps back from playing hyper-Leo, effectively exudes the vulnerability and nervousness of a character fighting the inner tension of a person torn between professional loyalty and personal survival. On the opposite side of the fence is Wahlberg, whose singular direction seemed to have been, ""Be really loud and mad,"" Baldwin and Sheen, two roles that would have been better served by character actors given their minor role in the film, and Nicholson, who seems to think that he needs to prove he can still play a bad guy by burning random objects and fondling dismembered body parts. But with his unkept hair and woefully chosen wardrobe, Nicholson's supposedly evil gangster character seems like he would be more comfortable lining up at the shuffleboard deck than capping bullets in enemies heads, which by the time the movie winds it way to the end, happens frequently enough to the various characters that the impact is minor at best, leading me to wonder whether killing off main characters in a movie is exceeding profound or simply an easy escape for a story searching for a finale.<br/><br/>And with any discussion of a film by a legendary director, Scorcese's performance itself needs to be judged as a sixth man in an otherwise crowded court. Here it seems that his characteristic style of un-static camera work and innovative plot progression is all but absent here. The Departed looks prosaic and darts along frantically from one scene to another with what seems like little thought of what the impact of each scene would be on the audience. Though in another Scorsese motif, the thundering rock soundtrack was well chosen -- including a great version of ""Comfortably Numb"" with Van Morrison on vocals -- and worked well to create both an edgy feel for the gritty locales as well as providing dramatic influence in certain key scenes.<br/><br/>But as the pasts of the main characters come back to haunt each of them with dire consequences, Scorcese's own cinematic past does the same, building up expectations that are not quite met in otherwise good film that should have been great. Luckily for Scorsese, in the world of film-making this amounts to little more than a bad review rather than a bullet in the head. If only ""The Departed"" could have been so lucky."

","OK. i'm opening this topic cause i'm having mixed feelings about the ending of the movie. when i'm talking about the ending, i'm talking about the part from the moment Leonardo realizes that Damon is a rat in the force, and on.<br/><br/>first of all - why does Leo run away? makes no sense for him to run and then later tries to ""arrest"" Damon. why doesn't he go straight to Baldwin?! 2. what's the thing with the yellow envelope?!? he gives it to psychiatrist and then...what? no sense, again. 3. everybody get's killed. after seeing Goodfellas (imdb auto corrected the name) and the casino i can understand that Scorsese likes to kill everybody on the end. but in this point, it makes no sense! what was i watching for 2 hours if on the end - no one wins? the mobs get wiped out, the good guy, the bad guy, innocent people (like the black cop). why? i mean, what's the point of executing everybody? who won? what have i learned in this movie?<br/><br/>if you ask me, a great movie with perfect performance, almost unseen quality acting crew, interesting story during all of the movie... and it gets destroyed on the ending showing us that actually there is no winner. it just has NO ENDING. that frustrated me, a lot.<br/><br/>2 more questions. why in the name of god would Wahlberg kill Damon??? unless of course it was Wahlberg who ""got killed"" in front of an elevator by Damon. i'm not sure of that. first i thought it was him, but then my friend said it's not true, that it is another cop. 2nd question. if Damon ""wasn't the only one"" working for Nicholson in the force, what did the other guy do? what ever Nicholson did, what ever he needed help with, Damon was the one who would tip him off and save his ass. so what the f..k did the other mole do for Nicholson?<br/><br/>my opinion after a long conversation with my friend: the end is not Scorsese's work. i think the producers said ""ok, we want it to be this way"" and it had to be like that. cause a disturbing and illogical ending like this is nothing like Scorsese. i just can't believe it's so.<br/><br/>i gave this movie a ""7"" just for the ending. unfortunately i will always remember it as ""could-of-been-a-master-piece"" but didn't cause the ending was destroyed it. hope to see a directors cut.<br/><br/>cheers all!"

","The departed is a top movie that will be remembered for decades. It contains everything that a good movie of this genre needs to contain. <br/><br/>I have to admit that this was a very good, memorable and exciting movie. And the cast is amazing, especially the role that jack Nicholson is playing- which will probably lead to his fourth academy award for best male actor. <br/><br/>But still of all its positive sides I don't like the idea that Hollywood movies kind of ""steal"" other foreign scripts/movies and turn them to American movies. I don't know if many of you know that the departed is kind of a rip off from the marvelous Hong Kong movie Infernal affairs. It came out year 2002 and in my opinion it's even better then departed an obvious 10/10!! I like it better because it's exciting all through the movie, one of the reasons is because it's 50 minutes shorter. <br/><br/>Okay, now to my point. All due respect for the departed as a movie, as I said before I like it a lot. But the thing that bothers me is why Hollywood movies have to take other foreign scripts and turn them so that it will be more suitable for an American public. And because they also use well known actors, this will be a far greater success at the box offices all around the world then the Hong Kong movie. I think that they kind of take the credit from Infernal affairs, and it will be Departed that will be remembered throughout movie history. <br/><br/>I think that's wrong thing to do, instead I think they should broadcast and market the Hong Kong movie in America and all around the world. They should try to do something about it, for e.g. came up with new ideas, new scripts, instead of just changing a bit of the content. By doing this Infernal affairs would get the credit they deserve abroad and we could also maybe have a totally different and new film instead of the Departed with the same actors and director. I don't know if many people agree with me, but that is my opinion.<br/><br/>Please comment what I have been writing here, would be glad if you did!"

"ericscartier","8","2","4","31 October 2006"," A gem from a master of the craft
","Scorcese has crafted another excellent gangster film. ""The Departed"" succeeds on all levels, including its script, its images, its performances and its themes. The intricacies of the complex screenplay are a delight to absorb and unravel. Several suspenseful scenes are masterfully strung together in such a way that the viewer has only a few moments to regain her breath, process the clues and prepare to hold her breath again. No other director has so successfully captured acts of violence in the filmic medium, and the violence Scorcese depicts in ""The Departed"" is ugly, sudden and brutal. The dialogue is riddled with profanity and tension-relieving jokes (Wahlberg's hip-rocking character's quips and insults alone are worth the price of admission), and the cast delivers its lines in convincingly authentic Boston accents. A number of actors turn in stellar performances, notably Nicholson (as a demonic crime boss), DiCaprio (as an undercover cop) and Baldwin (as a fast-talking, affable detective). Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, who collaborated with Fassbinder on his finest films, frames the ratty world of ""The Departed"" with a sharp eye. One scene, a foot chase through Chinatown, is remarkably beautiful, composed of quick cuts, vivid colors and steam. There is a recurring theme, virile masculinity, which remained with me long after viewing the film, and I will continue to reflect on the ways in which Scorcese (dis)associates it with violence, success and happiness. Though the film runs 149 minutes, it does not run long. This is taut, top-notch film-making, and Martin Scorcese reaffirms his status as one of the few living masters of the craft."
"rileymullins","9","2","4","29 October 2006"," Scorsese Does It Again!!!
","Certainly Martin Scorsese is in the Top 5 film Director's of all time! His ability to put out movie after movie with astonishing screenplays and unforgettable characters is unlike any other. The Departed is an amazing film, from its acting, to its script, to its portrayal of the Boston police and the Irish mafia, and to its shocking finale.<br/><br/>ACTING: The acting in the film is superb. At first it's awkward with everyone having Irish accents and such but you learn to love it. Like all of Scorsese's pictures, The Departed is extremely well cast. Leonardo DiCaprio is a fine actor indeed and may very well merit another Oscar nomination for his roll as an undercover in the Irish Mob, but nothing is certain with the Oscars. Mel Gibson wasn't even nominated for playing William Wallace in Braveheart, even though Nicolas Cage was more than deserving of his well earned Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas. Anyways back to The Departed. Matt Damon also delivers a strong role and possibly the best performance of his career. Is it just me or does Scorsese bring out the best in people? Everyone is already quite aware of Jack Nicholson's quality as an actor so I'll only say one thing. The personality he gives in his role as a criminal is surreal. There are still 3 actors who must be noted for making The Departed all that it is. Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, and Alec Baldwin. Each of them giving unforgettable performances. They really stand out in the film and provide some humorous comments as well.<br/><br/>STORY: From writer William Monahan (Kingdom of Heaven and soon to be Jurassic Park IV) comes an engaging, thrilling, and powerful story about corruption within the Boston Police and its ties with the Irish Mafia. Two moles, one within the police force tipping off the mafia, and one with the mafia tipping off the police force play a frustrating game of cat and mouse to discover each other's identities. That's the basic story line. Throw in a little drama, some very entertaining dialogue, a couple gun fights, and a few well placed twists and turns and you've just seen The Departed. Do all of Scorsese's movies have great screenplays or is it just me? <br/><br/>OVERALL: The Departed is a must see and will hopefully win at least a few Oscars this upcoming year. With a runtime of about 2 and 1/2 hours it keeps you engaged the entire time. It's basically rated R for language, a little sexuality, and some traditional Scorsese violence. Great acting, cinematography, screenplay, musical score pieced together nicely, and direction make The Departed an astonishing film."
"starlit-sky","10","2","4","29 October 2006"," An explosive crime-thriller! Could be the best movie of the year.
","Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) are two new Police Academy graduates who are trying to make it into the police department. However, Colin has been raised by the notorious Irish mafia crime-lord Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and is only there to infiltrate the police dept. He makes it through the interview and becomes an employee of the unit whereas Billy is denied the same opportunity. Instead, Billy is offered to take an assignment as an undercover cop to infiltrate the mafia. But this is a very special assignment and only two police officers, Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) know that Billy is actually a cop.<br/><br/>So, we have two men each working secretly for the other side and no one, except their bosses, knows their true identities. Soon, each side realizes that there is a mole in their unit and tries to uncover his identity. That's when things start to get tricky. As each party tries to inform their boss about the possible future actions of the other side, it turns into a dangerous game. Colin warns his boss Costello ahead of time because he knows about the operations of the police department and Billy tries to inform Oliver and Dignam about what Costello is up to.<br/><br/>This is truly an excellent film that will keep you at the edge of your seat until the very end. The plot is very well-written and, despite the many twists and turns, it feels completely natural. I feel the need to say a few things about Leonardo DiCaprio. I have always liked his acting but his performance in this movie is truly magical. He has matured as an actor and he completely steals the show in this one. He is explosive! All the other actors are actually performing very well.<br/><br/>I am not a big fan of remakes and this is a remake of an originally a 2002 Hong Kong movie, ""Mou gaan dou"" (see the name Siu Fai Mak in the writing credits; he is the screenplay writer for the original movie). Having said that, I must admit that this movie really blew me away and I am not a kind of guy who is easily blown away. This could be the best movie of the year."

","Y'know, I don't think I've actually watched much Scorcese before I watched this last night with the missus, but I can understand why people rate him so highly - in terms of putting together a tight piece of entertainment and getting convincing (albeit not necessarily realistic) performances out of his actors, he's indisputably one of the best, but I couldn't escape the impression that this film was utterly ridiculous. The good points are many; Jack is 200% fun to watch, it rattles along at a rate of knots and I was always intrigued to see what happened next (despite it dragging in a couple of scenes near the end)amongst others, but equally there were places where I thought, ""Oh come on...""; I wouldn't know a Boston accent if I heard it, but despite that, even I could tell that a fair whack of them were mangled, especially Ray Winstone's (you're great to watch, Ray, but please, god, stick to Cockney). And I didn't really buy Vera Farmiga's character, but then I've lived a very sheltered life...<br/><br/>I guess I was expecting something more hard hitting rather than this silly, but as I say, it was a lot of fun.

"craigsh11","10","2","4","23 October 2006"," Scorcese in my top three movie makers of all time
","I have loved Martin Scorcese for years and never realized that he had not won an Oscar. Jeez, Raging Bull alone should have garnered one... anyway. When I went to the theater, I knew that I would see a great film but also a grotesquely bloody one. Both assumptions came true. Jack Nicholson was at his best since Cukoo's Nest, Matt Damon was great, Leonardo DiCaprio (whom I've not liked since Titantic) was very good. Mark Wahlburg Was my favorite however and for the first half of the movie I was thinking he was going to turn out to be the mole in the cops because he was so in-your-face anti-criminal. I love Scorcese's use of period music, this was first best seen/heard in Goodfellas and his use of comedic dialogue between bad guys. I disagree with any of your reviewers who said the movie was too long, MS needs every moment of movie time to weave his films. BUT, I had to turn my head/cover my eyes at least 6 times knowing there was going to be yet another head shot with too-realistic splatter (This is from a guy who used to watch Scarface every weekend for a year). I would not attend or tolerate such gruesome killings in any movie but one by Martin Scorcese (loved Goodfellas, Casino, Taxi Driver and have seen all multiple times). If Raging Bull had been in color I doubt if I would have seen it more than once. My other two favorite film makers are Woody Allen and Spike Lee (Clockers was produced, incidentally by Martin Scorcese). I would completely recommend this film for any adult without combat experiences because it would surely evoke PTSD-like flashbacks in it's realism (I'm a psychologist BTW who works with vets daily). MS should have won Best Director multiple times already. He should win it here as well as a life-time Achievement award (I think he already has one of these no?)."
"jayk_bakner","9","2","4","22 October 2006"," Awesome Remake
","Martin Scorsese! The greatest director never to win an Oscar? Or overrated, homophobic trash-monger? You hear a lot of things thrown about concerning the mono-browed director. But whatever is said about him, he's delivered something special with The Departed.<br/><br/>Essentially an 'adaptation' - I'm tentative to use 'remake', for reasons discussed later - of a hugely successful Hong Kong cop thriller, Infernal Affairs. The action takes place in Boston, USA, and follows two men - Leo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan and Matt Damon as Colin Sullivan - from opposite sides of the law. Costigan is a cop (of sorts) who goes into deep cover in the Boston Irish Mafia; Sullivan is a mafia plant within the Police Force itself. And basically, they're assigned to find out each-other's identities.<br/><br/>What follows is a fantastically tense movie; masterfully directed by Scorsese in such a visceral and epic manner that you just get caught up in it all. Honestly, I couldn't tear my eyes away from the screen - despite it being just over two-and-a-half hours long! It's truly an achievement that Scorsese is able to hold a movie-goer's attention for such time; all the characters are compelling, the plot twists and turns, and goes through a fantastic series of close calls before reaching it's more than a little bit iconic showdown.<br/><br/>Another surprise is the quality of the performances; in particular, that of the two central leads. DiCaprio simmers brilliantly as the troubled police mole Costigan - whose position means he has absolutely no idea who to trust, and DiCaprio capitalises on this fact by infusing Costigan with an incredible sense of desperation, both to retain his own identity and to find out Sullivan's. Damon (a few odd accent moments aside) is in parts evil little **** and enigmatic young detective; balancing the two aspects of his character brilliantly. Jack Nicholson devours scenery as the ridiculously - occasionally hilariously - malicious Frank Costello, juggling the more humorous parts of the character perfectly with a mean streak a mile wide, and relative newcomer Vera Farmiga brings a touch of sass to the ensemble, with her sensuous police psychiatrist Madolyn becoming romantically involved with both protagonists.<br/><br/>But the true star of the show is Mark Wahlberg - which is a shock to say the least. He's only got a supporting role, but he grabs it with both hands and wrings it for all he's worth. He's on screen with such quality actors as Nicholson, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin, and his brash, foul-mouthed portrayal of Dectective Dignam - one of Costigan's handlers - drags your eye straight to him. That and he gets some of the best lines in the film - 'Maybe...maybe not. Maybe **** yourself!' being one of my favoured examples (you'll get it if you watch it).<br/><br/>Now, 'remake'. I said I didn't like using that term to describe this particular film, instead preferring 'adaptation'. This is because, whilst it does share major plot-points with Infernal Affairs, it is vastly different in it's handling. Infernal Affairs is a ridiculously serious, slow-paced cop thriller, whereas The Departed - whilst not exactly light-hearted - is a lot less serious, and there are actual some genuinely funny - occasionally in a bizarre, slightly twisted way - moments. It's also a lot faster in pace - despite the 150-minute running time - and all these things means it views as almost a completely different film.<br/><br/>Basically, this is a damn fine film. It's in parts nerve-wrackingly tense, thrillingly exciting and funny in the kind of way that you know you really shouldn't be laughing, and it all comes together beautifully. I honestly couldn't recommend this film more, both to fans of Infernal Affairs, and to newcomers to the series.It's by no means ground-breaking, nor highly original, but it is an entertaining piece of film-making that you should definitely check out if you can!"
"akber039","10","2","4","22 October 2006"," Mark Wahlberg haters ...die
","I do not get why all these people are saying that Mark Wahlberg sucked in that movie. That was actually one of the movies that he was good in, and anyone who thinks otherwise is an idiot.<br/><br/>The dialog was flawless from the beginning of the movie to the very end, Scorsese indeed has another masterpiece on his hands. I was very disappointed to see all the critics saying that Wahlberg delivered a terrible performance. ""F**k"" was used excessively, but I haven't seen a good movie that didn't have ""f**k"" in it every 3 seconds e.g. Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs. He played a role that took a lot of balls I guess, and he did it pretty damn well. My favorite line was definitely, ""Maybe, maybe not, maybe f**k yourself."" Again with the flawless dialog.<br/><br/>Directors like Scorsese and Tarentino really capture small talk moments that capture real life perfectly. They give you a different view than that of a happy utopia that so many movies portray. Utopia is bullshit. This movie goes into the heart of human behavior, and gives you a lot of good laughs along the way."
"mrjrd869","6","2","4","21 October 2006"," Somebody fell asleep at the helm
","Let me first clarify: This movie was FANTASTIC...until the last 10 minutes or so. I scanned comments and failed to see anything negative about this movie except for the comparisons to another I never heard of, so reader beware...if you watched this movie and missed what I'm about to point out, well...read on for yourself.<br/><br/>Everything was going great until the scene in which Sullivan (Damon) goes to delete Costigan's (DiCaprio) file. So OK...I may be more tech-knowledgeable than some...allow me to elaborate: It is not possible to just 'delete' a file from a database computer. (I am oversimplifying only for the sake of keeping this short) We can assume the movie is set in the present, given the technology displayed. In my opinion, this was a horrible mistake, besides even the fact that Sullivan is sloppily using a computer with his back to a glass wall. But is is only the beginning. When Sullivan goes to 'delete' the file, he is committing himself to getting rid of Costigan. Sullivan's character has, to date, been portrayed as intelligent, yet he fails to react and seek to eliminate Costigan. Even worse, he fails to see the threat that Dignam poses once Costigan's file is deleted. The film 'could' have taken a great turn here, but the writers and Scorcese fail to deliver. Instead, they now cast Sullivan as an idiot who then goes to a meeting with Costigan ALONE and unprepared. Next, he eliminates Costello's other inside man (ostensibly with the intent of protecting himself from exposure) and fails to recognize (again) the threat that Dignam poses. Not to be outdone, Scorcese goes on to allow Costigan to be 'outed' as a Trooper for his decorated burial, but fails to account for HOW anybody knew he was anything but a has-been (remember, his file was 'deleted'). There were other anomalies, such as with the envelope, the baby and the CD. I would object to this movie getting any awards...it was finished very sloppily with poor attention to important detail. Unless, of course, a movie could be nominated for only 90% of it... But didn't somebody once say 'the ending is everything'?"
"nmyres-1","10","2","4","19 October 2006"," The Departed: Long Awaited Satisfaction
","The Departed released this week, directed by Martin Scorsese, I am compelled to say is the best movie that I have seen in my generation. This is the type of movie that recalls to all cinema effectionados the true reasons why we loved film so much throughout the years. It for one made me realize once again what a real movie is and should be; and understand for the first time all the grizzle that the film industry has been feeding us from each season to the next. Fueled with all the big names of the industry,(I mean Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, and Mark Walberg); every actor's performance was an exquisitely wrapped, unexpected gift. Certainly Jack Nicholson's best role since The Shining or One Flew Over The Cookoo's Nest. I have always been an avid fan of Scorsese's, having fallowed his career from Mean Streets to the present. Like a fine wine, he as aged to perfection. With the wisdom and guidance of his absolute wizardry, he has molded DiCaprio into who may be one of the most well respected artists of our time. It only seems like yesterday I had seen DiCaprio in Basketball Diaries thinking that one day he would amount to great things. That is an understatement. The film opens the underbelly of organized crime, exposing the relationship between what society has deemed the good-guys and the bad-guys. In this world, painted in brilliant shades of black and white, the cat and mouse game that plays out is a symphony to be reckoned with. It all begins with the paralleled lives of two aspiring Boston State Police Force agents. One is the all American, blue blooded thru and thru and the other a hardened, agent reject with a broken past. Both are moles for opposing sides: the Police and the Irish Mafia; each violently struggling to reveal the other's identity. It is interesting to see how this one ends, so I will not give you any spoilers. You can see the trailer at the link posted below . I suppose the next step for me is to see the movie for which it is based, Infernal Affairs, a Hong Kong Gangster genre directed by Siu Fai Mak. But for now, I'm just going to enjoy and savor the taste of long awaited satisfaction."
"karenlynn1","8","2","4","19 October 2006"," Noteworthy Cast! **some spoilers**
","This film was rather impressive. Plenty of action, intriguing characters, and brilliant acting from an all-star cast. I feel that the violence could have been toned down a bit-the swearing and racial epithets could have been kept to a minimum. Other than that it was brilliant. Scorcese outdoes himself with this mob vs. cops drama that makes us keep wondering whoif anyone at allis one of the ""good guys"". <br/><br/>Jack Nicholson delivers a punch with his over-the-top performance as Irish mob boss Costello. He's a self-indulgent, arrogant, domineering control freak who rules his neighborhood with an iron fist. It even seems as if Costello has the Boston State Police Departmentever on his trailunder his thumb. This is mostly thanks to a Detective named Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon) who began working for Costello when he was a young kid, and is forever indebted to Costello. Working both sides of the coin, in secrecy, Sullivan helps to keep Costello one step ahead of the ""Staties"" that are hot on his trail. <br/><br/>The Staties have a mole of their own. Young renegade officer Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is sent in to infiltrate Costello's gang, under orders from his superiors (Baldwin, Sheen, & Walberg respectively). With some felons in Costigan's family tree, and the rumor that Costigan was thrown out of the academy, he receives acceptance from Costello's men. But soon he meets the man himself, and his loyalty is tested by undergoing a small yet painful ritual. <br/><br/>The story heats up, with more action, a lot of shooting, and a rather confusing love triangle involving a young psychiatrist who is forced to face too many truths all at once. Nicholson's portrayal becomes increasingly more manicalmost resembling his performance in The Shiningas his organization begins to unravel and turn on each other in search of the ""rat."" However, many scenes were stolen by Mark Wahlberg as Dingam. <br/><br/>The plot gets confusing at times, and the ending will seem like a cop out (no pun intended), but it's the sort of thing that if you look at the events that led up to itit seems to have followed a logical conclusion. Who really is a rat? And who real are the good guys? <br/><br/>Very well-acted, and intriguing picture. I give this an 8/10."
"tommeekew","6","2","4","17 October 2006"," Scorsese can go straight to...
","...the editing room. That's right. Another example of modern film-making's inability to tell a story in a reasonable amount of time. Much like Peter Jackson's bloated ""King Kong"", Scorsese's remake of another classic would have benefited from a good chopping of 30 minutes' worth of film.<br/><br/>Oh sure, Jack Nicholson steals another film with his performance. Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg didn't have to go to school to learn their Boston accents, which probably saved the producers a few dollars. I didn't see the purpose of the tug-of-war between Damon and DiCaprio's characters for the female love interest...it contributed absolutely nothing to the plot.<br/><br/>In general, the performances were good, the bloodletting and violence were more than adequate to satiate contemporary film audiences. Overall, I'd call ""The Departed"" another big-screen exercise in tedium. Might as well go and see it. At least it's better than having a root canal without anesthesia."
"FilmGirl222","10","2","4","15 October 2006"," The Best Scorsese Film I Have Ever Seen!!!!!!!!!!!!
","Minor, if any, spoilers.<br/><br/>I first saw The Departed the first weekend that it opened because well...I'm a huge Martin Scorsese, Leo DiCaprio, and Matt Damon fan. So this was definitely the movie for me to see this year. I have to tell you all, I loved it! I loved it so much that I have seen it three times already. I mean, it is just such an incredible film. I would even have to say that it not only is my favorite film of the year so far (which there really haven't been many great ones, so that is not hard for me to say), but it would have to be my favorite Martin Scorsese film also. If you have seen and appreciate a lot of Scorsese's films, then you know that what I have just said is a huge thing.<br/><br/>The Departed is such a great piece of work. It makes you think and is very well shot. The story itself is unbelievable. Just as a quick review to those of you who might not remember what it's about, The Departed follows two men, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) and Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio). Sullivan is a cop with a clean background who has made his way through his career with the help of his ""boss"" Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), a terrifyingly huge mob boss who does what ever he wants, like killing whoever and putting Sullivan through police school so he has one of his men in the police force. Costigan on the other hand has a history with being on the wrong side of the law, both personally and with family, yet he tries to become a full on cop and is only able to become an undercover cop for Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg). Costigan is assigned to go undercover and become one of Costello's men, which he is successful in doing. So the movie goes on with Sullivan becoming a Detective who still works for Costello and Costigan an undercover cop who is able to become one of Costello's right hand men.<br/><br/>The Departed is incredibly smart and very well put together. With some of Scorsese's recent films, such as Gangs of New York and The Aviator, which I both really liked, yet with both of those films I felt there was something missing, like it could have been tightened a bit more or something. The Departed was perfect. There were no points where there were lulls or where things should have been tightened. It was literally perfect. The way it was shot, the way it was put together, the story, the actingeverything was perfect.<br/><br/>Now the acting, oh my god, was incredible! Everyone and I mean EVERYONE was fantastic. It seemed like everyone wanted to be on their top game for this one. One performance that I thought was really entertaining and good was Mark Wahlberg. I'm not that big of a Wahlberg fan, yet I was delightfully surprised with him in this film. He was cocky and a real smart ass. I loved him, and if you see the end of the film, you'll know why.<br/><br/>I thought Matt Damon did a wonderful job. It was so nice to see him playing the bad guy for a change. I mean, it's not like he never has (School Ties, The Talented Mr. Ripley, etc.), but I'm so used to seeing him play the good looking good guy that it was nice to see him be the hateful bad guy.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson was good. He was completely crazy in the part of the mob boss Costello. Yet personally, I didn't see anything magical about his performance. It seemed to me like Jack was playing Jack, if you get my meaning. I have no doubt that Jack will be nominated for his part in this movie, but his performance in this movie wasn't the one that blew me away.<br/><br/>Now, here is the point that I have come to that was/is my favorite part of the movie The Departed, and that was Leonardo DiCaprio's performance. I can not possibly explain how wonderful he was in this movie. It's the kind of thing you need to see with your own two eyes. There were so many layers to his character and he pulled them off beautifully. There were moments of total sorrow and anxiety that his character goes through that Leo did incredibly. Leo is so wonderful to watch and so sexy (a fact that I didn't mind at all). There are many sad moments that Leo has in this film, but there is one moment at the end where I lost it. When you all see this film, you will know the point that I am talking about. The part is very surprising and shocking, and it made me heart broken. It touched me in such a level that after the film ended, I went out to my car and cried like I have never cried before. Leo moved me in such a way that I just needed to let all me feelings out. He NEEDS an Oscar for this part! Leo was that good. This is his year for an Oscar.<br/><br/>I could literally go on and on about this movie for hours. It was so good. I'm telling you, it will take a VERY good film to beat The Departed come Oscar time. It is finally the time for Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio to get an Oscar for their great work! If any one wants to talk to me about this movie, don't hesitate to contact me. I would love to discuss this movie with others."

","I really enjoyed the complex story line and the excellent acting. I saw it yesterday afternoon with a buddy and I am pestering my boyfriend to take me to it tonight, just so I can talk to him about the amazing conclusion. Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio are perfect foils for each other. They are both equally powerful actors and they are equally good and bad in this movie. The end is a shocker, so if you have heart problems stay away. The audience actually applauded the movie at the end and it was a matinée show. The plot line is really good for people who pick up the ending at the beginning of the movie. I will be surprised if it or the actors do not get nominated for Academy Awards. Leonardo Dicaprio, who I have been a fan of since he was on growing pains, should stop being overlooked by the academy. After so many overlooks, I hope this one is the sticker! Wow, it was a great movie!!!"
"come2whereimfrom","6","2","4","12 October 2006"," good but not goodfellas.
","Right lets get a few things straight this is not the performance of Jack Nicholson's career (although its good), it is not the return to form we were hoping for from Scorsese and neither Matt Damon nor Leonardo Decaprio are that convincing as the two main cops. All that aside this isn't that bad a film, there are moments of Scorsese magic, there is a stellar cast including Ray Winstone, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin to name a few of the excellent actors here, it has a great soundtrack and a killer script. Sadly it is a bit too long and not as good as 'Internal Affairs' on which it is based. Where it does shine it really is very bright but the flaws hold it back too much to be a career high for anyone involved, it is a lazy 'Goodfellas' at best and a Snatch/Lock Stock hybrid at worst. The casting of Matt and Leo (neither of which I rate as actors) as the rookie cops is an inspired take on the original story but the fact that in Internal Affairs the two cops trying to rat each other out had been on the force for so long gave the film a gravitas that just isn't here. A rather flimsy tentative connection is hinted at by a love interest they both find themselves sharing but it never goes anywhere, in fact her character just kind of disappears out of the plot leaving unanswered questions. Essentially the script highlights, apart from Nicholson, come from the banter between Baldwin and Wahlberg as the two department heads set with the task of bringing down Costello (Nicholson) but neither having access to each others resources. Being a rare 18 certificate means that Scorsese can still get graphic if needs be and he does. There are laughs, winces and tension and enough twists to keep your head spinning. Scorsese has also embraced the technological revolution and made mobiles and texting a prevalent form of communication between the cops and the bad guys and especially for the moles to sneak out info. Without spoiling the end or any of the really good bits I cant really say anymore, just that this is an OK film, not brilliant by Scorsese's earlier standards but worth seeing none the less, certainly the best he's done for a while."

His portrait of Boston's Irish Mob, with its mix of loyalty, deception and underlying legacy, is told with a breathtaking visual narrative of explosive violence and its consequences, in the compelling style Scorsese is famous for. At its heart, The Departed is Jack Nicholson's film. He dominates the screen as the personification of willful menace and pure evil. The remaining cast rivals any Scorsese ensemble, with career defining performances from Leonardo DiCaprio and Ray Winstone.

Normally movies now days are all special effects or just acting with a descent script. This movie's special effects are right where they need to be and NOTHING looks fake or over the top, the acting is nothing short of perfect, the directing WILL win for best directing, the writing is actually really good writing, and the movie; probably at the top with the best movies ever made. One thing that I really like about this movie is that I was never bored. From the first second of the movie i was interested and wanted to see more. One thing that I didn't like, was that it ended. I was hoping that it was going to be longer than the 2.5 hours it already is."
"WillTheThrill228","10","2","4","10 October 2006"," Quite Possibly the BEST Movie in 2 Years
","Let's get one thing straight, Martin Scorsese is a genius. Goodfellas, move over. Gritty, dramatic, suspenseful, all-around awesome. Everything was well acted. Great cast, though, anything with Nicholson is unbelievable. I can't say enough great things about this movie. The twisted nature of the story is what binds it together and keeps you begging for more. From the superb shots of Boston to Alec Baldwin's witty and hilarious lines. My favorite being to Matt Damon... ""You want a cigarette? What you don't smoke? What are you, a health nut? Alright, go f*ck yourself."" All done monotonously and dry. Just a superb move through and through, and though, it clocks in at 2 1/2 hours, the time seems to fly by as the story just draws you in deeper and deeper. Definitely one of, if not the best, movie I have seen in a good 2 years."

I don't know about Matt Damon, but he isn't as good in this as his ""Bourne"" Trilogy. Also, I have seen comments that this might be better than Goodfellas.

"Puckman751","10","2","4","9 October 2006"," Best Picture of 2006
","Matin Scorsese does it again in The Departed. Like his previous hits (Goodfellas and Casino), he takes movie making to the next level and when you don't think it could go any higher, he takes you there. The Departed is an intriguing story that revolves around Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello, an Irish mafia boss. He befriends Matt Damon's character Colin Sullivan, who eventually becomes a Massachusets State Police officer. Frank uses Colin to make sure his deals run smooth. On the other side of the law, Leo DiCaprio's character, Billy Costigan, goes undercover for the State Police and takes orders from Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg. 2+ hours of great film making ensues. I previously had thought that V For Vendetta would be a front runner for Best Picture but after seeing this film, there's no way I can see it win. Scorsese deserves a Best Director and Best Picture award while everyone else in the film, especially Leo DiCaprio, deserve huge amounts of attention for their acting. The story is fresh, intriguing and it keeps you on the edge of your seat and guessing. Finally, when you think you have it all figured out, you realize just how wrong you are. This film should and will go down in history."
"bob_gilmore1","10","2","4","9 October 2006"," The Best So Far For 2006
","My first thoughts walking out of the theater were, ""wow that was great but it wasn't as good as Goodfellas."" Few living directors have such built in levels of expectations as Martin Scorsese; his past will always be difficult to live down but he mostly does an amazing job with his all-star cast in The Departed. Given access to Hollywood's greatest talent allows him to create a vividly interesting and intensely watchable crime film. Everyone will have their favorites but for my money Alec Baldwin in the most consistently entertaining even with limited screen time.<br/><br/>The film is long, but doesn't seem long. If you are weighing the film from an investment standpoint I doubt that there are many places that you can go for two and a half hours and be this enthralled for only about eight bucks.<br/><br/>Back to The Goodfellas comparison. One of the reasons that that film had such a visceral appeal was that Ray Liotta was pretty much an unknown at the time. We got to know Liotta as Henry Hill, we didn't have many previous roles to work through in our establishing empathy. Sure he played in Field Of Dreams, but it was a brief appearance. In The Departed we never feel the same level of cathartic involvement because the actors are still just actors.<br/><br/>In the end this is but a minor quibble as the action is so riveting, the performances so well presented and the story so engaging that it doesn't matter much that we don't have that same level of emotional involvement.<br/><br/>Oscar time for Marty? Who knows. Most thought that the breakthrough would come with The Aviator (A great historical-visual masterpiece) but it was not the case. If the opening weekend means anything this will be probably be the director's most successful box office creation. Maybe that has been the real barrier to Scorsese getting over the top. While the violence is certainly ever present it seems to be less violent of a film than Taxi Driver or Goodfellas because of the way the violence is presented on the screen. It just sort of happens and it's happening just fits into the way that the plot unfolds."
"Whisper928","Null","2","4","9 October 2006"," Disappointed
","While I appreciate that the film stayed true to the original in most respects, it was too much of a carbon copy. I mean the only things they bothered to change was the setting, language and cast; everything else was so predictable that I left the theater. They should have just called the movie ""Infernal Affairs"", after all its not like they changed much of anything.<br/><br/>I suppose I should've researched the movie before going, but I figured .... ""Hmmm.... The Departed looks interesting"" and at first it was, but then I noticed I was able to predict the scenes. When they got to the ""personal info""(envelope) scene, thats when I knew it was a copy.<br/><br/>I'll admit it was a good movie and anyone seeing it for the first time will truly enjoy it, but if you've already seen ""Infernal Affairs"" don't bother ...... its just an americanized version of the original. <br/><br/>Changes made: Hong Kong = Boston Triads = Irish Mafia Chinese(subtitled) = English Asian Cast = American Cast"

It keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. I must say that the casting for this movie was incredible with a lot of high profile actors doing this film justice.<br/><br/>The brilliant part about this movie like many other great movies is that you don't get hit with with the quality until your walking out of the theater realizing that you have witnessed the best movies of all time.

"georgeh1981","10","2","4","9 October 2006"," Why are ""Southie"" films always so great?
","OK, so I have an affinity for Boston, and a strange obsession with ""Southie"" or, the Irish area in South Boston. I personally have a list of My top ten movies of all time, based, primarily on their ""re-watch-ability"", their constant creeping into my mind, acting, how witty the dialogue is, and ""other"". I would be greatly surprised, if, ten years from now, I am not quoting this Scorcese masterpiece. The dialogue is so witty, and the characters so memorable, and the ending....ohhhhh, the ending! Mark Wahlberg, pound for pound, was the best character. However, the greatest line belongs to Mr. Alec Baldwin. In a high stress sequence where the Boston Police are onto the bad guys, Alec Baldwin, says to one of the other cops in rapid fire delivery, ""Hey, I'm gonna have a cigarette..you want a cigarette?..what? You don't smoke?..What are you some kind of health nut?..Hey F&*% You!!!"" If that doesn't translate well to print...go watch the movie, see for yourself. Damon is fantastic, DiCaprio is excellent, Nicholson is great, and no one in the cast is a liability, even the ""love interest"", which, I had read in some reviews was lackluster, I thought, was great. So GO watch this Movie, and if you love the dialogue, then go rent...NO BUY, Good Will Hunting, and the Boondock Saints (My other favorite Boston Movies) Oh, and don't forget Goodfellas!"
"cpbadgeman","10","2","4","9 October 2006"," Dazzling character study from a master filmmaker
","Without a doubt this is the best film of 2006. The deceptively simple premise involves the Massachussets State Police planting an undercover operative (Leonardo DiCaprio) in the South Boston underworld in order to take down Irish mob kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). However, Costello has a mole of his own....<br/><br/>What unfolds is an absolutely stunning examination of the nature of violence, loyalty, avarice, and betrayal. The ensemble cast are uniformly excellent though Martin Sheen and a caustic Mark Wahlberg absolutely steal the show in their supporting roles as DiCaprio's world-weary handlers. Big Bad Jack turns in a bone-chilling, high octane performance that simply lights up the screen. As a side-note, his character is based in part on the exploits of a real-life South Boston mobster, Whitey Bulger. <br/><br/>The razor-sharp dialogue is enthralling and Martin Scorsese's direction is flawless. This film is a triumph."

","Whoever seen the original HK version ""Internal Affair"" years ago should know this is at best a mediocre knockoff. Better than ""Good Fellas""? Not a slightly chance.

For those who did, I tell you this movie is copying down to every details, I mean EVERY DETAILS. And for whatever they didn't copy over, they're making big mistakes.

This remake or should I say knockoff one just go on rampage without any setups, this is not supposed to be one of those ""Texas Chainsaw..."" movies.<br/><br/>Big cast, great director, ends up a total disappointment, the saddest part is, beloved folks here and TV critics and elsewhere had blindly promoted it to such a high place, where only those ever-lasting master pieces like ""Good Fellas"", ""Godfather"" and ""Shawshank Redemption"" should reside.<br/><br/>Don't argue before you check out the original.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","4","9 October 2006"," Adapted story takes on a new and different life under the masterful hands of Scorsese
","While ""The departed"" is adapted from ""Infernal affair"" (2002), the highly acclaimed Hong Kong crime thriller, not much can be gained from comparing them. Suffices to say that the ""infrastructure"" of the script has been essentially retained, but there are also variations, some quite major. More importantly, the two movies have different ""souls"". ""Infernal Affair"" focuses on a cross-sectional depiction of various scenes and incidents, with superb suspense and tension, with a metaphysical wink. ""The Departed"" focuses more on a story-telling ""epic"" approach, with a more coherent story and more character development. <br/><br/>Before looking at direction, acting and technical aspects, it is even more important to see that the movie stands on a devilishly clever double-mole structure, on which an excellent script has been developed, and on which, in turn, all the rest of it – direction, acting, editing etc – are built. Double-mole refers to a police undercover deployed at the heart of a criminal orgainzation, and vice versa. On the surface, they each have a boss that they are seen with daily but underneath, the roles of the real boss are reversed, with cell phone and secret meetings as the main mode of contact. Because of this convoluted setup, watching this movie requires a lot of concentration, as you have to remember all the time who knows who's who, and who doesn't. This gets even more interesting when they have to find and expose each other, in a deadly race against death, unavoidable if they are exposed first. <br/><br/>Martin Scorsese, slightly surprisingly, did not transport the story to his beloved New York where the Mafia provides such a convenient platform, but instead takes the story to Boston, pitching the State Police against the Irish underworld. More specifically, it's the quest of law enforcers Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) to nail kingpin Costello (Jack Nicholson) by catching him in one of his assortment of big, shady deals. Coin Sullivan (Matt Damon), taken under the wings of Costello since he was a boy, is now a rising star in the police departing with unblemished records that made him a favourite of Queenan and Dignam. Meanwhile Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), a dedicated police officer despite shady family connections, is half lured and half coerced by the Queenan-Dignam good-cop-bad-cop (in that order) duo into the loathsome job of infiltrating Costello's organization and becoming his right-hand man. <br/><br/>This gritty story of maddening conflict and suffocating tension is told in flawless pace with superlative editing. Scorsese is in top form, and, with absolute precision, realizes the superb script into a magnificent visual spectacle. <br/><br/>Turning to the cast, it seems, on the surface at least, that DiCaprio and Damon have their roles reversed, with Damon swimming in flair and charisma while DiCaprio looking earthy and uncouth. You can't image, for example, Damon and Pitt reversing roles in ""Ocean's Eleven"". But then DiCarprio is no Pitt, in terms of cocky confidence. On the other hand, he does remarkably well (better than in ""Gangs of New York"" or ""The aviator"") as the vulnerable and at the same time explosive cop finding himself in an uncontrollable, frustrating predicament. As to the legendary Jack Nicholson, I don't think there is much more that he can bring to the screen that we haven't yet seen (and hope I'm wrong). But we do get to see in ""The departed"" just about everything we expect from him. Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg, top actors in their own rights, take on supporting roles which they fill admirably. And as long as we are on that, there is a third policeman, Captain Ellerby, played equally admirably by Alec Baldwin. <br/><br/>This is a movie about men and, in a way, almost in complete symmetry with another movie I saw in the same week, ""Volver"", which is a movie entirely about women. The only noticeable woman in ""The Departed"" is police psychiatrist Madolyn (Vera Farmiga, relatively unknown) who happens to fall in love with both guys (for those who love to find fault with plots). But Madolyn is at least portrayed in a favourable light, which is much more than one can say for the only male character of any significance in Volver."
"stonecoldmark","9","2","4","8 October 2006"," Scorsese proves why he's America's best living filmmaker
","Today I went to see a movie, I really didn't start hearing about until the past few weeks. While the internet has been the cause for much time away from my family, I never really seek out movie info, part of me still likes the surprise of seeing trailers at the theater, but I also have adopted a ""I'll see it when I believe it"" attitude when it comes to movies in the works. I have other things to do than bad mouth movies that have not even come out yet... with that being said....<br/><br/>I went to see the latest Martin Scorsese film ""The Departed"". First of all ""Goodfellas"" is easily the top 2 of my favorite films of ALL TIME (right up there with ""Empire Strikes Back""). I have seen ""Goodfellas"" easily over 20 times in it's entirety. I am in the camp that believes that Martin was robbed of the Oscar in 1990, by Kevin Costner and his ""Dances with Wolves"". Don't get me wrong ""Dances"" was a good film, but I really think that for me it lacked the emotional journey and overall power that ""Goodfellas"" had. GF is film-making at it's best and honestly ""The Departed"" is like a breath of fresh air that's missing from so many big Hollywood films. Like many, I believe that Scorsese is arguably the best American director still alive today. Admitingly I was not a huge fan of the ""Avaitor"", and while ""Gangs of New York"" had it's flaws, it was still an enjoyable film. Of course films like Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, and Mean Streets stand on their own through the test of time.<br/><br/>The film centers around Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) who is an undercover cop working inside Frank Costello's (Nicholson) gang and Colin Sullivan (Damon) who plays a cop working as a spy for Costello and his crew, keeping the Boston police off his tail.<br/><br/>What follows for the next 2 and a half hours is an intricate crime drama with richly developed characters and an often vulgar, blood soaked story that will have you fully enthralled for the duration of the film.<br/><br/>I don't want to spend all this time discussing the plot, I don't want to be put in the position of spoilers and giving away the best parts of the film. I am here to say that this is easily the front runner for the best film of 2006. Scorsese returns to his mobster roots and does not miss a beat. For a Scorsese fan all his signatures are there, from a soundtrack that could not relate better to the images on screen, to the brutality of the violence... This is no cheesy WWE John Cena film, this is a raw, bloody ""R"" rated movie for all the right reasons. This combined with the Boston setting make this a choice film for this boring time of yawn inducing October releases.<br/><br/>The cast is suburb, Damon, DiCaprio, Nicholson are all equally amazing. Nicholson especially pitch perfect as Frank Costello, the aging crime lord that gets the sense there is a cop in his crew. Matt Damon is also amazing as the prick dirty cop working for Costello keeping him out of harms way. DiCaprio of course proves why he is worth every penny and this role really solidifies that he is the real deal. On a side note I find it funny that Ben Affleck gets tons of press, but has been in only one good movie (""Chasing Amy""), but friend Damon, has not only been getting quality roles, but roles that make money as well.<br/><br/>While these are the key players, they take nothing away from an amazing supporting cast including Alec Baldwin, Mark Walberg and Martin Sheen, all do an amazing job in bringing very complex, unforgettable characters to blistering life.<br/><br/>Worth a second, and third viewing, just to watch the acting alone, but also to really immerse yourself in the complex world of cops and criminals.<br/><br/>Highly recommended, and worth every penny. This holds up as a very good reason than great movies can still be made. It's just sad that there are not more movies that are of this quality."

Wow and all grown up now, a muscular guy who you can see thinking, freaking, without a word of dialogue. Which was overall pretty good --witty-- lots of instant movie classic lines. Rich, subtle camera work + wonderful bit of vertigo inducing camera at intro of young Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon). The weakest/campiest thing was Nicholson's over the top satanic performance. Perhaps doing the Joker Batman thing was too much, although admittedly kind of fun to watch. Further pickiness...what was Billy's job description, exactly in this band of murderers + thieves? Isn't there usually a hierarchy within these manly man groupsyou work your way up...in this case, from what to what? But these are details, in an otherwise superlative movie.

Sheen and Alec B have smallish roles but are fine too. Boston locales are top-notch, the movie takes the great HK Internal Affairs flick and tosses the Whitey Bulger angle into the mix, complete w/ the FBI informant stuff and corrupt cops aspect. There were only a couple things 'wrong' with it from my point of view.<br/><br/>One-it's about 20 minutes or so too long. The whole double-romance between the cop shrink and Damon/Leo is too cute by half(c'mon...it's Hollywood I know but still...), and slows down the pace after a fast first hour or so.<br/><br/>Two-You don't wanna see Leo wind up dead. He was the heart of this movie, somehow that whole OK Corral finale at the elevator reminded me of 'Face Off' if anything. Not terribly believable.<br/><br/>Three-Marky Mark bagging Matt Damon at the end-I liked it, but that's still sorta too neat.

Director Martin Scorcese shows his most thrilling and wonderful talents as director of this wonderful film. It follows a Colin Sullivan, played with much ease by Matt Damon, who is taken in by the notorious L-Street mobster Frank Costello, played by the remarkable Jack Nicholson. At the same time that Sullivan infiltrates the Boston State Police Department, a Billy Costigan, in Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance ever, rises up in the ranks of the police and infiltrates Costello's underworld. Costigan must face the dangers of leading a double life every day as well as confrontations with Sergeant Dignam, played exceptionally well by Mark Wahlberg, and is mentored by Officer Queenan, played by the always great Martin Sheen. Trouble ensues as the plot twists and turns in every single direction. With one thrilling scene after another, this film is remarkable in every single way, and will stay that way forever."
"boatdoc","10","2","4","8 October 2006"," Scorsese's Masterpiece of Boston Gangsters and Crooked Cops
","Martin Scorsese should easily finally take home his first Academy Award for Best Director for ""The Departed"". With consummate skill he has assembled bewilderingly complex and varied ingredients: performers, story, settings, photography - with the result being a film that grabs your attention in the first few moments and doesn't let up until the credits roll. The film clocks in at a minute less than 2 1/2 hours. With about 10 minutes left the Mrs. and I shared that we both needed a bathroom break after our half-gallon sodas... but neither of us dared leave.<br/><br/>The screenplay, I learn, was adapted by William Monahan from a Hong Kong script by Siu Fai Mak which was translated into English as ""Internal Affairs"". I also read that Mr. Scorsese didn't see the Chinese film but, rather, worked from an English translation of the ""Internal Affairs"" script. The story is a compelling narrative and Mr. Monahan has adapted the story to a Boston setting of Irish cops and gangsters. The dialog is full of sharp, witty one-liners, but also with a realistic, gritty ring of truth. The language reflects the setting of South Boston, not Sesame Street, so if your ears burn with the constant use of profanity - you may want to wait for an ""edited for TV"" version.<br/><br/>The cast is brilliant. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a sizzling performance as a Boston ""Southie"" who joins the police force at a tender age, but because of his family (his father was a local tough guy and his uncle a low level mobster)and intelligence(we're told he scored 1400 on his SAT - not usual police recruit material) he is recruited by a secret undercover unit to infiltrate the local mafia. We see him put through a grueling interview by his to-be superiors, Martin Sheen, full of paternal wisdom, and Mark Wahlberg, full of suspicions and vulgarities (but with many of the movie's best moments in a role that is no higher than maybe 5th or 6th billing.) At the same time DiCaprio is being recruited to infiltrate the mob, Matt Damon has been sent by the same mob to join the police force where, with his intelligence, etc, he is soon in a parallel secret unit investigating both his boss, Irish Mobster Frank Costello (in yet another defining performance by Jack Nicholson) and the ""mole"" who it is apparent has infiltrated the police force. (Among the many fine scenes are one where Damon gets to inform Nicholson that he is now leading the investigation to find - himself.) Jack's performance is a Nicholson special. Frank Costello is a nearly untouchable sociopath. (The reason Costello is ""ungettable"" by the Massachusetts police force is one of dozens of intricate twists and sub-plots.) Costello is vulgar and menacing and everyone in Boston quakes in his presence, from local priests to the scariest hit men. The Mrs. and I differ in our opinion of whether the film revolves around Costello (her view), since all the other characters revolve around him and, after all, he's played by the great Jack Nicholson, or whether DiCaprio's Billy Costigan is the main character (my opinion), since he has the most screen time and, if this story has a protagonist, Costigan is it. It's enjoyable to discuss such things, but it's quibbling. ""The Departed"" has so many well-drawn characters breathed to life by stellar actors in brilliant performances that it could easily populate two *good* films! Vera Farmiga was previously unknown to me, but she delivers in the only major female role as a police psychiatrist who graduated from Harvard, but takes the presumably lower-paying position because she wants to serve her community while she also helps her patients. In one of the trickiest roles of the film she becomes romantically attracted to both ""moles"", not knowing the ""true identity"" of either until the climax of the film. Her steely determination after she discovers that Matt Damon is the police department ""rat"" reminds me of Alida Valli's famous performance in ""The Third Man"" and her final scene in this movie (walking away from a funeral in a cemetery towards the camera in a single shot, completely ignoring the man who thinks he has romantic possibilities with her) is an obvious homage by Scorsese to Carol Reed's film classic.<br/><br/>Ray Winstone (as Costello's right-hand man, ""Frenchie"") and Alec Baldwin (as the over-matched police detective who is trying to bring together the various machinations of the Boston detectives and undercover mob infiltrators) lead the next tier of supporting performances. It's just another sign of the overall quality of Mr. Scorsese's picture that actors who would ""star"" in other films take on roles that in other films would be fleshed out by unknowns.<br/><br/>The films ends, I think, as it must, and it's fair to say it's a Noir ending and not a ""Hollywood"" ending. Over the weeks leading up to this year's Academy Awards this film will be praised more than the last 25 films nominated for ""Best Picture"" combined. All the praise and hoopla will make ""The Departed"" and it's various investors a lot of money. This makes me wonder - if great films like this are profitable, why bother with the other 99% of brainless dreck that shows up at my local cineplex every week? Just wondering."
"Awakening124","9","2","4","8 October 2006"," One of the best films this year, despite a couple of flaws.
","Acting: Top notch. Everyone involved gives a top caliber performance and, let me just say, it's so good to see Nicholson being the crazy badass we all know and love again. Even though Baldwin doesn't have much screen time, he steals the show with almost all of his lines.<br/><br/>Dialogue: I cracked up more than once, and I felt myself barely breathing the rest of the time. It went from darkly humorous to riveting in a flash, and did so brilliantly.<br/><br/>Story: I gasped more than once during the ending, if that's any inclination. This movie's long, but it more than held my interest the entire time so I'm not complaining.<br/><br/>So why didn't I give The Departed a ten? It was held back from true greatness by shoddy editing (I noticed at least ten inconsistencies, and I'm sure there were more that I missed since I was so entertained) and a very serious flow problem. It jumped from scene to scene so quickly that I found myself confused a decent part of the time, especially in the beginning, and a good portion of scenes were completely useless. For example, there's a one minute long scene of Nicholson's character throwing crack on a bed and telling a hooker to snort it 'till she's numb that comes out of nowhere, and disappears just as quickly. You could say it was to show how screwed up his character was but, trust me, there was plenty of whacked out crap to serve as proof of the villain's madness, so the scene was useless.<br/><br/>Despite its flaws, though, it shouldn't be missed. Scorsese does it again with this brutal, dark caper that keeps you guessing up until the end. You'll laugh, you'll jump, and you'll have to pick your jaw up off the floor. There's one scene in particular, centering around a cell phone 'conversation' in which nothing is said and both characters stare at the phone, simply thinking. If the actors weren't as brilliant as they are, it'd be a waste, but their talent lets you practically be able to read their minds. Simply brilliant.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Martin Scorsese, Martin Sheen, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg or Alec Baldwin, GO SEE THIS MOVIE."

While the film isn't flawless, it has great acting, a well-written script and good direction. I was glued to my seat immediately. I was worried about Leonardo. Yes, he has a handful of good performances on his resume, but the bad choices outweigh the good ones. You never know if he will actually be able to nail the part. Within 5 minutes you knew he would nail this one. If he doesn't get Oscar and Golden Globe nominations something is wrong. This is one of his best performances. His intensity is honest to the character. This is his film. The rest of the cast is awesome. Jack is a little over the top, but the audience allows it. Matt is, well Matt. He knows how to play this character. Basically he offers nothing new from what he has given us in other roles. There is a hint of charisma in some earlier scenes, but for the most part he doing just enough to make the character believable. The supporting cast is great. The movie is well casted. I loved infusing actors who were actually from MA. The violence wasn't over the top. The story was excellent. These actors had a great script to work with and the direction makes this film a modern day classic. I am purchasing it as soon as it comes out on DVD."
"mildew01","10","2","4","7 October 2006"," 'The Departed' is what all those critics have been waiting for
","When you read reviews of Martin Scorsese's films from the past sixteen years, you'll notice a sense of disappointment with the films, as the critics usually express a dissatisfaction with the main character - arguing that whatever film they're reviewing lacks in comparison to Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Mean Streets, etc. Frankly, I loved Cape Fear, Casino, Bringing out the Dead, Gangs of New York and the Aviator. They are all, in their own ways, unbelievable tour de forces that left me shaking by tail credits. I'm even coming around on Kundun. I usually hate the day a new Scorsese movie opens, because I'm flooded with reviews from critics who are chiding that they weren't graced with another Jake LaMotta. With this movie, they seemed to find the pill easier to swallow, and it's easy to see why. It's bloody, it has a cast full of a-listers, a plot that's been around so long every kink has been ironed out, and Jack Nicholson, who deserves a few more awards for his turn as Frank Costello. I haven't had this much fun watching him since As Good as it Gets - but this time, it's a bit of a guilty pleasure. He is funny, frightening and pathetic all at the same time, a character so large he practically jumps off the screen. But of course, when you watch a Scorsese film, you're watching actors who are willing to take amazing risks because they trust the man at the helm - everyone in this movie gives the performance of their life. So, I was happy yesterday to read the positive reviews in all the trades and papers. Finally, people are starting to ease up on the guy a little. Not every film is Raging Bull, and that suits me just fine. This movie has everything for a Scorsese fan - melancholic main characters, a hint of religious undertone, blood, rock and roll, Thelma Schoonmaker, Michael Ballhaus, and a third act that really gets the blood rate up. I loved it so much, I'll see it again tomorrow."

","Despite some outlying bad reviews by say the New York Times, the film The Departed directed by Martin Scorcese is an instant classic. In this film there is an all star cast followed by an all star director, one of the best of the last fifty years. With Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin, you cannot go wrong. From the moment that the beginning of the movie started, I was compelled. I have watched movies intently all of my life, watching classics from the past fifty years as much as I can, and I will definitely say to you all that this movie will now be included in the list with Scarface and Goodfellas. Martin Scorcese is able to bring an Irish gangster film about killing and deception to that of ""a Shakespearian tragedy."" That in my mind is the most pivotal point in this movie, Martin can bring this movie of cunningness and lying rats to that of masterful proportions. This movie will never be forgotten and I can promise you that. When I say it is my favorite movie of all time, I literally mean that, and I only saw it on its opening day, yesterday, October 6, 2006. The combination of amazing directing, superb acting, a very suspenseful and moving plot and excellent film work, will shoot this movie instantly to the status of the classics that we all know and love, that is a guaranteed fact."

","Of course fantasy. You don't kill off that many state cops. If you did, the FBI would take over the whole state, or at least the whole state police operation. Even just the first one could get you that. DiCaprio was much better than Matt Damon, had a much greater range of emotion. He's clearly an actor with much greater depth. Jack Nicholson was his usual terrific scene, and in one of 'em, screwed up his face to talk about a rat and got half the audience laughing because Nicholson reinstated disbelief when he got too vintage Nicholsonian. And the text messaging all over the place? You got to be kidding. And that old standby was there: the video camera didn't work. Several other things that add up to fantasy, not a crime story."

"charlesliulv","8","0","0","12 May 2020"," Morality Tale disguised as a Cat-and-Mouse game
","As deeply contemplative as it is tirelessly relentless in pace, The Departed doesn't let its philosophical themes get in the way of a good crime story. In the places where other Scorsese gangster flicks luxuriate in the atmospheres of their settings (the hazy lights and garish colours of Casino, the mundane tones of old age in The Irishman) The Departed is already onto the next plot beat or in the middle of unveiling another secret. The editing plays a huge part in this; in one particular scene, a character on the street looks at a security camera when he realizes that he's being followed, the next shot shows the camera's footage, and in the third is a reaction shot of said character, already in the police department where he works and watching the video footage.<br/><br/>That isn't to say that the film is devoid of philosophical queries; it's just that they are effectively woven throughout the fabric of its narrative rather than inserted between individual plot beats. Being a Scorsese film, it's also full of stylistic flourishes that augment the story; there are multiple instances in which incidental music will be halted abruptly by an occurrence in the film (say, the flipping of a phone), signalling that essential information is being delivered to audience, or that something important is about to take place. This technique is especially effective at a turning point near the end of the film, where silence becomes a much more effective tool for creating tension than music.<br/><br/>Everyone plays their role to near-perfection, especially Matt Damon, whose seemingly ruthless cunning is undercut by subtle moments of weakness and guilt; and Leonardo DiCaprio, though somewhat awkward during scenes where his character goes into monologue, plays his subtle glances and moments of fear and paranoia with utter conviction. All these elements play out in a game of cat-and-mouse where the lines between good and evil, cop and criminal are blurred, and everyone's faith is questioned in a world burning underneath the serene pastel blue sky of Boston, Massachusetts."

","I always think that the Hong Kong version of Infernal Affairs has reached the peak of Hong Kong movies. I figured it out countless times for this.<br/><br/>Before I watched the American version, I thought Martin Scorsese's skill would surpass this classic. A lot of people in the comments were also better than the Hong Kong version.<br/><br/>Objectively speaking, there are excellent places, and the application of cross montage is very exciting. For the Hong Kong version, the soundtrack is more emotional<br/><br/>But returning to the story of the movie itself, the whole is not as good as the Hong Kong version.<br/><br/>I will list a few points for this.<br/><br/>One, characters.<br/><br/>The most important part of the narrative level is the character.<br/><br/>Let me talk about the Hong Kong version first. The beauty of the Hong Kong version is the delicateness of the characters.<br/><br/>Liang Chaowei was tired of undercover life. Because his promotion is a ""three years and three years"" promotion. Even when facing his ex-girlfriend (Xiao Yaxuan), he could not recognize his true identity. It further highlights his helplessness. When Huang Qiu lived and died, the silent performance fully showed the helplessness of the characters and the motivation for the next action.<br/><br/>This is not so delicate on the undercover played by Xiao Lizi. When Diggman satirized Xiao Lizi at the beginning, he did not show his determination as a policeman. The old policeman just said ""do it again, for me."" What? Who are you? Why? Being undercover is desperate. The cooperation with the police has always revolved around ""I will die if I catch the undercover and catch me."" The source of his actions is not clear. And at the end he just wanted to eliminate the previous guilt and get money. He could not take this undercover, or he had more money as a criminal than this. Regarding details, Liang Chaowei 's trust in the female doctor is that she can sleep peacefully and tell the female doctor that he is a police officer. And the trust of Xiao Lizi, who was also insomnia, slept with the female doctor. If the West does n't care much about this bed relationship, why would Little Lizi trust her, but she can pretend to be like everyone else and continue to discuss marriage with her boyfriend who has been in love for four months?<br/><br/>Let 's talk about the second character, Matt Damon, who plays undercover.<br/><br/>The Hong Kong version of Infernal Affairs provided Andy Lau 's motivation to be a good person, and he is more likely to improve on the police side. There is a clear lens that shows himself wandering between good and evil. The Matt Damon police arrested the boss just because he suspected that he had been betrayed, out of self-preservation, and when the boss said he had not betrayed him before he died, he still killed the boss. Also in the movie theater, Brother Chen ridiculed Andy Lau, ""So you are worried about yourself, Officer Liu,"" and in the US version, Matt Damon said, ""You are so bully * What do you want me to do, you have to tell me ""Come"", the former shows selfishness, the latter shows arrogance. The final decision was to give Brother Chen the phone. Brother Chen did not take him to play, he was born with a sense of crisis. So Brother Chen called Andy Lau and found the ringtone. When Brother Chen died, he did n't have a word. Smiling shows his conclusion. Before deciding on his position, Matt Damon also called to advise the boss not to go. The boss yelled and ordered him, so he decided to remove the boss and not only a lot of ink in the process of killing the boss, but also tell the boss woman ""We lost him"" is superfluous, and the characters change too fast.<br/><br/>The third character, the villain boss.<br/><br/>Zeng Zhiwei's boss is a sinister and cunning but decisive person. He chatted with Huang Qiusheng last second and set off the table next second. His eyes revealed cunning, and his words were full of irony. He was cautious at the first transaction, but the operation transaction failed, and the police knew he had committed a crime but had no choice but to take him. The American version of the boss, an elegant old rogue, suits and leather shoes full of swearing, Matt Damon ordered him, he compromised. When dealing with the Chinese, they were more reckless and more spicy, but the meticulousness was insufficient and the transaction was still successful. The police knew exactly where the transaction was, but they dared not catch people because of surveillance problems and let them go. Brother Chen knows that there are inner ghosts, and he suspects temptation one by one, while the US version of the boss knows that there are inner ghosts, only to test out the newcomer Billy. And the boss in the US version also added some content. First, selling chips that endanger national security, such a big thing, came one or two FBI, and then added an unnecessary criminal motive, Billy asked him the reason, not lack of money or women, when the boss is in like.<br/><br/>The fourth character is a female doctor.<br/><br/>I personally think that this is the worst. The Hong Kong version is two female characters that do not interfere with each other. The US version is a female doctor who connects two undercovers in series. This formed a chaotic relationship between men and women. I was even thinking, who is the child the female doctor is pregnant with? Especially at the end. The female doctor became the only person who knew the identity of the undercover on both sides. Little Li Zi left her things unanswered. The last shot was to sign Xiao Lizi's name and put it in the drawer. For Matt Damon, he just ignored him and did not provide a direct lens to indicate what she might do next. . BTW: How did Diegman find Matt Damon, did not provide direct camera clues. Became the ending for the end. Leaving aside followers of Infernal Affairs 2 and 3, the bad guys in the original edition of Infernal Affairs Hong Kong are still pretending to be saluting, which is even more ironic.<br/><br/>Finally, let me talk about other minor characters.<br/><br/>After Diegman resigned, he apparently became a character in the play that was put on hold. But he was the policeman who had the information on the undercover. That undercover says it doesn't matter? The boss said that if he wanted to do it, he wouldn't do it. He had only one action from resignation to reappearance, which was to kill the police undercover. This viper figure is completely absent in the Hong Kong version, but another senior policeman who knew the undercover identity in the Hong Kong version died as soon as he appeared, so it strengthened the importance of Huang Qiusheng.<br/><br/>There is a small person in the Hong Kong version. Du Wenze played the stupid strong. When Liang Zhaowei was found to be undercover, he showed his loyalty in the underworld and protected Liang Chaowei, which was a passive action. Silly is not stupid. On the other hand, when the American version knew that Xiao Lizi was undercover, it was the bad guy A who took the initiative to test him. This section is not in the Hong Kong version. He told Xiaolizi 314 that they were actually at 344. Then he did not tell others, and finally he questioned him, not far away from other members. The little plum is just downstairs. If you walk from the joint to the end of a street, and pass 314 before you reach No. 344, and walk here to see the dead person, it's fine to stop. This temptation is not rigorous and superfluous. There is a suspicion of imitation for imitation.<br/><br/>Second, the echo of the plot<br/><br/>The Hong Kong version echoes a lot. Liu Dehua and Liang Chaowei met early because they bought audio. There are also common hobbies and pursuits. Echoed the identity of both undercover. At the end, the evidence was sent by the way when the sound was sent. This is not in the US version, but the female doctor directly peeked at the privacy of his boyfriend. You might say that it is not important, ok, let 's move on.<br/><br/>At the beginning, a policeman who knew Liang Chaowei's identity died. At this time, Liang Chaowei, who had been undercover for many years, watched the funeral convoy in the alley and performed a police salute. So at the end he only said the phrase ""I'm sorry, I'm a policeman"" when he caught Andy Lau. At the end of the US version, Matt Damon said, ""No one knows, what are you?"" Nani? Someone knows ~ Digman the neglected knows. Although he left for the time being, he was still an insider without dying.<br/><br/>The most important echo is also a cause and effect relationship. The transaction between Brother Chen and the Thais failed, and they found out that there was an inner ghost. In the US version, the police came directly to say that they had an undercover, and Matt Damon reported to the boss, which was very straightforward. On the police side, the reason for not daring to act is that the camera is not installed properly, and then Xiao Lizi directly told the police that there is an inner ghost through the dialogue, and there is no direct evidence, only that there is surveillance here. Isn't such a thing as a monitor so conspicuous in such a barren building? Even if you know it, wouldn't it be checked from the person who installed the camera? And Xiao Lizi said on the phone the method of providing false intelligence, but the poisonous snake Digman did not bird him at all.<br/><br/>Let's just say another echo, Andy Lau 's CIA sent someone to follow Huang Qiusheng. After Huang Qiu 's death, the people in the serious case complained about Andy Lau, so the last arrest and resentment against Andy Lau did not cooperate. Andy was commanded by Huang Qiusheng 's revenge. After those people, the final action was successful, these police applauded him for approval. In the US version, only Digman was the one who complained about Matt Damon, and he was even opened. When Matt Damon was looking for help, I found the undercover in private, so come and help me. At the end there is also a lens of applause, but this meaning is obviously not as interesting as the Hong Kong version of applause.<br/><br/>Three redundant c"

"jayjaycee","9","0","0","20 April 2020"," The rat symbolises obviousness!
","""The Departed"" is a 2006 crime thriller directed by Martin Scorsese starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon. As the annual birthday feature I decided on Scorsese's mid two thousand gem. It's a rewatch for me, as I already watched it back in November of 2017 and I still can feel how much this day has impacted me and my always developing taste in films. It's Scorsese, isn't that enough said? While there also many people who just don't resonate with his films, I'm definitely considering myself a great admirer of his work. I always knew that when Scorsese makes a film it's gonna be nothing short of cinematic art. This one's not quite different. First of all, he assembled one of the greatest casts and uses extremely talented actors even in the smallest roles. From terrific central performances by DiCaprio and Damon, there's an absolutely crazy performance by Jack Nicholson who dominates every single scene he's in. This man is without a doubt one of the most talented actors of all time and appearing in this film only confirms his status as an absolute legend. The supporting contributions by Sheen, Farmiga and Wahlberg are also not to bee scoffed at and also on an tremendously genius level. As to expect from a Scorsese feature, the whole final product is pure art by all accounts. Based on the Chinese classic feature ""Mou Gaan Dou (Infernal Affairs)"" he managed to relocate the story in the wonderful and brutal streets of Boston and it doesn't lack the tension a film of this genre needs. The story is without a doubt a masterful construct that even more masterfully combines its plot lines with such unique brilliance. It's basically a simple idea elaborated to such a sophisticated and packing plot. Two moles from two different parties try to identify each other all the while trying not to be uncovered. This duality is kept until the very end and even when the film already starts with this specific feeling of threat, it's becoming increasingly more and more as the film goes on. Just when you thought you've seen it all, Scorsese doubles it and blows your mind again. The character constellation is what makes this formula work out so extremely well. From start to finish it's not one hundred percent sure who's a friend and who's a foe, everyone has their own secrets and hidden role. Who can you trust? While we as the audience know about some characters and their role in this construct, we're still surprised nevertheless about some revelations. The triangular relationship between the two moles and the same woman is only one of the weak spots about this whole concept of trust and paranoia. The runtime might seem a little long, but in direct comparison to some of the director's other works, he uses every single second wisely and actually never slows it down or makes it boring. The tension doesn't decline once and until the shocking ending, had me on the edge of my seat. It wouldn't work out though if it wasn't for the ingenious cinematography and brilliant editing that create this packing atmosphere in the first place. All in all, this film is hands down one of the best thriller of the two thousands and effortlessly ranks among my favourite Scorsese flicks. It's an interesting gangster take with enough shocking twists and unraveled secrets that keep the film from getting boring, not even once it made me lose attention. In the end, nobody wins in this merciless game of trust and I think that's the crushing message behind it that makes it so subliminally epic. Well crafted, well acted and just highly enjoyable to witness. One of his best, that's for sure, but some other films of his filmography even better than this one. To conclude my review with the words of Ralph Wiggum: The rat symbolizes obviousness!"

The shift from buddhist ""incoherence"" to Catholic guilt is the biggest change in the theme of the original work, which makes the Chinese translation all the more inappropriate. So this is a thoroughly scorsese movie, and for most of scorsese's movies we can't ignore the religious aspect, or we'll have a lack of understanding."

","The localization adaptation was very successful and reached the balance of commercial art. Compared with the Hong Kong version, the obsolete bridge section with infinite flashback + sensational soundtrack is eliminated, and the headshot is clean and neat, but it has fallen out of rhythm control, character portrayal, and emotional substitution. The background of the characters, the integration of the characters into the environment, and hooking up with a psychologist have seriously slowed down the rhythm and entered the first trading climax. The Hong Kong version has a 15-minute US version and an hour. Old Jack's strong sense of existence actually made him a bit of a fan, and the newly added FBI informer's plot is not clever."

I was kind of disappointed with the stuff that happened towards the end of the movie, as I thought it was unnecessary and wasn't deserved to certain characters."

","2 snitches try to rat out each other. 1 good snitch (Di Caprio) is inside the mob. 1 bad snitch (Matt Damon) is inside the police force. Whose cover will be blown first? That's the whole story.<br/><br/>A copy is often never as good as the original. This movie is a copy of the original ""Infernal Affairs"" (2002), which is a much more subtle, refined detective movie. The difference in attitude is enormous. ""Infernal Affairs"" is especially to be recommended for the arthouse movie fans and for those who find the many swearing and violent scenes obnoxious in The Departed. The original ""Infernal Affairs"" is a gentleman's detective, where one outsmarts the other with a smile and a polite, yet deadly insult. ""The Departed"" on the contrary is all about vulgarity and looking macho through acts of violence. What a world of difference.<br/><br/>Something keeps nagging at me every time I see this copy with such a terrific star cast. What do I miss? I miss excellence. And I DID expect excellence with such a terrific star cast. Matt Damon is definitely miscast. Matt Damon is always known to be the good guy in all his other movie roles, but now he has to play a snitch, a homophobic ruthless killer. That role just doesnt look convincing, although Damon tries his best. The other actors are good in their roles, but somehow I miss chemistry between them. For that lack of chemistry I blame the director Scorsese.<br/><br/>Not every Scorsese picture has to be a brilliant classic, but when a director tries to make such a grand, star powered gangster movie, he better deliver the product. He missed the mark of excellence though. But even when Scorsese doesnt excel, it is still worthwhile the watch, with such great acting talents, therefore I will still reward it with 7 stars. It could have been a lot better though..."

","If there was ever a cast created by the hands of God himself it would have Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Martin Sheen, and Mark Wahlberg. What's that you say, The Departed has a cast like that and to add to it it's directed by Martin Scorsese. Well, this is the definition of perfect. Scorsese tends to stick with mobster movies like Goodfellas but he makes them so well. The writing and acting drive this story and the Boston setting is the icing on the cake. Nicholson plays Frank Costello, a Boston mobster who uses Colin Sullivan, played by Matt Damon, as a cop on the inside. Billy, played by DiCaprio, is an undercover cop sent by Sheen and Wahlberg to work for Costello and help bring him down. Rats on rats on rats. <br/><br/>First off, the story is one of the best I have ever seen. The sneaking around and the lying and the deception on all ways possible in amazing to see on screen. Bill lies to Costello about his life to get on the inside and Sullivan is working to bring Costello down while secretly working for him. It's a little hard to wrap the brain around but that makes me fall in love with the movie more. Word gets around that there is a rat in the police unit and Costello thinks there is a rat in his crew. Bottom line, Sullivan has to find himself and Billy has to be careful. The writing behind this is incredible and a few twists and turns are around every corner. <br/><br/>Living in Boston I know a few things or two about the language. The Departed may be a bit exaggerated but for the most part people do talk like that. The famous Boston accent can be that extreme but it's really extreme in this movie. Some of the actors are not from the Boston area and it shows as they try to force the accent. The cursing is also very extreme. One time I sat down and counted how many times they fay the F word and it was close to 400. Parents be aware, this is not a movie for the kids. Take notice of the R rating. <br/><br/>Damon, DiCaprio, and Nicholson were the stars of this movie but Mark Wahlberg snuck in the backdoor and was amazing. The first scene with him is my favorite in the entire movie. He and Sheen are offering Billy the job and Wahlberg goes off. You can tell Wahlberg had a lot of fun with this role because he plays a scumbag, but he is great. His lines are clever and snarky and when he acts it is entertaining. He stole the show every time he was on screen. He was a jerk but his intentions were positive. A character like this was needed for this movie and again, perfect casting choice and the character was written beautifully. His one flaw is his lack of screen time. There is a big gap in the movie where he isn't there and not involved and I was left wanting more. <br/><br/>No movie is flawless and I think the one weakness is Madolyn. She's the shrink for cops and criminals. She gets in a relationship with Damon but it's not really touched upon. They get together in the beginning but it's forgotten and overshadowed by everything else going on. She also works with Billy and they develop a relationship. A love triangle develops but it works for a little while but it becomes very two sided if you know what I mean. I don't really like her character as she is just as much of a snake as everybody else and at the end there is a huge plot hole with her. There is a big question that isn't fully answered and every time I watch the movie it drives me mad. Her character could have been so important but she turns out to be a loose end. I wish she could have been written better and given more screen time with Sullivan to make their relationship more believable.<br/><br/>From top to bottom each and every single character worked. Besides the start the supporting cast was amazing. Alec Baldwin and Anthony Anderson are in this movie and they are big name guys taking a smaller role like this. They make the best of their material and they are both fantastic. As for the guys on Costello's crew, they are awesome two. Mr. French is a beast and Fitzy is a riot as well. They are characters you don't necessarily know by name but you know their faces and love what they do in the movie. <br/><br/>The last thirty minutes or so were awesome. Everything unravels and there is one final twist at the end I didn't see coming. Characters get justice, some get screwed, and some get revenge. There are very few plot holes and the end is satisfying. Some characters have confrontations that are very intense. The ending made the movie and every time the credits role I smile and embrace the brilliance.<br/><br/>Overall, The Departed is an amazing film and Scorsese delivers again. There is a lot of violence, swearing, and the movie is long but it is worth every second. DiCaprio deserved an Oscar for his performance but we all know the academy hates him. It did win Best Picture and Best Director. Wahlberg also got nominated for best actor in a supporting role and he probably deserved it but it's not a shock he didn't win. What was good about this movie? Everything, there is no such thing as a perfect movie but in my opinion, this and Titanic are the two closest movies I can think of. WillyT Seal of Approval? Well, yes, obviously."

","This is the second time I watch this film and It again amazes me from start to the end. Billy and Colin Sullivan, the two main actors, ends up with both dead but they do really play a run and catch very well. Billy in role of an silent hero who has to give up the pride and honor of a police man to live as a life of crime. On the other hand, Colin shows his intellectual impasse when he realizes that the longer he wears this mask, the deeper he sinks his life in a swamp. There are several scenes I don't understand at all, for example the appearance of another police rat or what happens next with Madolyn, what is she gonna do with the envelop given by Billy. However, it is a good remake of Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>One minor thing, the end of this film is what I don't like most when the director let Dignam, a cop, kill Colin in a criminal but realistic way. It'd be better if Dignam would be the one who catches Colin finally and give the job back to law and justice. I think Colin did have an easy death."

","The thing I remember the most from seeing The Departed the first time is that I had rented it with my parents, and there was something wrong with the DVD so it kept freezing at the scene in which Jack Nicholson whips out a dildo at the adult movie theater, which I found both harrowing and amusing since I imagined that someone had played that scene over and over until the DVD got scratched or something. We must have watched that rubber penis ten times trying to get past that mark. I mention this because it says something both about my complicated relationship to my parents and sex, and about the slight forgettability of the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Still, the fact that the film pales a bit alongside Scorsese's other great gangster films does not make it bad, in fact it is a solid piece of work. The Departed eschews some of the lavish style of movies like Goodfellas and Casino, possibly because the source demands a somewhat grittier presentation, by, aside from a couple of neon glowing scenes and a weirdly gratuitous cocaine orgy scene, keeping the visual excess to a minimum and playing the soundtrack rather safe with things like Pink Floyd and The Rolling Stones – Gimme Shelter is played at least twice, but I gotta admit, it's the perfect song to make a badass entrance to.<br/><br/>However, the plot, about a policeman infiltrating the mob while a mob guy is infiltrating the police, is brilliantly constructed, especially during the latter half where Scorsese turns the tension of who will be exposed first up to eleven. The fact that both camps are full of ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" helps blur the line between the two, which is a recurring theme in the dialogue. There's an inherent growing sense of distrust and paranoia in the central conflict that the film could probably squeeze more out of, but DiCaprio conveys it quite well in his emotionally troubled undercover cop. The suspense reaches its height during two excellent scenes; first, an intense alley chase, and second, an equally intense phone call between the two infiltrators. The only thing that doesn't really work with them is the somewhat contrived subplot in which they both sleep with the same woman. It would be unfair to single out The Departed among the host of gangster films but it's like it didn't even show up for the Bechdel test.<br/><br/>I have to revise my opinion about the violent two-part climax which I previously thought had an air of silliness to it, as it actually plays quite perfectly into the whole blurred distinction between good and evil. There's something ironic? fateful? nihilistic? about it and it reminded me of those old French heist movies like Rififi and Le doulos. The departed, good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor, are all equal now."
"FilmGuy34567","9","0","0","30 June 2013"," The Departed
","Scorsese returns to his old form in ""Goodfellas"" and Mean Streets"" with this tense thriller, about two men who are both moles for the police and mafia, respectively and how their lives crisscross. There is a duality to these characters, they are at once opposite and the same, but working on different ends of the spectrum. This is what creates the tension of the film, not to mention the brutal depictions of mob violence and ethnic nationalism. Scorsese embodies a modern crime thriller here, but explores the same themes of his previous films, such as isolation, redemption, and betrayal. It's exciting and morally relevant, a power punch of a thriller boosted by fine performances from DiCaprio and Nicholson especially."

","Excellent. A great, great movie. I saw it last night at a special screening and must say it was a tour de force. Even though Boston is not really a gritty town Scorsese was able to capture a darker side of the city. Coming from that area, I am always concerned when actors put on the local accent as it tends to be distracting rather than supportive. However, with local pros like Damon and Wahlberg they were able to really grab hold of it and not go overboard... most of the time. The true stand out performance has to go to DiCaprio. He has really come into his since hooking up with Scorsese, having scored a number of original performances all of which have expanded his range. He really snagged onto a deep and tragic character and created something that will hopefully be recognized come awards season. One of my favorite aspects was the friendly hostility the characters had for each other. It is a specific trademark that I have never noticed in any other city. In Boston, when you are really close with someone (or not really) it is, more or less, a requirement to bust their balls and shoot cruel insults back and forth in rhythmic banter. That detail was extensively realized in THE DEPARTED and I doubt anybody who was raised outside of the metro Boston area, or at least visited at some point, would find it nearly as hilarious as those who were. As for Scorsese's direction, I think he scored big with this one. While many have criticized that his movies have become more commercial I believe that he has just evolved. There were some classic Scorsese moments here, my favorite being a scene where DiCaprio is alone and packing his things in his apartment. Beautifully cut and stylistically directed. Is it his best effort? No. But it still is truly mesmerizing. He has created something truly special from a city that is highly underrated."

","This gangster movie, dressed up as cops and robbers, is severely pumped by Boston bluntness where everyone is on the fast track to earning the film's title. An epic espionage battle ensues with ""rats"" abound. The native Bostonians set the tone, as Matt Damon is brilliant trying to stay ahead of the pack and Mark Wahlberg's chip on the shoulder routine doesn't let up while Nicholson swims in the self serving villain role somehow missing the obvious? The police psychiatrist played by Vera Farmiga adds the DiCaprio box office love tryst but obliterated a gripping suspension of disbelief (unprofessional relationship and distributing prescription drugs without being an MD?)Despite the insult to our intelligence, the All Star cast delivers while Scorsese over-delivers as per the norm for our American filmmaker."

","The Departed is story about a man from the mob who's infiltrated the police and a man from the police who's infiltrated the mob, adapted from the 2002 film Infernal Affairs. Let me just say the film was incredibly well directed, with slight quirks in the cinematography and every actor influenced by Scorsese to shine within their roles. The overall film is well rounded, with realistic performances and a standout setting.<br/><br/>There's not weak link in the line-up; every actor has been cast perfectly. Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon each play the lead roles excellently, managing to sustain deep and original characters throughout. Jack Nicholson, with his rugged, aged looks and unique quirks allow his role as the domineering mob boss to stand out and provide a lasting impression. One scene in which he's trying to find a rat in his organisation provided a platform for him to subtly, yet menacingly imply accusations upon his crew. Mark Wahlberg (who received and Oscar nomination) played the potty-mouthed straight up cop to a tee and Martin Sheen played the understanding, experienced detective greatly, managing to keep a cool performance, only slightly changing when faced with death.<br/><br/>The film provides deep suspenseful elements and a fast paced, clever plot. Moments of excitement are juxtaposed by meaningful scenes of heartbreak and character development. If you want to see an intelligent, memorable thriller, watch The Departed."

","Martin Scorsese finally received his Oscar for Best Director with this film, among three additional Oscars, including Best Picture. For Scorsese, his Oscar was overdue, but it could not have been awarded for a better film. The Departed is a powerhouse; the casting, directing and acting in this film are untouchable. Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon work together to create a truly brilliant contrast between protagonists that escalates into an unprecedented and unexpected climax that will leave the viewer stunned and speechless. Jack Nicholson proves why he is the consummate actor of his generation with his chilling portrayal of a ruthless and truly evil Irish crime boss of whom the film's story circulates. From his first scene to his last, Nicholson's performance is spectacular. His authenticity is positively chilling. To complement the stellar performances from DiCaprio, Damon and Nicholson, Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg offer performances that fit this film seamlessly and perfectly. From the honest character of Queenan (Sheen) to the brutish but intelligent Dignam (Wahlberg), the supporting cast blends effortlessly into the leading roles to provide a remarkable finished product that is The Departed. Alongside the brilliant casting and the outstanding acting, the pacing of this film is perfect. Comfortably over two hours, the steady and constant increase of action and intensity culminates in a truly unique and heart-stopping climax that the viewer will absolutely not expect. If you are a fan of Martin Scorsese, this film is for you. If you are a fan of DiCaprio, Damon, Nicholson, etc, this film is for you. If you appreciate the art of filmmaking, this film is for you. <br/><br/>To summarize, this film is absolutely brilliant. 10/10."

","It was intriguing to see the gang and the cops predicting each other's moves, except this play of deception suddenly stopped making sense towards the end of the film.<br/><br/>It shouldn't have been too hard for the cops to work out that when Capt. Queenan was killed, the mole was either Colin or one of the officers following Queenan that day, yet nobody mentions this. When Colin orders the followers not to pursue the van, it makes it even more evident that he's the mole.<br/><br/>During the meeting with the Chinese, how do the FBI tapping everyone's phones not spring Colin?<br/><br/>Before Frank's downfall, why does Billy try to convince Frank that he's about to be sprung?<br/><br/>Once the psychiatrist discovers that Colin is a spy for Frank, why is she left alive?<br/><br/>Instead of running away and master-minding a failed plot, why didn't Billy run straight to a high-ranking cop and reveal Colin as soon as he noticed the envelope?<br/><br/>How did the FBI mole know about Colin and why would he protect him?<br/><br/>How did Dignam find out about Colin? The police wouldn't have told him or they would've arrested him themselves. Madolyn could have only told him if Billy had given her Dignam's contact information, but he was never around the police computers to check and any contact information relevant to Dignam's former position would have likely become invalid as soon as he quit (I assume he wouldn't have used his personal number to contact Billy)? Besides, if he had Dignam's contact information, why was there any need to leave the evidence with Madolyn?<br/><br/>If Billy knew Dignam's contact information, he would never have had to arrange the risky meeting with Colin, as he could've relied on Dignam to back him up in the case that Colin had erased Billy's file. Why did that come as a surprise to Billy anyway? Shouldn't it have been obvious? Considering that Billy wasn't aware of his file being erased, what was the point of running away then later arranging the meeting anyway? His only request in the extortion of Colin was to get his identity back, which he could've got easily if he just stuck around at the police station instead of running away. The fact that he could arrest Colin at the meeting left him in the same situation as if he had stayed in the police station, as he would still need to explain the story to the rest of the police.<br/><br/>Why does nobody spot Colin during the presumed investigation of the Chinese cook's murder/assault? Even if they didn't know that Colin was a detective, surely they should've spotted Colin in the footage then done a search for him?<br/><br/>Forensics experts might've seen problems with Colin's explanation for Billy's murder and why any of them were there in the first place, but that's not a big deal compared to the other problems in the movie."

","The movie The Departed focuses around the police trying to convict a well-known gangster in Boston. With corrupt police and being a very powerful gangster this becomes a large struggle for the police departments. The quality of the actors is magnificent in this film; it features Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy, Jack Nicholson as Frank Costello (gangster), Matt Damon as Colin Sullivan, Mark Wahlberg as Dignam and Martin Sheen as Queenan. In this movie Billy graduates from the police academy and is picked to work undercover as one of Frank's henchmen. Earning Frank's trust is the first task for Billy to accomplish. Billy does this basically becoming a thug, beating up people who own money to Frank. Billy reports directly to Queenan and Dignam on his findings of the illegal activities that are being done. Unknown to Billy, Frank has several police officers on his payroll including Colin who Frank helped as a child by giving him groceries for his family and promising to give him a job if he ever needed to make extra money. Billy being under tremendous stress uses drugs to help him get the undercover assignment and is required to seek the help of a female counselor Madolyn played by (Vera Farmiga) who turns out to be the girlfriend of Colin. Billy becomes sexually involved with Madolyn. Madolyn is also the source in which Billy gets his drugs. Billy starts to suspect that Frank has informants in the police department making it hard for him to trust anyone. He is constantly torn between doing the undercover work, wanting to have a regular life and his growing feeling for Madolyn. Billy gets to the point that he is almost paranoid. The action in this film usually revolves around violence. The beatings and killings that take place really do a good job of demonstrating a lot of drama. The lighting plays a big part of the film; much of the filming is inside dark rooms or bars. This helps set the tone of the activities being performed. The film angles in which some of the shooting and fight scenes are shown to enhance the action that is being portrayed. This film has a lot of the same theme as the gangster movie Goodfellas, only in a different time frame and location. The ending of this movie takes many by surprise just because it is unexpected of how all the events takes place. I will not indulge on the ending leaving that to the audiences who have not seen this movie yet. It is definitely worth seeing. The actors do an excellent job portraying their characters."

And no one could have done it remotely close to Jack's performance which is why Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences felt an Oscar would be too demeaning for an actor of Jack's stature.<br/><br/>In his academy award acceptance speech for the long-due Oscar for the Best Director, Scorsese mentioned Monahan's brilliant screen-writing as a 'crazy script' and you have to nod your heads for Scorsese's acumen.<br/><br/>The script demands every actor to play a lead role and a supporting role as well. Alec Baldwin comes next in the list of performances in this 'Modern day masterpiece' with jokes delivered with a deadpan face and a rather grave voice that you could hardly realize he was joking after all.<br/><br/>The movie is adapted from 'Mou Gaan Dou' but it will remain an epic Hollywood remake for at least half a century hence.

"Cedric_Catsuits","10","0","0","21 July 2011"," Matt Damon is outstanding
","This is a classy bit of film making with some cracking performances. Matt Dillon's portrayal of slimy faux-cop Colin is brilliant, probably the best I've seen from him. He alone makes this film worth watching, and I've watched it 4-5 times and intend to do so again.<br/><br/>Dillon's adversary is faux-hood DiCaprio, sweating his way through a stressful career stint as scary arch-villain Nicholson's sidekick. Throw in a little Sheen and Wahlberg, mix with Baldwin and Winstone, and you have one enthralling movie. For glamour fans there's the delicious Vera Farminga, throwing a cherry on top of the fabulously convoluted plot.<br/><br/>No matter that the story is full of holes and nonsensical, contrived situations. The appeal of this film is gritty, real-life relationships and dilemma. You can smell the fear and taste the blood, thanks to a director and cast who really know what they're doing.<br/><br/>Quite why Damon's performance has gone largely unacknowledged whilst almost everyone else involved with the film has collected awards, is puzzling me. Playing such a complex and shifty character with great depth and understanding is apparently not enough - it seems you have to shout, wave your hands and make funny faces to win awards.<br/><br/>Well done Matt Damon, in my books yours is one of the all-time great performances, and I'd give you an Oscar."

","Martin Scorsese has always been known as A legendary director. With masterpieces like 'Raging Bull', 'Good fellas', 'Taxi Driver', and 'Casino', Scorsese never fails to at the very least impress. This film proves that Scorsese is brilliant at doing what he does best.<br/><br/>The Departed is an infuriation of excellence. Watching it is like watching exploding fireworks in the sky. The film captures an unseen, brutal part of Boston, showing it in an undeniably intensifying way. It's filled with excellent performances, outstanding direction, and a great screenplay.<br/><br/>This thriller is filled with jarringly flawless performances. Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon's on-screen 'battle' is suspenseful. You can actually feel yourself rooting for one of them. DiCaprio is furious and exuberant, while Damon is smart and curious. Jack Nicholson makes for a charismatic star in this film. His performance is certainly worthwhile freakish. Lastly, Mark Wahlberg is hilarious. I really haven't seen a better performance from him. Other actors including Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Vera Farmiga are decent.<br/><br/>Scorsese may not have ventured into this theme so much, apart from Goodfellas, but it mostly seems so. The different camera angles and intelligent shots are dazzling. Inclusive to some overdone foul language and blood/gore, it eventually pays off. I'm definitely counting this film as a worthy Scorsese brilliancy.<br/><br/>It's not easy to write scripts, but this film has an engrossing one. From the start to end, the film is entertaining enough to keep on going. It has a highly suspenseful and sometimes abrupt climax, but otherwise, no problem.<br/><br/>Overall, there's really not enough to justify this achievement. It may not come to the likes of people not familiar with substance material, but it's a must-see for any Scorsese fan. A star-studded cast, worthy direction, and 'exciting' screenplay back up as proof."
"danbarr000","9","0","0","14 March 2011"," A great movie with an all-star cast and an intriguing plot line, The Departed has very few flaws.
","Storyline <br/><br/>The plot line that the departed follows is sort of cat and mouse type set up. It is the story of two rats, one who is loyal to the Massachusetts state police and the other to Boston Irish crime leader Frank Costello. Billy Costigan is the man who is a good and some what honest cop who Queenan and Dignam are prejudice of because of his family history. While Colin Sullivan who looked up to Costello as a sort of father figure in his youth is the mole inside the state police. Both scramble to find the identity of the other while billy's superiors use him to gather evidence against Costello, while Costello is using Sullivan to keep the state police from gathering evidence against him.<br/><br/>The Good<br/><br/>The irony to the plot line creates an interesting concept to follow. The man who would become the undercover officer the police needed and who could be potentially essential to bringing down Costello is at first quickly rejected from becoming a regular state trooper, while the man who is an informant for Costello is quickly accepted. The twin story lines creates a good effect on the viewer by allowing both stories to unfold around the characters with their paths crossing. Another excellent aspect of The Departed is the characters, the characters have a lot of depth so much so that they seem like they could all exist, from the criminal Costello to the humble cop Captain Queenan. This movie has a large amount of incredible actor some considered to be the best around, with Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, and Martin Sheen topping the list. This movie entertains you through its entirety until it comes to an unexpected and satisfying conclusion.<br/><br/>The Bad <br/><br/>Some have said this movie is over done when compared to the original Infernal Affairs. This could seem confusing to some who don't follow it closely because of the two different characters it follows almost an equal amount of time. <br/><br/>and The Conclusion<br/><br/>This movie can entertain almost anyone, with a great storyline and a fantastic cast. Thats why the departed gets a 9/10 from me."

"ajs-10","9","0","0","21 November 2010"," Best since Goodfellas...
","I have lost count of the number of times this film has been recommended to me. Consequently I bought the DVD some time ago but never got round to watching it until now. It is a remake of a 2002 Hong Kong film titled Infernal Affairs which was a big hit over there. It deals with crime and police corruption in Boston, and I must admit to those that recommended it to me, it's pretty damn good! More of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters take big Joey for a ride while I write the next paragraph But don't let me catch you readin' it!!!).<br/><br/>State Detective, Billy Costigan, is from the South side of town; he has no family to speak of and so is targeted by Cpt. Queenan and Staff Sgt. Dignam who run undercover operations. They persuade him to get in with crime boss, Frank Costello, who they suspect is selling technology to the Chinese, amongst many other crimes. Little do they know that Costello has an inside man on the police task force, Colin Sullivan. Now Sullivan is not able to get the name of the undercover operative in Costello's gang, but tips him off whenever the cops are getting near. After a while the cops become suspicious that Costello has an inside man amongst their ranks and start up an investigation to find out who the rat is. Cpt. Ellerby appoints Sullivan to lead the investigation. Add to this the fact that Costigan is slowly losing his mind the longer it goes on and has to see a police psychiatrist, Madolyn, who just happens to be Sullivan's girlfriend. With both sides slowly closing in on the insiders a tense and shocking climax is in the offing.<br/><br/>I must say I really enjoyed this film up to a point. That point is the ending, I would have done it differently, but then who am I to argue with a man like Scorsese? A great script by William Monahan really brought out some great performances. First up I thought Leonardo DiCaprio was outstanding as Billy Costigan, Matt Damon totally made me forget the Bourne films as Colin Sullivan and, of course, Jack Nicholson was great, as ever, as Frank Costello. Also on the role of honour are; Mark Wahlberg as Staff Sgt. Dignam and Martin Sheen as Cpt. Queenan. Honourable mentions go to; Ray Winstone as Mr. French (Costello's top henchman), Vera Farmiga as Madolyn, Anthony Anderson as Brown (a cop) and Alec Baldwin as Cpt. Ellerby.<br/><br/>A really engrossing film with just enough twists and turns to keep the audience enthralled without confusing too much. A great script and some really great performances only add to the enjoyment factor. I've already said I have a slight problem with the ending, but it is still a tremendous film and one I don't hesitate to very highly recommend.<br/><br/>My score: 9.3/10"
"allen74-884-714138","10","0","0","31 October 2010"," The Departed-Ida Allen
","Ida Allen HUMN246 F2WW Assignment 5-5 Film Review The Departed<br/><br/>The Departed is an American film based on the 2002 film called Internal Affairs. The Departed takes place in Boston, Massachusetts. The film is centered on crime and deceit. One of the main characters Frank Costello played by the legendary Jack Nicholson is quite the crime leader. He trains and plants Matt Damon's character Colin as an informant at the Massachusetts State police Department. At the same time, the police get wind of some wrong doing and plant their own undercover assignee Leo DiCaprio's character Billy. The Departed is quite the layered film. It is deep and serious through out. It takes more than one viewing in my opinion to fully understand and appreciate the wonderful actors and the stories they tell. <br/><br/>Legendary director Martin Scorsese has been mentioned as one of the most legendary directors of the decade. He really met his match on this film. It is so intricate and detailed that even he said on an entertainment show that he had more to tell than he could truly fit into a respectable time allowance. The theme of The Departed gets down to basics about cops and robbers. It shows the audience about the good guys and the bad guys and shows that sometimes they even pretend to be on the other side when they need to. The central concern in the film is based upon crime and catching the bad guy. The theme mainly focuses on plot and character.<br/><br/>Thematic ideas are truly important when reviewing a film. The plot points of The Departed have so many thematic elements intertwined into it that one has to pull each string of information from it to understand the full picture. For example, the plot involves two trained cadets who are both trying to uncover crime in the same work place of the police department. Both Billy and Colin are working as double agents with the overall goal of catching Costello. The thematic element of character comes into play strongly in this portion of the plot. The characters in the film have very detailed roles and truly make the movie. The Departed is clever, cunning, and meticulous. <br/><br/>There are many undercover scenes where Billy and Colin give incredible performances. The scenes are tense and nerve racking and place you at the edge of your seat. The viewer feels nervous about either Colin or Billy getting caught by Costello. Both sides worry about getting their cover blown, but yet suspect that they are being watched by someone else.<br/><br/>In all reality, they are. Both Colin and Billy are watching the same criminal and one another. The plot thickens when Vera Farmiga's character psychiatrist Dr. Madolyn Madden is involved with both undercover agents. She is the stations psychiatrist and Colin begins seeing her and then Billy also begins a romance with her after meting with her for his probation. This woman could blow both men's cover at the drop of a hat. They refer to the other as a rat. Colin and Billy give stunning performances in this film and left me hoping for a sequel. They provide such a believing performance of their characters and really convince the audience that the good guy, bad guy story line is real.<br/><br/>Techniques used during The Departed really added relevance to the film overall. For example, the lighting in the film was right on the money. A scene where Costello was discussing his crime activities with Colin was often captured in low lighting. This gave me the feel of hidden danger and secrecy. In addition, a scene where Billy was investigating Costello and Colin was often portrayed in natural or low light. This felt surreal and authentic. This provided me with the belief that these characters were real and the film was not just a film, but a real occurrence.<br/><br/>Another example of a technique in the film is camera angle. In a scene where Mark Walhberg who plays Staff Sergeant Sean Dignam who is second in command of the undercover unit and is on a mission to figure out exactly what Colin and Billy is up to makes the audience feel as though they are on the street as well. The angle he is captured when yelling at Colin made me nervous and feels on edge for him. The angle was shot close up and was bona fide. <br/><br/>The theme of The Departed is not a singled out one. There is one other film that comes to mind with the character and plot portrayal of crime and undercover moles in the police department which is Goodfellas. This film is also based upon crime and robbery. The film places direct reference on the theme of character and plot. The main characters Henry Hill and Jimmy Conway take part in a robbery that was in completion of two other gangsters who also have their bids on the crime. The film was quite complex and involved around the characters and the plot. <br/><br/>In conclusion, The Departed has a theme related to character that many can relate to. Costello acted as a father figure to both undercover agents. The main point of theme is identity of the good guy and bad guy. The identity of both agents keep the audience intrigued and the thought of Costello realizing who they are are just captivating. Throughout the movie, Scorsese proved that remakes of earlier films can be as good as the first version and that suspense and thrill are his main ingredients to this film.<br/><br/>References Scorsese, M.

","Desperate to bring down local kingpin Frank Costello, the Boston Police Department convinces a newly graduated officer with a chequered past to go undercover and join Frank's mob. However, Frank has his own agents working for the good guys ...<br/><br/>This fast-moving crime melodrama is pretty good fun but for me it's overly familiar Scorsese territory, with its wiseguys, stoolies, religious backdrop, failed romance and general male identity crises. It was a big hit for him, both financially and perhaps more importantly in that he finally won an Oscar after five nominations. But take it from me - most of those previous nominations were for better movies, and some of his best work wasn't even nominated (Taxi Driver, The King Of Comedy). Don't get me wrong though, there's a lot to enjoy in this flick and in some ways it is quite different - there's much more of a focus on plotting and intrigue, there's Crazy Jack doing his inimitable thing and the big ensemble of heavyweights are all clearly enjoying themselves (Wahlberg wins the Joe Pesci gratuitous swearing award). I liked Damon best as the increasingly confused Judas with a lucky streak a mile wide, and the plot has lots of interesting little quirks, such as the inference that Costigan (and not Sullivan) is the father of Madolyn's child. It goes for the standard Hamlet ending, but in an unexpected way and the final shot of the rat is an amusing metaphor. I've never been particularly enamoured of Scorsese's constant fascination with the link between machismo and male identity - I guess it's an Italian-American thing - but when the picture gets into more universal territory, like the scene in the restaurant where Frank is starting to crack under the pressure of knowing there's a traitor in his midst, it starts to come alive. The movie has an unusual history - it's based on the excellent 2002 Cantonese flick Mou Gaan Dou, aka Internal Affairs (and not to be confused with the 1990 Mike Figgis film of the same name). Aren't the Academy Awards strange ? When Scorsese makes a courageous and deeply personal piece like The Last Temptation Of Christ he loses (to Barry Levinson), but when he does a (slightly inferior) remake of a pulp fiction Hong Kong action flick he wins. Hey, maybe there's a rat in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences."
"Ziya90","8","0","0","7 August 2010"," Disappointed at theater, but after a second watch, changed my mind
","I was pretty disappointed with the movie when had watched it at theater for the first time (had difficulty in following the movie especially, found it too fast paced etc.) it was just a good movie, but months later, I watched it on DVD again and changed my mind almost completely. There is everything that a cop movie could include. Of course, this is not the best Scorsese film or my favorite Scorsese film, it is Taxi Driver, but a great movie. And people compare it with the original Asian version (they don't have to do), then they say hard things about this movie. I was disappointed not because of only one reason, but the most problematic thing in the movie was editing, the movie is one of the most exhausting movies ever made, if you ask me. It is like there is no break even to breathe, no break between the events, so a too exhausting experience like he first half of Bourne Ultimatum. The events run, run and run, any kind of method is not used. I don't like the movies has such editing, because you cannot assimilate things. As for the plot, despite this is not an original work, a new version, the story is brainwave, in other words, it is brilliantly written, it adapts 'the idea' almost excellently. I see The Departed as a crime epic, yes it is an epic, not like American Gangster which is pretty good, but usual. The actors. Matt Damon is one of my favorite actors, but the point is that may be because of his persona, may be because of Bourne trilogy, himself (and his character) is one of the factors that make the movie very good. Damon excellently reflects his character's two face. And his unbelievable actions throughout the movie. Jack Nicholson is one of my favorite actors too, but his acting is not overrated, great performance. In addition, his colorful, but at the same time maniac character, Costello is not likable, but very interesting and colorful. I am proud of Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg. Yes sometimes such things happen, a man comes and exhibits an unexpected and excellent performance. I don't like Mark Wahlberg honestly, but in this movie, he goes beyond himself. He is so funny and so serious also, his character. The battle of words scene between Dignam and Ellerby is the peak of Martin Scorsese movies, you know, in Martin Scorsese movies, characters are ribald and as I know, Casino was a record in terms of strong language. The scene was very funny and a bit shocking and makes a reference to Scorsese movies I believe. The best part of the movie, that deserves being in cinema anthology, starts when everything turns into a mess. Orders, coincidences and bad luck. I don't know why, but to witness the greatness of the movie, just watch this scene. It was one of the reasons that made me changed my mind. I don't know the disappointment reasons of other people, but it should not related to the script, acting or direction (except exhausting story telling), because this is a very well written, acted and directed movie with some bitter twists. The success of it comes from the details mostly and its complexity in the story. The movie has flaws, but not little flaws. For example the love triangle is so far fetched and unrealistic. They encounter at home, then have sex. There is an envelope matter which is weird. However, we can interpret it as silliness of Costigan. By the way, almost all the people around me complain about the ending. I have not any problem with the ending. What is the name of the movie? Plus, no uninteresting or dull character. Now it is time for Di Caprio. He raises his bar too. The situations he is in and his relationship with Costello are very exciting, very engrossing, but sometimes harsh and sad. Scorsese should have won the best director Oscar absolutely by The Taxi Driver first, but this is not a movie which I would complain or bother so that he won it by this."

I am personally very impatient and can barely sit through an episode of Friends or Sex and the City, but the two and a half hours of this movie passed by in no time.<br/><br/>If you like movies similar as Goodfellas then this one will top it. A strong story that keeps you focused to the screen for a long time and you will watch it again.<br/><br/>The story is about two graduate Mass. State troopers. One of them is deemed so intelligent, he is offered an under cover position to uncover Castello's mob network in South Boston.

"Webstuhl","8","0","0","10 May 2007"," Excellent Rip-Off
","It is a wonderful movie, I really enjoyed watching, but it kind of makes me mad that it won 4 Oscars only because Scorsese ""americanised"" the story of infernal affairs. Of course Scorsese changed a lot. There's is some improvement. For Example : In Infernal Affairs every time somebody gets shot they play music, so the scene gets more ""emotional"". But I loved those silent killings at the end of TD. Then character development is a bit different. TD concentrates on relationship, whereas Infernal Affairs concentrates on the two mules and the way they become part of their environment. I think that this aspect is portrayed better in Infernal Affairs.<br/><br/>The rooftop scene - In Infernal Affairs the rooftop scene is much cooler, much more intelligent. On the other hand, it is good that Scorsese changed it, because it wouldn't fit to the concept of the movie."
"mathmaniac","10","0","0","24 March 2007"," Scorsese is the master
","I don't think I have to read every comment here to say what I have to say about this movie: it is the work of a master and that will make it always worth watching. <br/><br/>The very first time I saw a Martin Scorsese film, it was 'Mean Streets' and it gave me an anxiety attack. I thought I wouldn't be able to cope with all the adrenaline making me sit on the edge of my seat throughout that movie. Little did I know that any movie of the crime-suspense genre by Scorsese would make me feel this way and I had better get used to it.<br/><br/>Spielberg should bow and scrape every time he sees the master. And any actor with a brain would crawl through broken glass to get to work on a Scorsese picture. <br/><br/>The fact that this was a remake of a great Chinese film invites comparisons between the two. I think I will wait a good long while before I see the Chinese film and I will probably love it as much but with distance and time between the two stories. <br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg was blessed to get the role that he did in this film. He had to do little except act the part of tough native Bostonian. His somewhat important part in the story didn't really shock or amaze. He got recognition for his role simply by being involved in this wonderful production.<br/><br/>Can Martin Scorsese tell a story better than anyone on the effin planet or what? Can he recognize a humdinger of a story when he sees one better then any effin director alive today or what? Can he dig the diamonds out of the effin coal while working in effin politically correct effin Hollywood or what? Sorry, just still feeling the effin spirit of the effin movie's effin language, that's all.<br/><br/>There's a haze of dread that hangs over every scene like pollution. Does that come from the viewer's intuition or does the director, with the writers, the camera man or the lighting guy, put it there?<br/><br/>In almost every scene, there's the new lethal weapon (call it Lethal weapon XXVI): the cell phone. Every time one rings in someone's pocket on screen, you want to stand up and scream, 'Don't answer it!' The cell phone is the new character, deserving separate billing, getting 'offed' (thrown in water) or marked with blood (literally).<br/><br/>As in all crime plots, the black character is marked - you know he is going to get whacked, it's just a question of when.<br/><br/>Matt Damon and Leonardo di Caprio give equally powerful performances but Leo is the lucky guy who has the audience rooting for him. They look a bit alike and this cannot be an accident. They look like they SHOULD be related. In real life, in the non-screen world, Whitey Bulger and Billy Bulger are brothers and have been living a drama based in Boston that also pits good against evil (brothers, Whitey is a mobster on the lam, Billy was the president of the University of Massachusetts, both Irish, both Bostonian). There's a fabulous irony that somewhere, Whitey Bulger probably owns this DVD and watches it in a setting not unlike some of the film sets. <br/><br/>There has been talk that Costello, the Nicholson character, was loosely based on Whitey Bulger. That isn't important. The good/evil conflict is, and it is very Bulger family - like. Kudos to the screenwriter, William Monahan, who has more than a little knowledge of the Bulgers, having written a book about them, and knows how to write one quotable line after another. Bang, pow, wham! They just keep coming, making your wish you could carry those lines around in your pocket. 'I'm the guy who does his job. You must be the other guy.' Alec Baldwin and Leo have best lines - the dialogue just comes from them, as if they went home at night and wrote the lines themselves -but Nicholson has his share, too. <br/><br/>Nicholson is great but he plays, who else, the Irish American version of Jack Nicholson. Great nonetheless.<br/><br/>The dark scenes with the soundtrack of the slammin bangin Dropkick Murphy's music: everything is harmonious in this movie as long as we are in bars, alleys and dark, hidden places.<br/><br/>I have the tiniest criticsm of one plot point in the movie: who cares if your identity is erased from a computer? As everyone who ever has touched a computer knows by now, everything lost can be found again!<br/><br/>I also want to thank the Academy for recognizing this picture - what's with all the other crap coming out of Hollywood these days, anyway?"
"clintfive-1","7","0","0","22 March 2007"," Scorcese Imitating Scorcese?
","When I put the fact that Scorcese directed this flick against the finished product, I was left scratching my head. Scorcese has always had the goods where gangster films are concerned. But, I have to say I'm now inclined to think that there WAS a time when you could go to see a Scorcese movie and know you were getting first class. You never had to worry. THE DEPARTED may have killed that notion...at least for the time being. I went straight out and bought the double disc edition with the movie script booklet purely based in the fact that Scorcese directed it. (Note: in FIRST run of the DVD in Australia, released February 14 2007, the second disc's special features don't match those advertised on the box cover - there are fewer on the disc itself than printed on the back. This is a print error that Warner Brothers have since acknowledged and will be rectified in future prints.) It is not a bad film by any stretch; it's still very entertaining, however, the actors didn't quite reach the level of authenticity I would have expected - especially since the cast is a bevy of Hollywood's A-List male actors. Jack Nicholson is a brilliant performer - he always brings an intensity to any role he plays. And he did this here, occasionally throwing in that jagged edge of insanity he is famous for. However, I just couldn't believe him as a mob leader specifically. Matt Damon - always been a favourite of mine. But what's going on, mate? Here we see him attempting to achieve the persona of a sly, corrupt cop in the way he THOUGHT it should be played, rather than actually becoming the role. In a number of his roles, he has come across as somewhat conscious of how he is delivering the character, and this was no exception. For me he didn't quite fit the role. Mark Wahlberg's sharp mouthed, a-hole cop was almost unnecessary. I couldn't piece him into the picture; the film could have easily survived without this role, regardless of the fact that he was required to round out the plot in the final scene. But, his angle on character delivery was too forced and exaggerated, and in placing him into the full context of the story, his existence was more a hindrance than a help. The only really solid performance here was Leonardo DiCaprio. And this is something I never thought I'd admit to. I have never been a fan. However, in this film, he has proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is a main player. Overall, THE DEPARTED didn't quite showcase the legendary capabilities of Scorcese as a director. And for this reason, the final product looks more like a film made by a lesser known director trying to IMITATE Scorcese's style, but doesn't fully achieve the equivalent. Thus, we don't see the full potential of what we know to be a brilliant cast. The flow of the movie is left somewhat disjointed and scattered, making it difficult for the audience to fully submit to the plot and the experience. And this is a pity since you really need to pay attention to the plot to catch the wave and stay with it. However, it is entertaining. Most people will probably enjoy it - if not for the juiciness of a violent gangster flick then certainly for the cast. Still very worth the watch if you love Scorcese."

","I haven't been so blown away by a film in a long time and this immediately got put on my favorite movies list. I've seen comments left by other users who are fans of Infernal Affairs which is the film The Departed is based on. They bashed this movie saying it was ""too americanized"" or ""the characters were ruined"" but i feel differently. The original movie Infernal Affairs was good, but I can't say I liked it as much as The Departed. Many things highlight this movie such as a diverse group of characters and personalities, a VERY strong cast, excellent acting by all cast members, and a plot that took my breath away. The moment I walked out of the movie theater I said to myself ""that one's gonna win Best Picture"" and it did. Enjoy this milestone of a film and remember it for years to come."

But yea its a great story with some great performances,similar to Crash really,but for an Oscar as best Pic don't you think it should be more than just a good story. Now i'm confusing myself,i suppose the purpose of this web site is too recommend a movie and avoid anyone watching the dross they produce nowadays ,so that in itself ,i will conclude that The Departed is a very well recommended movie which we enjoyed immensely.........but is it an Oscar winning. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Of course Jack Nicholson puts in another quirky performance that we expect of him and i am never disappointed with Jacks name in the credits.Martin Scorcesse once points fun in the direction of the criminal and organised crime,sometimes i think that it glamorises ,but hey its a movie.Thought the sex scene was a tad unnecessary,but no real overuse of bad language.great really enjoyed."

","lots of bodies, should be this films title. Scorsese is at his best doing movies where the villain is more fun than the main characters. Nicholson shines in this film. His glowing hallow around Nicholson makes moderate performances by the other actors playing mob guys look excellent. Tony Sirrico and Gandolfini (Sopranos) act as if they are mobsters, the guys in this film ""not so much"". In fact in a couple of scenes they looked bored in the background. Scorsese doesn't spend much time worrying about his background players and it shows. Many scenes where an extra actor could add something to the scene. They Bump On A Log. I believe it is an east coast acting theme that believes heroes, major characters, should only be the ones on camera. I did not like Snakes On A Plane however, the director had a moving grooving set, with lots to look at both foreground and background. I found Martin Sheen, Baldwin, and Wahlberg's performances trumped Damon's performance by a long shot. Di Caprio stole this movie. He was unrelenting, viciously psychopathic and yet tender at times. The best scene is in the porno theater when he is listening. He did not take the easy way out by just sitting there, no Di Caprio outdid both Nicholson and Damon in a scene where he's just sitting there. Wahlberg, plays his character, as a vicious jerk, which seems overplayed. However, Scorsese, plays the viewer for the fool when he, the unemployed cop, kills a rat in the end. Excellent film because Di Caprio, Sheen and Wahlberg tugged out Oscar Winning Performances from what can be played as a mobster movie. Nicholson was a perverted mobster which I felt did not do the character justice and Damon adequately weaselly did an OK job."

","In the film The Departed directed by Martin Scorsese audience viewers will get to experience an action packed film, filled with internal character turmoil, played by some of the best ""A"" list actors Hollywood has ever seen. The three main characters, Billy Costigan played by Leonardo Decaprio, Colin Sullivan played by Matt Damon, and Frank Costello played by Jack Nicholson are all facing a moral and ethical dilemma. Throughout the film the audience will see how each character contemplates doing what is morally right, or sticking to their alliances with other characters in the film. <br/><br/>In the opening scene of the movie we are shown how Colin's allegiance to Frank Costello, played by Jack Nicholson, is developed. Colin is a young child sitting isolated in a deli. Frank comes in to collect ""taxes"" from the deli owner. After causing a commotion with the deli owner, Frank makes the owner give young Colin milk and bread, because Frank knows that Colin does not have a good family life. Fast Forward into time and Colin is now working his way through the Boston Police Department to work as a mole for Frank Costello. Simultaneously as Colin is going through the ranks we are introduced to Billy who is working through the ranks for good intentions, to change the perception of his family's name. <br/><br/>The director, Martin Scorsese uses a variety of film techniques to portray the underlying mystery and suspense in the film. Scorsese uses a lot of low-key lighting to create an almost depressing atmosphere in most of the action scenes. The audience can almost predict when something bad is going to happen. Scorsese also uses high angle shots to diminish Billy's worth within the police department, while low angle shots are used to make Collin appear more respected. This style of directing can also be seen in Orson Wells film Citizen Kane. <br/><br/>The Departed is a film that all movie viewers will love, whether you're looking for a love story, an action flick, or a suspense thriller. Viewers will be on the edge of their seat from the start of the movie all the way up through the end of the movie. As the characters develop, and the plot thickens, viewers can't help but to hope that good will overcome evil."

","It goes without saying that this is another piece of Scorcese excellence, however I made the idiotic mistake of watching it when I was tired and probably should have been in bed. A big mistake - you'll want to watch this when you're totally focused and enthusiastic, otherwise you'll have trouble piecing it all together and following the plot. I won't go into the story on this one; instead I'll give rundown of the actors' performances - and this is something anybody considering watching this flick will want to know given the celebrated A-List cast assembled. I have never been a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio. (His performance in ""The Basketball Diaries"" was flawless. Other than that, he's been very ordinary). However, after watching ""The Departed"" I had to humble myself and admit that his delivery in this flick was nothing short of brilliant! He and Jack Nicholson carried this film, if no one else. And, in a way, this is a shame when you compare it to the other somewhat bland performances by the other cast. This is what upsets the movie and makes it seem disjointed, thus becoming a distracting factor in an otherwise brilliant film. Jack Nicholson doesn't seem to need to make any effort in his acting technique - he pulls it off each time. His performance is incredibly focused and well timed, with that trademark edge of demented deviance he brings to almost all his characters. I've ALWAYS been a Matt Damon fan. However - and I hate to admit it - but his performance here was almost wooden. I don't think it was a role he fully submitted to. Again, like a small handful of his other performances, he was playing 'Matt Damon'. You can detect a touch of self-consciousness in his delivery. However, this won't deter a lot of Damon's fans. Mark Wahlberg's arrogant cop was just passable, however I could see a touch of his 'Dirk Diggler' from ""Boogie Nights"" in the way he delivered his dialogue. In a documentary from the accompanying Special Features disc, he mentions that he was playing the type of cop who used to arrest him when he himself was a teen. And this seems to be precisely what he does: he imitates someone else, rather than putting his own interpretation on the role. A pity, since Wahlberg is actually a great actor. In a relatively small role, Alec Baldwin is actually outstanding. This might be the role which may reprise his career after all! Martin Sheen - do I need to comment? This guy is brilliant no matter what he does. A very focused performance.<br/><br/>All in all, this film is incredibly well done, in true Scorcese style. A few continuity errors and audio overdubs/lip-synch changes are present, however, once immersed in the entertainment, viewers will be happy to dismiss these. (Or, perhaps, those who know and expect perfection from Scorsese may be somewhat shocked by these minor, yet mildly distracting errors.) Still highly recommended to any Scorcese fan or fans of the cast. Definitely worth the two and a half hours.<br/><br/>SPOILER: A lot of the film's bung-ups have been mentioned already in full list, however one that I haven't yet seen is the audio overdub of Matt Damon's voice when he is asking his informants over the phone what fell off the building. His actually asks what fell off the 'roof', however the audio says, 'building'. The second time he asks the same question, both his mouth and audio deliver 'roof'."
"cliff-19","8","0","0","18 March 2007"," Another voice comparing the two
","I managed to see both ""Infernal Affairs"" (hereafter ""Mou gaan dou"") and ""The Departed"" in one sitting and would like to compare them. To start, I would give them the same rating (8) and praise them equally. But the strengths are uneven.<br/><br/>What follows is TOTAL SPOILER and meant only for others who have seen both.<br/><br/>* Religion In Mou gaan dou, the mob boss Sam is religious. He indirectly attributes his success to his faith and ties in the disciples through a ritual of loyalty. He rules by this ingrained sense of loyalty and is never portrayed as fearful. In Departed, mob boss Frank rules entirely through fear, violence and intimidation. He caps this off with utter contempt for the Church. Who would stay loyal to a guy like that?<br/><br/>* Class The Departed's greatest strength is in the in-depth analysis of the class conflict in New England's Irish community. References to ""lace-curtains"" and ""shanties"" is an allusion to long-standing symbolism of this conflict. This was a compelling introduction to the characters that Mou gaan dou left out, and went very far to explaining their motivations. <br/><br/>* Language The language in Mou gaan dou is richly oblique (""At least I am not afraid to let the sun shine on me"" says Yan toward the end.) and only occasionally rough. The language in Departed is relentlessly coarse and filled with coarse metaphors, puns and references. The language in each fits with the consistent tone of the acting. The two main spooks are cool in Mou gaan dou, and nearly hysterical in Departed.<br/><br/>* Overall The Departed's beginning was utterly brilliant, far outclassing Mou Gaan Dou. But the high level of violence in Departed wore thin on me. By the time of the big bust, I felt that Mou gaan dou leaped ahead in crafting a complex drama that was not just another shoot-em-up. The cat-and-mouse chase between the spooks was FAR more compelling in Mou gaan dou, and the last scene in Departed proved that not even Scorcese can avoid the demands to give 'em a happy ending."

My father was raised in working-class Boston, and his description of the collaboration between corrupt police and organized crime matches what is shown in this film.<br/><br/>Unlike the majority of American films, this is realistic.

My own time spent living in working-class neighborhoods of the old parts of NYC and Chicago shows this film has taking a boring scenario and spiced it up by showing the seamy background. This means understanding the complex dynamics of the denizens of countless neighborhood bars that function as restaurants and public meeting spaces.

","""The Departed"" is captivating movie-making. ""The Departed"" is not the year's Best Picture; although it seems destined for the Oscar gold. Director Martin Scorcese generates powerful and compelling performances from Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, and Jack Nicholson. Writer William Monahan's story is based on the screenplay for ""Infernal Affairs"" by Alan Mak and Felix Chong. ""The Departed"" starts off great and has a stunning Act 2. However, Act 3 is horrible in the sense that the movie suddenly turns stupid, and then desperately and unconvincingly ties up loose ends. I think Martin Scorcese wants to demonstrate that along with his preoccupation with the darker side of humanity, he also has a sense of cinematic justice. This is a feeble attempt at best.<br/><br/>The going in premise is an intriguing look into intertwined cultures from the perspective of cultural moles. Colin Sullivan is a smart sharp kid in Boston, virtually raised by Irish Mafia kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Colin (Matt Damon) becomes a Boston Police cadet and quickly rises through the ranks of the Boston Police Department. Sgt. Colin Sullivan remains beholding to Frank. Colin becomes a key player in a federal task force that infiltrates the Boston Irish Mafia. On the polar opposite, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a bright police cadet with questionable family ties which does not bode well for his career as a police officer. We witness Billy burying his dead mother. Billy's late father was a man of honor, an Airport worker who refused to join Frank Costello. Billy strikes a deal with Boston Police Capt. Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Detective Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) to go rogue undercover and disavowing any ties to the Department. Billy's job is to get in with Frank. Along the way Colin romances police staff psychiatrist Madolyn (Vera Farmiga). Farmiga has the thankless job of essentially portraying a plot device, as charming as she is.<br/><br/>The performances in ""The Departed"" are amazing. For that acknowledge Scorcese. Leonardo DiCaprio has grown into a powerful leading actorhe commands the screen. He is edgy and dangerous. It is puzzling that Matt Damon did not receive more acclaim for his role as insider Colin. Damon balances a slick soullessness and believable consuming desperation. Jack Nicholson as Frank displays unrecognizable restraint in a compelling performance. Ultimately, the script fails the movie. During an early scene in the movie Billy (DiCaprio) quotes Nathaniel Hawthorne. Detective Dignam (Wahlberg) makes the snide remark that he was expecting him to quote Shakespeare. Ironically, ""The Departed"" is not great tragedy. It is not Shakespeare. Unfortunately, it seemly intended to be so. This in itself is tragic, given the promise of the story's premise and the superb cast. My friend Chuck said that ""The Departed"" would have been great if it ended before devolving into senseless violence. His comment is brilliant and insightful. There is neither great catharsis nor any grand noble act in the end to redeem ""The Departed"". What we are left with is a harried mess. And that is truly a tragedy."

Bringing all of those well known actors together - Jack Nicholson, Leo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, and Mark Wahlberg - in one film, is the icing on the cake.

","Seriously Director Martin Scorsese finally delivers a mind blowing, crowd pleasing, genuine Hollywood heavyweight. And his long-time loyalists can't be more thankful. Credit begins with a brilliantly complex screenplay adapted from the 2002 Chinese film ""Infernal Affairs."" As Scorsese testifies, ""It was the first picture I made with a plot."" It seems like that is exactly what the people were waiting for, as the opening weekend gross of $26.8 million obliterated all other Scorsese releases. And regardless of its many shortcomings*, Marty certainly reassures us all that he is still the master of modern mortality with a riveting final half-hour of elegant and exciting violence that is right on par with the 'Baptism/Murder' crescendo in ""The Godfather Part I""-- when Michael Corleone finishes all of the family's unfinished business. With ""The Departed,"" it seems that Marty also finishes some business of his own.<br/><br/>*First, realize a few things: that this film takes place in a fantasized contemporary world, that Jack Nicholson can't help but act extremely ridiculous, and of course, that Marty Scorsese is a highly stylized director the musical selections, the over-lighting, the frequent and casual violence, and the excessive story exposition and once all of this is understood, or more importantly, accepted (asking too much?), then you can really begin to have fun with this movie.<br/><br/>Now, coping with Nicholson's absurd over-performance is probably an issue on to its own How much better might this movie have been had DeNiro played Frank Costello, rather than the attention starved Jumpin' Jack, who seemed like he was just horsing around until he got to the Lakers game later that night (i.e. playing with a dildo in a porno theater)? See Born Critic for more on that<br/><br/>http://borncritic.blogspot.com/2006/10/departed.html<br/><br/>On the other hand, the rest of the cast displays career acting performances, most notably Leo DiCaprio, who brings an amazing raw energy and intensity to his roles, balancing both the physical and psychological demands of his complex character, and was only beat out for a Best Actor nod by himself in ""Blood Diamond.""<br/><br/>http://manwithavan.blogspot.com/"

Yet Having the Legendary director with full star cast including Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg who could miss a movie like that?!!! I have to admit that I spent some of the finest 150+ Mins in my life watching this magnificent movie. <br/><br/>I have to be honest that I would never have thought that it would be half as good as it was. Me being a person who watched thousands of movies in my life there is a little room for surprises to me but I was SHOCKED.<br/><br/>This movie will be held in the movies hall of fame to be one of the wittiest , brilliantly acted and directed movies of all time. Not a single minute of boredom in over two and half hours of brilliance. This movie just cracked its way in my Top 10 List ever. There are no words that describe the script smoothness and slickness throughout the whole movie. Leornard Di Caprio have entered in a new dimension in his acting skills and now he is not the boy with pretty face , no this Guy can on par to the greatest actors alive now.

No need to mention Jack Nicholson because he is the master who never really misses , Alec Baldwin, Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg probably have done the roles of their lives.

Excellent camera control and flashbacks that really don't interrupt the movie flow but just gives you a glimpse of the background of every character. <br/><br/>If you don't like Scorsese or DiCaprio or any of the great film cast or you being offended by violence or profane language, I Still advise you to push yourself to watch this movie because it's like an experience which you will never forget. For the younger audience who haven't watched the Great movies like Godfather , Goodfellas , Pulp Fiction, etc.. you will probably believe that this is the Best Movie you have seen in your life. Go watch it, enjoy it, buy it on DVD, Tell your kids about it and pass it on to your grand children .

"jpschapira","8","0","0","29 January 2007"," The Question, Part 1
","Remember when I said ""Match Point"" moved fast? Well, ""The Departed"" moves faster; so much faster that the name of the film appears after the movie has begun developing the plot and it would have been the same if it appeared at anytime. Characters speak without pauses, throwing intelligent lines from time to time; the music is too loud and it never seems to stop. Every time I paid attention the loud music was in the back; as if the montage of the first scene was still running.<br/><br/>It's fine, but I was thinking about the beginning of ""Goodfellas"" and how much I loved the speech he gives; gentle and slowPaused. Here, Jack Nicholson gives a wonderful opening speech but it goes so fast that if you close your eyes you miss its essence. The same goes for some talks between Vera Farmiga and Leonardo DiCaprio and between Matt Damon and Alec Baldwin that lie between the best little scenes of the movie.<br/><br/>I didn't watch the original piece in which William Monahan based his script, but Monahan still doesn't convince me. There's a lack of seriousness to his work and he'll get an Oscar for it. However, when his ""Kingdom of Heaven"" was short of words, this screenplay has words to spare. I probably miss the days of ""Taxi Driver"", when Bob drove through the streets and there was no need for words to express his feelings.<br/><br/>Here we encounter the great Martin Scorsese in a rush, as his movie of course. The pictures of Scorsese I've watched made me understand he was a calm and observing director, with a lot of messages to give in each film and a lot of importance to give to the screenplay. ""The Departed"" doesn't instantly find messages, but the screenplay rushes; and Scorsese doesn't stay behind. With his ability, Marty followed his characters rapidly, moving constantly his camera; whether in a chase scene or in a chat inside of an office where the close ups are instantaneous and the frames show a character by the second. In addition, he still found the time of creating new and interesting filming shots that go along with the film's rhythm.<br/><br/>That ""The Departed"" is far from being Scorsese's best picture is a fact; but it's probably the best he's done this decade. And that's enough to get him an Oscar before he starts desperately trying for one and goes back to make films without a burden or a personal pressure; because he won't give up the crusade for an award he simply deserves.<br/><br/>As I said, a part of me wants the old Bob back, but as the years go by, Leo is kind of growing on me. I mean, he'll never be my favorite actor or anything similar; but his performance is the finest of ""The Departed"" cast. I look back at his retarded kid in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" and I think to myself that when DiCaprio isn't on the main focus (because it's where he's always been), he can hand in some great portrayals.<br/><br/>And what an ensemble! I mean, Scorsese can get big names that are among the biggest talents. Don't even mention Jack Nicholson, who's not in the run for the big awards because we are rewarded when we watch him on screen; it's his present to us. Mark Wahblberg, an actor I've always liked, could have gotten recognition for a couple of films where he outshined the leads some time ago; but is perfect here in a role that was definitely for an older person. If we say older persons we find the fabulous portrayal of Ray Winstone and two underrated performances of Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin (what a year he had). What was even more underrated was Matt Damon's incredible turn as Collin Sullivan, the second in line after DiCpario's performance in the movie and easily his best labor since ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"".<br/><br/>Is anyone sure if Vera Farmiga has nothing to do with the Arquette family? She looks a lot likeAnyway, she's a good actress. I refuse to talk about Anthony Anderson, but the question remains: ""Is 'The Departed' the Best Picture Oscar of the year?""."

","I just saw this movie earlier tonight and all I can say is: what a disappointment! I was expecting a Scorsese masterpiece, instead I get this crap! This movie is long, disjointed, and fails to capture the viewers attention. What does everybody see in this crap? It has the feel of a movie that was written by multiple people, edited to death by numerous individuals. Somehow they cant come up with a comprehensible story. Its a shame because this movie could have been real tight. Poor martin sheen is more like a confused grandfather figure than any sort of important police official. There are tons of things that happen throughout the movie that are never explained and make no sense. This is no Godfather... hell, it ain't even up the standard of carlitos way.

","The movie is good, but I am curious to know why the writers have to resort to so much bad language. Many great movies have been made without inundating the audience with senseless cursing every other word. In reality the ""F-bomb"" was dropped, on average, every thirty seconds. I would think that the ""writers"" could try to convey their message by using more powerful writing. It's too bad. I can't really recommend this movie because the foul language is the only thing thing that stuck in my head instead of a good story. It's no wonder people today speak in such a disrespectful manner.

"claudecat","2","0","0","26 January 2007"," some good performances, but full of problems
","I know no one is going to read this, but this move irritated me so much that I have to blow off steam.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to seeing this movie, but I was completely disappointed by the inadequate screenplay, the distracting casting, and Scorsese's weak choices. The story is full of holes. A very few examples: a big deal is made about a letter which is then forgotten, and characters do things that don't make sense (would you warn a known murderer that you're on to him, and then agree to meet him in a deserted warehouse? Why not just go to his superior with all your evidence?).<br/><br/>The character of Madolyn (why the bizarre spelling?) was completely frustrating. As usual for a big American film, there are dozens of featured male characters and only one woman (other than a few minor roles), so she has to serve as the love interest for both of the main actors. Yet nothing comes of this ""love triangle"", so why include it? Supposedly Madolyn was really happy with Colin, yet she has sex with Billy who, inexplicably, seems to know no other women. Rather than deepening my feelings about the characters, this situation just puzzled me, and made me think that Madolyn was a pretty bad psychologist. Actually, I got the impression Scorsese was hedging his bets with the Madolyn character--she adds so little to the plot that she could easily have been cut. <br/><br/>There are some good performances in the movie, particularly Jack Nicholson's and Martin Sheen's, but I felt that Scorsese cast people he likes and not necessarily actors who were right for the roles. Obviously, Mark Wahlberg's performance has its fans, but he didn't convince me at all as a foul-mouthed tough guy, with his baby-face and floppy hair. Leonardo DiCaprio did a good acting job, but he's too physically slight to be really believable as a gang strongarm. Martin Sheen was the only one who managed to disappear into his part. (Though I didn't believe for a second that a no-nonsense guy like Queenan, as Sheen played him, would have stood for all that lip from Dignam.)<br/><br/>There are some bits that really made me wonder about Scorsese's own beliefs. Both the gang characters and the police make sexist remarks, which they probably would in real life, but the women around them don't get any lines to respond, so the comments are left to stand. Scorsese seems to be on the side of Billy when he beats a guy senseless for saying that his drink is girly, as if that were the only appropriate response to such an insult. Possibly that's not what Scorsese meant at all--he may have just been trying to show how far Billy would go to play his assigned role--but what are we to make of the fact that an Asian man is accidentally killed in the course of the story, and then never mentioned again, as if the murder doesn't ""count""? Racism? Or did Scorsese forget about that, the way he forgot about the letter?<br/><br/>I've read a lot on IMDb about how much of the movie was lifted from ""Infernal Affairs"". I haven't seen that film, but I was appalled to see how Scorsese ripped off a famous scene in ""The Third Man"". (At the funeral.) He also apparently paid ""homage"" to Howard Hawks by stealing his use of ""X's"" from ""Scarface"". (I didn't notice that myself, but several people on IMDb have mentioned it.) I think someone needs to teach Scorsese the difference between affectionately referencing someone else's work, and just taking from it because you haven't thought of anything as good yourself. I'm really angry at him for making sure that now, whenever I see that powerful scene in ""The Third Man"", I'm going to think of a movie that I mainly disliked. And what was the deal with that ridiculous last shot of the rat? How could a supposedly great filmmaker give in to such an obvious, heavyhanded choice?<br/><br/>I think Scorsese has it in him to make a better film."

I knew it was going to at least be good. it wasn't good. it was possibly one of the best movies i've ever seen. that being said, if you can't stomach incredibly brutal violence, then don't watch it, because believe me, as much as i like a violent flick here and there, even i left the theater feeling like i had been hit with a baseball bat. <br/><br/>The story is very riveting with good twists, yet one doesn't have to pay attention to every minor detail and look for symbolism left and right to find out whats going on. DiCaprio's performance i thought was absolutely fantastic, hes definitely one of the best actors out there today. Whalberg is hilarious in his few scenes and of course does the ultimate justice in the end of the movie (watch and you'll know what i mean). The soundtrack fit the movie perfectly, from Gimme Shelter, through I'm Shipping Up to Boston, Nobody But Me, Thief's Theme, all the songs fit every scene perfectly.

"filmmakr03","10","0","0","26 January 2007"," Scorsese deserves an Oscar for this film
","Like most of us, when news comes from Hollywood that an American filmmaker is doing a remake of a foreign film, my stomach cringes at the fact (i.e. The Grudge, The Ring). However, imagine my sheer excitement when I learned that Martin Scorsese was attached to direct one of the best HK crime films I've seen: 'Infernal Affairs'. Usually, I'm not optimistic about a remake but I had to make an exception. Anyways, the film succeeds in matching up to the original, reminding me why idolize Scorsese in the first place. Scorsese, with the help of a solid and interesting screenplay by William Monahan (Kingdom of Heaven), crafts a story of deception and tragedy set in one of America's most celebrated but equally infamous cities. Casting is everything in a film and The Departed is no different. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one his best performances as Billy Costigan, the undercover cop sent to infiltrate Frank Costello's (Jack Nicholson) crime syndicate. I totally bought DiCaprio as the man who was trying to distance himself from his family's dark past. His struggle in leading a life of deception is very chaotic and thrilling. He deserved an Oscar nod for this role (I haven't seen Blood Diamond yet). Matt Damon, as he demonstrated in the Bourne films, showed a darker side as Colin Sullivan, Costello's rat in the Boston State Police. I sound a bit biased, but I think Damon should have gotten at least a Golden Glode nod for the film. Jack Nicholson is Jack Nicholson. His casting was key in the success of this film as he provided some of the most comical and sinister scenes of the film. It is a crying shame that this is the only film Nicholson has made with Scorsese so far. Alec Baldwin is great as Capt. Ellerby, even though he has very little screen time. However, the performance that caught me by surprise the most is that of Mark Wahlberg as Sgt. Dignam. He is very convincing as a no nonsense cop with a chip on his shoulders. His disdain for Damon's character is very genuine and it makes what transpires very chilling and justifiable. Overall, this film is at the top of my film list for 2006. If you haven't seen The Departed yet, please do. It is an unforgettable experience. Also, will the Academy please give Scorsese the Oscar come March?!?"
"whill4","10","0","0","26 January 2007"," Oscar nods
","How in the heck does Mark Wahlberg get a best supporting actor nomination and Di Caprio get nothing. The Oscars have truly become the least credible movie award, and yet they maintain their glamor. WHY???? Also why does it seem that an actor with two wonderful performances in one movie year only get one Oscar nomination?? How many times are actors and actresses get nominations for a performance that was only half as good as another performance in the same year? An example is Sean Penn winning best actor for Mystic River when his performance was much better in 21 grams. Anyway this is just my rant because I like Di Caprio and he deserves at least an nomination for his performance in this movie, especially since he was a supporting character. I guess the Oscars have a lot of trouble deciding who is the main character in a movie where there is no main character only supporting characters. It saddens me that the best performance 'I have seen' all year didn't even get a nomination."

","Martin Scorsese's remake of the Hong Kong thriller INFERNAL AFFAIRS (2002) is a thrilling return to form, a psychological gangster film whose diabolically convoluted premise follows two men living double lives, their manufactured identities sustained by a web of lies that simultaneously keeps them alive and strangles their souls. Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) and Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) grew up in the same tough South Boston neighborhood, each in the shadow of Irish mob boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson, only rarely lapsing into ""Here's Johnny!"" mannerisms). But while Costello took the orphaned Colin under his wing, schooling him in the ruthless, bottom-feeding code of the streets, Billy was sheltered from Costello's pervasive corrupting influence by his father, the one law-abiding member of a mobbed-up family. Both entered the Massachusetts State Police academy, and each enters an elite division of the force: Colin, the very image of a bright, incorruptible cop, joins the Special Investigations Unit, which is mandated to bring down Costello's empire by any means necessary. Colin ostensibly reports to Captain Ellerby (Alec Baldwin), but is in fact Costello's inside man, keeping his mentor apprised of every move the police make. While still a cadet, Billy is tapped by avuncular Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and foulmouthed Southie Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) to work in an ultra-secretive undercover division. Billy's chief qualification is his family's criminal history, particularly his late Uncle Jackie's close relationship with Costello; after Queenan and Dignam arrange his expulsion from the academy and a stint in jail, Billy is perfectly positioned to worm his way into Costello's organization and feed information to the police. The two moles soon become aware of each other's existence, but neither knows the other's identity or that they're connected by therapist Madolyn Madden (Vera Farmiga), who's dating Colin and counseling Billy as a condition of his parole. Hidden behind their masks and under ever-escalating pressure to root out the traitor within their respective organizations, Colin and Billy both begin to crumble. William Monahan's screenplay hews remarkably closely to Alan Mak and Felix Chong's convoluted original (though their names are buried in the end credits), but Scorsese makes it his own, from the vivid pop soundtrack to the seething paranoia and spasms of brutal violence. The cast is uniformly excellent, with Ray Winstone a standout as Mr. French, Costello's red right hand."

","The world is divided into two; those who believe Scorcese has been victimised and deliberately ignored in the Oscar stakes and those who think he's trying a little tooooo hard to worm his way into the Oscar Academy's graces. Okay, so TAXI DRIVER (9/10) could've won but it was also against NETWORK (9/10) and the eventual winner ROCKY (9/10). And who could forget the incredible KING OF COMEDY(10/10) with Bob De Niro playing the wanna be standup Rupert Pupkin with Jerry Lewis playing the straight man.<br/><br/>Yes, with his last two films, you watched them and go ""so what?"" GANGS(6/10) was almost camp in some of its violence with the cartoonish Daniel Day Lewis , while THE AVIATOR (6/10) made one look on in horror at Leo De caprio's miscasting. And made you wonder what the hell he saw in Leo apart from his pretty blue eyes? He's back. This is gangster opera. Ebbing and flowing through a sometimes complex film with more crosses( and double ones) than a Lourdes shrine. And put any TITANIC (6/10) misconceptions to rest; this film shows Leo can act. He plays an undercover cop, Billy Costigan, who goes so deep that he finds it hard to come back. An emotional tour de force, and force majeur. Makes me look forward to seeing BLOOD DIAMOND in the coming year.<br/><br/>The basic premise is of undercover infiltrations into the violent ganglands of Boston; not the first natural milieu for the genre you'd think of, in this most mayflower of cities. Jack Nicholson plays a crime boss who does it as much for the love of the game as for the profit it brings. Matt Damon is an ambitious cop with plans for the future which take him outside of the force. But his past won't free him and he knows it. An at times unbearably tense film, it gripped me throughout.<br/><br/>Great support by Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, alec Balwin, Ray Winstone and the not so insignifcant love interest Vera Farmiga.<br/><br/>And expect to see Marty up on the stage come February 25th, with his cheeks shining with tears and Jack in the front row, slow clapping him up with his trademarked grin."
"urian_alf","8","0","0","20 January 2007"," A rip-off of ""infernal Affairs"". An excellent movie nevertheless.
","""The Departed"" is a remake of a 2002 Chinese film entitled ""Infernal Affairs"". The main and almost only difference is the exceptional heavy-weight Hollywood cast that has been thrown into Scorsese's version. DiCaprio's performance is excellent (as always), but Matt Damon's somehow falls short of his usual standard. The character played by Nicholson has a bigger and more eccentric role in this version as compared to the Chinese version, which does not come as a surprise considering that it is Jack doing his thing in his own way. Nevertheless, this time Nicholson does not steal the film like he's done in previous times. Considering all the big names in the cast, and if I could go back in time and change something about this film, it would be the choice of Damon as the mole in the police dept. I think that role required either a different approach or an actor with more personality so that the public could identify more with the character, like in the case of DiCaprio's. After all, the whole point of the movie is the tension created by the possibility that either one of those two characters is going to be caught. The film is excellent but I can't give more than 8 out of 10 to it considering that in some scenes it is a frame-by-frame rip-off of ""Infernal Affairs"". If you can watch any of the two versions at any given time, I would recommend to watch the original version first because In my opinion it comes across as the most honest of the two."

","Scorsese is one of my favorite directors, at least he has certainly made a few of my favorite movies. And seeing how he keeps the quality of his work so constantly high is astonishing. And not only that, i would rate this as his finest movie this decade. While i did enjoy ""Gangs of New York"" and ""The Aviator"" (both are fine movies in my opinion) this is still a lot closer to the masterpieces of Scorseses previous career.<br/><br/>I have always considered the American way of taking foreign movies and making a new version rather silly. I don't know whether they do it because they can't stand reading subtitles or if there are other reasons. Generally the new versions are also inferior which makes it an even less understandable practice. Here though we have the opposite. While i feel that ""Infernal Affairs"" is certainly an interesting movie, and a quality film to boot, i still feel that ""The Departed"" is a vast improvement.<br/><br/>What i was perhaps most impressed by when i watched this movie was the way that Scorsese brought the best out of the entire ensemble. Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Wahlberg are far from my favorite actors but they are all as good as i have seen them here. Damon usually has something stiff and almost detached about him that i don't like, but here he seems a lot more relaxed and really flows into his character. Jack Nicholson on the other hand is one of my favorites, and he is absolutely magnificent in ""The Departed"". He makes one of those appearances where he just dominates every scene that he's in, and unlike many other great actors who have been in the game for a long time, he never seems to relax and turn on the autopilot.<br/><br/>Of course in a thriller the story has to be interesting too, a great ensemble is not enough. And i think that ""The Departed"" delivers there as well. While it is perhaps maybe 20 minutes longer than i would have liked, it never becomes painfully so. A few twists along the way are also bound to keep most people guessing.<br/><br/>After watching ""Gangs of New York"" and ""The Aviator"" i felt afraid that Scorsese might never reach the peaks of his earlier career, and therefore would never receive the Oscar that should have been his a long time ago. But ""The Departed"" gives me hope since this is yet another memorable and simply great movie. Very recommended! 8/10."

The acting was incredible all around from main to minor roles. The screenplay was excellent. The plot was very dynamic. After reading several reviews, I was unsure why many comments compared the movie to Internal Affairs. In Internal Affairs, Garcia's character knew the entire movie that Richard Gere was the crooked cop. In this movie, DiCaprio had no idea who the was the crooked cop. The movie seemed to me more like Donny Brosco. DiCaprio's character experienced the same anxiety as Johnny Depp, both as undercover police officers inside the mob. The different angle for Departed, was that the mafia had an inside man penetrating the police.<br/><br/>Half way through the movie I thought to myself that was one of the best movies I have ever seen. Then everyone in the end got shot in the head...in succession. It became so ridiculous during the elevator scene, laughter rang out through out the theater, and my wife shouted, ""This is stupid."" There could have been several better endings, either the ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"" winning. Such as Damon killing DiCaprio, and then Wahlburg finding the tape recordings on his desk. Something to leave you thinking, rather than the simple ending: kill everyone.<br/><br/>Despite the ending, a wonderful movie worth watching at least twice.

","Most people are like myself and when they hear of Hollywood remaking another masterpiece from the other side of the globe they will shudder and feel that it can be disrespectful to the original source. Not in the case of Marin Scorsese's The Departed, where he's back on form with what will no doubt be the best film by the end of 2006. When you hear that a master like Scorsese is going to direct a film like The Departed you suddenly get overwhelmed with the knowledge that you know it will be something special. The Departed is based on an Asian cop Vs criminal film named Infernal Affairs that since 2002 has managed to spawn 2 sequels and now the remake The Departed.<br/><br/>When a director like Scorsese gets on a project like The Departed you know that you're in for a treat and with its wonderful cast you're going to be hard done not be impressed. There is a certain responsibility The Departed has and that's the fact it has to be respectful to Infernal Affairs and no steal the film's original premise. It has to keep the original story, but remember to make it individual and unique. So The Departed pays respect to Infernal Affairs while adding the needed significant changes and that's where The Departed succeeds.<br/><br/>Whether you hate remakes or not all goes out the window because the film becomes a unique piece of work that only Scorsese could have done. Many other directors would have felt inclined to stay close to the tight knitted story, but Scorsese adds many changes and development so that he can make the work his own.<br/><br/>My favourite aspect of the film is the intense proportion of skill in the acting from the entire cast of greats. The acting is the most dominant part of the film and you become so absorbed by the characters that you'll forget about the film's two and a half hour running time. Every single actor and actress has a personality and a certain technique to their character which helps you come to understand them better. The enhanced range of styles and wonderful capabilities everyone shows just how much time and effort was put into the film. The cast includes the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio who's performance is in fact the best of his career and also the best the performance the film has to offer, he truly succeeds at holding the film together. You've also got other excellent performances from Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen and the gritty performance from Ray Winstone.<br/><br/>Mixing crime and drama perfectly the film sets out to be a modern masterpiece of the cop Vs criminal genre. The technique used to tell the story is brilliant and smoothly paced; it's a distinctive style that has a trademark stamped all over it. The original soundtrack is one that perfect suits the scenes it accompanies and the stark direction captures the crime perfectly. There are many powerful moments to accompany the film and it is at times quite heartfelt. From start to finish you become gripped to the intelligent and intense plot line. There's also a psychological element to the film and moral subtext to the characters, which is terrific.<br/><br/>In the end The Departed does become a better film than Infernal Affairs and this owed to the original otherwise The Departed would have been a lost case. One of the best films of the last few years, a must see for anybody interested in film and for the sheer entertainment value this film has to offer."

The thing with Scorscese is you give him any story and he will direct it in a way that it appeals and leaves an impression. Even weak storyline(""Gangs of Newyork"") are turned into directional masterpieces. This one however does have a potent script, and the acting by all the players is definitely good. I have always believed in giving credit to the director for Good or Bad acting. He is the captain of the ship and can work his crew around guidelines he so wishes. I am pretty confident he can even make Tom Cruise act better, and if you can do that, you're good... and Martin Scorscese definitely is. The departed is A Must See !!"

","There is no doubt that Martin Scorsese's instant classic mobster flick ""The Departed"" has not been left for dead. Not only has it received lauded critical success, but it also has been a box office monster. OK, I am going to rat and tell you what the film is all about. Leonardo Dicaprio stars as Billy Costigan, a novice cop who goes undercover and poses as a henchman to Boston Mafia Guru Frank Costello played by an unknown actor named Jack Nicholson. Kidding! I was just Jacking you off! Eventually, these 'Costo"" brothers' pseudo-relation will cost them a great deal and not much is saved. Dicaprio continues to demonstrate that he is a true aviator in the world of acting and that his pretty face is not always in the clouds. He was impressive as Costigan, his character is likable and made you want to advise him ""Billy, Don't Be A Hero"" so his life will not be endangered. What can you say about Jack? Nicholson's Costello routine was wicked, wily, and wonderful. Ummmmm I smell a rat! That would have to be Matt Damon who was astounding as police rat Colin Sullivan. Damon was a little damon in this part , but the talented Mr. Damon has effectively played wicked before. I also dirkly digged Mark Wahlberg's performance as the callous Sgt. Dignam. I guess you can't take the dig out of Wahlberg's movie characters. All the aforementioned are worthy of Oscar noms. Acting vets Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, and Ray Winstone also gave ""The Departed"" a will to incorporate an outstanding acting ensemble. The only character which I thought was lifeless in ""The Departed"" was Madolyn (played by Vera Farmiga), the lone principal female character of the film bared no momentous contribution. Before I depart, I must mention that the iconic Marty Scorsese makes a triumphant return to the genre which made him a film director legend. Hopefully for his sake, he will not also be classified as a Susan Lucci legend by losing out on another Best Director Oscar. His nom is in the bag already. OK, I am departing now but don't you depart from ratting on to ""The Departed"". ***** Excellent"

If this isn't nominated for best picture, best actor, director, etc, I will never put any stock into what is an Oscar-winning *anything* again.

","Just simply brilliant, looking at the quotes just cracks me up again. The acting was great. Scorscese just seems to get the best out of actors. good to see J.N. back in a bad guy part. Dicaprio was great too. Even though he's a pretty-boy, he's way talented. I really grew to hate Damon through out the movie, so he did a good job i reckon :p. Even Walberg managed to make me laugh. especially when talking to Baldwin about his wife and mom, ha ha. The cast was just great, and all performed at their best. Love it, just loved it. Length of the movie was pretty good, shouldn't have been longer. 'ne thing i didn't really get was the importance of the therapist chick. And why they didn't pick someone else for it. But besides that, it was all good."
"ameh1","8","0","0","13 November 2006"," A Belated Response - Moral Ambiguity
","The Departed, is one of the better movies I have seen by Martin Scorcece, with Leonardo DiCaprio as a replacement for Robert De Niro, and with Jack Nicholson at his evil best, when you watch him on screen you realize that acting for him seems the most natural thing to do, nothing seems too difficult, everything comes easily, although it would interesting to see if he is able to play characters that are simple and straightforward, instead of people who seem to keep the company of the devil.<br/><br/>The movie is slow and methodical, where characters talk to each other and the story is allowed to develop for audiences to absorb and understand. But judgment is still out on Leonardo, he seems to express emotion and has screen presence, however this role does not have much range, it is limited in its scope, so one cannot really get an idea of his abilities, I maybe wrong for I have not seen some of his earlier movies. But I do not think he is the heir apparent, yet, to a Robert De Niro or an Al Pacino. I did find the female lead Vera Farmiga, fascinating, her performance was very good, and the relationship that develops between Madolyn and Billy Costigan, has a lot of chemistry and charisma, it is unfortunate that the director decided to leave it unresolved or to explain what happened to Madolyn, it would have been interesting. I did find Matt Damon's performance interesting, although a little wooden, because he is unable to express conflict very well.<br/><br/>As the movie reaches its final dramatic conclusions and resolutions, one is left with a feeling of incompleteness and irresolution and so one leaves the theater with a sense of Moral Ambiguity and a lot of unanswered questions. Although this is a pretty accurate depictions of the real world, with its sense of chaos, greed, corruption and violence, where the question is not one of good or bad or right or wrong, but one where an individual is measured in degrees of immorality. <br/><br/>One always hopes however, that in the world of fiction, we get to see our Moral and Ethical Dilemmas resolved with a clear distinction made between good and evil, right and wrong. At least that is why many of us in the Audience flock the theaters, although in much less numbers than before. Hoping to catch a glimpse of our hero's fight the forces of evil, with all their might and the advances in technology, sometime single handily but often with trusted Sancho at their side, triumphing in the end, and sometimes winning the heart of the most beautiful woman of them all and some of us in the Audience. But Art or what's left of it, demands that we stay true to life and to the story as conceived of by its creators.<br/><br/>Although our director does make significant and subtle attempts to take a moral stand, even our arch enemy, by the end begins to show hints of a conflict, a softening of the soul in his relationship with Billy, or in expressing compassion for the fate of the Frank Costello's lady friend. On the other hand, by the end, the director is unable to suppress his fascination with the Mechanical and Technical aspects of the enactment of the Violent Cinematic Death Scene, although Brutally Honest and Tragic, with a Visual Sense of Appeal, it seems empty and hollow if it somehow becomes disassociated with the story, as certain important or meaningful characters seem to disappear and one is left with a sense of loss at their sudden end or disappearance."

"zsept","10","0","0","12 November 2006"," Martin Scorsese meets Guy Ritchie and Boondock Saints ... spectacular!
","Wow ... first off ... wow. I just got home from seeing this film not an hour ago and still I'm struggling to describe this movie with words more descriptive than ... wow. I'd first like to point out that I'm not a Scorsese fanatic who will instantly love anything he puts on the screen (as I am with some directors) I've seen only two of his films the Aviator which I liked and Gangs of New York which I did not. I'm also not a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio however I don't mind him when hes working under a good director.<br/><br/>My first thoughts after seeing this film were ""its the great film-making of Martin Scorsese with a complicated twist laden plot line of Guy Ritchie (Snatch and Lock stock and two Smoking Barrels) set in the backdrop of Boondock Saints and Goodwill Hunting (Boston)"". This movie although very unapologetically violent is, funny (something I was not at all expecting) the dialog as well as the situations are so funny that many times in the theatre I was hysteric with laughter, very loudly and in the theatre I might add and I was not the only one its not very often that an audience in a theatre is so captured by a film that you can hear its collective uninhibited reactions to every funny line or plot twist but that was the case with this film.<br/><br/>The story itself is brilliant very very interesting. The Massachusetts State Police and the Irish mob both have moles deep in the other organization and let the mole hunts begin! The two sides are a negative and positive for one another and the mirroring and reflection that goes on between them is phenomenal.<br/><br/>The acting was superb everyone was excellent the great cast of this film performed to its full potential. My favorites Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, and Martin Sheen were all at their best Matt Damon in particular was outstanding. Even Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin who I'm usually relatively indifferent to gave wonderful performances and yes even Leonardo DiCaprio was extremely good.<br/><br/>The music (something I notice very much in films) was exceptional there was music playing nearly the entire film and created the perfect atmosphere for every moment of the film. The piece that was most notable for me was ""I'm shipping up to Boston"" by the Dropkick Murphies. Ever since I've listened to them I've thought I would love to see them used in a film and with the exception of Boondock Saints this is the perfect film for them.<br/><br/>A warning to some as I mentioned before this film is unapologetically very violent and certainly requires one to have a stomach for that sort of thing.<br/><br/>All in all this is an extraordinary film I haven't been this excited about a film since I saw Munich several weeks ago. Enjoy!"
"bloodandiron","7","0","0","11 November 2006"," Whether you think Infernal affairs or the Departed was better depends on which you watched first, and whether you are fluent in the languages.
","I watched Infernal Affairs when it came out. I thought it was a really good movie, with an original plot, and great actors. I watched the Departed a few days ago. I think to appreciate each film, despite some people saying that the language barrier doesn't matter, I think its a major component. Some people applaud The Departed in that Scorcese portrays the American setting really well. Well I can't appreciate that because I'm not from there.<br/><br/>ALSO a big part of appreciating the movie is letting the plot unfold without knowing what will happen. I watched Infernal Affairs first, so naturally when I saw a lot of the plot and even minor details copied from the original, it raised an eyebrow and hindered the flow of the movie. A lot of things, like the plastered arm and envelope with the crossed out spelling.<br/><br/>Another thing I like in Infernal Affairs over The Departed is that it has more contrast in emotion. There are moments of comic relief by the ""Sor Keung"" character, and, for example, DiCaprio's character in Infernal Affairs isn't yelling and punching people the whole time. The Departed has a bit too much violence and swearing to my liking, even if that is an accurate portrayal of what people were in that setting.<br/><br/>To be honest, the biggest determining factors in people's preference of the movie is which you watched first, and which language you are more comfortable with. I watched Infernal Affairs first, and though I'm fluent in both English and Cantonese, I appreciate the cultural background of the Hong Kong version more. All in all, I can't really judge which movie is better than the other because I'll probably be biased, but I certainly enjoyed watching Infernal Affairs more."

"Mxzplk","Null","0","0","10 November 2006"," The ExceptionalFellas: finally the Scorcese/DiCaprio partnership lives up to all expectations
","When the fellowship between Scorcese and DiCaprio seemed to be on way to confirm it as a shot on water, here they come up with The Departed. Gone are the unsuccessful historical themes of Gangs of New York and The Aviator, in which the director seemed so comfortable as a crasher in a party, and comes back the universe of organized crime, that he dominates perfectly; vanishes the catalysts leads, and brings up the original and more balanced division of forces between the characters; above all, there isn't here that desperate need for approval - of the Academy, his pairs, of the industry and the public - that were present in his two previous projects with his favourite actor. Scorcese is back to his comfort zone. Which, in his case, means the return to the extreme emotions and the cinema of high combustion of Goodfellas and Casino, that until this new enterprise were considered the last big moments of his curriculum.<br/><br/>Adapted such and which of Infernal Affairs, a Hong Kong crime movie, The Departed treats on the opposing trajectories, but symmetrical, of Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon). Both have family connections with the Boston Irish mafia, and both distinguish themselves as cadets in the police academy. Colin, however, is there by orders of Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), the godfather of the local banditry, with the purpose of making a career in the law and therefore facilitate the business of his organization. Billy, whose father apparently was the only honest man in the family, is recruited for the inverse task: commit a crime, get kicked out of the police force and forge his passage to the other side of the balcony, captivating next to Costello. For his protection, only two of his superiors, interpreted by Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg, know his true identity. And, the more the two plans, Billy's and Colin's, uncurl themselves, the clearer it gets to both organizations (the criminal and the police) that they have a rat in the house - and the more it intensifies the hunt for them.<br/><br/>As an example of another icon of the new yorker cinema, Woody Allen, which in Match Point gained new breath when transposing his habitual themes to London, Scorcese appears rejuvenated in this change to Boston. In contrary to Allen, however, that went to film in England because it was there that the money for it came from, the unexpected decision of Scorcese served to at least one good practical reason. A plot such as of The Departed would stumble on innumerable logical obstacles if taken place into the rigid hierarchy of the Italian families of the New York mafia. Now the style more, let's say, personalized - and, therefore, highly inflammable - of the irishans of Boston fits perfectly to this story of two voluble agents, that act based on improvisation and in the shortest elapsed time of action and reaction, with no information to map beforehand a path to walk on. Billy and Collin are thus, more then anything, actors, and their different dramatic styles - calculated and good-tempered in the case of Collin, that is climbing up in meteoric speed in politics, defensive and reactive in the case of Billy, the dude that joined the gang last - are the keypoints of the film.<br/><br/>Another indication that Scorcese appears to be back to his good times is this: the way that the characters exists here in full form, and not as counterfeits as in Gangs of New York. The dialogues of The Departed are torrents of obscenities and insults - but torrents meticulously modulated according to the temper of the person that pronounces them, specially brilliant in the case of Mark Wahlberg (no, this is not a typo). In other times, Scorcese would have chosen other heavy metal actors used to impose themselves by their weight in the scenes, such as his old favourites Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci. Here, starting with Jack Nicholson, first time with the director, all the cast is lighter and agile - and in all of it, from one point to the other, the interpretations are exceptional. Even so, there is no doubt that this is a Leonardo DiCaprio movie. Apathic in Gangs of New York and dislocated in The Aviator, he here reencounters his plummet (and, no less important, his ability to involve the audience) in a role much harder then the previous two. His Billy Conaghan is burdened by simultaneous wishes of survival and self-destruction, and by fantasies of failure and victory in impossible circumstances. And is, above all, very young and very lonely, in what finally appears to be a good use of the personal repertory of the actor."

","This is a really, really good story. I urge women who really don't like violent movies, but whose guys do, to go for this one. The story is outstanding with more twists and turns than a cut snake. The actors are all excellent. Even the small roles are attention grabbing. Mark Walberg, that guy just gets better with every film he makes. This is a mature role, and he plays it to the hilt. Matt Damon, too nice, too cute, and never looking older than 22, finally ages a bit, and almost plays a nasty, the twist being that he got the role within a role because he is a nice guy, too complicated. Leo DeC gets a role worthy of his talents, Let's hope it teaches him to stamp on his agents' toes when they offer him romantic leads. The only woman is unknown and totally real. The whole thing is just mesmerizing for what? 2, nearly 3 hours. Scorsese on top of his form. Da guy is a genius or what? See the Chinese version.

","After several years of toiling away in good (but not great) historical dramas and biopics, it's fantastic to see Scorcese return to his roots with this gritty, tough, tense gangster flick.<br/><br/>And it's almost as if he never left. ""The Departed"" is a textbook example of how to craft a practically flawless thriller - these guys set the scene early on, and keep ratcheting the tension tighter and tighter, all the way till the end.<br/><br/>Scorcese is at the top of his game - his sure-footed direction of his actors and beautifully operatic staging work wonders within the cops-and-mobsters world of the Boston underground.<br/><br/>Marty's got good source material here as well. Monahan's script is easily a front-runner for the Oscars this year. His characters are complicated, conflicted, and utterly fascinating. ""The Departed"" has more twists than a Russian contortionist, and Monahan will keep you guessing, right up until the final minutes of the film.<br/><br/>The cast is nothing short of brilliant as well - leads DiCaprio and Damon hit career-high notes in varied but intense performances, and the supporting cast of Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen all take to their characters with relish. And that's saying nothing of the sheer joy that the audience gets watching Jack Nicholson really, really let himself go. Which is saying something.<br/><br/>Fast-paced, bloody, tough and demanding, ""The Departed"" will grab you by the throat and keep squeezing until the credits."

","I was eager to see how the Americans would remake Infernal Affairs. Based on other American remakes of Asian films, however, my hopes were not high. Even so, I was hoping that I might be pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>I was wrong. Almost everything about The Departed was a direct copy of Infernal Affairs. The plot, which although more drawn out, was pretty much identical. They even stole bits from the original script. Now, this wouldn't be so bad if they'd acknowledged and paid respect to their source, but they had said that this was not a remake of Infernal Affairs, rather, they merely took inspiration from the Hong Kong thriller. Furthermore, none of Martin Scorcese, Jack Nicholson or William Monahan (the screenwriter) had even seen the original. Is it laziness or arrogance? Knowing Hollywood, it's probably both.<br/><br/>The film, being a carbon copy of Infernal Affairs, adds pretty much nothing to the original film, but somehow manages to take away instead. The violence often moves to the forefront of the drama and subtracts from the character development. Furthermore, it appears that the ending to this is some kind of hybrid of the original and alternative ending to Infernal Affairs, which unfortunately, negates the whole point of the film.<br/><br/>The stupid love triangle involving Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio and Vera Farmiga is pointless and typical Hollywood nonsense that does not add to the tension like it was probably supposed to.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the acting on the whole is good. Jack Nicholson is outstanding as the mob boss (a marked improvement on the original, in fact). Matt Damon shines as a mob mole placed inside the police department. His character has also been changed slightly (one of the very few differences between this and the original) and Damon does well to make it work. Leonardo DiCaprio is competent, which is more than can be said about his usual performances, but seems miscast and is outclassed by Tony Leung in Infernal Affairs.<br/><br/>On its own, The Departed is not a bad film. Unfortunately, it was preceded by a much better version of the same story, upon which The Departed stubbornly refuses to acknowledge its dependence. All this leads me to summarise this film in three words: Watch Infernal Affairs."

Therefore I will just focus on the part that I have different comments with most other people. <br/><br/>Yes I have seen the original before, and I might be a little bit biased here, but for me everything is nicely done in this movie except the ending. Of course there are different styles for directors, so some scenes might be more effective than the original, some might not. But I found the ending for The Departed especially lacks of depth. Where I am not just simply comparing the ending with the original. I am just commenting on the ending of The Departed by itself.<br/><br/>Seriously, the ending feels like a comedy, it kind of ruined everything that this movie has tried to development in the first 2 hours. It feels like ""okay the movie has to end now so let's just blow everybody's heads off"". <br/><br/>When people began to get shot in the head near the end, most people in the theater began to laugh out really really badly. It is just too sudden and has no emotion. Bang! Bang! Bang!, okay now they are all dead and we don't really care. The only sentence I wanted to say to my friend when I was walking out of the theater was the sentence that they have abused during the entire movie: ""what the xxxx"".<br/><br/>In conclusion, I think The Departed is a great movie before it reaches the end. The ending really has disappointed me a lot, and that's why I only give it 5/10."
"johnwstiles","Null","0","0","8 November 2006"," life is brutish and short and we should be grateful for any illusion of peace we can muster
","Martin Scorsese is a brilliant filmmaker and all his films are must sees. When he's plumbing the depths of his bad guy obsession his films can be simultaneously riveting and repulsive. The Departed qualifies on all counts, must see, riveting and repulsive. DiCaprio is Scorsese's new DeNiro and he is the centerpiece of the latest Scorsese descent into death. Cormac McCarthy says any writer unwilling to deal with death isn't serious. If this is so then McCarthy is as serious as any writer has ever been. His latest, The Road, deals with nearly everyone's death in a post-apocalyptic world of cannibalism and ash. Not far removed from McCarthy's world of dead people is Scorsese's world of people fixing to be dead. No happy endings (no surprise), awful lot of brains blown out, and an awesome display of acting from DiCaprio. You have to wonder where the anguish and anger he shows us in his interview with Wahlberg and Sheen come from. Watching Vera Farmiga as police shrink watch her boyfriend Matt Damon talk to Nicholson on his cell made us want to see much more of her.<br/><br/>Scorsese seems to have a visceral hatred of snitches. Rats abound in The Departed and we have trouble telling the difference between the good and bad guys at first. They all end up bad guys by the time all the blood is let. Scorsese works hard to make us sympathize with DiCaprio's character and if we can see past the anger and beatings administered by him we do care more for him than anyone. I couldn't tell if Nicholson's charm was innate or Scorsese's manipulation but we shouldn't like the head bad guy, right? Even when he does his rat impersonation? Right? Maybe Martin is talking to us about honor, about being true, about the damnation visited upon the liar. Or maybe he's just saying the world is an ugly and violent place, life is brutish and short and we should be grateful for any illusion of peace we can muster."

After Wahlberg takes a leave of absence, and pretty much everyone but Damon is still alive, I felt they spent a little too much time setting up the final kill. As soon as Damon was alone in his hallway, and the old lady jerked her dog away !! rotfl, I don't know who couldn't have seen it coming. I just wanted some answers from the OTHER RAT that saves Damon from DiCaprio in the elevator! Where did he come from? And that raises the question, who did Wahlberg actually work for? I think the ending fit the style of the movie, being mysterious the whole way through.

","This film rollicked right along with decent acting and an intriguing plot and then, all of a sudden, it ended with a series of abrupt murders hastily filmed as if Scorsese's backers had tapped him on the shoulder and said ""you're over budget fella, wrap it up, now."" Clever, imaginative, striking, interesting - not this movie's ending.<br/><br/>But major kudos to DiCaprio for an acting tour de force - his was a splendidly executed portrait of bottled dynamite with a conscience. I was sorry Scorsese's budget clipped the role short, along with all the other characters heaved unceremoniously into the morgue's dumpster as the quickest, dirtiest, cheapest way to tie up all the story's threads.<br/><br/>Much more satisfying in this genre of ""mole tasked to find the mole"" is Kenneth Fearing's ""The Big Clock."" Now THERE'S an imaginative tale, well told, and without a big pile of corpses at the end.<br/><br/>Mentioned countless times already, but here're my two cents to help bring the total in the jar to serious money: FAR too much gratuitous obscenity larded dialogue - it's WHAT'S said that gives dialogue its punch, not how many times the F word can get shoehorned in between the preposition and the period."

","Everybody with any interest in movies, must see this masterpiece of Martin Scorsese. From the beginning to the end this movie shows nothing but quality and perfection. The story is absolutely great and all the actors show their A-game. This movie will be remembered by anybody giving time to watch it, and you should. It is a breakthrough in movie history. Every second in this movie is exciting and the acting is mindblowing, Leonardo DiCaprio deserves an Award for his performance. He shows that he can play any role, and he does it to perfection. If you haven't seen this movie, you better do it, you will be disappointed if you don't."

","Wow! Best Film this year. Scorsese has matched a terrific cast and a great story and pieced together a masterpiece. In the deluge of mush touring American theaters in 2006 appeared this diamond. Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio are outstanding in the leading roles. The best performance of their careers. Jack Nicholson should win the Oscar for his role as an Irish godfather. The supporting cast of Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone and Mark Wahlberg were excellent. Vera Farmiga is terrific as a psychiatrist torn between the ""nice guy"" and the ""bad boy"". Be warned, like any Scorsese film, violence is explicit and disturbing."

","Simply the best movie I have seen in the last 5 years<br/><br/>If Mr Scorsese does not get an Oscar for this, then there must definitely be a conspiracy going on in Tinseltown, also Leo DiCaprio should get one for best Actor and Jack for best supporting actor.<br/><br/>I think the special effects were stunning too, the sound of the Pistol going off next to the lift at the end sounded real. <br/><br/>This is about the best I have seen Leo perform in a Movie, I didn't know he had that much talent, However one downfall for me was the interplay and banter between Alec Baldwin and Marky Mark at the beginning, I thought it was over the top.<br/><br/>This does not in any way detract from the overall quality of the movie its the quickest 2 and a half hours I have ever spent watching a movie."
"Syrchek","8","0","0","7 November 2006"," It really deserves a spot among the best crime flicks.
","I heard this film is allegedly a remake of a Hong Kong film called Mou gaan dou, which I sadly haven't seen before this one. That fact takes off a lot of the originality that The Departed would have poses if it hadn't been a remake. So I'll try to take that in consideration. But since it's a Scorsese flick I spent a little more time comparing it to his (still) better crime-drama, Goodfellas. In my opinion, just because of the pure chronology, considering that Goodfellas was made about sixteen years before The Departed, that alone makes it a more original piece of the crime world.<br/><br/>Let's face it. The crime genre is by now a pretty well investigated universe. I'm not thinking just about films, but tens of TV series as well. So in sense of originality, The Departed does come a little short. However, the cast, the performances and the entire realization of the project are quite a different story.<br/><br/>These are probably DiCaprio's and Damon's toughest roles yet. I've read one review of the film in the papers so far, and the critic described them as 'eternal boys', that just couldn't fully pull it off. But I think he was wrong, because the film doesn't rely that much on their brutality. Instead we really get a view into an intense struggle on two opposite fronts. I think most of the beauty of the film lies within Costigan's and Sullivan's insecurity and unawareness of who's who in this game. It kind of feels like good old fashioned voyeurism, since we are the ones that see it all from a bird's-eye view. And along with the story, the characters just get more and more corrupt.<br/><br/>I would say that this one does deserve a good spot on the chart of best crime films in recent years. The only problem I see in it is that it doesn't appear to be that quite fresh. Like I've said the crime genre is already very well worked and tested. But if you take all the attributes into account I think it's very worthy to spend two and a half hours of time on it.<br/><br/>........ +4/5 ........"
"gjdenooij","4","0","0","7 November 2006"," It is a record of the f-word abuse
","OK not really a record, but it looks at a good attempt. Words cannot describe this movie, I absolutely hated it. first of all because it is so vulgar, understand me well, I do not care if you use the F word or similar, like: ""what the F-word do you think you are doing"" or ""die F-word die"". But in every sentence it becomes unrealistic and very irritating. Lets say a conversation like: Hey extended F-word What the F-word do you think you are F-word doing? Shut the F-word up Cs I will F-word do What I F-word Like. Let's say in anger or fear you use terms of abuse, this adds to the realism of a movie, if you use them in every sentence you are just looking for an excuse to use them. Get My point? If you do not care or even like this in a movie, fare enough I suggest you watch it you will have the time of you're life. But in reality no one communicates with each other in this way certainly not police officers, Not that I ever have been to the US, but in Europe this is certainly not the case. I can only hope they respect each other as much in the US. But besides these vulgarities the movie has many shortcomings in my book. In the first hour the storyline was swift, that is in a bad way. At one time you are at the this point and suddenly somewhere else and then again somewhere else. The scenes do not connect well. There is a lack of storyline in the beginning which makes it strange to watch, as if you are watching different movies of 2 minutes. My guess is the movie was too long and was edited in a bad way too make it shorter. Besides 2 actors look too much alike, some people might have trouble keeping them apart in the beginning. The movie however does become a little better in the end, too late to save this movie, but still better than nothing. I actually started to feel some tension, but them came the many twists at the end, as if they wanted it to end in a certain way, I do not want to spoil it for you so I will not tell the ending, but you will know what I am talking about when you have seen the movie. All in all a bad movie which could have been very good if the director was not looking to use the F-word so much and the storyline connected a lot better than it did."
"narayans80","8","0","0","6 November 2006"," Watch with lesser expectations
","Very mild spoilers.<br/><br/>This is the first time I've caught a Scorsese movie in theater, that too a non-biographically styled modern one remade from 'Infernal Affairs' (which I haven't seen yet).<br/><br/>'When I was your age they used to say you could become cops or criminals. What I'm saying to you is this... When your facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?' the Frank Costello's pretty much summarizes the movie.<br/><br/>There were 2 unusual things which was'nt a part in the previous Scorsese movies I've seen (Casino, Goodfellas, Aviator): 1. The movie had a contemporary setting (few years back is contemporary too ;) ), and I did quite miss the antique settings in this movie, especially the soundtracks.<br/><br/>2. It had a feminine key character, the rest of them (except Sharon Stone in Casino, who probably would'nt give you the feel that there was a female character) appeared in roles that were'nt important to the plot.<br/><br/>Being a remake, I would'nt delve into the plot although it was one the strong point. The screenplay and dialogues were typical Scorsese sprinkled with dry humour, guns and loads of blood spatters. Jackie boy, Leo, Mark Wahlberg were the ones who stealed the show. Like Reuben says in Oceans 11 'What am i saying. You guys are pros, the best' :) The only source of disappointment was Matt Damon, he still looked kind rookie-ish. I could'nt make out if was scared or not from his facial expressions (which his role required him to do). Maybe thats why Marty assigned him to be Sullivan and (thankfully) not Costigan. Leo on the other hand had lots of scenes to his credit: his first meeting with the counsellor, a couple of scenes after Queenan dies are some i can think of.<br/><br/>Overall, I would'nt place this movie in the 'Best of Scorsese', but certainly recommend all mafia movie lovers to watch it (with lesser expectations)."
"dunmore_ego","9","0","0","6 November 2006"," Martin Scorcese's Badfellas
","Cops who are robbers. Robbers who are cops. And a hip hop star synonymous with exposed underpants who steals the show.<br/><br/>A welcome return to form for the premier gangster movie-maker, Martin Scorcese bats one outa the park with *The Departed*. Ferociously funny, doggedly compelling, a *tour de force* of gritty production, tightly-wound storyline, sneeringly salty language and flame-throwing acting chops. And there's Leo and Matt and Martin and Alec and Marky Mark. And Jack. All so deliciously at the top of their game that the word Oscar is bandied about this movie as profligately as it is around Sesame Street's resident Grouch. Deservedly so.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson is Irish mafia kingpin, Frank Costello, who opens the movie cultivating the trust of a young street kid, who grows to be Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), a Massachusetts Police Officer whose loyalties lie not with law enforcement, but with his mentor, Costello. Concurrently, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), a former street thug who passes his academy training with flying colors, and who also applies to the Massachusetts P.D., is rejected on the grounds that you can take the thug out of the street, but not vice versa, and is ""invited"" instead to go deep undercover within Costello's mafia. Confronting Police Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen), being forced to relive his checkered past, though DiCaprio mines incredible emotive shadings, that scene is definitively stolen by Mark Wahlberg, as the Cynicism juggernaut, Detective Dignam. With this film, Wahlberg comes into his own as an Actor; though his scenes are short, they are as cuttingly sweet as limes and salt rubbed into paper-cut wounds.<br/><br/>*The Departed* quickly establishes its triangle of the gangster (Costello), his mole in the police (Sullivan), and the police mole in his outfit (Costigan)  and then sits back and lets the plot twist, as each faction tries to untwist its knickers and weed out their respective moles.<br/><br/>Right hand man to Costello is Mr. French (Ray Winstone, almost unrecognizable under heavy beard and faux-Boston accent  given away by his customary élan, i.e. as tender and subtle as a crucifix nail). Under Captain Queenan is Ellerby (Alec Baldwin, in another of this movie's smallish roles that is eaten alive by its actor  Baldwin gives Wahlberg a run for his money as comic relief scene-stealer). Amongst the battle-scarred veterans, Scorcese chose wisely to insert a ""new"" beautiful face as female lead - Vera Farmiga, as police psychoanalyst, Madolyn, who moves in with Sullivan and then begins an affair with Costigan (nice!), setting up a tangential triangle which might have obscured the larger criminal drama in a lesser director's hands, but otherwise only served to verify that old saw, ""chicks dig bad guys.""<br/><br/>Sullivan is a policeman, sure, but as a mole for Costello he is inherently a Bad Guy  whether Madolyn knows this or not, she is drawn to his duplicity and callousness. Costigan, though also a cop, is so deep undercover that the street is rubbing off on him in ways that make Madolyn's pants-suit pants moist - once again, no medals for figuring why she prescribes him ""private therapy."" <br/><br/>*The Departed* is unmistakably Scorcese, with all the classic Scorcese stamps; his characteristic camera moves, angles and smash-cutting; foreboding or calming source music juxtaposed over contrary visuals, and pulling a depth of performance from his actors that must take them places in their heads they never want to visit again without an attorney.<br/><br/>Selling Leo as a hard case in Scorcese's *Gangs of New York* was mildly obtuse; here, in their third collaboration, DiCaprio is steaming with mental muscle, street smarts and a spring-wound temper that turbo-charges his screen presence like no other role he has ever attacked. Not only might it be one of *his* best performances on film, the same can be said of Nicholson, whose conniving and ruthless Costello seems always to be on the verge of either welcoming you as a brother or snapping your spine and appending a pun.<br/><br/>Re-made from a recent Hong Kong movie *Mou gaan dou* (*Infernal Affairs*, 2002) (written by Felix Chong and Siu Fai Mak and directed by Mak and Wai Keung Lau), it is a slight annoyance that Scorcese would insult his audience by performing that patronizing surgical act of re-rendering foreign art for the Great American Unwashed; on the other hand, *The Departed* (screenplayed by William Monahan) stands extremely tall on its own merit, not exuding that alarmist *stanque* of ""remake"" (*Oliver Twist*) or worse, ""bad remake"" (*Fun with Dick and Jane*) or worse still, ""pointless remake"" (*Psycho*).<br/><br/>Whereas Scorcese's *Goodfellas* showed us the world through the eyes of only bad fellas, *The Departed* slews its camera over the wrong AND the right side of the law, graying the line between honor and justice and law and order with its complex layers of hypocrisy. Among thieves, among cops alike, we see honor and duplicity and lawlessness and order.<br/><br/>The worlds are exactly the same. But the chicks dig the bad guys.<br/><br/>(Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)"

Leonardo Dicapio is riverting as a good cop who has to go to jail in order to be undercover going after a notorious mobster Costello(Nicholson). The only people that know about it are the 2 officers that ordered it, Mark Whalberg and Martin Sheen. Matt Damon is the seemingly good cop,but is bad. He knows Nicholson he does everything to keep Nicholson from getting arrested. But Nicholson discovers there's a rat in his mob. Matt Damon is with a shrink, who cheats with Dicaprio,she discovers what's going on with Damon. Jack Nicholson is amazing as a very vicious mobster.

Sheen gets killed by Nicholson's mob, they throw him from the balcony,Dicaprio feels bad,because Sheen was protecting him. .Brilliantly paced,artistic,very bloody and an amazing cast."
"brendastern","8","0","0","6 November 2006"," Scorcese is Back at It
","The Departed marks Martin Scorcese's return to more-familiar territory after forays into period pictures. This film does not rank with his very best work but easily is among the best films of 2006. Leo DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin turn in fine performances; Matt Damon does a good job essentially playing a variation of the same character he played in Syriana, only bigger and broader here. Scorcese almost but not quite reins in Jack Nicholson; perhaps if DeNiro had played Frank Costello as originally planned, the film would have gained at least another star from me. My main objections to the movie are its sloppiness (see the Continuity page for many, many examples) and lack of authenticity. Despite the location settings, it was really shot primarily in New York and that takes away from its efforts to depict the Boston cops and crime scene. Mystic River did a much more accurate job of that. And still, it's nice to have Scorcese back making a picture where his talents can really shine through -- humor, gore, profanity. and moments of real emotion."
"Filmfan-NL","7","0","0","6 November 2006"," Nice, but overrated
","The Departed's storyline is promising, the cast top notch and the names behind the film impressive. Yet the film does not quite meet the expectations I had of it. Somehow the characters never really grasped me, I felt no more sympathy for the good guys than the bad, and frankly, Nicholson sort of disappointed me. I just didn't believe him in this top criminal role, and the majority of his goons just were too flat and stereotype to lift this mobster flick above the average level, where films like the Godfather (the entire trilogy), Goodfellas et cetera seriously surpass that. Maybe it's a matter of a bit too much of everything, too little of one thing in particular. Good ingredients don't necessarily make a gourmet meal. The high rating in the top 250 surprises me, not often I feel so different about a flick's rating. Anyway, worth watching anyway, but don't expect too much."

"gu_babe","5","0","0","31 October 2006"," Vastly disappointed at Director Martin.... felt it could had been done better
","I went into the cinema with high expectations on this film because of two reasons:<br/><br/>big cast w/ renown director and a Hollywood budget production. I am so sorry but in my personal opinion INfernal affairs in terms of plot was defo miles ahead of The Departed and here is how I would explain it, the major fault was the failure to display the characters inner struggle at the mental level:<br/><br/>1) excessive use of foul language to an unnecessary level... a level that actually hindered me from understanding what the actors were trying to say off their lines.<br/><br/>2) Felt that the director struggled to find a rhythm for the film, and tried too hard to fit in original scenes into this one, e.g. the cast-breaking scene when Leo D had his hand smacked on the table. golf practice scene. <br/><br/>Being inspired and plagiarism are two diff things in which unfortunately this film belongs to the 2nd CAT.<br/><br/>3) I don't see the core elements shining thru as much as IA, the contrast between good and evil despite a mis-match of physical identities. the contrast between the good vs. bad group is not presented strongly enough.<br/><br/>e.g. how they got young version of Matt Damon to pledge loyalty to the crimelord.......surely any kid wont understand what it meant when the crimelord helps him the 1st time literally for nothing... seemed like Jack Nicholson decided to be Santa that day and walked into the grocery to make sure the kid receives food/things under his name and practically not items from HIS shop but a poor food shop owner who had been harassed for protection fees just 3 mins ago. <br/><br/>4)the killing scenes?? supposedly a battle of wits, now it;s become random killing occasions. I cant see a trace of premeditation here, even the killing of Nicholson by Matt D was made to look as a total accident (i.e killed him out of self defense) From a viewers point of view I was thinking... Oh! just another one down, it kinda became a laugh at the end when 3 person where consecutively shot dead outside the lift........ and us poor viewers totally had NO clue what the motifs were at all.<br/><br/>OH not to mention that the death of Martin Sheen was so awkward!! deliberately slowing down his fall from the building... geez it nearly did made me think that it was a doll.<br/><br/>5) whats up with the Chinese crime org trading with the Irish gang? cant even speak cantonese properly...nor did he sound cruel. I really dun know how the crew picked their cast, esp knowing that a cantonese audience will be watching this film.<br/><br/>6) apparently bits and pieces of the plot were transferred to TD which for a person like me who had seen IA before found it stale, unoriginal and most importantly bored.<br/><br/>This film had failed to convince me to view a story with a similar backbone from another perspective. Because of a fragmented plot line, I can only give it a 5 at most. However I think Leo D's performance was a breakthrough and he deserves praise for that. Jack Nicholson also played the crimelord well... cruelty without an expression of fear or guilt, perfect. The psychiatrist role was also pretty good...playing justice for the both of these moles, although I would prefer if Vera played the wife of the crimelord cos she seemed to be witty and sly at times.<br/><br/>I bet Martin was prob sticking with his goodfellas blueprint and decided that women in mobster films should always be the dumb blonde."

I don't want to bother you with details (and if you are going to see it anyway, of course you don't want to know them before going), but believe me. It's not likely because of an endless series of incorrect details.

Marky Mark, was good, but could have had a bit more depth other than verbal fisticuffs. Nickleson in parts was brilliant, you could really feel the malevolence. Ray Winstone, ignoring the accent had the best exiting scene for a long time, very good.

","For as much as I fancy myself a connoisseur of cinema, I have never been too heavily interested in auteurs like Hitchcock, Kubrick, and Scorsese--granted, they have made some films I've enjoyed, but on the whole, I lack the (seemingly mandatory) obsessive critical enthusiasm for their works overall. But ""The Departed"" (a surprising remake of a Japanese original) is the type of film that might finally inspire me to peer into Scorsese's extensive backcatalog.<br/><br/>""The Departed,"" in addition to telling a story that's deceptively simple on first glance, but brilliantly twisted with complication as it progresses, also succeeds in assembling a cast at the tops of their respective games. The film actually deserves its biggest accolade for convincing me (finally) that Leonardo DiCaprio is capable of playing an adult role without a hint of the sappy, sentimental ""Titanic"" baggage that's long stigmatized him in my eyes (when his undercover agent roughs up two hoods in a convenience store, we buy it completely). Similarly, Matt Damon--who's often seemed like a pretty-boy recycling the same character--has a fine turn as a cop who's corrupt to the bone, whose long-standing relationship with Jack Nicholson's Bostonian mob kingpin only drags him further down. Parallels to ""The Score""--the 2001 heist flick that united Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando, and Edward Norton--are not out of place, but ""The Departed"" is more than a cinematic stunt revolving around a twist ending while the actors show their chops; there is a sincere, wrenching intrigue and dramatic force propelling this ride. Scorsese's implications--as we've seen in ""GoodFellas"" and ""Taxi Driver""--are shattering, and ""The Departed"" is no exception.<br/><br/>While the plot is intricate and I probably couldn't spoil it even if I tried, it is only a tiny part of the bigger picture. Scorsese's film might be the best fictionalized portrait of corruption among civil servants since 1997's ""L.A. Confidential,"" and the double- and triple-crosses perpetrated by DiCaprio, Damon, and Nicholson interweave beautifully. While the script has its contrivances--a romantic interlude between DiCaprio and Damon's girlfriend (Vera Farmiga)--Scorsese not only makes us feel that something is truly at stake all the time, but is not afraid to align our sympathies with his corrupt characters at any given time. ""The Departed""'s constantly spinning moral compass--and the coordinates it settles upon--is one of the film's major attractions, because it keeps predictability at a minimum.<br/><br/>At two and half hours, ""The Departed"" is a tightly-paced crime thriller that maintains such strong momentum that its minuscule caveats are easily forgivable. In addition to the wonderful interplay between the three leads, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, and Mark Wahlberg also turn in strong supporting work. This is a surprising, enthralling film...one of the year's best."

","Martin Scorsese has created another great film that will join ""Casino"" and ""Goodfellas"" (two of his earlier films) in the American mobster canon. However, this film isn't quite as good as Scorsese's earlier contributions. In fact, it doesn't really improve on ""Infernal Affairs,"" the film it is based on - it merely Americanizes the story. <br/><br/>The script is excellent for the most part. The dialogue is funny, quirky and effective. The actors do a great job (although the accents falter occasionally). Jack Nicholson is hilarious and believably crazy, although, admittedly, he is somewhat typecast as the character he plays in this film and seems to rely on standard grimaces and deranged smiles. <br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg's character is strangely lovable, even though he plays a cop with very few redeeming qualities. <br/><br/>Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio convince us that they are, respectively, moles in the police force and an organized crime racket. <br/><br/>Alec Baldwin's supporting role is also very entertaining. <br/><br/>One thing that bothered me was the subtle and not-so-subtle product placement, which, in my opinion, took away from the film (Halls and Dell are two prominent examples). While many argue that we should just accept product placement as a fact of life, I believe that directors have the choice to sell out or not and should resist the urge to make more money while compromising the visual and ethical integrity of their films. <br/><br/>If you have not seen the original film (Infernal Affairs), you'll probably love this movie. If you have, you'll still like it. If you enjoy repartee coupled with violence (something only mobster movies seem to be able to satisfactorily provide), you'll be in for a treat.

The storyline was fantastic and was really gripping. All the four leading actors did an excellent job, Jack Nicholson obviously nailing the part rather predictably. But the real surprise amazing performance came from Leonardo Di Caprio. He gave the best performance in the film and made Matt Damon look left standing alone even though he gave a good performance. Mark Wahlberg gave a good performance but his was more comical than as dramatic as the others. But he suited the role perfectly i think.

","just finished the watching of TD around 10 mins ago, well, i have almost the same opinion like many guys who already have seen the TD and the original version have given. Kindda disappointed.<br/><br/>Basically, TD is a good movie if we r not comparin it 2 the original 1. When I first heard this remake movie is going 2 be stared by Dic&Matt, I was holding a lot of expectation. Unfortunately,it doesn't work out that way as i expected.<br/><br/>I don't like the performance of the both in comparison 2 Tony& Andy. I personally think Dic's performance is bit superficial, his eyes and acting oozed out 2 much fear. Lookin back tony's performance, it's more complex and dramatic intense.<br/><br/>Well, as 1 fellow said, in this year filled with lame movies, it's still a good thing to watch a movie as TD. And 1 more tip, don't watch the original version before u watch it."

","Okay, I'm not a huge Scorsese fan and entered the theater having possible thoughts that this film was another cop and criminals film. It is a cop and criminals film, but done in a very rare feat of movie-making that blew me away! The film is based off of a previous film made in China that explores both sides of the law through the eyes of two men. both of them are moles who are in deep, seeking out information for the other. Billy Costigan (Leo Dicaprio) plays a hot-headed cop who hasn't graduated the academy yet. he is assigned to go undercover as a henchmen for a ruthless gangster named Costello (Jack Nicholson).<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Costello has a mole inside the police department, Det. Sullivan (Matton Damon) who is ambitious and who worked his way quickly through the department to get a high position in the police force. As the story progresses, both sides of the law learn they're being watched and leads to a very violent and shocking conclusion.<br/><br/>The acting was top-notched and believable. I'm not much of a Leo fan, but he was flat out excellent and deserves some recognition in the Oscars. Nicholson was pretty much himself with his charm, wicked humor, and psychotic facial expressions. i don't need to mention the rest of the cast, for they were all equally as great, despite the fact that Alec Baldwin stole the show a bit.<br/><br/>the story was in-depth and ad a lot of character development, as well as twist and turns and occasional plot holes that were meant to be. The film-making was excellent, especially with the use of old rock'n'roll music such as Pinkfloud and the Rolling stones, the editing was tastefully done, as well as the cinematography, and the pace of the film flew by, feeling like a ninety minute movie versus a two and a half hour film! Despite all of this, I have to say that this film is not for everyone. especially for those who are squeamish to blood, for there is plenty of graphic blood spray, which never really bothers me, but made me gasp and say ""Oh my GoD!"" in a few scenes, and there was boat load of swearing that was as bad, if not worse than Bad Boys II.<br/><br/>nonetheless, I loved this film, and I think it is the best film of the year, and as well as Scorsese's best film. It was awesome. It had offbeat, and sick humor, action, acting, story, fast-paced, and above all shock value. there is no doubt that this film should get some Oscars!<br/><br/>**** out of **** If you are a Scorsese film (which I now am because of this film), and can handle a great deal of violence and swearing, it's for you!"

","The Departed By: Rick Radman of Radman_Art<br/><br/>Awesome! I absolutely loved this movie. In a decade of bad movies I can barely believe a movie like this was released. Martin Scorsese is a genius, we should cherish this man and honor him before he leaves us like Stanley Kubrick. Like myself and thousands of other artists that never get to create to their full potential. They are ignored by a industry that has completely lost touch with it's audience . But I know the way things are going, the people that hate will stay on the top of the hill destroying all that is TRUE entertainment. ""All we need is love"", The Beatles.<br/><br/>My dad was a cop in Connecticut all his life and his friends where my friends. Life is cheap back east. I thought in that sense this movie was accurate. That is why I love the west. We are kind out here. This is our world. You have to live here to see what I mean. Don't get me wrong I am from Middletown, Connecticut for as long as I live. My family's family is from there amen. If you want to know why I do not move back there or even visit. Then please contact my sister and two brothers and ask them. Although family sticks together they also (like the movie) turn against each other at the spire of the moment. <br/><br/>I loved absolutely every thing about this move. Except. <br/><br/>Who's brilliant idea was it to make Jack Nicholson the stud? A man at his age he isn't performing any thing remotely similar to the stud he is made out to be in the move. It kind of makes me sick to think of such a thing. Other than that his performance was perfect. It was so cool to see him play a bad guy again. Like in the movie Batman as the joker. It was a thing of beauty. Like I said before, we will not know how much we appreciate someone like this until they are gone. <br/><br/>Oh and how about Alec Baldwin? I just could not hold it in during the conversation at the putting range I began laughing and so did the couple behind me. This is the man at work in such perfect form. It felt like the last scene in ""True Grit"". <br/><br/>I only hope for more cool movies like this. I think the movie industry makes it's mark like rock music in the 60's and 70's. This past decade of compromise is a mark against us all."

"roland-104","9","0","0","4 November 2006"," Scorsese in familiar territory: guerrilla warfare in the urban jungle. Terrific acting except for Nicholson's lazy turn
","Martin Scorsese returns to the milieu he knows best: guerrilla warfare in the urban jungle, only this time the setting is south Boston (""Southy""), not New York City, and it's Irish ghetto dwellers, not Italians, that claim his attention. All of which is vaguely amusing in light of the fact that Departed is a remake of a 2002 Hong Kong crime flick, ""Infernal Affairs,"" adapted from the original script by William Monahan, a Boston Irishman himself.<br/><br/>The plot line is as reminiscent of John LeCarre as of Mario Puzo. It's all about spying. The Boston city police suspect that Southy gang lord Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) has planted a mole inside their criminal division. At the same time, Costello's people have been tipped that the police covert crime unit might be running a spy, an undercover agent who has infiltrated their gang. In fact, both rumors are true, as we learn early on. But wait a minute. Things aren't THAT simple: there seems to be a spy behind every other lamppost in this shoot 'em up thriller. And Scorsese pays all due respect to the Hong Kong provenance of this story by liberally splashing blood and knuckle sandwiches around like holy water.<br/><br/>Scorsese has also gathered a fabulous cast, and for the most part he orchestrates their turns to great effect. Matt Damon (playing Colin Sullivan) and Leo DiCaprio (as Billy Costigan) are the principal spies, and both sizzle: they're tough as shoe leather, quick as tigers. This is the best work I've seen from DiCaprio in ages: he's maturing, he's bulked up, he's convincingly tough yet just vulnerable enough to be intriguing, as well. Scorsese makes more than sufficient amends here for miscasting him as Howard Hughes in ""The Aviator."" <br/><br/>Another wonderful surprise is Mark Wahlberg's strong work as the garbage mouth, in-your-face Sergeant Dignam, aide de camp to the chief of the undercover unit and Costigan's leader, Oliver Queenan, who is more than ably played by Martin Sheen. And that's not all. Alec Baldwin also shines as Ellerby, chief of the crime unit, Damon's boss. Then there is Brit bad guy extraordinaire, Ray Winstone, never more menacing than he is here as ""Mr. French,"" Costello's right hand man.<br/><br/>That leaves us with only a couple of less admirable turns to confront, one of which, I regret to report, is presented by Jack Nicholson, who sleepwalks through this film playing the role of, yes, himself, Jack Nicholson. We get the shambling gait that has attended his increasing corpulence in recent years. The rolling up of the eyes, the arching of the brows, the acid toss off comments, the devilish, naughty little smirks that can explode into either a violent attack or a hearty guffaw.<br/><br/>But it's all old hat: Prêt-à-Porter, off-the-shelf, stock Nicholson. And for that reason I find his turn here distracting, like, how did this aging, frumpy, lovable Hollywood actor become enmeshed in a taut crime storyhe better watch out, he could get hurt. He doesn't need a hip fracture at his age. I defended Nicholson in ""About Schmidt,"" when a number of critics said he was too big a star to play such a character role, i.e., too much Jack, not enough Schmidt. But I can't defend him here. Come on, Jack! You can do better. Start surprising us, for Heaven's sakes. Earn your money. Be a dog that is willing to learn new tricks.<br/><br/>However canned his performance is, you can never accuse Nicholson of offering a weak turn, but you can sure indict Vera Farmiga on this charge. Her Madolyn is a psychiatrist who ends up having professional and unprofessional contacts with both young spies, Sullivan and Costigan. The screenplay demands that she face a hopeless fate: as a lover, she is ambiguous and lacks passion; and as a shrink, her sense of boundary issues approaches that of an amoeba. As the lone woman among this pack of seriously felonious cops and crooks, she all but disappears. If I were Ms. Farmiga, I would replace my current agent within the next 30 minutes, before he steers me into another suicidal casting blunder.<br/><br/>This rough and tumble gangster stuff is done in the stylish, grand Scorsese manner; he's at his best directing entertainments like this one (think of ""Mean Streets"" and ""Goodfellas""). And if the moral point seems to be that there isn't much difference between cops and criminals, why that's hardly news. For years psychological researchers have demonstrated such an affinity in the personality makeup of these two groups of adversaries. Like any good Hong Kong crime movie, this one may not teach us anything we don't know already, or transport us to any new destination, but it's sure a thrilling ride.

Everyone was excellent but kudos esp. to DiCaprio - mesmerizing and heartbreaking. Recommend highly but don't go if your taste runs to the typical Hollywood pap.It requires the viewer to think; the storyline may appear simple but there are so many sub-layers to the characters and their relationships.

A top, top, top flight cast, with a top director and a top idea  as a cynic, for me it was set up to be a turkey, but luckily they got it right. Scorsese's pacing and control are spot on, Nicholson seethes and explodes as only Jack can, Damon is cold and controlled, Alec Baldwin (world's greatest actor, according to Kim Jong Il) is superbly fat and sweaty, Wahlberg is intense and dislikeable (in a good way) and Di Caprio gives, maybe, his best performance since What's Eating Gilbert Grape? managing to convey the desperation and isolation that Costigan was feeling without resorting to melodrama.<br/><br/>It is a long film but never drags and, despite having already seen Infernal Affairs first, still felt fresh and gripped me to the end.

","An American remake of the Infernal Affairs trilogy from Hong Kong.<br/><br/>Story is essentially the same: a powerful mobster wins the attention and soon the loyalty of a young boy who later joins the local police force and gives him critical information to help the gangster carry out his underworld operation. Meanwhile, the cops send in their own undercover man to find who sends them critical information from within the crime lord's empire. Soon, paths become dangerously close as both cop and criminal know that someone is out to expose their real identity.<br/><br/>One of the world's finest directors once again works with a powerhouse cast to deliver a powerful film. Nearly epic in tone and riveting with its great performances for its admittedly lengthy runtime, but you'll hardly notice that. This is also one of the rare times where remake measures up to the original, mainly in that Scorsese pull no sucker punches or cheap shots. He controls the characters, sensationalism, and critically, the violence and steers them out of Hollywood cliché. The film has literally non-stop profanity/offensive remarks and brutal scenes of violence, but it is all convincing when shown next to the two-faced nature of undercover work. Nothing happens just to show off a slick location or gun-play, but all measures up to what crime drama fans have been waiting to see from Scorsese since he made ""Casino"" a decade earlier.<br/><br/>The film does end slightly abruptly and the scenes seem to jump a bit towards the end. The lengthy duration of the seems to the have caused Scorsese to speed things up there in order to reach the conclusion, but overall this great stuff. Jack Nicholson has never looked so evil and a film has rarely been so dark in parts and funny in others, so depressing in certain scenes and uplifting in others. And the best thing is, most of these scenes ring true.<br/><br/>Even if you have seen the original (and will be able to predict major story turns) this is still a film worth watching in how its core has been placed in America.<br/><br/>However, the biggest strike against the film, and Scorsese at Oscar time, will probably be the poignancy of the film. Scorsese is more than likely to once again square off against Clint Eastwood who directed the great, and POIGNANT ""Flags of our Fathers."" This film lacks that punch in that it deals with issues that don't affect everyone, but war reaches an entire nation as you have, inevitably seen in recent years.

","I suppose I was a little harsh in ranking The Departed a 7 out of 10 but whenever I watch a Martin Scorcese film I expect to see a great movie. I guess that's what happens when he's directed hits such as Goodfellas and Casino. Still, The Departed was an action-packed film that left me shocked (in a good way) as I left the theatre. The plot centers around Colin Sullivan (played by Matt Damon) as a crooked police officer from Boston and Billy Costigan (Leonardo Dicaprio) as an undercover cop posing as a gangster in Frank Costello's (Jack Nicholson) gang. Basically, Costigan is recruited by Officers Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) and Queenan (Martin Sheen) to become a mole within the Frank Costello crime operation. His work as a mole is totally clandestine with only Dignam and Queenan having any knowledge about his mission (to gather evidence to arrest Costello). Subsequently, Costello suspects that there's a spy on his crew and asks Sullivan, using his police power, to find out who the mole is. Unfortunately, for Sullivan, he doesn't have access to the records of undercover police officers and therefore has no knowledge of Costigan. To complicate the matter further, it is suspected that there is a mole within the police department and Sullivan is assigned to investigate such claims. Without giving away too many plot details, the rest of the film centers on Sullivan desperately trying to find the mole on Costello's crew while Costigan does the same for the police department. In general, the film was filled with much of what has made past Scorcese films so good, great acting, a solid plot, and a lot of action/bloodshed. In particular, I thought Matt Damon stole the show with a great (Oscar worthy?) performance as the suave yet cold Colin Sullivan. Also, Mark Walhberg was great in a supporting role as the bellicose Officer Dignam. Overall, I felt this was a great movie but still a tier (albeit a small one) below Scorese classics such as Goodfellas and Casino."

"reachie85","7","0","0","29 October 2006"," The Departed and Infernal Affairs (Chinese version) comparison
","Like a lot of other American films that's of the same genre, this one is filled with shooting, fighting, and killing. To some of us, this film is fairly original; just how the film is in detail, there are plenty of reviews already. However, to anyone that understands Chinese, or anyone who's interested in the original version of this film, I strongly advise you to watch Infernal Affairs (yes infernal, not internal) 1 (2002), 2 (2003), and 3 (2003) (Wu Jian Dao / Mou Gaan Dou). While I would say both the American and Chinese versions of the film are great. The Chinese version offers a greater detail of character development, there is a lot more layers complex that requires viewers to really pay attention to the movie to enjoy it fully. On the other hand, the American version follows the more American trend of such genre, story is completely flattened and simpler in comparison, with less attention to character details, and a lot more action. Since the American version of this film is considered an action film, I would say the Chinese version is a film of art. Depending on personal taste, some would prefer one over the other. If you want to enjoy a good o' American action film with plenty of ""blowing things up"" to keep you on the edge of your seats, The Departed is for you. If you enjoy the finer details and story of films that hooks you into the movie, then Infernal Affairs are the better choices. Either way, I suggest you watch both versions, and personally, the Chinese version is more my flavor.<br/><br/>Oh, by the way, to avoid too much confusion: Infernal Affairs 1 is The Departed, 2 and 3 are prequel and sequel that goes into more details to complete the whole story (forgot which one's prequel, which one's sequel)"

"Luke902","10","0","0","29 October 2006"," Scorcese Is Back Where He Belongs
","Last night, I sat in a dark theater, thrilled to see the words, ""Warner Bros. Pictures Presents"" come onto the screen. I have been a Scorcese fan for as long as I can remember, but this was the first time I had ever witnessed one of his brilliant films on the big screen.<br/><br/>For starters, let me say that this is the best film that I have seen this year, and I find it sad that it comes so late. There have been no films that have really blown me away this year, and it's already October.<br/><br/>But it was worth the wait. I was blown away by the cast members' performances, especially those of Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon. Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin are fantastic in their roles as Oliver Queenan and Ellerby, respectively. Jack Nicholson plays Frank Costello the only way Jack Nicholson could play a villain, violent, vulgar and insane. And under Martin Scorcese's direction, he becomes the incarnation of evil.<br/><br/>The plot is a basic cops-and-robbers tale that makes itself complex, gripping and amazing all at the same time. Frank Costello (Nicholson) is the one man you don't want to meet if you ever find yourself visiting Boston. He's flashy and dangerous, and keeps all together apparently, as he's never been caught for his illegal activity. And there's reason for that: He has a mole working as a police officer in the State Police (a ""Statie"" in Boston street slang). The young man who tips Costello off is Colin Sullivan (Damon), who was just a kid when he began working for Costello.<br/><br/>Of course, there has to be a good cop. That's where Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) comes in. He has the task of going undercover as a member of Costello's crew.<br/><br/>And so begins the intensity of ""The Departed."" I can not give away any of the plot because it is just too good. Mark Wahlberg and Vera Farmiga also deliver solid performances. Martin Scorcese is back where he belongs directing gangster movies, and it shows: The film is packed with Scorcesean violence, heavy profanity and unbelievabely intense scenes. It's gripping, depressing and beautiful. It's the best film of 2006."

"Monotreme02","9","0","0","28 October 2006"," The man has done it again
","The man has done it again. If there is any director who is the undisputed master of the crime genre, it is Martin Scorsese hands down. Not because his films are campy examples of the genre, and not because they take and break the rules. What makes Scorsese's crime movies, and The Departed as a particular standout example, is how incredibly matter-of-fact they are. Frank Costello isn't a caricature. Jack Nicholson plays him with much intensity, but he never, ever treads Vito Corleone or Marcellus Wallace territory. Costello is just a man who happens to be a foul-mouthed gangster  no more, no less. Costigan is just a young man who is extremely confused about loyalty. Sullivan is just a young man who stands by his loyalty but gets dragged down by his weaknesses. Dignam is a man who compensates for his lacking physical stature with fierce determination. Queenan is a wise father figure. The point of this breakdown is to emphasize that all of these are characters. They never become caricatures, exaggerations, and depictions. They all exist in all three dimensions, round as a billiard ball. As with his previous films, Scorsese never needs to emphasize the setting. Sure, since it is a contemporary film he doesn't need to indulge in period details. But the whole Boston setting is extremely well executed in that Scorsese never emphasizes it. It simply is. It is in this sense that Scorsese is so successful in his film-making. Because he doesn't indulge himself in excessive details. His focus is entirely on his storytelling. And this focus pays off greatly.<br/><br/>The plot is thick as a brick. The initial concept of a police mole in the mob and a mob mole in the police department, both of which pretty much need to find themselves, is fascinating and brilliant. But there is so much more than the simple premise. The film is rich with paradoxical details and mind-bending deadlocks. The dynamics, parallels, and general unfolding of events are as rich as they are fascinating. And as the film reaches its unforeseeable climax, we see what all the anticipation was for.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, Scorsese utilizes a style reminiscent of Taxi Driver. It isn't exactly minimalist, but it is certainly gritty and down to earth. There is no fancy lighting, no elaborate sets or costumes. Everything is extremely realistic and down to earth. Scorsese also expertly uses music in the film, both pop songs and Howard Shore's original score, NEVER to emphasize or warp the audience but simply as a setting. If there are two technical aspects that must be emphasized, it is the cinematography and the editing. Scorsese has always been known as a master of the camera, and what makes him such a master isn't being a show-off, but in his restraint. The camera angles and movements are brilliant and dazzling, without taking front stage. It all serves the story. The editing by Thelma Schoonmaker, longtime Scorsese collaborator, is definitely the most amazing technical aspect of the film. It blew my mind. I seriously can't think of any director that can better string together a series of shots in a more meaningful and expert way. The editing in this film should win awards. It's just incredible.<br/><br/>But utilizing the film medium is just part of Scorsese's brilliance. He is also a notoriously good director of actors. And with an all-star cast most other directors would kill to get, Scorsese already has a great starting point from which his actors can take the dive and start bouncing. And bounce they do. Every performance builds on and off the other performances. Nobody ever overplays anyone else, it's an extremely expert use of an ensemble. This movie further supports the claim that that the Academy should desperately include a ""best ensemble cast performance"" category in the Oscars. Nicholson dominates the film; Sheen and Baldwin, the other veterans, expertly deliver fantastic supporting performances. But the real stunners are the younger cast members. DiCaprio was incredible and came across as extremely convincing and very intense as a gritty street character. Then again, Scorsese definitely knows how to direct the man - I still think his performance in The Aviator deserved the Oscar. Mark Wahlberg, a very hit-and-miss actor, is definitely in the hit territory - his aggressive police lieutenant character is expertly, expertly played. But the real standout is Matt Damon. I knew this guy could act - just see Good Will Hunting or The Talented Mr. Ripley for proof. But at THIS caliber? I had no idea he had it in him. The intensity, the drama, the accent - Damon nails it all. He deserves more recognition as a talent and less as a crowd-drawing name as he does today.<br/><br/>I resent calling this a ""return to form"" for Scorsese, because I personally found his last film, The Aviator, to be just as brilliant as Scorsese's other masterpieces. But this is definitely another entry in one of the most masterful filmographies of any director working today. It's great to see that Scorsese, like fellow director Steven Spielberg and quite unlike fellow directors Brian DePalma and George Lucas, remains a strong and consistent directorial force, and hasn't at all lost his touch. He's still a master of his craft, and does his thing better than anyone else."
"Tamio888","4","0","0","28 October 2006"," Weak, bloated remake
","A major disappointment for people hoping for a sharp, original take on a great film. Scorsese and company add nothing new except trivial subplots and extra characters to service their need for mass market digestibility. Do we really need an improbable romantic triangle involving the two male leads? The Mark Wahlberg character is a superfluous addition whose only purpose is the provide a tied-up-with-a-bow ending. The original is edgy and tense and contains a deeper moral sense of good versus evil. It also has real acting in it. Nicholson overplays every scene and, of course, has to do his crazy devil thing. In the original, Andy Lau actually achieves some depth as the icy, distant, morally vacant wolf in sheep's clothing. In ""The Departed"", the same character, played by Matt Damon, is portrayed as engaging and charming, making his evil completely inorganic. Tony Leung in the original delivers the best performance of anyone in either film. In the remake, DiCaprio, in the same role, is stiff and artificial, as is most of ""The Departed"". Too bad, if you saw the remake first, but check it out if you want to see tense, nervy, original film-making of the quality Scorsese used to make."
"evilflic","7","0","0","28 October 2006"," In the shadow of the trilogy...
","I'd give this seven stars out of ten. Why? Simply because the Infernal Affairs trilogy eclipses it. Why remake a film which is superb as it is? The plot of this film follows that of Infernal Affairs closely- however, the ending seems a little different. The film basically attempts to walk in its daddy's footsteps. I suppose, though, that if you don't understand Cantonese and dislike subtitles, you're better off watching this movie rather than the original. Pardon my use of a cliché: nothing beats the original. This film isn't very 'special' or 'original', in the sense that it's all been done before...<br/><br/>This film, however, is well worth seeing. The acting was good, 'good' meaning nothing special, but nothing too mediocre either. Famous names add some star spangle to the movie. Leonardo DiCaprio's acting lives up to (if not, surpasses) that of his Asian counterpart, Edison Chen, from IA; but then again, it cannot be denied that Chen's acting was far from admirable. At least both actors are fairly attractive- they both give the film a little 'zing'. Flimic techniques are geared for thrilling viewing. Those who are game for a fast-paced, action-packed movie with a clever plot will find themselves drooling over The Departed. <br/><br/>Watch this movie for a bit of excitement. It's best viewed in a cinema- surround sound and all that.<br/><br/>Don't watch Infernal Affairs until you've seen this movie. Otherwise, you'll find yourself sitting through The Departed, thinking to yourself the entire time; ""What was the point of a remake...?!"""
"McGonigle","Null","0","0","27 October 2006"," Brilliant Scorcese Movie
","Martin Scorcese returns to the top of his form with this one. This is a movie that will undoubtedly be spoken of as one of Scorcese's all-time best in years to come. He's done the street-level mob story more than once in the past, but the Boston setting (very well represented) and the absolutely stellar cast insure that this movie never threatens to become ""Mean Streets III"".<br/><br/>The entire cast is wonderful, including Leonardo DiCaprio, who is in no way outclassed by the legendary actors he's surrounded by. Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg insure that there are authentic Boston accents, and most of the accents in the movie are pretty good (possibly a first for a Hollywood production set in Boston).<br/><br/>It's also worth noting that this may well be the most tightly-plotted Scorcese movie I've ever seen. While his previous mob movies have been more character-based, the action in this one crackles from start to finish, but never overwhelms the well-drawn characters.<br/><br/>In summation, a masterpiece, and one I can't wait to see again."

","I can only say one thing, with this all star line up including the director I expected to be overwhelmed. I wasn't. The movie is below average in every sense. This movie without, mainly, Nicholson and the rest of the line up would have been a terrible waste of time. The story is fully depreciated and the ending is just trying to put a spin on things.<br/><br/>Of course the direction is outstanding but Scorsese is whipping a dying horse. <br/><br/>This is definitely not the movie I expected. It is not even entertaining to say the least."

","I went into this movie with a lot of people already telling me it was a must-see. Never a good start. I had the expectation that it would be another gangster movie with lots of violence but essentially the same story. I was wrong. This is a break out on the gangster theme and set in Boston, instead of the typical New York scene. I figured the cast would dilute the story, but again I was wrong. The cast made the movie. Kudos to the casting director.<br/><br/>Best scene in the movie is the cell phone scene b/n Damon and DiCaprio. Similar to the scene in Heat, where Pacino and DeNiro meet for the first time.<br/><br/>Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed it and would see it again. A couple of holes near the end, but the studio hacks probably cut it down b/c of the lengthy timing already. Its OK, it justifies buying the director's cut on DVD in a year."

","I was really expecting this movie and had high hopes for it. I've never been fan of Scorsese, he always seemed like a guy who trying too hard. If only he would relax and not make movies just because of the golden statue.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I was pretty disappointed with The Departed. It had bad pacing, worse editing, was way too short for such detailed story - constant jumping from one event to completely another, too many characters undeveloped (especially Sullivan). What kind of relationship do Sullivan and Frank actually have? Can you just shoot somebody after a lifetime of companionship?<br/><br/>It reminds me of movies about superheroes. Those most likely fail when taking themselves too serious. The Departed is just trying too hard to be cool gangster movie with tough guys with f***ed-up personalities.<br/><br/>Altogether, the idea is good but unfortunately Scorsese fails to deliver the whole package. Also, I didn't find DiCaprio to be Oscar material... he frighteningly screams in all his movies anyway."
"khan-busby","6","0","0","27 October 2006"," Very well put together, but ultimately pointless?
","This is undoubtedly a very well made film. It has a gritty realism in style, dialogue and acting. The main protagonists are clearly great actors doing a great job. There is also plenty of action - some of it pretty messy (this isn't a film for people who can't stand the sight of blood!). So why the low score? For me the film fails as there is no real character development. As a result, you never really build any empathy with any of the characters. Ultimately, you don't really care who ""wins"" or ""loses"" - pretty much all the characters come across as amoral. So you can sit back and admire the technical competence of all involved, though you won't feel involved yourself..."

","Alrite, I finally drag myself to watch this. My reluctance, of course, is because i think the original is a very good movie that has decent plot and good deal of emotion heavy moments, plus I am never a big fan of Scorsese's works and i really did not think it could top the original. <br/><br/>It turns out i was right, but I had to applaud for this movie. Afterall, it is Scorsese, one is not going to get those beautiful songs play at the background when someone die. It's bleak and cold, and it is a movie of its own. <br/><br/>The only problems i have with this film is Sullivan and the ending. I think the screen writer must be out his mind to make such a complicated character in the original degrade into a stereotypical villain. In IA, Andy Lau is deep, evil, but in the same time, in constant struggle to find his self image. Sullivan is really just lame. I also think the ending lacks the tragic feeling in the original, but hey!, it is exactly Scorsese's style and i respect that.<br/><br/>One other disappointment is leaving out the subtle kind of understanding between the two main characters make the film's depth a bit shallower. After all, the best scene in the original is the one at the audio store where Tony Cheung and Andy Lau first met. Departed just made the line between black and white too clear. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, it is still a great film. DiCaprio deserve nomination for his performance, and even though i am in doubt Scorsese will actually receive one academy award next year, I think this is a better shot compare to GoNY and Aviator. Wellz, i guess i will just make a suggestion for people who watch this film but not the original, grab it. It's the same plot essentially but very different style, and both highly enjoyable"

It had a lot of over-acting (Nicholson) and none of the camera directing and scene construction that made the previously mentioned Scorcese movies so great. Those movies were rich in every sense that a director can enhance a movie that already has a good script and a good cast. Scorcese constantly reminded you that it was a ""Scorcese"" film. <br/><br/>It perhaps is in the same league as Gangs of New York and Aviator.

"ALauff","7","0","0","24 October 2006"," Good, but Scorsese's least personal film
","In this, Martin Scorsese's least personal film to date, the director's typically freighted acts of ritualized violence are pared down to a simple, brutal efficiency. Gone is Travis Bickle's spiritually cathartic massacre of a compound full of pimps and dopers or Jake La Motta's masochistic bloody atonement versus Sugar Ray Robinson. The one-shot kills depicted here, shocking in their suddenness, are accompanied by the same splatter of brain fragment across pristine surface time and again. In their depersonalized sameness, these acts achieve something of a perfect uniformity to the dehumanized world in which they occur, where life is cheap and identity cheaper, each man an interchangeable cog in a bottomless existential chain game of cops and robbers. Yet this dedication to meaningless chaos saps the scenario of some of its complexity, particularly noticeable in Scorsese's relative lack of attention to moral and spiritual consequence, the rich exploration of which have solidified his legacy as a serious artist.<br/><br/>So, what is at stake? Unlike in his best work, the answer is found in dismissed and belittled subjects. The disdainful treatment of the clergy provides a window into his methods, as he gives neither counterpoint nor context to an early scene in which two priests are accosted and verbally humiliated by a gang lord played by Jack Nicholson. The scene is treated as a blackly humorous anecdote, but the degrading treatment found here and elsewhere in the film, of a profession to which he's mostly shown unique respect throughout his oeuvre (the fact that he nearly became a priest cannot be ignored), suggests that he's in accord with Costello's coarse assessment. This denial of complexity turns up frequentlyincluding an incredibly poor final shot, the selection of which frankly puts his judgment in questionand suggests that what's truly at stake is commercial viability.<br/><br/>If Scorsese's presentation borders on the reductive, the film is given ample weight and complexity through several fine performances and its crackerjack premise: Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), an undercover cop trying to earn his stripes, moves up a Boston gangster's (Nicholson) food chain as Nicholson's surrogate son and lieutenant (Matt Damon) infiltrates the city police department. Both moles appear at first to be sympathetic, good men. But as Costigan clings tighter to the fragments of his true identity Damon begins to relish the freedom of his adopted one, eventually resorting to irredeemable measures to protect it. The story provocatively suggests that Costigan is a better cop as a criminal and Damon a more effective instrument for evil as a protected agent, a sly insinuation that the methods and conventions of the police and the underworld are not so dissimilar.<br/><br/>Scorsese, to his credit, crafts many fine suspense sequences. The film is at its best when Costigan and Damon are pressed to work at cross-purposes on the same task, as in a drug deal between Costello and some Japanese buyers, when the imperiled moles clandestinely use cell phones to send signals to their respective teams. This scene, and two deeply upsetting deaths, fulfills the promise of the scenario, propelling it to near-greatness. The fact that it falls short may be attributable to Scorsese's indulgence of Nicholson's worst impulses, playing a multifaceted character as a dime-store Mephistopheles, thereby softening the story's profound emotional impact and coarsening its tone. As affecting as DiCaprio and Damon are, Nicholson plays it from the outside, relying on tired gamesmanship to undermine the narrative austerity. Just as Nicholson's failure to understand age-appropriateness paints him as an old man trying vainly to be a kid again, Scorsese's comparatively grown-up attempts at striking the right balance between the sacred and the profane are infinitely preferable to this stab at postmodern chic."

In the 70s through 90s he was the mastermind behind the films Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, Raging Bull, The Last Temptation of Christ the epic Kundun and the great Goodfellas. In the last 5 years he's spent time directing, Gangs of New York, The Aviator and now - The Departed. Scorsese is the kind of director; character actors rush, hope and pray for an opportunity to work with. Watch any film in his extensive filmography and you will understand in an instant.<br/><br/>The Departed is a story about two informants in the Massachusetts State Police department who work for and against the Boston mafia. The film includes a laundry list of supporting actors. They include Mark Wahlberg, Ray Winstone, and Martin Sheen but it leads with Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson and my man Leonardo DiCaprio. <br/><br/>Damon performs another solid role as the mob mole working in a special task force inside the state police. Nicholson plays ""himself"" as the dangerous Irish mob boss but he has finally re-invented himself into a dangerous, believable and refreshing character - imagine that. Then we have DiCaprio, one of the best male actors on from the left-coast. Scorsese starred him in ""Gangs,"" trusted him to play the mysterious Howard Hughes in the ""Aviator"" and has him sneak around inside Nicholson's mob in this thriller. Dicaprio is completely convincing as he moves in circles, unable to trust anyone.<br/><br/>Departed places you in the middle of a world filled with murder and much aggression, all necessary to convey this intense story. The film is easily followed but full of credible twists and turns. Scorsese introduces a new character that should be given a Best Supporting nod if only it had a heart. He has taken our modern day convenience, the cell phone and turned it into a character never before seen on screen. <br/><br/>As with any mob film, there is plenty violence but don't let that deter you from seeing one of the best films this year."

I think that the ""best of the best"" should be original ideas (although I'm well aware of the fact that there are few ""original"" ideas left in Hollywood).<br/><br/>That having been said, I thought ""The Departed"" was a good movie, but not great. I thought most of the performances were good, if not particularly memorable (although Alec Baldwin was hilarious!). I thought that for the most part, the principles pretty much play their parts about the same in most of their movies. And will Leonardo DiCaprio EVER look like he's older than sixteen!? On to the ending...from reading other postings, it sounds like it's a pretty straight redux of Infernal Affairs' ending, but I don't think a ""gritty"" crime drama should have the audience laughing with increasing volume as each character goes down with a shot to the head!"

","Good plot, acting, cinematography+ horrible ending=OK movie<br/><br/>I don't understand how this movie has an 8.1 rating. <br/><br/>I think people are forgetting that a good movie has to be a complete package. Plot got really complex and instead of even trying to attempt an ending, just kill everyone and roll credits. <br/><br/>Went from a 10 movie to a 1 movie in the last fifteen minutes, so I am giving it a 5.<br/><br/>Another problem is that with the all star cast...you are constantly reminded you are watching a movie, and this can make it tough to get into it.

","The Departed is an an excellent film that is a remake of a Hong Kong blockbuster titled Infernal Affairs. I had previously seen Infernal Affairs and it was a pleasant surprise to see how closely The Departed tracked the original script. My memory is a bit fuzzy, but I definitely recognized several conversations that were lifted directly from the Hong Kong original. <br/><br/>WARNING: PLOT SPOILER BEINGS HERE<br/><br/>Despite the clearly demonstrated desire to stay true to the highly successful original, there were certain plot modifications made with an American audience in mind. Among them is the fate of Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon's character) at the end of the movie. Other than adding a little additional color, and brief moments of humor, the desire for some ""positive"" closure appears to be the sole reason for the inclusion of Sgt. Dignam (Mark Wahlberg's character), a character who was not in the original movie. <br/><br/>What really struck me towards the end of the film was the necessity of Billy Costigan's (Leonardo DiCaprio) death. I'm not a Leonardo DiCaprio fan, but I was quite surprised and impressed with how convincingly he played his character. There was a certain point where I realized that in the absence of some cheap trick by the scriptwriter, there was no way for Costigan to live happily ever after. The closest they could have come to a Hollywood ending would have been to have Dignam come in and somehow vouch for Costigan; fortunately it was not with this in mind that he was included in the script. <br/><br/>The one thing this remake was unable to capture was the strong father-son relationship between Costigan and Capt. Queenan. That relationship added a lot to Infernal Affairs and made the latter's death all the more affecting."

"the_pooge","8","0","0","19 October 2006"," One of Scorcese' Finest Films!!!!
","Wellwhat can I say about the latest film from Martin Scorsese? Is it a prestigious thriller/drama film up their with the likes of The Godfather, Goodfellas and Reservoir Dogs? Or is it a flop, a flimsy lifeless film which lacks the depth and perception that most crime/thriller films happily entail? From what I have seen from this film, The Departed is Definitely NOT the latter of the two.<br/><br/>I could start with the acting, but I think I'll leave that till a bit later. The first feature of the film that struck me significantly was the setting of a modern day Boston. Scorcese has succeeded in depicting such an underrated city in its dark and sinister form. If there were another definition for the words 'realism' and 'effect', the backdrop of Boston in The Departed would certainly be featured. Each scene is strikingly detailed down to the point of even adding effect to a fly on the wall. The backdrop of the meeting place for Costello's (Nicholson) gang in addition to the Massachusetts State Police Headquarters fits in appropriately with the overall theme that the film is expressing to its viewers.<br/><br/>In order to make a good film, fine actors must be featured in it. I have already selected at least three of the cast members who should vie to win, or at least be nominated for, an Oscar for next year. For Best Actor, Jack Nicholson's portrayal of powerful kingpin Frank Costello is nothing short of exceptional. Nicholson succumbs to his trademark smirk and charisma that is strongly evident in many films that he has had the honor of starring in. The Departed shows that Nicholson has not lost his talent with his old age. Costello, with all his power and influence over his gang in Inner Boston, is a pivotal character in the film, endeavoring to use his power to his advantage.<br/><br/>My second choice for Best Supporting Actor would normally be very difficult to choose for this film. Both Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio have certainly seized their chosen roles and have presented them in convincing awe. If I could only choose one, it would have to be DiCaprio's portrayal of undercover cop Frank Costigan. A live wire in the police who dropped out of the Academy, he is rectified of his prison sentence and wrongdoing and is recruited to go undercover to investigate and weasel out Costello and his henchman. Costigan himself is a confused and unstable man who's vast presence on screen involves compassion and resilience for his aura. Scorcese has really revived DiCaprio's career through his recent films and he is heading back up the food chain of the hostile and unwelcoming list of current great Hollywood actors.<br/><br/>The third and final person who is worth a Nomination is Vera Farmiga who played Dr. Madolyn Madden, Sargent Colin Sullivan's (Damon) girlfriend and shrink who serves Costigan during his stint as an undercover cop. Farmiga strongly portrays the female lead in a style that portrays her unawareness of the situation that is being faced in the film. She is a pivotal character in the plot of the film and her presence on screen is somewhat invigorating. She deserves a nomination for Best Supporting Actress at a minimum.<br/><br/>With the utterly convincing plot and setting, the superb acting by such an ensemble cast, and the superb twist at the end, all describe the sheer excellence that The Departed contains. The only problem I had with the film was its length. At 151 minutes, you just wished at times that the film would come to its fantastic and long awaited end.<br/><br/>This deserves to be Film of the Year and I'm being very generous in giving it a high rating."
"Ndirsch11","9","0","0","19 October 2006"," Another Great Film from a Great Director!
","Just as it was becoming painfully clear that 2006 was one of the worst years for movies in recent memory, along comes a masterpiece like 'The Departed' to freshen things up a bit. This should come as no surprise, however, when one takes a look at the credentials of the film's director: Martin Scorsese. Scorsese is arguably the greatest living filmmaker whose films tend to center on themes dealing with violence, masculinity, and urban alienation. Films like 'Taxi Driver', 'Raging Bull', and 'Goodfellas' are among his best work and have represented American cinema at its very best.<br/><br/>After a series of period pieces, such as 'Gangs of New York' and 'The Aviator', Scorsese takes a change of pace with 'The Departed' and goes back to the urban alleys and streets that have been the setting for many of his films. Many fans will no doubt find this to be a welcome 'return to form' for Scorsese, although this is hardly a fair assessment of the director's body of work.<br/><br/>Although the plot has a somewhat labyrinthine structure, the basic premise of 'The Departed' centers around two moles, or 'rats', both of whom are employed by the Boston State Police Department and the Irish mafia. Jack Nicholson, in one of the best performances of his career, plays the notorious mob boss, Frank Costello, who has many friends in high places protecting his every move. Frank is the kind of man who rules his Boston turf with an iron fist, but is capable of mercy and generosity when it suits him. He values loyalty above all else, and if ""you'll scratch his back, then he'll scratch yours.""<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan, a young thug who works his way into the Boston State Police Deparartment and gets a little more than he bargained for: he gets assigned to work undercover as a 'mole' in Frank Costello's gang. The other mole is played by Matt Damon, who also works for the Boston Police but is secretly helping Costello every step of the way.<br/><br/>The brilliance of 'The Departed' lies in its wild energy and fast-paced storytelling. Tight editing and controlled camera-work move the story along at a quick pace while the twists and turns of the plot will leave you on the edge of your seat. Another charm of the film is its somewhat over-the-top sense of violence combined with eccentric dialog and crude humor. While watching 'The Departed', I was reminded of Quentin Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' in that both films contain random and brutal scenes of violence that are juxtaposed with long scenes of quirky dialog. <br/><br/>'The Departed' is a remake, or more accurately, a reworking, of the popular Hong Kong produced film, 'Infernal Affairs'. Other than a change of setting, 'The Departed' keeps the basic story intact while modifying everything else to appeal to Western audiences.<br/><br/>With a great director at the helm, 'The Departed' winds up being one of the most wildly entertaining movies in recent years. It is sure to be a big contender come Oscar time and may even score Scorsese his long eluded best director trophy. Everybody is perfectly cast with strong performances from Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Alec Baldwin in particular.<br/><br/>'The Departed' works because it knows how to entertain. Whatever it may lack in thematic content it more than makes up for in entertainment value. Don't skip this film as it is one of the year's best films and deserves to be seen on the big screen.<br/><br/>Rating: 9 out of 10."

","Martin Scorsese rises to the peak of his directorial skills once again. His return to the world of crime equals his return to prominence. Leonardo DiCaprio brings his best performance of his career, Jack Nicholson gives a performance worthy of his colossal acting ability and notoriety, and Matt Damon adds even more depth to the story that kept me entertained, thrilled, and in suspense throughout. In particular, though, it was the ""other"" supporting actors that made this film great: Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin. Wahlberg's coarse and biting tongue was brilliantly on display whenever he was on screen as Dignam. His dialogue was some of the best of the film, and it is easily his best performance. Martin Sheen was very good as Queenan, who was emotionally connected to Costigan and tried his best to keep him from going off the edge. Meanwhile, there was Alec Baldwin, who provided the perfect amount of comic relief. Vera Farmiga was also good in support, but her role was not as outstanding as her male counterparts. The dialogue was crisp and unrelenting, the violence brutal and unremitting. The ending, despite some negative feedback, made me love the film even more. The ending was in fact my favorite part about this film. I was satisfied, shocked, and depressed all at once. The range of emotions this film provides is brilliant in it's own right. The credit should be given to Scorsese once more, as well as to DiCaprio and the rest of the cast. The editing was unapologetic, fast, and smart, and the culmination of the film left me wanting to see it again right away. Whether or not this film is a remake does not bear weight after viewing what exactly this film represents. The gritty city of Boston plays host to a magnificent film and certainly a possible Oscar contender. Mr. Scorsese, you have done it once more.<br/><br/>10/10"
"RhysHayes","9","0","0","18 October 2006"," Typical Martin ScorseseGREAT!
","Let me get started, this film is great. Like every Scorsese film I've ever seen, I was excited before and after I saw it. Scorsese has made a plethora of films that dip from genre to genre but what I think we all remember him for is his crime films (Remember Goodfellas? That way so good!!!) and I have to say he has returned to this genre with one great film.<br/><br/>Maybe the most surprising of the elements in this film is the casting of Leonardo DiCaprio as under cover State Police officer Bill Costigan; a part that he plays very well Dare I call him a Badass. Yes I dare. He spends most of the film terrified that he will be caught and I have to say that I felt sorry for the character (though I was a little curious as to why they hired someone with such a nervous disposition to be an undercover cop). All the casting was spot on, with big names all round: Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Matt Damon (As a great Corrupt cop) and even Ray Winstone. Who is great but does have to work harder then the rest of the actors with the distinct Boston accent but that's not a criticism. <br/><br/>Based on the brilliant Honk Kong film Infernal Affairs (or Mou gaan dou before someone calls me on it.) it lives up to it. Like the original it has a lot of things going for it. The film takes place in Boston; a city that seems to be have been neglected by the crime story community and with this film following very closely to the tale of Whitey Bulger you get the feeling of echoes of real life. Although the film does have its share of plot holes (i.e. Why would you let a guy who use to be a cop in to your criminal enterprise and when you found out there was a mole in said enterprise why wouldn't he be your first port of call?)The script is faithfully adapted. There's even a good action sequence in it. All in all, this great film is definitely worth the £6 ticket price and I recommend it to anyone.<br/><br/>Plus the ending kicks ass!"

","Late on Monday afternoon my friend had asked me if I would like to go see this movie. I had seen the previews and knew a little bit about the story and since the director was Martin Scorsese, I knew that my cage might be rattled a bit. I had no clue as to the roller coaster ride that would ensue. Right out of the gate the story catches you. (dont worry, no spoilers) Nicholson shines as you would expect as the dirtiest low down devil of a human being as any actor could hope to try for. DiCaprio and Damon have a synergy through total yin and yang. And to top it all off you have moles in the system. Where can the story bring you that hasn't already been done? That is for you to see. As the credits rolled, I stood up very slowly. My stomach hurt. I was pushed and pulled through emotions (the fun ones like fear, anger, anguish, etc.) that my head was a mess so my body reacted to it. When you can leave a theater and feel tension like that, the director correctly did his job. Scorsese nailed this one, and DiCaprio has done an even better job in character acting than in the Aviator. Oscars anyone?"
"Tony43","Null","0","0","18 October 2006"," Well done, to a point
","There is little doubt that Martin Scorsese is one of the finest directors currently at work in America. Pictures like ""Raging Bull"" and ""Goodfellas"" established him as a master of the art. There is also evidence that, like the gangsters and heist artists he sometimes depicts on the screen, Scorsese is always looking for that one big score, the movie that will put him on easy street. He searched for it in ""Cape Fear"" and ""Gangs of New York"" and he's back in the hunt again with ""The Departed."" Scorsese's talent and craftsmanship cannot be disputed. He has the amazing ability to create a milieu, a textured background, fill it with interesting people and events and weave them all together. And despite his less than successful forays into other genres, he usually comes off best when he sticks to the genre that made him famous, the gangster flick. Scorsese may hate gangster films for all I know, just as James Cagney did before him, but he is smart enough to realize they are his bread and butter.<br/><br/>But like so many directors today, Scorsese is trapped in an industry that focuses so much on the youth market, in today's world, a poorly educated youth market that is swimming in media excess. This is the age, not of information, but rather of too much information. This is an age where movies and TV are more influenced by the computer screen than any other force in society. And as most of us know, computers have to have some type of information occupying ever square inch of the screen. So today, TV shows may have opening credits at the bottom of the screen, but they are often overlaid with promos for the show coming up next, even though the viewer isn't even into the current show yet. And since the information is overlaid, you actually can't read either, much less pay attention to the picture on the screen.<br/><br/>Up on the big screen, directors like Peter Jackson can make a horrible mess of his remake of ""King Kong,"" by filling the screen with so much action the film is hard to follow. Don't have the big gorilla fight one T-Rex dinosaur, have him fight three of them, while falling down a bottomless pit and trying to save the girl at the same time.<br/><br/>The fear that letting up for even a second will lose this short attention span audience is slowly strangling the entertainment industry.<br/><br/>""The Departed"" falls into this trap. It moves along with the speed of light and even though I found myself checking my watch when we'd crossed the two hour mark, I still enjoyed the movie.<br/><br/>Then came the ending.<br/><br/>Not only did one bad guy meet his maker, they all did. Even people who we didn't know were bad guys died in a hail of bullets. I almost expected the final scene to be somebody pulling out a gun and committing suicide, adding their own body to the pile.<br/><br/>Whether all this carnage was needed, or whether Scorsese just thought that's what kids wants these days, we will never know.<br/><br/>Does the film work, yes. Would I recommend it? Yes, but only with the warning that it contains much bloodshed and too much action for most of us to easily follow the plot.<br/><br/>Is the acting good? Mostly, yes. Leo DiCaprio and Matt Damon are good in lead roles, Martin Sheen, Alex Baldwin and particularly, Mark Walberg are good in supporting roles and actress Vera Farmiga provides some very welcome relief as the love interest, if only in that her scenes provide some of the few moments of calm in this frenetic story.<br/><br/>What about Jack? Nicholson ranges from brilliant to just plain Jack, an actor who is basically playing himself and done it so many times he is now almost a parody of himself.<br/><br/>Is the story credible? Hard to say. It is supposedly adapted from an Asian gangster film. It provides a look into the Irish mob in Boston and thus seems to be fashioned in part on the career of Whitey Bulger, a Boston mob leader who was also an FBI informant and who is still a fugitive.<br/><br/>Lastly, I have one question for the director. Why did he call his fictional crime boss Frank Costello, naming him after a very real Italian-American crime lord once known as the Prime Minster of the Underworld. Costello was probably the most powerful mobster in America during the 1940s and early fifties. He was a dapper dresser and soft spoken hood who lived at the Waldorf Astoria, frequented the Stork Club, and, since he was top man in ""the outfit"" which reached from New York to New Orleans, Miami to Los Angeles, he probably very rarely turned up in warehouses in the middle of the night where he could get caught in the middle of shady deals. He went to prison, alright, but for what they eventually got most of the big hoods on, a tax rap."

"teh_mode","8","0","0","17 October 2006"," Dynamic, Brutal Thriller
","Martin Scorsese swaps the mean streets of New York for the green streets of Boston in this electro-charged double-double agent crime thriller. At his disposal are his most starry cast ever, among them Leonardo DiCaprio as the hapless cop Billy Costigan forced into the violent underbelly of Boston's crime family. The yin to his yang is Matt Damon who's character, Colin Sullivan, develops mob ties as a lad, then honours those loyalties by becoming a trooper in the state police, giving Costello influence on the inside. As the story unfolds, Costigan and Sullivan become aware of the nature of each other, and must dig each other out before the other one does, or before getting found out. Among the supporting players are Martin Sheen as the stern but caring police chief Queenan, and Mark Wahlberg, who steals every scene his in as a foul-mouthed, though as nails cop working along side Queenan and Costigan against Costello.<br/><br/>Whilst the movie is based on the outstanding Hong Kong thriller ""Infernal Affairs"" The Departed is very much ""un film de Martin Scorsese"". Many of the basic plot strands in Wai Keung Lau and Siu Fai Mak's film are present in The Departed, such as the famous silent 30 second phone call, but very seldom do you get any feeling of déjà vu. One such tweak is the role of the mob boss, a important but austere figure in the Hong Kong film, is transformed into a towering inferno in the form of Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello. Here he is the bulk of much of the film's power and emotion, guiding both our protagonists as they attempt to bring their factions down from the inside.<br/><br/>Nicholson is almost unavoidably ""Jack"" these days. Even when he is playing the psychotic, misogynistic, blood loving Irish mob boss Frank Costello, Nicholson instils him with his evil screen presence, effortlessly charming the audience as well as repulsing them. At times his scenery munching threatens to imbalance the gritty tone of the movie, but just as the seemingly inevitable arching of those infamous eyebrows begins to tease us, we are kept ashore by our faithful director. Not even ""Jack"" can steal a Scorsese film.<br/><br/>This is Martin Scorsese's first pure genre outing since his reworking of Cape Fear (1991). Whilst I wasn't a huge fan of that particular film, here he succeeds by not limiting himself by the material. Yes this is a genre movie, but that 1970s Scorsese potency perfumes itself throughout, through trademark snazzy editing, a barnstorming rock soundtrack and lots of gratuitous violence. The characters are multi-layered; Matt Damon's mafia ties are at one point complicated by his new found love life. Leonardo DiCaprio is honourable as a cop, but has enough violent tendencies, and drug dependence to throw his good guy image into a mist. The original film was all about entering a layer of hell of getting your real identity confused with your pretense. Whilst this film doesn't quite achieve the depth on top of the style that the original did, and nor does it compete with the heavyweight contenders of Scorsese's yesteryears, such as Mean Streets or Goodfellas, it is never-the-less one of the most electrifying movies I have seen this year. This is, in no small part, due to the wonderful cast, from the poster boys to the equally starry supporting players like Alec Baldwin as a crack police chief, and Ray Winstone who exuberates his nasty, gruff henchman persona with panache despite his Boston-Irish accent seemingly floating in and out of his native cockney at free will. This isn't quite vintage Scorsese, but with Scorsese being the genius he is, its still a dandy."

I would give it a 9, but that being said, I had a few questions regarding who Frank was working for - where the other rat on the police force was all along and how did he know to show up at the elevator scene at the end? And what was in the envelope Costigan gave the shrink - and was it that that ended up in the hands of Dignam who finally got his rat? Regardless, it was worth seeing and I can't wait for the DVD!"

However, The Departed is full of everything Martin Scorsese  conflict, intensity, male testosterone, chemistry between male and female, the blurred lines between good and bad and legal and illegal. Oh, and did I mentioned gun shots to the head. The Departed is Martin Scorsese at his best.<br/><br/>The basis for The Departed comes from the film ""Infernal Affairs"" (out of Hong Kong) and screen writer William Monahan does a more than credible job extending the storyline and characters. The Departed is a story and study in the comparison of deception and honesty, crime and law, family lineage and no background, and protection and exposure.<br/><br/>The Departed is full of popular leading actors playing leading and supporting roles that have depth and importance to the film. It is a credit to Scorsese, the actors and the script that The Departed can blend the styles of being almost over-the-top with stretches of seriousness and high intensity yet not lose continuity or the audience. Another measure of the quality of The Departed is that it runs at 1:51 minutes but plays much more like 90."

","Now this is how a remake should be like. Not too long ago I went with a friend to see this movie not exactly expecting much of it as it was a remake, and as they say, Hollywood version of an already great smash hit Asian movie tend to suck major ass. However that didn't stop me from going as the director of this piece of movie was no other than Martin Scorcese himself. A master director in my mind. I walked out of that cinema and thought, yep, this was actually better than the original.<br/><br/>Infernal Affairs appear more stylised than The Departed. In fact the reason why I liked The Departed more is because of Scorcese's style and cinematography. TD appears more gritty and realistic than in IA. When I watched IA again, I just can't help but think that everything in it was just glamorised. Even the fight scenes, they just didn't shout 'gritty' to me. I'm blaming this on the use of colour and lighting. Most of the time the settings of the locales are in some sterilised environment with tall skyscrapers and buildings. The colours blue and silver seems to be the film's favourite which creates a more modern day feel to it. Scorcese is renowned for his usual dark settings. In TD it was more 50/50 imo but that didn't really bring me down. Some parts of TD where they show the pivotal scenes was actually portrayed more realistically and more believable than in IA. For instance the part where Martin Sheen's character fell from the rooftop seemed more realistic. No music was played to coincide with the scene and that is what makes it more believable, although I do have to say the presentation and portrayal of that particular scene in IA was tapping more on the emotional side with its use of a melodic song to go with that scene.<br/><br/>In IA the film actually wants to go somewhere, as in it actually wants to move on to the next scene. Whereas in TD it primarily focuses on the development of the two moles. You could say that TD incorporates both IA1 and 2 into the frame. Some viewers may find that the development of these two characters tend to drag on a bit but I personally think that this sets a good ending with their minds being psychologically motivated in capturing and exposing one another. Like I said before, TD is more realistic so presentation wise, it wasn't 'perfectly' set out and co-ordinated in a fixed linear pattern compared to IA. But this is what I like about TD and Scorcese's style and cinematography. The fact that everything is hectic and fast paced shows how chaotic the world around them is and this is what he is exactly trying to convey to us. In IA it just seems like a more perfect world tbh. Everything seems so orderly and 'peaceful' in a way (even though its not).<br/><br/>The music in TD also conveys to us how chaotic and gritty the world is. In some scenes we hear a piece of Irish song played and then it immediately cuts off afterwards. Again this shows how the world and the characters in this film isn't set out on a pre-destined path. The film wants to show us how life is unpredictable, it wants us to feel that there is an ulterior motive or a different agenda to any of the scenes. And this unable us to think what is going to happen next. However since I've seen the original version, I already knew whats going to happen but it is that what distinguishes itself from the original.<br/><br/>I was surprised that it was an all star cast. Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, Leonardo Di Caprio, Jack Nicholson and Ray Winston. I just thought, woah, I really do hope that this movie will turn out to be a great movie. I didn't want them to pull a Troy on this one. And I wasn't let down. The cast were amazing. Great actors in the frame especially Ray Winston's character. But my initial thoughts on Jack Nicholson playing a mobster leader was a little sceptical. I always see him as a deranged serial killer or eccentric/madman. And thats what actually put me off in this film. I'm guessing its the smile on his face and his frizzy hair cut. It just shouted 'MADMAN' at me. Most of the time you usually get mobsters being displayed as a calm, cool headed, confident and authoritative fella. Here you seen him as your quite chubby womanising smooth talking uncle, if you have an uncle like that that is. He didn't really have that authoritative figure but hey, neither does IA's mob leader. It's more about the actions that they did, the dialogue they used which makes them appear sort of like a mob leader.<br/><br/>But overall the whole movie was great. Watch the original if you get the chance and you can make comparisons for yourself. You may like the original more than this as some members on this board have already stated."

","Last weekend when I went to the movies to see ""The Departed"" I knew I would see a good thriller, and it didn't let me down. Being a big Jack Nicholson fan this was a must see for me as I see all of his movies, that was enjoyable but the plot and twist of this movie made it that much more pleasing. Also ""The Departed"" features an all-pro cast not only Nicholson, but you have Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg and being directed by a legend like Scorsese made it well worth a watch. ""The Departed"" is a terrific cops-and mobsters tale that is complicated and compelling. You have the Massachusetts State Police ready to bring down ruthless mobster Frank Costello(played perfect by Jack)enter Boston bred police trainee Billy Costigan(DiCaprio) whose put undercover to dig dirt. The police captain(Sheen) and command sergeant(Wahlberg) are the only ones to know of Costigan's assignment and nobody else does. Scandals are unaware though when rising young sergeant Sullivan(Damon)is already in the special unit known only to his commander, and Sullivan secretly is loyal to Costello who tips Frank off about the moves of police. This movie then one by one becomes a puzzle hard to figure out as no one seems to be who they are. I really like Scorsese's use of realism of the violence and intensity he shows of this film, I guess that can be expected when dealing with the Boston mob though. You will love the blood soaked gore and bullet scenes the best I've seen in a while also. ""The Departed"" is a film to me that shows one by one how people depart from business or the very life they have one by one as you will see in the film. This is a must see because of the good plot and twist and the great acting."

","As we all know from countless movies, cops and robbers are the heads and tails of a coin that always seems good for another flip, if the spin is sufficiently vigorous. But while this film has an interesting (if preposterous) premise of mirror-image moles in the Boston police and an Irish ""mafia"", and is well directed, acted, and photographed, I found it curiously unmoving. It is certainly far from the top of my list of favorites in the thriller/mystery genre. Puzzling over my unemotional state as I left the theater, I thought of The Departed in comparison to The Third Man, another movie with a mirrored pair of protagonists, and the thriller/mystery that is still at the top of my life list. DiCaprio and Damon as the cop-and-robber twins, and Vera Farmiga as the woman caught between them, could be compared favorably, as actors, to Joseph Cotton, Orson Welles, and Alida Valli, but the male characters in The Departed, unlike Holly Martins and Harry Lime in The Third Man, seem to learn very little from their conflicted loyalties as they ricochet from one violent event to another. Also, nothing happens, or can happen, between them, because they do not know one another, and even their final violent meeting is oddly devoid of drama. Only Farmiga's character learns anything, and it is a bleak lesson indeed. Nicholson's over-the-top mob boss is an entertaining Beelzebub, but actually a distraction from the main story. We certainly learn nothing new about evil from him."
"WorkingAuthor","9","0","0","16 October 2006"," Scorsese returns to a gritty crime-drama with near perfect results.
","""Martin Scorsese (the legendary filmmaker) zero Oscars - Three 6 Mafia, one!"" The implication of Jon Stewart's words during the 2006 Oscars stamped a red hot exclamation point onto the thoughts of many moviegoers. Hopefully, with this recent offering returning to a gritty crime-drama, the Academy will finally recognize Scorsese's talent.<br/><br/>The Departed is a witty, highly original story about a State Trooper named Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) who goes into deep cover to infiltrate Boston organized crime led by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), an aging, Teflon crime lord. Billy has a dark past and many connections with unsavory types, so he's a shoo-in to get close to Frank. As a fresh plot element, one of Frank's henchmen, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), goes into deep cover as a State Trooper. Here Damon treats us once again to his Boston accent that sounded so natural in Good Will Hunting. Once Billy and Colin discover the existence of one another, it's up to them to smoke each other out. It is in these moments where the movie truly shines. The most tense scene is probably the film's most subtle, with Billy and Colin on opposite ends of a silent phone call, waiting for the other to speak and betray their identity to the other.<br/><br/>The main plot is helped along the way by a wonderful supporting cast. After a few years doing comedies and misfired dramas, Jack Nicholson reprises his role as the Joker (not literally, but close), which comes almost as naturally as playing himself. His highly nuanced performance has Oscar contender written all over it. Martin Sheen plays a fatherly Police Captain that could have come off flat and cliché with less camera time, but thankfully, the film gave him enough room in which to work. Vera Farmiga, who played the wife in this year's Running Scared, acts as the romantic interest and the third point in a love-triangle between herself, Damon and DiCaprio. My only complaint with her role is that it exists in a vacuum, having very little to no effect on the main plot as a whole. Lastly, Alec Baldwin, whose making a nice comeback through supporting work after his star appeal dwindled to nothing, and Mark Wahlberg play two foul-mouthed, zealous cops and they are a treat to watch on screen, exchanging a litany of swear-riddled barbs fluidly and with perfect timing. Their characters aren't the most textured, but the actors wisely resist the urge to overplay them.<br/><br/>Penned by William Monahan, who also wrote Kingdom of Heaven, The Departed is evocative, witty, and violent. Scorsese takes all three aspects and runs with it, especially the violence. One scene has a character falling from a building and nearly crushing another character while another scene has brain matter from several character painting the walls. A lesser director might ""tastefully"" keep the gore out of frame or go the other direction and indulge in it. Scorsese simply sets the camera in place and lets the scene play out in one long take. The body count of Shakespearian proportions at the end of the movie will be shocking.<br/><br/>I've never been a big fan of DiCaprio's, but it seems like Scorsese is hell bent for leather to strike gold with him. When I think of DiCaprio, I think of angst and caps slung low over a brooding expression. Maybe it's the way he looks. Like Matthew Broderick, he has one of those weird, perpetual baby faces that'll keep him looking like a teenager for the rest of his life. I think, for the first time, DiCaprio has found a role that suits him in The Departed and the gold Scorsese may strike might be in the form of a little statuette that is reportedly heavier than it looks."
"banderson-25","8","0","0","16 October 2006"," Scorcese's back!!!
","A lot of critics were hailing this movie as one of Scorcese's best. I would have to agree. Although he will never top ""Goodfellas"" or ""Raging Bull"", Scorcese has managed to take a rather tired genre--mob movies--and breath new life into it. Of course, having about seven A-list actors in the cast would help any movie. Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, and Martin Sheen are solid, Ray Winstone is great in his biggest role to date, and Jack Nicholson and Leo DiCaprio deliver masterful performances. The weakest link in my opinion is Matt Damon, who comes across as rather stiff. The direction is pure Scorcese. The steadicam shots, the unexpected explosions of violence, and juxtaposition of humor and bloodshed--I was in Heaven. ""The Departed"" will probably get a few Oscar nominations. It might win one. For those wanting a break from the usual formulaic tripe, this is a true diamond in the rough."

There is very little between Leo and Leung in terms of performance (I perhaps lean slightly toward Leung as he is the finest Asian actor of the modern age I believe).<br/><br/>All in all, a great but flawed film (some additions to the plot worked, some did not) and a return to form from Scorsese"

However, I grew weary of the obscene cussing within half an hour, if not less. It would have had more of an impact if certain words were used more sparingly. However, Matt Damon and the other actors in the movie do a great job with the Boston accent. This is definitely not a movie you would take your kids to.

All in all, the result is quite a piece of entertainment, with some outstanding performances, in particular De Caprio and Damon as the two sides of a character that is heavily manipulated by circumstances and a Faust-like figure.<br/><br/>Damon, in particular, is very good in the way he portraits an ambitious yet hesitant corrupt police officer. He is a despicable character, who still manages to pull a few sympathetic punches. De Caprio is upstaged by Damon a few times, but he is still very effective. Nicholson presents another variation of his naughty persona, with a twist of evil to make it interesting enough.<br/><br/>The man in charge is definitely Scorcese, still at his best with material that involves deceit, violence, and plenty of crime. The movie moves very well most of the time.

"Rubes17","10","0","0","14 October 2006"," Masterpiece
","Just got back from a second viewing of Scorsese's latest, and this time was even better than the last. The script is excellent -- this is a well crafted movie that deals with the themes of greed, trust, and deceit. ""Man is a political animal"" said Aristotle. This film plays with that idea - it's survival of the fittest out there and man's pride can get the best of him if he's not careful. Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is clearly blinded by his own greed in this film -- he basically drools when he looks on the great gold dome of the capital building here in Boston. The dome is a motif that sums up the movie well - it is always looming in the background, it's glimmering gold a clear metaphor for the material benefits that men like Sullivan and Costello (Nicholson) desire. All deceive in this movie, even the ""good guys"". There is miscommunication galore - everyone withholds information from everyone else, even within the departments of the police. <br/><br/>The acting is absolutely perfect in this movie. Hands down the best role I have ever seen DiCaprio perform. He is stellar - he encapsulates the fear, frustration, and grit of his Billy Costigan. We completely identify with him, and when he meets his end we feel as if we have met our end. It would be naive of me to say that he will definitely win best actor because one never knows the intricacies (or idiocies) of the academy, but I do believe he deserves it for such a sensational job. Not far behind him is the supporting cast, most notably Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin. Wahlberg plays the ""bad cop"" of the good cop bad cop duo and is an honorable officer who does his job well. He says to an incompetent character, ""I'm the guy who does his job, you must be the other guy!"" Although he's in a small amount of scenes, he steals them all. The born and raised Boston accent adds to his durable character that doesn't ever flex. He would rather resign than compromise his principles and his devotion to his superior (Martin Sheen, also played well). Lastly, Alec Baldwin seems to have perfected the wise- cracking, vulgar yet efficient boss role as the police chief. The dialogue in the movie is excellent, and he seems to have some of the best lines - every time he speaks he gets a laugh (unquotable for this paper).<br/><br/>It is clear that Costigan (DiCaprio) and Sullivan are foils of each other, ""two sides of the same coin"". They have the same task - to relay the actions of the other side. They have the same contacts, but with dual purposes. They even sleep with the same girl. It is no coincidence that Scorsese picks two virtually identical actors to play the parts. He is commenting on the dual nature of man, the antagonistic light and dark. On one side, greed, deceit, and vanity and on the other decency, integrity, and ""merit"". Scorsese shows their contrasting characters through their relationship with Gwen (Vera Farmiga) -- Sullivan at one point refuses to even look at a picture of her in adolescence before stowing it away with the sorry, vain excuse that ""We may have company"" and that ""You don't see where I come from"". Costigan, on the other hand, warmly embraces the picture and hangs it on her wall when he sees it. Later on, when Billy gives Gwen an envelope and instructs her not to open it, she does as he asks and leaves it sealed. Yet she can't resist opening the package sent to Sullivan. Costigan and Gwen have a relationship of sincerity and trust, whereas Sullivan cannot be trusted - he obscures his past, his true identity, and strives off his lies for his own personal ascension with blind eyes on the gold dome.<br/><br/>The Departed is about men who have gone off their predetermined path. The departures are both negative and positive, whether the characters have departed from a life of faith and honesty (Sullivan) or departed from a family history of crime towards the honorable, good path (Costigan). It is about men who have departed from their true identities to play theatrical roles. They then must re-search for themselves - ""I have to find myself"" says Sullivan. ""All I want is my identity back"" says Costigan. Scorsese comments on how most of us in the everyday world lead a double life, often playing more than one part for societal and political expediency - ""It's a nation of rats"" says French, Costello's right-hand man. The Departed is a movie that kept me on the edge of my seat through two viewings. Not to mention one scene that is an excellent homage to one of my favorite movies, The Third Man (the funeral). Marty, I hope this is the one, you've certainly deserved it."

","If you didn't know any better, you would have thought that this story was written by Shakespeare. I mean it has everything: complex characters, heavy accents (Bostonian) that are near incomprehensible, plenty of language (oh yes, Shakespeare was quite vulgar for his time), sex, witty comedy relief, and an extremely high body count (along with gallons of blood). What starts as a simple undercover job turns into a deadly cat and mouse chase between the two rats (DiCaprio and Damon) to discover the identity of each other without getting killed in the process. Jack Nicholson is, as always, superb and delightfully evil as the vicious mob boss who, like everyone else in the film, has something big to hide other than the fact that he is a mobster. Minor roles of Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen almost steal the show with their off beat humor and sheer presence (respectively). Fair warning, this film has some very rough cursing and very graphic mob violence and is definitely not for anyone below 17.

","The Departed is an Americanized version of the Internal Affairs trilogy from Hong Kong. The film is about a young man named Billy Costigan who is assigned by the police to go undercover and be a part of the Irish mafia and do whatever their leader Frank Costello tells him to do. The police are trying to crack down on Frank and they figure if Billy gets enough information on him that he can lead them to him and they can make an arrest. Meanwhile another cop named Colin Sullivan is trying to help the police crack down on Frank as well, but little do they know that he has been a long time friend of Frank and whenever they come close to catching him Colin always tips him off, so he doesn't get caught. Frank soon starts to realize that he has a traitor among his men and tries to find out who that is and the police know that one of their men is tipping off Frank and they try and find out who that is. The rest of the film is a cat and mouse game of who ends out and top and who gets caught or not. The Departed has good direction, a good adapted screenplay, good performances by the entire cast, good original music, good cinematography and good film editing. The Departed is a smart film that has a good story and lots of neat twists and turns and you never know how the film is going to end. I thought everyone behind the camera and on screen did a great job and the story kept my interest and entertained me and kept me in suspense wondering what would happen to these characters. The conversations between these characters are very well written and the dialogue between them is very good as well. The film has a nice stylish look and at times also looks gritty which helps give the film the needed edge and feel that it needs. There are a lot of interesting things in this story and while the movie does involve several characters it never complicates the story by throwing in unnecessary side plots or other things involving the characters and when it does it all works well. This film is pulled off very nicely by it's cast and great director Martin Scorsese. For being an unpredictable, compelling and well made film that packs a powerful punch especially in it's last half I would say that The Departed is one of the best films of the year and another great film for Martin Scorsese's film résumé."

If you like this one, do not forget to watch the original, it is a very good one too. One thing I disliked about this movie was it seemed to be a bit lengthy and it could have been cut short by eliminating few scenes without spoiling the movie. The strength of this movie lies on the superb acting of Leonardo, although I think Tony Leung in the original was also very good. Matt also played an excellent opposite role in this film, which reminded me of him of Mr. Ripley's (The Talented Mr. Ripley - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134119/).

This device in screen writing is very mechanical and has been used many times (see Road to Perdition for a recent example) The music, while adding atmosphere and excitement, substitutes for dialog and is overused in my opinion. The female psychiatrist who is involved with Damon and Dicaprio is pretty lightweight for the role; she's too important to the story to be just average.<br/><br/>-spoilers, don't read if you have not seen the film - Once you think the story is over and the bad guy has won, the character they conveniently removed from story comes back and kills him... all the central characters die. Is that the point, no one wins these wars between the cops and the criminals?"

","While watching this movie I got the Idea that it could be based on the real life story of Whitey Bolger as well as what someone else wrote (maybe that's where they got the original idea). If you know the story of the Winter Hill Gang in Boston and yes they were southies, then I highly recommend the Movie. In the late Seventies a gang calling itself the Winter Hill Gang were murdering at will and trying to take over the city of Boston's underworld. Led by Whitey Bolger they used every means at their disposal including the legal system to hide what they were doing. Whitey finally fell when he went into business with two out of state investors. On his orders they were killed separately in Okalhoma and Florida. Investigators from the FBI tied the two murders together and upon further investigation found a suspect mole in their organization in Boston. It touched off a scandal in the FBI and the Federal Witness Protection program because Whitey was using it to protect himself. Whitey then disappeared and has not been heard from since."

","Gruesome. Its almost disgustingly violent, nearly revolting. Some call it gritty and real, others says it's blood soaked and sensationalistic. I think it's classic Scorcese - brutal yet elegant, visceral yet poignant. It's a grizzly ballet, a macho cinematic dance. The details of the story are well recorded in other commentaries so I'll limit my statement to my other impressions. DiCaprio is a very fine actor, with a remarkable face. His boyish looks are a high bar for him to maneuver in creating a believable tough guy, and he clears this hurdle easily, powerfully. Matt Damon is a natural as a Boston street smart cop. Mark Wahlberg likewise is a perfect fit as a hard nosed detective. Alec Baldwin is a sheer pleasure to watch, just about stealing all his scenes. And Papa Jack is in great form as an aging, haggard bad ass, past his prime but proudly protecting his turf, the King of the Streets. It gets very gory and grim, a lot of guns and blood, not much left to the imagination. Martin Scorcese uses violence like other directors use dance numbers or musical interludes, as accents and punctuations to expertly developed character studies. It's interesting that their viciousness somehow doesn't define them, but rather, these characters are merely colored and completed by their individual brands of brutality. Scorcese, it seems, has little doubt as to Man's innate inclination for violence, but he is just as shocked and awed by it as we are. He has explored this theme many times, inspiring a legion of imitators and fanatics, and once again breaks new ground with a mesmerizing, if not numbing, barrage of testosterone fueled mayhem and bravado. The love story is weak, like most of Scorcese's female roles usually are. That, I think, is what robs him of the Oscar nearly every time. Yeah, I give it eight bullets out of a full magazine of ten."

","Although The Departed is very entertaining and his best film since 1995 CASINO, this is one of Scorsese's more detached films. His films for the most part tend to be very personal and character driven. He does character studies on his characters exploring their flaws and weakness. The Departed is one of his few films that are actually plot driven and for the most part he does a fantastic job at it. When you think of all great Scorsese films it is the character that reveals the plot. In terms of guilt and redemption all his film posses this element. Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Casino, Goodfellas all this films are character films, and we view life for the most part through the eyes of the protagonist. That besides the way that Scorsese stylize his films is more intriguing.<br/><br/>The Departed is very entertaining and that is what film should be. This is commercial Scorsese at his best. Film was definitely geared toward the masses yet Scorsese has definitely left his usual stamp with his visuals. Film is visually stunning and that is partly due to his editor Thelma. Sound track is mediocre, I thought they used the song Gimme Shelter by the Stones too many times, where as when you think of Goodfellas and Casino, the same song was never used twice. <br/><br/>Any way I saw it twice in the theatre and I am going to see it again."

Jack Nicholson stellar performance from him, I love how he is kept in the without any lighting for a good portion of the film. My problems with the film well not big problems but here they are. 1) Casting of Anthony Anderson. I mean okay this guy is from scary movie he adds zero credibility to this film. I think having him in it degrades the quality of the picture. 2) the excessive headshots, okay Martin we get it don't have to knock us over the head with it.

","In the end, when Mark Wahlberg's character (Dignam) shot Damon's character (Sullivan), did that prove that Wahlberg was also a mole just covering his tracks, or was it revenge for Damon being a cop killer? If Wahlberg was just getting revenge on Damon, the girlfriend must have given Walhberg the yellow envelope that Leo gave her. But if Walhberg was a good guy, wouldn't he just hand it over to the police? Why would he go and kill Damon and not let the truth out? If Walhberg was also a mole, he had to kill Damon to cover his tracks. I think that it makes more sense that he was a mole... or a rat, as the film cleverly portrays with the big rat crawling on the porch. They are pretty crafty in Hollywood."

","With ""The Departed"" Martin Scorsese remakes a Hong Kong film called internal affairs.<br/><br/>Taking Place in Boston, young Undercover Cop Billy Costigan is assigned the job of infiltrating the Irish mob ran by a violent crime boss named Costello. Simultaneously, Costello has a criminal mole of his own working in the Police Department. Eventually both the mob and Police realize there is a mole in their operations causing the ensuing action and excitement, when they try and smoke each other out.<br/><br/>Scorsese knows how to do crime movies with such greats as Casino, Goodfellas and Taxi Driver under his belt. He matches and maybe even surpasses those films with the Departed.<br/><br/>I'm neither a Matt Damon or Leonardo DiCaprio fan. In Fact I always saw them as pretty boy actors who are mainly used to attract a female audience. In Departed both attempt to step up to the plate and try erase those past impressions. DiCaprio does a decent job even though his accent was questionable, and Damon is fully believable in his role. They were backed by a great cast including Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Ray Winstone, Mark Wahlburg, Vera Fermiga & Anthony Anderson.<br/><br/>The one actor who I think did poorly was Jack Nicholson. He overacted and really hammed it up by acting plain retarded at some points. Some of his gestures and and facial expressions were ridiculous and silly. <br/><br/>Writer William Monahan rewrote the script without viewing the original, allowing him more freedom. He does a great job translating this oft told story into something fresh that unfolds in an exhilarating way.<br/><br/>Scorsese's directing was also quite impressive. He obviously didn't feel the need to rush things and allows the film to move along at an even pace without getting boring. Many directors would have made the mistake of shortening the script, thinking they would get a tighter movie.<br/><br/>As I said the plot itself is pretty straightforward, but the ensuing results are anything but expected. This isn't a conventional crime thriller so things happen that you would never expect. The story and characters are exciting, and this movie packs a lot in what seems like a short amount of time. <br/><br/>Nothing is excessive and everything is intense, leaving you with a true crime masterpiece.<br/><br/>I give it a nine & not a ten only because of Nicholson. His hamming it up was ridiculous at points . Besides that this was a great movie, probably the best I've seen in years."

But allow me to say that, this one is really not as good as the hong kong original drama ""Mou gaan dou""! The director, to be praised that he himself had understood the theme that ""Mou gaan dou"" created and he really did researched a lot about that. But, if the 80% of the scene is a completely copy from the original, it won't be a success. Despite a lot from the social, cultural difference, the connection between people will also be a great issue taken consideration of the gap midst eastern and western country.<br/><br/>For instance, when you translate a Chinese literature into English, you can not just refer to the meaning of each individual word; you ought to fully understand the whole meaning of the article as well as those underlying meanings that the author tend to being it to you.<br/><br/>I am a Chinese by the way, and I can read most of the information that the director wants to express dramatically to us. On the other hand, I stay aboard for a long time I can also comprehend all the meanings inside this English movie. But, if you put them together, as me, I found that the director was trying to adhibit his understanding from the original film piece by piece in order to recreate some new western taste ""commercial advertise"".<br/><br/>To be honest, if you considered this new cake as a stand alone, original , classical, thriller; it is fantastic.

The roles were both strong individually yet were given the opportunity to play off of each other. I can honestly say that this was one of the best movies I have seen in a while.

I only gave this movie 8 because i think there are couple things that are lacks, which is the role choice of each person, Except JAck Nicholson (wow he is just amazing) i think The antagonist character are way much better than the original ""infernal Affair Trilogy"", because Jack Nicholson looks just like a real mafia/gangster, Eric Tsang i think his face are just too stupid he doesn't have mafia/gangster face. as for the two main character, i think it will be much better if Leonardo and mat Damon switched position. the real mafia rat (andy lau), are more mature, more experience and has meaner face, i think Leonardo is the fittest choice for this character, as for police rat (Tony leung) he looks more younger and less experience type of person, so i think Matt Damon are more fit to be the good guys, and part of if because i think Matt Damon looks dumb too hahah. and the last but not the least, mark whalberg character, i don't think i could find his character in the ""infernal affair trilogy"", is he playing Leon Lai's Character in Infernal Affair 3 ???? i don't know, ill see it again later, but overall one more time, this movie is good worth your time and money, you guys should watch it."

"EUyeshima","9","0","0","11 October 2006"," Scorsese Back in Top Form with a Stunning Cast for an Unbelievably Taut Thriller
","Filmmaker extraordinaire Martin Scorsese finally brings back the dazzling intensity of his earlier films such as ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Goodfellas"" with his latest offering, a driving Americanized update of the 2002 Hong Kong thriller, ""Infernal Affairs"". Adapted with intelligence by screenwriter William Monahan, the now Boston-based story focuses in parallel fashion on two young police detectives who are leading deceptive existences, one is sharing the department's goings-on with local mob boss Frank Costello, while the other is undercover inside Costello's organization and secretly informing the police of their plans. The informant is Colin Sullivan, who impresses his supervisors with his savvy and unfettered ambition. The other detective is coiled-to-the bone Billy Costigan recruited by Captain Queenan and his hot-headed assistant, Sgt. Dignam, to infiltrate Costello's gang.<br/><br/>Both detectives are loners in one way or the other because they are moles always looking over their shoulder lest they get caught and killed. The movie dexterously goes back and forth between the characters with the linchpins being not only Costello but also a department psychiatrist named Madolyn. She becomes Sullivan's girlfriend and also Costigan's doctor. As you can guess, the destinies of Costigan and Sullivan intertwine like a tightening vise but not without several interrelated story lines battling for our attention. One of the key reasons that this approach works so effectively is the kinetic, time-jumping editing by longtime Scorsese collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker, infusing Scorsese's masterful direction and the adept unraveling-by-necessity character development.<br/><br/>A stellar cast is in peak form here starting with Leonardo DiCaprio's riveting turn as Costigan. Under Scorsese's tutelage for the third time, he has finally matured into a role that capitalizes on his visceral intensity and delivers easily the best work I have seen him do. If Matt Damon's solid work is slightly less electrifying (with a vocal resemblance to the southie he played in ""Good Will Hunting""), it's primarily because the character is designed to be unapologetically covert and a braggadocio to boot. Of course, Jack Nicholson is getting the lion's share of the media attention because he is back in a showy role as Costello. Whether making subtly threatening non-sequiturs to the hapless in his neighborhood or sharing Costello's path to success with his young cohorts, Nicholson blazes without resorting to the scenery chewing we have seen in past roles.<br/><br/>As Madolyn, indie darling Vera Farmiga brings an unexpectedly idiosyncratic quality to what could have been the standard girl-support stereotype, bringing not only vulnerability but a guarded sense of adventurousness to her character. In supporting roles, Martin Sheen is solid as Queenan, but it's the rapid-fire profanity spewing out of Marc Wahlberg as Dignam that remains more memorable. Ray Winstone brings his trademark menace to Costello's amusingly named henchman, Mr. French, and Alec Baldwin shines in the smallish role of department head Ellerby. It should come as no surprise that there are moments of shocking violence as the movie culminates into a series of scenes quite graphic in nature yet thematically resonant to the core story. Scorsese has thankfully let go of the wearying pretensions of his last two movies, ""The Aviator"" and ""Gangs of New York"", to produce an incredibly taut, character-driven police thriller. It's aces for this kind of work."

While some viewers may be put off by the violence that is prevalent throughout the movie the true film connoisseur sees that the vulgarity is artful and masterful. Matt Damon performs in what may be his finest role to date and there were stellar performances by Wahlberg, Nicholson, and even, though I'm loathe to say it, Leonardo Dicaprio. What really makes this movie work is the comedic dialogue juxtaposed against what is a truly gritty and harsh story. I can't reveal more than that without spoiling part of the story but trust me when I say that you'll be chuckling at some of the lines if you've got a funny bone in your body. In conclusion, I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys Scorcese, organized crime, drama, action, or Boston.

I was totally mesmerized by Matt's character from start to finish. He nailed this character to the very core. We didn't see enough of Mark Wahlberg but what we did see was great, of course. And I have to mention Martin Sheen. He had a significant role and did a great job! This movie was so intense that you wouldn't want to leave to take a bathroom break.

","Overall it was a very well made film, but for being done by an anal-retentive director, I would have thought the editing would be better. It is not that I didn't enjoy it, it is that with the story line so 'tight', you try to pick up on everything. Maybe it is because I also act that I notice these things. Two big scenes that stand out in my mind were the picture of Madolyn on a bike as a child and then Colin's gun being left in the elevator. In one scene, Madolyn pulls th picture out of the box at Colin's apartment and he takes the box away to put it in the bedroom with the picture back in it. Nice big close up of the pic in the scene. About 15 minutes later, Billy comes to her apartment and she is still packing, OK not totally moved out, but there is the same picture and Billy actually hangs it on the wall! Wow, it was so obviously done wrong. I thought maybe she brought the box back, but earlier she told Billy that she only had 3 weeks left on the lease. Nobody would float the box back and forth between apartments if you are definitely moving into one. The other scene was at the end when Billy had Colin on the roof, took his gun, and shoved it down the back of his pants (like all good cops do). After the elevator door opened on the first floor and Billy 'got it', Colin shoots two other guys and walks out. The next scene is him being interviewed on what happened. I kept waiting for the cops to say, ""and how did your gun get into his pants?"" Might be a minor detail, but could have been done better. Either take the gun before leaving the scene or explain why the gun was there. Like I said, overall good flick but Madolyn's character had no real drive in her for either guy. Dialogue wasn't believable."

Leinardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon are probably going to be competitors for the best actor Oscar; both gave great performances, DiCaprio in a flashier role, but Damon's controlled intensity was amazing, too. Strong supporting roles, especially by Martin Sheen and, of course, Jack Nicholson, as the most evil guy in the world. I usually find Nicholson to be a distraction, since he's usually called upon to play basically a slightly different version of his crazy-guy role; this time he really submerges into an anything-but-crazy role as mob boss Frank Costello. Savagely bloody, sustained tension; vintage Scorsese, easily his best movie since Goodfellas, and the best American movie of the year."
"bobbobwhite","8","0","0","10 October 2006"," Great, but brutally exhausting to watch
","With his films, Scorcese usually tests our guts, stamina and tolerance for pain. With The Departed he even exceeds his previous unbroken records in all of these areas. This is the most powerful film I have seen in ages, but is hard to get to the end without feeling emotionally wrung out from watching his graphic depiction of human venal excess. The extreme violence, profanity, evil, treachery and power addiction wore me out by the end but also made me remember that various forms of these abominable human behaviors do exist in real life and are not exclusive to the criminal world but occur in regular society and the business world as well.<br/><br/>The film story has been outlined by others, so it is my interest here to discuss the philosophy behind making it. Was it made just for profit, or did it have other agendas? It is MHO that with Scorsese, any possible harm to our children and adult sensibilities from watching his films always comes in last compared to the quality of the story told, no matter how tough the subject, from Mean Streets to Taxi Driver and Goodfellas to here. All were degraded and mean societal bottom feeder stories, but were dramatized versions of real life that some people live on some level every day. All of his films show the grittiest and harshest aspects of the tortuous underbelly of our modern ""civilization"" that cause cruel things to happen in some people's lives and not just to the lowest underclass. Most of us don't know that and Scorsese knows we don't know that so he does his best to show it to us in a way that forever shocks and assaults us as much as Tarantino, Kubrick, or Peckinpah ever did, and maybe more so. And, to do so is very profitable for him as we eat it up, violent wild animals that we are. And, I am very sure that his degrading depictions of our progressively more violent ""culture"" don't help us improve socially as it is becoming more and more commonplace to see violent degradation everywhere and not just in films(but especially IN films), and Scorsese is only too willing to dramatically show us the reprehensible behavior in our culture that some of us commit on each other for personal gain without thought for the consequences to all mankind in the end. Maybe Scorsese is doing his part to force some form of social change by rubbing our noses in human behavioral filth. As a counterpoint though, how many of us think the violence such as that shown in Scorsese's films is worse than or not as bad for our society as the severe and life-ruining emotional and financial damage to millions of people's retirement as done by Enron, WorldCom, etc.? Hmmmmm.<br/><br/>Finally, I have to admit that I am drawn to his films like a moth to a flame and I can't say that I like that about me, but it is true that Scorsese's work holds an uncomfortable and almost addictive attraction for me and many others. Maybe it's like smoking, drinking or drugs done to excess...all of us know these are bad for us, but some of us just can't help using them even though we know all too well the brutal consequences. We just continue to say, ""Someday I'm going to stop."" Sure we will."

It is not a remake like the Italian job or the grudge or the wicker man in that someone actually sweated over the script and martin scorsese gave the direction his full attention and all the elements in this make sense.<br/><br/>All the parts are well written, a bit quirky and brilliantly acted. I'm sure I wasn't the only person watching it thinking that a hardcore gangster film with dicaprio, damon and whalberg would be a bit BBC3. But they are great. Every character is appropriately cast and completely excels in their roles. It's not ""cool"" in the way gangster movies are now. It is very low key direction in a way. Scorsese has very little flourish to his shots, he has just gone for one great and totally appropriate framing to another. It is such a pleasure to watch a master of cinema back on top of his game after (in my opinion) the disappointment of the Aviator and Gangs of New York. And to have nicholson back from mid-life crisis/am i over the hill roles in fluffy comedies to doing what he does best - acting his socks off and terrorising you - is a real joy to behold.<br/><br/>There are a few potential plot holes that I'm sure I will dwell on when my happiness at having been blown away by this movie will subside and I'll be able to think about it all but everything about this was great! Very realistic and brutal but not gratuitous. often very surprising too.<br/><br/>If you proper like movies like they used to make in the seventies (and scorsese continued to make into the 80's and 90's) then this is well worth a watch."
"steverino171","7","0","0","8 October 2006"," Humor and Playful Touch Save Scorcese's Latest from Tedium
","As an English teacher, whenever I had students write short stories in class the boys would always end them the exact same way: total mayhem where everyone gets killed. There is something juvenile about killing off all of your characters to tie up a film. Scorcese is known for that; in fact, you could say it's his signature. From Taxi Driver to Goodfellas, his film's resolve themselves in explosions of violence. Just like my fifteen year old students' stories. But my students worked under time constraints (50 minutes), they were writing in a foreign language, and they're fifteen. For a professional filmmaker such a hackneyed means of tying up a story demonstrates an unfortunate dearth of creativity. Nevertheless, The Departed's script, some fine performances, and some restrained direction from Scorcese distinguishes the auteur's latest cops and gangsters film from the myriad others he's directed.<br/><br/>Scorcese certainly lacks subtlety. And he holds steadfast to familiar themes: organized crime, pervasive corruption, anti-social hypermachismo, and of course, purgation through violence. The Departed certainly has all that. It revolves around an undercover cop who's infiltrated organized crime in Boston, and a mole for organized crime entrenched in the state police department. While the police probe their own department to find the mole, the Irish gangsters try to smoke out the rat among them. The dialogue is a Mametian pitter-patter of obscenities and insults spewed forth like high school poseurs trying to impress upperclassmen. It's all tough talk. Until all the tension and wrath culminate in a fiasco of gunfire and instantaneous death (I've never seen so many clean shots to the head before).<br/><br/>Still, the dialoguebut not the story, with its gut-wrenching yet trite endingis the film's saving grace. The Departed's all-star cast fire off snappy one-liners like rounds from their Kalashnikov's. ""Who am I? I'm the guy who does his job. You must be the other one"" barks Mark Walburgh to an impudent but incompetent video technician. When Vera Farmiga tries to give a flirtatious Matt Damon her business card so they can meet for lunch, Damon's smart-ass reply is ""No thanks. I'll find you. I'm a detective. Just kidding. I need the card."" In spite of all of the mayhem and macho posturing, the film has a breezy sense of humor that eases the tension. And to his credit, Scorcese handles it well. Unlike his previous two efforts, The Departed never gets too heavy-handed or brooding. Also, certain much-needed playfulness in the performances keeps the movie flowing smoothly. Thankfully, Scorcese doesn't indulge in any forehead grasping moodiness that might've halted the show dead in its tracks. He gamely keeps the tension and humor brisk throughout.<br/><br/>And the performances of the all-star cast are nuanced and subtle. In a nice touch while Farminga keeps the pahk the cah on hahvahd yahd accent under leash for most scenes, she lets it loose when she gets emotional. And still more credit goes to screenwriter William Monohan for drawing distinctly similar yet discrete characters.<br/><br/>The film could just use a more interesting, perhaps less bloody ending. If he had that, it could've been one of Scorcese's more distinguishable films. Instead, it's just a furiously entertaining one."

","This movie was a Scorcese wonder. It grabbed and kept my attention throughout the entire movie. The conflict between the two sides was intense and had me on the edge of my seat the entire movie. Leonardo DiCaprio has finally grown up. Jack Nicholson reverted many times to his Joker role in the original Batman or maybe even the movie where he turns into a werewolf. Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, and Matt Damon were fantastic. I think Damon and Dicaprio mirrored each other well. I'm not sure if the small romance piece was necessary. I think the movie would have been just as great without this piece. The movie is violent and bloody, so if you take young children, be warned. I recommend you leave the babies at home and enjoy the ride. Kudos to Scorcse. I definitely will be seeing this one again."
"Chris Knipp","8","0","0","8 October 2006"," Stunning remake: but why a remake, from Scorsese?
","Writer William Monahan uses a borrowed premise, borrowed plot, for Martin Scorsese's exciting and violent new crime movie, The Departed. The Irish Catholic intonation of the title emphasizes the Boston setting. We're far from the HongKong of the original, Wai Keung Lau and Siu Fai Mak's Infernal Affairs . A group of Chinese triad gangsters are mocked with racial epithets, as if to further distance the new version from the Asian original. But the HongKong source remains. It's an illustrious one: the original was a well-made, well-acted film and so hugely successful two sequels appeared before this remake could be finished.<br/><br/>Internal Affairs' mirror-image plot structure is so clever and one might almost say so obvious that it's surprising it was never used before. It gets deeper than ever into the always potentially incestuous, sometimes interchangeable, relationship between cops and robbers. In this story, the two main characters do cross over. And their goal is to stay there. In the original there is perhaps more of a sense conveyed of how hard it is to sustain the deception over time. Everything is so fast and furious in The Departed we don't think of the time.<br/><br/>The cunning premise is that once upon a time there were two young men, who both eventually became police cadets. One almost from the start (we see him as a mere kid, at a soda fountain) becomes the protégé of a gangland boss who, when the boy becomes a man, persuades him to infiltrate the police force and spy on its activities for the gang. Matt Damon is at his most unappealing and blank as this slick liar. The other is a smart kid from a seedy family with Irish mafia links but an honest if unsuccessful dad, now departed, who doesn't do so well as a police cadet but is eagerly recruited by the police undercover division as an ideal person to infiltrate the gang. Leonardo DiCaprio is overwrought but strong as the pill-popping pseudo crook, who of course is in more danger. He must live among sadists, bad guys. The cops have foul mouths: this is writer Monahan's delight. But they are not made to appear as psychopaths.<br/><br/>The two men are like stage managers, observing and calling shots from inside to a force outside. But unlike the God (and the artist) of Joyce's Portrait of the Artist who looks down from above, ""within or behind or beyond or above his work, refined out of existence, indifferent, paring his fingernails,"" these two mirror-image undercover operatives are always hiding and in danger of being found out, vulnerable to the consequences of any action. In the original, you're struck by how alike they are. They run the same dangers and play the same game of betrayal of associates. Here in the American version somehow the contrast is made stronger. The film is nihilistic and cruel, but it is moral in this aspect. Damon is a despicable fat cat, given a posh apartment. DiCaprio is a nervous outsider, sensitive and suffering. But even Damon and DiCaprio have a certain square-jawed similarity.<br/><br/>The Chinese original had the two major matinée idols of HongKong film, Jeff Lau in Damon's role and Tony Leung in DiCaprio's, so you can't say it too didn't have big names. It ran fifty minutes shorter though and the performances were more understated: there was a greater economy and subtlety. Using Damon, Mark Wahlberg, and Charlie Sheen adds to the authentic sound of the Boston accents. The overlay is convincing. Another new touch is having a woman both moles are interested in; Vera Farmiga is a psychotherapist whom Damon dates and DiCaprio is treated by. There's also Ray Winstone, excellent, as always, as crime boss Costello's associate.<br/><br/>And there's Jack Nicholson as Frank Costello himself. Since the running time and the baroque expansion of scenes gives the actors too much time to ham it up, Jack just winds up being Jack. Apart from that, he doesn't feel like a crime boss. He doesn't have the physical authority of James Gandolfini, the stillness of real menace (which Winstone has). He feels like an over-the-top actor who's descended into mannerisms and comedy.<br/><br/>In the original film, the parallelism is cunning: it's all you really need; the situation itself is extremely suspenseful. You don't have to jazz it up.<br/><br/>The new version is also more moralistic. DiCaprio is more of a martyr and Damon more of a scumbag. The Chinese version makes you feel more sympathy for each, more conscious of the danger they're both in and the parallelism of their roles.<br/><br/>Monahan is praised for his dialogue, and it's certainly spicy, but it's overdone. All Wahlberg does as the undercover cops' handler is insult and swear at people. He's generally the most appealing character in a crime movie, but this time he's a little wasted. Nicholson's character is incapable of referring to a priest without mentioning pederasty or a wife without alluding to fellatio.<br/><br/>All this aside, the two and a half hours go by quickly enough. Scorsese's editor Thelma Schoonmaker does a bang-up job; the actors are in fine (if in Nicholson's case overripe) form. This is Scorsese's first crime movie since Casino and his most entertaining in a long time. It's also arguably his most nihilistic. After everybody blows everybody else's head off and the bad guy gets a commendation (but not the girl), there's nothing left on the ground but blood and cynicism. Great entertainment, a damned good show. But still the question remains: why does a filmmaker of the caliber of Martin Scorsese want to do a remake, even of a story as archetypal as Lau and Mak's Infernal Affairs?"
"Sfpsycho415","8","0","0","7 October 2006"," Scorsese returns to the house he built--- 8/10
","A few years back i was worrying about the state of the gangster movie. There were tries. Some people did an okay job, some made laughable attempts to emulate classics like the Goodfellas and Scarface. I started to think that with the Sopranos knocking all mafia-esquire stories out of the park, the classic gangster movie may be dead.<br/><br/>Now, the man that helmed some of the greatest gangster movies of all time, Martin Scorsese, returns and adds a cop movie twist. The Departed is loosely based on the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs, which was a decent thriller with great performances. The Departed however is a great thriller, with amazing performances, all directed by a master of the medium.<br/><br/>The Departed follows two moles; one a cop in the Irish mob, and the other an Irish mobster with cops. Both answer to Frank Costello and Oliver Queenan, the mob boss and the head state trooper, respectively. As each find out about each other, they enter a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse as they race along the body littered streets to blow each others covers. Now, i know it sounded like the back cover of the latest Wesley Snipes movie, but The Departed is a gripping, exciting, and star-studded epic.<br/><br/>The most instantly appealing part of the film is the amazing ensemble cast that includes Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nichcolson, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen. They all do an amazing job but never though i would say this; I officially forgive Dicaprio for his crimes against cinema. While Jack steals the show of course, Leo turns in an incredible performance, becoming the character you actually care about the most. His intentions are well, but the act of betrayal is wrong and has consequences no matter what, and thats what Leo brought to the table. Matt Damon handles his rare bad guy role really well, and Jack Nicholson rivals Joe Pesci in Goodfellas for being both hilarious and terrifying.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese knows how to use his cast to tell the story in the best way possible. This story, at it's core a straight-forward thriller plot, could have been handled by any director and made a good movie that you would forget in a few hours. Scorsese, however, puts the characters first, haunts you with their mentalities and their ultimate fates, and creates an unforgettable film. Welcome back, Marty. 8/10"

","The Departed is - a good film.<br/><br/>It was more than what I expected, and even though many reviewers have stated there was much violence, I found that there wasn't as much as usual in the Martin Scorsese films of that genre.<br/><br/>What was interesting that on many occasions, the violence does come from out of nowhere and sometimes, unexpected. The Deaparted is a story about 'who is who': law enforcement having an organized crime mole embedded in their department and the organized crime folks having a police mole embedded in their department - each racing against time to find out who is who.<br/><br/>The performances of note do belong to Jack Nicholson (I do hope he does get an Academy Award nomination out of this!), Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon. Jack Nicholson owned the role of Frank Costello - he was slimy, crazy, calm, sexual and murderous. Leonardo DiCaprio has turned into quite the serious adult actor and not the pin-up pretty boy little girls drooled over. In this film, he's tough, violent, emotionally hurt, confused and used. Matt Damon also deserves kudos's for being one of the best characters in this film for he was calm, cool, collective and a cold bald faced liar.<br/><br/>The supporting cast was just as interesting: Alex Baldwin, Martin Sheen and Mark Walhberg in roles that drove the story along in ways you couldn't fathom - and that's what makes this film watchable. There's a lot going on, even in this films' 2 and a half hours, but everything is leading to a tie-up in the end.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese brings his film team and film-making style to this project, which at times had me laughing at one minute and at other times in shock as to what was going on.<br/><br/>The Boston area is captured very nicely here. But be warned, the language is hard in this film, as so the violence - and nothing is PC. Nothing. From the beginning of this film to the end, you'll know it. If you get offended easily, this is a film you might be uncomfortable with viewing. So I'll close by saying, up until viewing this film, I loved drinking cranberry juice for the fun of it. I guess I'll find another drink - captain, my captain."
"alexdeleonfilm","1","3","8","11 January 2017"," Terriblle. Scocese should have hung up his gloves after Raging Bull
","Wed. October 17, 2006, At the very first Rome film festival. Wirld Premiere of Martin Scicese's ""The Departed"" Ahoy Tom -- Yessiree -- Life is pretty sweet here in Rome and I'm glad you asked about Scorcese and whether this is his great comeback after a string of turkeys. Well, the simple answer is:<br/><br/>NO --this is not the great comeback for Scorcese -- in fact it's a regression even further back into obvious crass commercialism than was ""Aviator"", which was pretty damn regressive, not to mention a pile of horse manure. To start with, both Nicholson AND Dicaprio were Seriously miscast -- The best role in the whole film is Mark Wahlberg --(fast becoming my favorite Hollywood actor) -- who should get a Purple Heart for having to give his all in the company of these phoney stars who walk away with all the credit --as if there was anything creditable to speak of -- while he actually keeps this monstrosity afloat whenever he's on. The interview following the press screening was FAR more interesting than the film itself, which I found hard to actually sit out and squirm through.<br/><br/>For one thing, too much rapid artsy intercutting between the parallel stories of how Dicaprio and Damon infiltrate the police department and The Mob, respectively. The whole shebang was far too intricate for a Boston based gangsta Story and shoulda ""stayed in bed"", which is to say, in Hong Kong, where it started out -- and where it belongs. An exercise in glossy bullshit all around --(nobody can accuse Scorcese of not making Good- Looking, high-GLOSS films -- even if there's no 'there' there otherwise...) and also -- according to Scorcese in the following Press Con, an exercise in ""experimentation"". Well, maybe that was the problem -- It's so Experimental that it falls apart in every other scene without ever getting it together anywhere in between. The only thing that makes it more or less tolerable are the very good supporting roles by Alec Baldwin (always good), Wahlberg (always superb), and Martin Sheen (always interesting, especially now with white hair), but there is one key supporting role that is pathetically bad --the police psychiatrist, played by an unknown (and unappealing) actress by the name of Vera Farmiga. For Christ Sake -- Whoopy Goldberg would have done a much better job! This gal must be a friend of the family -- in fact the whole film feels to me like an expensive home movie made by Scorcese for and with his family and friends. The bottom Line? P. U. -- ""The Departed"" is plain putrid. Glad you asked.<br/><br/>By the way the Italian press and public both lapped it but then, they were filtering it through Italian subtitles -- which made it gain things that weren't there -- or shall we say, were ""FOUND IN TRANSLATION -- Coppola that with the simple fact that neither Scorcese nor Dicaprio can possibly do Any Wrong here in Italy -- even if they ate spaghetti with chopsticks -- and you've got another smash hit here for Marty boy. Given the obvious star power of the main cast and the advance (paid-off?) hype to the effect that Marty is ""back in stride doing his gangster stuff"", I would be hesitant to predict that this awful picture will go under in America, but somebody watching the parade just hasta come out and say it --when the king ain't wearing a single goddamn stitch!<br/><br/>As for the main roles, it's maybe not so much that Jack Nicholson was miscast as an Irish Maffia don, but rather that he's gotten to be such a gigantic Ham that all he ever does anymore is imitate himself as the Devil in ""The Witches of Salem"", or play an old creep on constant viagra overdose. To my mind, he's had an interesting career, but it's time for him to stay in bed --for good! Nevertheless, because of some sort of star-inertia principle (a moving Hollywood Box Office Force tends to keep moving in a straight line as long as money can be drained out of it), his face and name still sell tickets at the B.O. Viggo Mortensen would have been more credible in the role. As for Leonardo -- well, to see the way he beats the crap out of all kinds of heavy thugs in this pic, with the greatest of ease, you'd hafta think he was the baddest ass who ever lived. A bare-knuckled Billy The Kid, when actually we all know he's a frail, sensitive, loving chap who wouldn't hurt a fly -- be cause he doesn't have the strength to! This all has about the same credibility level as a tubercular looking Montgomery Clift knocking John Wayne for a loop in ""Red River"". Matt Damon, the third big name in the cast, is acceptable since he's not called on to do anything but what he always does best -- a grown up hoodlum with a working-class Boston accent who wishes he could have made it to Harvard. Hate to disappoint you, pal, but let me know what you think when you get to see it -- and just remember: Never trust a film critic! --"

Like the old film noirs from the 40's and 50's: you know you are not looking at real life, but at one dimensional cardboards. And thats great fun!<br/><br/>But it's not a great Hollywood flick. Because it tries to add realism to a not so realistic story. The dialogue is very good, but the actions taken by it's characters (who are one dimensional) are a mysteries. If you present it real, you have to explain. If you present it as entertainment, you don't have too. That the main weakness of The Departed for me. Also, it's not a Scorcese picture. It's a bland film, that could have been made by almost any TV director. The actors are great and work with some fantastic dialogue, although Matt Damon and Mark Walhberg really can't act and should stay doing action films. The crew delivers top notch work, but for me: it still doesn't work.<br/><br/>It feels to convulted and I have the feeling that (even though the film runs at 2 1/2 hours) most character motivation was left on the cutting room floor."

As a Chinese, I sure have watched HongKong version 'Infernal Affairs', which was, in my opinion, so-so. But The Departed is a failure out and out. HongKong movie has a great tradition of Gang Movie. Like western in American movie, Gang Movie is a major genre in HongKong movie. Most time, they are heroes, sometimes, they are villains. But they always get their due, they are human being, just like you and me. They are not the pervert, like the persona Jack Nicolson played. They are family-guys, they got hearts, hence it is hard for undercover cops to 'betray' them. I like old HongKong movies very much. when I said old, I mean ten years before, twenty years before. They were powerful,not full of idiot comedies, which is the case with HongKong movie nowadays. What was really great with Hongkong movies was how they depicted and expressed the appreciation and friendship between guys.It could inspire you like hell. In Infernal Affair , two undercover are not only rivals, but also,more importantly,they appreciate each other. They feel like they could be very good friends if they are not doomed for a fatal confrontation. All this are missing in The Departed. <br/><br/>Awful. Don't waste your precious time.

I guess that's the deal he got more parts and got to ""improvise"", in exchange for him being in the cast. Anyway, not impressive at all.<br/><br/>Since this is a remake of the HK movie Infernal Affairs (according to the New Yorker Oct 27), I watched the original work just to get an idea. A brief comparison: all the tastes meant to touch and move the audience in the HK movie were removed and replaced with the authentic American money/slur/old days/gang elements.

For anyone to compare this with the likes of ""Goodfellas"" should be blacklisted. Casting Leo as a ""tuff guy"" (gangs of new york, the departed) has become the downfall of Scorcese's gangster films. The suspense, wit, drama, soundtrack and overall natural blend was absent in comparison to Scorcese's classics. The film's only element of survival was violence, which there was plenty of (standard in a Scorcese film). Was this filmed in a 2 week span?"

","As in all movies, this one had its strengths and weaknesses. It was a great story, gripping, absorbing, well acted and generally very powerful. The ensemble interaction was right on the money, and though the twists and surprises sometimes tended to outweigh the plot, the movie was not terribly difficult to follow. Among the many strong points of the film, the cast was exceptionally convincing in portraying their roles. Also, the chemistry between Damon and Farmiga, and subsequently DiCaprio and Farmiga was top notch. The entire production showed excellent, realistic story development.<br/><br/>On the down side, the movie was somewhat heavy handed and overly gripping, without a great deal of pause. In addition to the suspense and tension, the audience should at some point have a chance to breath. Also, there seemed to be almost no let up in the loudness, screaming, and language. Although we all understand that profanity is a part of reality, it doesn't necessarily mean that it has to be the force fed main attraction of the entire story. If the level of communication among officers and detectives in this story is true to life, then one might believe that it is a requirement of all law enforcement officials that their language is always ridiculously juvenile. All of the action characters say the ""F"" word at a ratio of 1 to 4, throughout the entire movie. It makes one wonder what the actual median level of education is among the officers and detectives. (Among the hoods, it is a given). It also makes one ponder the possibility of the story and portrayals being just as believable and realistic if we were to cut back the language to about one third of what this film offers. (It was done seamlessly 34 years ago in The Godfather, when there was still censorship). This juvenile language aspect is obviously common among almost all current mob and agency related movies. But this installment just seems to go above and beyond.<br/><br/>Then, whatever became of the age old formula where the good guys are the good guys without always being abrasive, and the bad guys being the clear cut bad guys? Then, the two sides fighting it out and the ones wearing the white hats win? This didn't happen. Also lacking was the audience's ability to be able to smile and be satisfied with a reasonable ending. In the incidental romantic subplot, we didn't see the truly deserving good guy drive off into the sunset with the truly deserving good girl (as in Payback, of seven years ago). Apparently, street language and an unhappy ending were more important than anything remotely resembling a vindicating or satisfying feeling about anything. Almost like the movie ""Poseidon"", only with no winners at all, instead of just a very few.<br/><br/>Very few movies of this type can attain a perfect balance of reality, story, and satisfaction. Harder still is the one that satisfies all audiences, a virtual impossibility. But anyone who has a penchant for mafia and mobsters, cops and robbers, cover-up and covert operations should see this movie. And it is not for the squeamish, either. To enjoy this story, in addition to the above, one should have a strong appreciation for graphic violence, extreme profanity, and a no win situation plot."

","The movie was fantastic!!! First Scarface use to be my all time favorite movie. I've held this opinion for years. But now, it slips into second place!! Jack Nicholson was superb...what else do we expect from this man. Leo DiCaprio has truly flexed his muscles. He was fantastic. Matt Damon, I was never a fan but his performance has made me a believer. Bravo Matt!! Martin Scorsese is, hands down, the director of the millennium with this piece.

","Departed, The (2006) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>I went and saw Martin Scorsese's latest film today and afterwards one thing jumped into my mind and that was the word masterpiece. From the time I first got on the internet I've always told people they shouldn't label a film a masterpiece for at least 10-15 years so you could see how a film would sink into you. However, I guess I'm going to have to break my own rule because I thought this film was absolutely flawless and it's certainly the greatest thing I've seen in a very long time. I had a top ten of this decade but this here jumps right at #1. I was a major fan of Scorsese's previous two films but this one here is vintage Scorsese. I really feel sorry for those who have to pick Oscar winners because this film is full of possible nominees.<br/><br/>DiCaprio once again turns in a super performance and Matt Damon gives the best performance I've ever seen from him. Jack Nicholson is someone you can always expect greatness from and he delivers here again but it was great seeing a great performance from him outside of a romantic comedy. As with Scorsese, this legendary teaming has Nicholson doing vintage work. I'm sure Nicholson will get a Supporting Actor nod but you could also throw in Damon, Mark Wahlberg, Adam Baldwin and even Martin Sheen. In most Hollywood films the movie would spend too much time with Damon and DiCaprio but I thought it was a brilliant move to make this thing more of an epic and give all sorts of character detail to the supporting players. Sheen really shines the most and I'd probably give him a nod before Nicholson.<br/><br/>I haven't seen the film this is based on so I'm not sure how much is the same or how much is different but I felt Scorsese grabbed you from the very start with Nicholson's narration cut to a beautiful camera shot and then, of course, The Stone's Gimme Shelter. Seeing the rise of Damon's character through the division was something else that really worked and I personally feel the film could have told more of his story at the start. When the two eventually get undercover I thought Scorsese showed his master's touch again. Most Hollywood films would have just set up several bang-bang scenes but this one here carried the suspense throughout. Little by little plot developments would occur and little by little Scorsese would build the suspense. I was a little worried about the 150-minute running time but the way everything was moving this here could have been doubled in length and still worked just as good.<br/><br/>No spoilers here but I thought the ending was brilliantly played out. I can't remember the last time I watched a movie and thought it was over only to be hit upside the head with a complete and utter shock where I was asking myself if something really happened."

"jcbutthead86","10","2","5","9 November 2013"," An Excellent,Unforgettable Epic Gangster Film/Crime Drama/Thriller Remake. Another Martin Scorsese Classic.
","The Departed is an excellent and unforgettable Epic Gangster Film and Crime Drama/Thriller remake that combines amazing direction,great performances from the cast,a terrific script and a memorable score and soundtrack. All of those elements make The Departed not only a great Gangster film and remake but another Martin Scorsese Classic.<br/><br/>Set in the Soutn Boston neighborhood of Boston,Massachusetts,The Departed tells the story of police officer Billy Costigan(Leonardo Dicapro)who's been asked by his superiors to undercover and work for a vicious local Gangster and crime boss Frank Costello(Jack Nicholson)and his organization. While undercover,Billy is unaware that there is another cop working for Costello,Colin Sullivan(Matt Damon),a State police detective who is selling information to Costello from the police department. With Billy and Colin both working for Frank will one of them discover each other identities or will one of them become a member of The Departed?<br/><br/>The Departed is a brilliant and thrilling Crime Drama Thriller that saw Martin Scorsese return to the genre Scorsese is best known for the Gangster film after two great period dramas Gangs Of New York(2002)and The Aviator(2004). The Departed won Oscars for Best Picture and most importantly Best Director for Martin Scorsese although many agree that Scorsese should've won for his earlier masterworks such as Raging Bull,GoodFellas and Taxi Driver but that doesn't stop The Departed from being the great film that it is. Right from the opening The Departed is an amazing film and an instant Scorsese classic that has you mesmerized and glued to the screen giving viewers a film that intense and powerful and will have viewers on the edge of their seat wondering what will happen next and there is constant intrigue going on throughout the but done in a no holds barred style that Scorsese does so well. The Departed is a Gangster film that is rooted in the spirit of Film Noir where the attitudes of the main characters is tough and cynical and the tone and atmosphere is dark and where streets in this film is brutal and cops and criminals only follow the law of the gun. Where as Scorsese's other Gangster film took place in Scorsese's hometown New York City (GoodFellas,Mean Streets)or in Las Vegas(Casino),The Departed takes place on the mean streets of South Boston where the crime world in South Boston isn't as flashy as New York(in terms of clothes and how they live)or other big cities in terms of style but still has the same violent viciousness as it's other big city counterparts and where the Irish Mob and Frank Costello's crew is working class,gritty and people you don't want to mess with. The Crime world in South Boston has a style on it's own. The Departed not only succeeds as a great Gangster film but a great remake of the incredible Asian Crime Drama Infernal Affairs(2002)and while The Departed adapts the plot Infernal Affairs Scorsese's film works as it's own film. The two main characters Billy Costigan and Colin Sullivan are great characters because with Costigan being undercover and Sullivan being an informant you see these two dealing with guilt,fear and a sense of dread of someone discovering who the two really are and working for Frank Costello adding to the suspense of the film because while you may not always like the them as people or the things that they do but you will be in their shoes. The violence in The Departed is classic Scorsese because the violence is vicious and brutal and when the film gets bloody the red plasma comes off the screen in dark fashion. If you've seen Scorsese's Goodfellas and Casino you know kind of violence is going to be in this film. The screenplay by William Monahan is terrific,with Monahan giving the film gritty and memorable dialog that feels realistic and reflects the style and tone of South Boston and has characters that are unforgettable. The ending of The Departed is fantastic and memorable because it's shocking and darkly humorous. A great ending to this wonderful film.<br/><br/>The whole cast is amazing Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as Billy Costigan,with DiCaprio bringing intensity,depth and energy to the role. Matt Damon is brilliant as Colin Sullivan,bringing power and believability to the role. Jack Nicholson is amazing and at his maniacal best as Frank Costello,with Nicholson being intimidating and funny at the same time. Mark Wahlberg is terrific as Sgt. Dignam,with Wahlberg saying great one liners and stealing scenes. Martin Sheen is great as Capt. Queenan,Costgan's boss. Ray Winstone is fantastic as Mr. French,Francis' right hand man. Vera Farminga is wonderful as Madolyn,Colin's girlfriend and Billy's psychiatrist. Alec Baldwin is outstanding and funny as Capt. Ellerby,a hyperactive cop. Anthony Anderson(Trooper Brown),Kevin Corrigan(Cousin Sean),James Badge Dale(Trooper Barrigan),David Patrick O'Hara(Fitzy),Mark Rolston(Delhunt),Robert Wahlberg(Lazio-FBI)and Kristen Dalton(Gwen)give good performances as well.<br/><br/>The direction by Martin Scorsese is excellent and stylish,with Scorsese always moving the camera and giving the film a great pace and visual style with terrific shots and camera angles. Great direction,Scorsese. <br/><br/>The score by Howard Shore is fantastic and intense matching the mood and tone of the film. The film also has a great soundtrack with songs by The Rolling Stones(Gimmie Shelter,Let It Loose),Roger Waters,Van Morrison,The Band(Comfortably Numb),The Dropkick Murphys(I'm Shipping Off To Boston),Patsy Cline(Sweet Dreams(Of You),Roy Buchanan(Sweet Dreams),John Lennon(Well,Well,Well),Nas(Thief's Theme),The Beach Boys(Sail On,Sailor)The Allman Brothers Band(One Way Out),Badfinger(Baby Blue),The Human Beinz(Nobody But Me),Lavern Baker(Tweedle Dee)and Joe Cuba(Bang Bang). Wonderful soundtrack.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Martin Scorsese,Gangster Films,Crime Dramas,Crime Thrillers or films in general,I highly suggest you see The Departed,an excellent,unforgettable epic Gangster Film Crime Drama/Thriller that is another Martin Scorsese classic and is a film you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
"Benjamin_Cox","10","2","5","20 February 2009"," Shows Guy Ritchie to be the amateur that he is - 93%
","Wow. Not since Michael's Mann ""Heat"" has a movie surprised me with its brutal, visceral and completely enthralling vision of the eternal battle between good and evil and how it affects all of us, whether we want it to or not. I confess, this was my first Martin Scorsese film but I completely understand why this was the one that famously got him that long-awaited Best Director gong from Oscar. Suffice to say, this ain't gonna be my last Scorsese film either...<br/><br/>Things are going pretty good for Boston crime lord Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). His gang of Irish hoodlums pretty much own the streets, his empire is secure and neither the police or the FBI can seemingly touch him. The reason for this is he has a mole working within the Boston police department, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon). So senior detectives Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) decide to plant a mole inside Costello's gang, local officer Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio). But when both sides discover that they are being infiltrated, the race is on to not only bring Costello down but also just to survive.<br/><br/>Normally, there are some things I can criticise about a movie. Even ""Pulp Fiction"" (my personal favourite) has its flaws but the only one I can think of is the development of Vera Farmiga's character Madolyn, which felt a touch too contrite to be believable. Everything else is fantastic. The performances from the jaw-dropping cast, surely one that only Scorsese could assemble, are faultless. Nicholson looks to be having a ball as the vile Costello and quite frankly, it's great to see him back. The script never lets you go from the first scene through to the explosive finale and this sprawling, epic tale is told over an unexpectedly brilliantly soundtrack - just needed a few more Rolling Stones tracks for my tastes! And because this is Scorsese and you know through reputation that this is his yard, the whole thing feels horrifyingly authentic - not just the violence (which is brutal enough to satisfy any action film fan) but the feel of the thing. If it wasn't so entertaining and didn't have big name stars all over the place, you'd think you were watching a documentary and not a remake of Hong Kong classic ""Infernal Affairs"".<br/><br/>This is probably the best gangster film to emerge since Scorsese's heyday in the Eighties and early Nineties and yet, nobody seems to be raving about ""The Departed"" in the same way they were about ""Goodfellas"". I can only assume that this is for two reasons. The first is that they haven't bothered to see this because he hasn't made a good movie since ""Goodfellas"" (apparently) and reasoned that this wouldn't be any good either. Fuggitabutit, this is the real deal - a welcome homecoming for a director who stuck to what he knew and came up trumps. The other reason why this film isn't getting the praise it should is due to age but given time, this will become a classic if it isn't one already. It is a movie of real, grade-A class and any doubts or questions you may have about it will be dispelled pretty quickly. Be a wise guy and go and see it."
"dan80074","10","2","5","5 August 2008"," Scorsese's Best Movie Sorry Goodfellas
","Now although, I thought Goodfellas should have won best picture over Dances With Wolves (I'm not quite sure what drugs the academy takes to name that movie best picture over Goodfellas), this movie still takes the title as Scorsese's best movie in my opinion. I believe Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and The Aviator were robbed of best picture (sorry Gangs of NY but The Pianist deserved the 2002 nod for the best film of the year). This would best Scorsese as the top director of movies that won best picture with 4 over William Wyler who directed three that took the title (Mrs. Miniver 1942, The Best Years of our Lives 1946, and Ben-Hur 1959). However movies like Ordinary People, Dances With Wolves and Million Dollar Baby stole Marty's fire. I believe he is easily in the top 3 of greatest director's of all time.<br/><br/>Now for the movie. One word- MASTERPIECE. The acting is top notch. How Leo didn't get the best actor nod and Nicholson the best supporting actor along with Mark is a mystery to me. At least the British Film Awards gave them both the nod. Supporting cast along with Jack and Mark were great including Damon, Sheen, Winstone, Baldwin and all the others make this a true acting masterpiece. I'm glad this movie finally got Marty the best director win while Raging Bull should have easily got him the award (as should have Goodfellas and The Aviator and close competition with Gangs of NY but a loss to a worthy contender in Polanski). The movie had just about everything a movie could have- comedy, drama, suspense, everything. The screenplay was magnificent as well. <br/><br/>Bravo Marty 10/10"
"kaseymarie07","10","2","5","5 July 2008"," Leo is an actor to keep an eye on. His performances can only continue to be outstanding. A DiCaprio film will continue to be a film worth watching.
","Leonardo DiCaprio deserved Best Actor for his role in ""The Departed"". The fact he didn't win is a sin. He has grown into an excellent, topnotch actor. Marlon Brando, James Dean, Robert DiNiro, watch out. (""Blood Diamond"" further substantiates this point.)<br/><br/>Thru ""The Departed"",Martin Scorsese, finally. redeemed himself for that fiasco ""The Gangs of New York"". Not even Leo could save that disaster!<br/><br/>As for Jack Nicholson, every role he plays is the same. The characters may be different but Jack plays them the same. For an actor with such a limited range, I don't see what all the fuss is about! Jack is overpaid and overrated. Leo was definitely the draw in The Departed."
"myrealnameisjon","9","2","5","6 May 2008"," Another masterpiece by the master of crime
","There is no question as to the level of genius that Martin Scorsese portrays in every piece of art that he creates. Anything the man touches turns to magic. Even with that said, it sets the bar far too low to measure a masterpiece we know as The Departed. I can honestly say that I am a fan of crime family, mastermind scam, and mafia movies. They seem to appeal to the darker side of me that has never and will never be unleashed. The Departed grabbed a hold of that darker side and did not let go until my darker side was whipped into criminal submission. My Irish-rooted soul was bound to the cast of characters in the lore of Mick cops and gangsters; and the sex, drugs, and brutal use of violence left films like Scarface simply wanting. I am not completely sure if I can say that The Departed is my favorite mafia movie, considering The Godfather is still out there, but it is up there on the chart. I only have two suggestions: 1. watch this movie as soon as possible. 2. make sure that your children are out of the house for the night."
"hderksen","9","2","5","22 November 2007"," tough guys shouting profanities with an intriguing plot
","Do you want to see a movie with cops and bad guys (and there is certainly some overlap between the two)? Then watch this movie.<br/><br/>The best part of this movie is the intriguing story line that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie. In summary, the cops have planted ""a rat"" (DiCaprio) in the criminal organization led by Nicholson. But Nicholson has his own ""rat"" inside the police force (Damon). To make things more interesting there are also ""rats"" for the FBI, and both Damon and DiCaprio fall for the same woman. This then all plays out like a bloody game of chess where at the end both ""kings"" die.<br/><br/>This is a star-studded movie where most of the actors do very well, especially DiCaprio and Damon. I found Sheen's Boston accent convincing and Nicholson of course does his thing. Some times I got the impression that there was a bit of competition going on between the actors. Like, who can play the toughest guy.<br/><br/>The weakest point of the movie was the psychologist who is torn between DiCaprio and Damon. The speed at which she falls for the convict (as far as she knows) DiCaprio seems unprofessional and unrealistic. There is never a real confrontation between DiCaprio and Damon over her as one might expect, but the documents that DiCaprio gives to her (not to be opened until something happens to him) end up being Damon's downfall."
"javaman-7","10","2","5","20 September 2007"," Scorsese's Oscar and this film's ending: as inevitable as a Greek Tragedy.
","Java Man Reviews ""The Departed"" (2006, R). Directed by Martin Scorsese. Written by William Monahan. Starring Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Vera Farmiga. Running Time: 151 minutes This review originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW: <br/><br/>Martin Scorsese, perhaps today's greatest living director, guides his grip truck through the mean streets again, this time steering into the Irish-American neighborhoods of South Boston. The first stop is the Massachusetts State Police induction ceremony, where two young recruits have earned their badges and are beginning their careers as cops. Ambitious Colin Sullivan (Damon) gets assigned to an elite investigative unit whose purpose is to bring down local crime boss Frank Costello (Nicholson).<br/><br/>Street-smart but hot-headed Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) soon gets booted off the force and ends up as a confidant to the corrupt Costello. Screenwriter Monaghan quickly reveals that each man is actually a mole working for the other side, thus freeing Scorsese to dispense with suspense and get right to the exploration of these two complex characters. Along the way they are joined by other macho lawmen played by the likes of Sheen, Baldwin and Wahlberg. Adding a welcome female presence is Madolyn (Farmiga), a fascinatingly inept therapist who manages to develop a too-close-to-the-couch relationship with both Costigan and Sullivan. Scorsese and his crew build up the tension to its inevitable conclusion, which is reminiscent of Greek tragedy.<br/><br/>REVIEW: 4 OUT OF 4 JAVA MUGS <br/><br/>Early in the film, Colin Sullivan is being tempted from his youthful paradise by Frank Costello, king of the Boston underworld. Young Colin is played by a young actor, but there is no attempt to portray Costello as a younger man. This is one Scorsese's genius strokes. We immediately realize that Nicholson's Costello is ageless, just as Satan and his evil intentions are ageless. This is Nicholson's best scene and as the film progresses, he slips in and out of character (and Southy dialect) as he wanders between previous personas from The Shining and Batman.<br/><br/>But that's no problem because this film has so much acting talent that it doesn't even need Jack in top form. DiCaprio and Damon give career-best performances, while such pros as Sheen and Baldwin do superlative supporting work. The most pleasant surprise comes from Wahlberg who is a revelation, and should have Mr. Scorsese direct all of his films. It has been noted that the former bad-boy based his character on a real-life Boston police officer who arrested him several times during his wayward youth. Farmiga, in the only prominent female role, capably keeps her head above water in this tidal wave of testosterone.<br/><br/>The devil is in the details (so to speak) and Scorsese doesn't miss a trick. For example, Damon has a scene at a funeral where we see him with on-the-job facial injuries. Though the other characters don't notice, Scorsese's camera captures his twisted face in such a way that we see into his twisted soul. The screenplay takes the characters on a wild ride through the streets of Boston, but somehow we sense how most of them will end up--as victims of fate and inevitability.<br/><br/>Scorsese has finally won his Oscar, as has the film itself. That, too, was inevitable."

","This movie has good performances from many of the leads, especially Dicaprio and Nicholson, but it's no-where near a best picture. The last 10 minutes or so got pretty ridiculous considered how long the movie dragged on. Yes it's supposed to be an epic crime yarn, but let's just have one more main character whacked for good measure at the end to make it a bloody mess literally. It's convoluted poorly - the ending knocked it down a bit. This is not Good-Fellas which was a better movie with better characters and more interesting from the social point of supposed crime and gangsters. Instead of a crime drama, The Departed is in essence a double cat and mouse game that feels overlong. Anyway, editing might've done the movie well. The side plot romance also was too much of a plot device. Anyway, a bit disappointing. Finished review....now, Last year's Crash showed how fickle and utterly poor the Academy's selecting is...The Departed as Best Picture is further proof that the Academy are lemmings giving-way to political tendencies rather than merit. In hindsight after seeing most of the candidates, Letters from Iwo Jima probably had the most merit. Anyway, if you like any of the lead actors, maybe worth a viewing."
"JaQaL","2","2","5","26 June 2007"," How did it win any of those awards?
","When I saw this movie I was stunned at how bad it was and yet that it was rated so highly by IMDb voters. Here we had a highly talented cast and a great (based on fact) idea to work with yet it comes off as contrived, cheesy and unfulfilling.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio takes the acting honours clearly but there's not much competition. Jack Nicholson is terrible. When he plays bad guys he at least has some charm. Not here. Maybe he wasn't meant to. If so then he was poorly cast. Martin Sheen was ordinary. Perhaps his lack of big screen time has affected his abilities. Vera Farmiga, as everyone's love interest, had no warmth, no depth, nothing.<br/><br/>If you want to watch a Mafia movie then just put on a The Godfather.

","Martin Scorsese has to be the best directer out there. He has not made a proper crime film since Casino. The Departed is a classic crime thriller on the streets of Boston thats actually a retelling of the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs. The Departed is about American/Irish gangster Frank Costello(Jack Nicholson) who has placed Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) in the state Police. However the police are a head of Costello and has placed rookie cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo Dicaprio)as a undercover cop in the mafia. All through the film you are gripped and thrilled by Scorseses classic use of ultra violence.

"tharnax","9","2","5","12 April 2007"," An Instant Scorsese Classic, Nicholson Dominates...
","""The Departed"" will join director Martin Scorsese's other classic crime dramas, arguably on a par with ""GoodFellas"" in particular. This film easily swept the Academy Awards in 2007, winning Best Picture, Best Director, Best Editor and Best Adapted Screenplay. <br/><br/>This classic film is set in Boston, where two young police cadets( Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio) are pulled into the web of betrayal and murder orchestrated by Irish crime boss Frank Costello (played by the legendary Jack Nicholson). The complex plot is based on the Hong Kong film ""Internal Affairs""(2002) of which ""The Departed"" is a remake. The film is packed with A-list talent; in addition to that mentioned above, the movie also stars Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg. <br/><br/>The screenplay for ""The Departed"" is among the best ever written for a crime drama, it keeps the action moving at a fast clip and delivers clever dialogue alongside fantastic character development. Martin Scorsese won his first Academy award for Best Director for this picture; a well-deserved and long-delayed honor for one of America's greatest directors. It's easy to see why Scorsese won for this film, it is yet another brilliant expose of his masterful skill as a director. <br/><br/>Jack Nicholson dominates this film. His performance as crime boss Frank Costello is brilliant and seems to come effortlessly to this living legend of the silver screen. The Costello character is ruthless and Machavellian to say the least, he ""adopts"" the young Colin character (Conor Donovan, played as an adult by Matt Damon) who grows up to join the Massachusetts State Police, thereby giving the crime boss an inside man within law enforcement, and the perfect ally to protect and expand his various rackets. From Nicholson's opening line, he outshines the other actors with screen presence alone, and then eclipses them altogether with his classic line deliveries. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio has grown to full maturity as a true A-List actor. His third collaboration with Scorsese (following 2002's ""Gangs Of New York"" and 2004's ""Tha Aviator"") as police cadet-turned-undercover cop Billy Costigan is perfectly performed, illustrating Scorsese's continued ability to draw out DiCaprio's best interpretations. Matt Damon revisits familiar territory as a South Boston cop, this role recalls his performance in ""Good Will Hunting"" complete with authentic Boston accent. Damon also works well under Scorsese, portraying the duplicitous, crooked cop Colin; his performance is sharp and well-balanced. <br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg's character Staff Seargent Dingnam is all wit and constant profanity, giving him the majority of the hilarious one-liners and zingers in this film. Martin Sheen provides a perfect counterbalance to Wahlberg's character as Chief Queenan. Providing further evidence of perfect casting is Alec Baldwin, who portrays Lieutenant Ellerby, the most crass and humorous of the veteran officers. Ray Winstone also delivers a superb performance as the menacing, authoritative Mr. French, Costello's most trusted enforcer. <br/><br/>The music of The Rolling Stones constantly drones in and out during the film, providing excellent atmosphere for a crime flick set on the mean streets. <br/><br/>""The Departed"" is a instant classic, a great movie for fans of gritty, violent crime dramas ala ""The Sopranos"". Scorsese continues to exhibit his mastery for this genre of film, his best work to date."
"Tyler_Seymour_Wallach","10","2","5","11 April 2007"," Scorsese + DiCaprio = Amazing... Three Times Over
","So, I've seen this movie for the second time, and it is still as effective as the 1st time I saw it, about 3 months ago. This is a recommended watch to all fans of either : Martin Scorsese, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg, Great Gangster Film or Great Cinema in General. In Martin Scorsese's 3rd film of this decade and 3rd straight film starring Leonardo DiCaprio he delivers only as he could. Leo and him have shown that they are an unstoppable force in the film industry, throwing out their (most likely) 3rd straight Best Picture contender. William Monahan does an excellent job adapting this film from the original Japanese films the Internam Affair Trilogy. He did such a great job recreating this film for America and other audiences alike. The most unlikely of events happened, the audience and critics alike loved this remake, unlike so many other films that failed to reach that goal. Combining the best of the best from the trilogy, he creates 1 of the Best Adapted Screenplays of the Year. Surprisingly this is only his 2nd screenplay written in his career (the 1st being Kingdom of Heaven). Though the fact that this film contains vituperation, it is astounding the potency is not lost or even degraded in the process.<br/><br/>Mr. Scorsese's direction of this transcending cinematic masterpiece. He has total control of such a mob-thriller for the 1st time since Goodfellas and boy does he make it count. With perfectly placed violence, excellent pacing and fantastic scenes of intensity, it is no wonder why he is 1 of the moguls of Direction, for last generation, this generation and hopefully for the next generation to come. This is probably the 1st time I have ever mentioned this but, Ellen Lewis has done an amazing job casting the perfect actors for the roles they were placed. The best cast I have come across in a long time, and all thanks to Madame Lewis. After re watching this film I finally see what was so good about Mark Wahlberg. He does a really good job, but still, is #3 or #4 from the film, in my opinion. Though he does a great job with his anger and rage it is more surprising that in his midst of rage he is hilarious as well. The perfect combination, glad to see others enjoy his performances as well. Vera Farmiga is having her breakthrough year with 2 great performances, the other being in Running Scared. She is the extra subplot in the film, and could've been left out, but without her the emotional longevity is much less effective. She has great facial expressions and good use of tone in her lines. Nothing too spectacular, and in my personal opinion, she was better in her other film of 2006. Matt Damon, everyones precursor for Best Actor in a Leading Role in the summer, and now, is not in anyone's mind or on anyone's lists. Sadly overshadowed by 2 or 3 other men in the film did nothing for his performance. He was good, great portrayal of emotions, fantastic important scenes of tension, but for some reason, I felt it could've been stronger. Not saying he doesn't do a good job, but he could've expressed more rage in certain scenes, and more depression is other crucial scenes as well. Anyways, despite being under minded throughout the whole Award Season, he still her 1 of the better performances of the year. The funniest performance of the film easily comes to Ray Winstone who is also having a great year, starring in Breaking and Entering, The Propostion and the TV version of Sweeney Todd. He does a great job as Mr.French, delivering every scene with either a great punchline or a wonderful scene of emotion or action. Jack Nicholson is the most experienced actor of the lot, the Grandfather of Cinema some say. His performance was no less that excellent, playing Frank Costello a modern bad guy and a memorable character for years to come. He stole a lot of the scenes he was in and rightfully so. The fact that his performance was able to convince many that he was the character is fantastic. Many solid scenes, some funny, some intense but mostly all effective. Leonardo DiCaprio, the best performance in the film without a doubt, proving he will be 1 of the Best Actors in years to come. Teaming up with Martin Scorsese is the best thing he's ever done, and it has made him a sensational success. His performance is 1 to be reckoned with at the Oscars, due to the fact that he massively exceeds expectations, and if it weren't for Forest Whittaker, he would quite possibly be the #1 contender for the coveted prize.<br/><br/>I am definitely looking forward to The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt when it is released in 2008, marking ScoCaprio's 4th collaboration this decade. The film editing of this movie is very significant in the pacing of the film, seeing as the 150 minutes passed by seamlessly due to it. The score is very beautiful, but yet, does not make my list for Best Original Score, though it is receiving some very nice praises among critics and ""Buzzers"" alike. The cinematography is very nice, but nothing to spectacular. Very important in some scenes but not important in a lot of them. The make-up, though minor, is not insignificant in the least. Majorly important in fight scenes, it does what it needed to do to create the utmost effective effect."
"hellokeith51","2","2","5","10 April 2007"," lots of killing ..
","Oh how we are drawn to movies about people who do bad things. And no doubt those involved with this movie will receive countless awards for making it, as though they've given us something that made our day better. They use the F word about a thousand times(not that there's anything wrong with that). Ha! Albeit, the awards will be for such things as story continuity, structure, editing. Stuff like that. And great 'acting' too. While overlooking the subject matter. Makes no sense to me. Better someone hand out awards to the Iraqi terrorists for entertaining the world so well. The movie was indeed exciting & thrilling, and I couldn't stop watching the DVD rental once I started... was compelled to see if the 'good guys' survived. But it certainly didn't leave me feeling 'better'. Doesn't make me feel better to be reminded of how bad & despicable grown men can be. I won't be recommending it to my friends or family."
"Domski88","Null","2","5","7 April 2007"," Plot hole
","Warning: Spoiler.<br/><br/>Overall an excellent movie, and certainly Scorsese's best for a long time. However there is one obvious plot-hole which really spoiled the last third of the film for me.<br/><br/>It's this: when Capt Queenan dies, why doesn't Costigan simply call Dignam and tell him that whoever ordered the tail on Queenan must be the informant? Costigan actually explains this to Queenan immediately before his fall from the roof, so he is clearly aware of the significance of the tail, yet as soon as Queenan dies, Costigan fails to take this most obvious course of action.<br/><br/>Then Dignam's two weeks leave at this crucial junction feels contrived- a device to remove any protection from Costigan for the remainder of the film. The logic of the plot however should lead to the informant being found almost immediately- either via Costigan, Dignam (who cannot conceivably fail to make contact with Costigan even if Costigan doesn't call him), or by Alec Baldwin's character, who would surely order that Costigan be pulled out asap to sort out what just happened."
"pacmanmty","3","2","5","21 March 2007"," spoiler warning ...what a piece of c....
","Blame it on me. Probably too many years of going to the movies makes me skeptical or cynical, but to tell you the truth, I can not tolerate the ending of The Departed. What originally was made a movie about two individuals that begins to emphasize with their natural enemies because of their interaction with their surrounding environment is transformed thanks to Hollywood in a very potent movie about fatality and no honor among crooks. And the movie was absolutely marvelous until the last three minutes<br/><br/>That ending,..that freaking ending. Damon leaving the elevator and the dog that dodges him, Whalberg there to kill the ""bad guy"" and the damn rat on the window. Damn !!! Why not to finish the movie -like the original - with the ceremony of the deceased DiCaprio ? Why to kill the bad guy ? Whay they did that if not of because the ""moralistic Bushian"" way of life ?. Why not to understand that evil wins a lot of games ?<br/><br/>what a way to trash a movie !!! Imagine this, you are preparing a delicious dish at your house... and at the very end you add three spoons of crap (s.it) would you still eat it ? would you still think of that as a great dish ? do not fool yourselves.

"njmoorhe","4","2","5","13 March 2007"," Inexplicably terrible with amazing acting.
","Perhaps then worst Oscar winning film I've ever seen. How a movie could be so disappointing with such amazing acting is beyond me. There is little or no character development and several inexplicable plot choices. Without giving the film away, several things happened that made no sense other than (as my film-making father would say) ""the director said so."" I'm not sure that the failures of this film can be attributed to any of the executors of the film (director, actors, cameramen) since all of them seemed to execute the filming to near perfection. Rather, the failure is either with a shoddy script, poor editing choices (fault depends on the amount of control the director had), or a combination of the two. A viewer could easily find this to be one of the better films they have watched recently, or one of the worst, depending on several factors (including whether they are seeking a well developed). Look for the best, but prepare to be disappointed and perhaps confused."

","This film has a long runtime, but I have watched it a total of 11 times. I love it. It is literally the best movie that I have ever seen. The performances are flawless, every last one of them. As an actor, I felt so fueled and inspired by each and every character choice and performance by the actors. By the end of the movie I felt like I knew these characters, because of how much actual character work must have gone into them by the actors themselves. I will carry this film and the brilliantly crafted characters that the actors created with me for a lifetime. A huge acting and film making influence, and for me the best film ever created. See it, it is unforgettable, and I hope you feel the same way about it. The only way you could dislike it is to not have a brain."

I just watched Babel... & I told myself,god this movie should have won best picture,not The Departed, because in Babel the twists & turns are so well put, that its unbelievable. But in the Departed, the irony of Jack Nicholson trusting the only person he shouldn't trust is just stupid to me...I will NEVER forget the general laughter at the end of that movie,when all the brains were splattering on the walls. It was pointless and gratuitous and gave a false impression of the police. I mean there ARE moles but this was just gratuitous violence and a pointless depicting,very wrongly made. I'm sorry to say that this movie was too f***ing over-rated(excuse my language) but this movie was really realllllllyyy bad & boring. It had its cute scenes,for instance the misspelling on the envelope,that Leo made on purpose,so he could track it. & for those who are wondering WHAT was in the envelope that Leo gave to Matt's girlfriend(I don't remember her name anymore....it was THAT bad:P) well it was the evidence against the entire mafia, against jack Nicholson in particular, simply because he was completely surprised when he figured out that Matt was the mole;) hehe there you go I SAID IT! :P It was a bad movie, thats all I want to say. It was so cheesy & gory that it really died for me. Shame on you Scorsese....i am VERY disappointed."

Its a little different from the original, but thats OK, because it leaves some room for improvements in this movie.<br/><br/>The original was really good, filled with talented actors. So this one had to use talented actors. In this movie, they filled it with talented American actors. Nicholson, Damon, Leo are all talented actors that can actually act. Leo's acting impressed me the most, he's really improved since Titanic.<br/><br/>Then we get to the storyline, I actually like this storyline more than the original's one, they made a few subtle changes that improved the movie."

","Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) is a mole inside Costello's (Nicholson) crime gang. Colin Sullivan (Damon) is a mole inside the Boston Police Dept. When the cops and Costello find out each has a mole among them, things get more than interesting.<br/><br/>It is more than nice to have an all star cast performing an excellent story. This doesn't happen often and doesn't disappoint. Plus the fact that it moved along at such a lively pace the 2 ½ hours didn't seem like 2 ½ hours. One can easily see how this was nominated for Best Picture (which it won) and also how Martin Scorsese was nominated for Best Director (which he won). And, one can also see how some of the stars could have been nominated for Best Actor or Best Supporting Actor: DiCaprio, Damon or Nicholson (but none were). <br/><br/>But, there is one area that surely needs to be recognized and that is the film editing, and by-God it won for that too. This was a cat mouse-chess game and the shots went back and forth at a rapid pace at times and yet, and you didn't lose the thread. Great editing job.<br/><br/>This is a movie you have to stay with. If you give yourself an intermission while the DVD is still running, you may lose something you probably need to know later on. So pay attention.<br/><br/>When we saw the Academy Awards we saw Jack Nicholson looking like Mr. Clean, Lex Luthor, Kojack, or Daddy Warbucks (take your pick) and we feel the reason for this is because Jack saw himself in this movie and realized he had a really bad hair day all the way through. Also, did anyone but me notice some facial similarities between DiCaprio and Nicholson? Hmmmm.<br/><br/>Everything was excellent, the cinematography, the dialogue, the editing, the acting and yes, the music was, at times, very good too.<br/><br/>Violence:Yes, Sex: Yes, Nudity:Partial, Language:Yes"

","I rented this film to watch on Oscar night. Anticipating a classic Scorses film I was let down. While my opinion of Martin Scorses is and remains high I found too many issues to enjoy this film.<br/><br/>Casting: I found the cast to be odd. Matt Damon is a perennial stiff and lived up to that rap again. Baldwin and Sheen are C list celebs and seemed more of a favor to someone that anything. I thought Nicholson was excellent along with Decaprio and Wahlberg. I didn't get the point of Vera Farmiga at all. I still cant believe that Scorsese cast this movie. It seems like this cast was put upon him.<br/><br/>Screenplay: What a mess. What was all the cop killing at the end. Yeah that was pretty believable. What should have been a tightrope was more like a loose fishing line. I didn't buy the story almost from the start. While the movie should have focused on the gangsters we are treated to Matt and Vera playing house much of the time. This may be one of the worst screenplays of the last ten years in a highly acclaimed film. It was truly a mess.<br/><br/>Acting: The problems started with the casting and continued with some poor performances. Matt is the new Harrison Ford. A one trick pony with almost no acting range. Vera should go back to TV bits. Sheen, Bladwin overact constantly. Jack was well Jack. I think the biggest problem for me was not concentrating on the gangsters more. I just don't find Damon, Sheen, Farmigo, Baldwin very interesting.<br/><br/>As you can tell I wasn't impressed with the movie and I really wanted to be. I was concerned when I saw that Matt Damon was in the lead role. I really felt that Scorsese was looking for cash/fame/Oscar and took the bait. One of the old sayings is the masses are asses and I think this films popularity and awards confirm this.<br/><br/>Wait for this clunker to show up on HBO or Showtime."

The film is as dramatic as an Greek tragedy with Di Caprio performing magnificently, as has never done in such a depth and closeness to his role, thanks to director of course. So good as the good fellas with the only difference that the new super actors become mature and brilliantly flourish in this very film and will dominate next decades, as De Niro, Ceitel and so many did in the past, one of director's main assets"
"jeremy_campbell","7","2","5","19 February 2007"," The Departed - very good, but don't get carried away.
","Highly entertaining as this film is, it should not be Oscar worthy. It only goes to show the relative paucity of good Hollywood films in the past year that it has managed to get five nominations.<br/><br/>How a loyal remake of a fanciful gangster film can be up for Best Film and Best Director is beyond me.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it, and it could have carried on for another 30 minutes and still gripped me. Each actor was excellent, Wahlberg and big Jack stole the show.<br/><br/>But it seems to have escaped everyone's notice that the plot is comic book stuff. Goodfellas this is not. That film was entirely believable (for a start, it's a true story), and its impact was consequently much deeper. This is fantasy cops and robbers stuff, and is typical of the -sometimes excellent, sometimes dire - Hong Kong cop genre. These films are almost always forgettable, the focus on immediate gratification.<br/><br/>Adapting the story to a more western format took some skill, and should not be underestimated. The Bostonian flourishes and character development, particularly with Di Caprio's role, were commendable. But ultimately this is a television soap plot. It is great fun, and should not be missed. But to suggest it is Oscar worthy is too much. <br/><br/>Scorsese may get the sympathy vote as Best Director, but anyone suggesting this is his 'masterpiece' should take a long second look at Mean Streets, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy and Raging Bull, which remains one of the best Hollywood films ever made, and a true masterpiece. The fact that Scorsese failed to get Academy Awards for all of these is remarkable, but don't let it fool you. The Departed is great entertainment, and for that we should be thankful. Raging Bull is something more than just entertainment, and that is what Scorsese should be remembered for, Oscar or not."
"gurmcorp","1","2","5","2 February 2007"," Why The Divide In Loving Or Hating The Film - Its Like Marmite
","I have watched a number of Asian films over the past few years and have found them to be refreshing in the ideas they present to an audience as opposed to Hollywood where the majority of films seem to either be bogged down by having a special effects budget that needs filling or a complete act of mindless violence which can pass the time with some occasional thrill seeking. I can understand the need for the latter form of film, it can be entertaining to a degree but that is all it can provide, a simple short term solution. The basis and overall genius of ""The Departed"" lies in the fact that it cloned a pre-existing masterpiece that provides more than a short term fix of a film.<br/><br/>The original Infernal Affairs (on which The Departed is almost completely based on, and not just inspired by as Scorsese has stated)is a brilliant film, it stays in your mind and makes you think, its not a quick fix or light form of entertainment but a gripping and involving story between two men and their struggle to deal with the blurred boundaries of right and wrong.<br/><br/>I honestly read no reviews before watching the departed and had no idea it was based upon Infernal Affairs. I sat down expecting something good, I mean goodfellas was excellent so I assumed The Departed would be at least an on parr as Mr Scorseses previous works, but as the the film progressed I realised what the story was and that I had been greatly mistaken. It copied Infernal Affairs and at each scene my heart sank lower and lower as I felt the sheer mess the director had made of the originals work. Soo much about this film was wrong, it felt wrong, as if someone had stolen a beautiful piece of art and exchanged it for a toilet roll! I understand why people like the film, and the majority of those that do have probably not seen the original. If you have I think you will agree it is a superior movie in almost all aspects, I mean it was one of Hong Kongs most popular movies of all time. Had it not been for my partner being from Hong Kong and urging me to watch some of Asia's finest films I admit I probably would never have watched Infernal Affairs and would therefore have ignorantly liked the departed and voted it in the top 250 movies. It doesn't deserve it, I plead with you to watch the original and see for yourselves, you will not be disappointed, if anything you can watch the sequels and progress your love of the plot even further.<br/><br/>I realise my rating of the Departed is low but that is mainly out of respect to the original, I couldn't believe that Scorsese didn't even properly accredit Infernal Affairs well at least a large proprtion of the population still have no idea its a remake, what was he thinking! Anyway enough ranting basically you love The Departed because its a great story with great scenes and ideas and the cast does manage to carry off their individual performances well, especially Mr Nicholson who I found to be the only redeeming feature of the film. I feel for a remake to be justified it needs to at least add somethng new to the original material and provide the audience with a novel and unique perspective into the film. The departed i felt actually detracted from the original and did in no way improove upon the original. This leads on to why people hate it because it cloned a great story and some great scenes and ideas from another great film and in the majority of the movie it actually removed the strength and impact of certain scenes through a poor level of re-interpretations and lazy mundane camera work. Its obvious what side of the marmite divide im on but i do feel the quality of Infernal Affairs far surpasses that of The Departed, Even though the latters budget was substantially higher."

I mean, to satisfy you guys does it have to be the most insanely brilliant movie possible? Where do you even find movies you'd rate a 10? Of course it's not perfect, but at least it was intelligent. The ending was a bit much, sure, but it's still better than any thing I've seen lately by far. Because I think this movie drew a fairly intelligent audience with higher expectations than most, I think it's getting knocked unfairly. It's not perfect but I still think it's just so much better than practically any other movie in the last few years. If people are only giving it a 5 or lower, how would you rate ""The Holiday"" or some piece of dribble? Maybe it's not up to your expectations, but on a scale in comparison to other movies, this clearly tops the majority. I REALLY enjoyed the movie, liked the acting, the storyline, the direction, everything. My biggest problem with the movie was the bizarre Boston accents...even Matt Damon's and Wahlberg's were a mess...and they're from Boston! Both my parents grew up there so I've heard some pretty strong ones, but they didn't sound like that.

","'The Departed' is one spectacular film. Martin Scorsese has directed another masterpiece. The action, suspense, tension, excitement that this production generates is amazing. Each shot keeps your attention - you can't take your eyes off the actors. And what actors! Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan is so good that he even keeps up with the legendary Jack Nicholson - scene for scene. And often surpasses the master. Mr. DiCaprio will definitely be nominated for the Academy Award this year and should win (but the ultra-liberal academy will vote for Will Smith). The aforementioned Jack Nicholson is just plain wonderful as Frank Costello. Matt Damon is chillingly perfect as Colin Sullivan, giving a superb performance. This is certainly Matt Damon's year, with this film and 'The Good Shepherd', both 2006 releases. Alec Baldwin is in both films as well, and boy has he become a great character actor. Personally, I think he still has lead actor quality and ability. In 'The Departed' he is great, just great. One more actor I wish to mention is Mark Wahlberg. Mark Wahlberg has never given a bad performance - that said, he is amazing as Dignam, the hot-tempered detective. The rest of the cast is fantastic. Scorsese's casting choices are right on target. The soundtrack music is terrific. I noticed that there are two versions of it. Guess I'll have to get both. Great Film!"
"wmjahn","4","2","5","28 December 2006"," And the audience laughed ...
","Well, I went to the cinema yesterday evening to give Marin SCORSESEs new so-called ""masterpeiece "" a viewing and there are indeed a couple of positive things one can say about this movie: 1.) It could have been a really nice little mean & dirty B-movie (the storyline is indeed great and would have made fantastic B-movie material), but it was not to be. 2.) DiCAPRIO does indeed give an outstanding performance, much better than I had expected. 3.) It's a nice time-killer and certainly watchable 4.) There's one really terrific scene very much at the beginning, when DiCAPRIO beats up two molesters in a small deli. This scene has a raw quality and utterly believable eruption of violence, which is unmatched in the later scenes of the movie.<br/><br/>That said, there are unfortunately so many (needless!) implausibilities, logical impossibilities and story-holes, that the movie as a whole is unfortunately a far cry from the ""masterpiece"" it has been called by some critics. In fact Scorsese seems to be out of sync with his material fro a few years already and has not achieved any major artistic achievement since the days he has made such great movies as RAGING BULL, GOODFELLAS and THE AGE OF INNOCENCE. Personally I consider this a pity and can actually not imagine Scorsese has not himself realized the above mentioned and down below discussed shortcoming, which are:<br/><br/>1.) The major implausibility or even logical impossibility is Mark DAMON walking in some high-$$$ fancy apartment - as a young policeman - and either renting or buying this (I think more renting). He simply could not afford this with the average or below-average income he is supposed to have. Looked at critically by the guy, who would rent it to him, he utters some line that somebody would guarantee for his payments, but at that time of the movie, the only rich person he's connected with is the molester played (over.played, unfortunately) by Nicholson. As the story progresses and the police has realized that they have a traitor in their own lines, all people are checked in detail, but obviously nobody takes any notice of the question, how DAMON can afford this style of living (even now equipped with an average-wage-earner girlfriend). Come one, that's not a minor implausibility, given the fact that everybody's lives are checked so much in detail!! And it's completely useless! There's no need for the story to have DAMON live in such an expensive apartment. he could have easily rented a small affordable one and the following story would have developed the same.<br/><br/>2.) Now I am certainly no moralist, when it comes to foul language, but with foul language you have the same problem as with exceeding violence. With more and more of the same, it does not only get redundant, but it also wears thin, get's implausible and even ridiculous. Already at one of the very first scenes with DAMON he calls other footballs players some (here) unprintable words. He does not call them that once, but he calls them that some 4 or 5 times, speaking as fats as a machine-gun and already after that scene you ask yourself, if the guy is really in control of himself (which he'd certainly need to be, with that story to follow). The whole picture goes on like that, every 10th to 15th word is ****(in), ****(in), **** sucker and whatever else. Everybody (!) seems to talk that way, the low mobsters, the high mobsters, the low and the high policeman, only the few women are an exception. Now, is that believable that really EVERYBODY shouts obscene words in every fitting and unfitting scene? I very much doubt this and less would certainly have been more and more impressive. A needless waste of credibility again. (I do have an explanation for that nevertheless: SCORSESE wants to show us - the audience - how similar the good and the bad guys are ... well, an old story and not the right way to tell us that, I'd say).<br/><br/>3.) NICHOLOSON is usually good when playing a mobster. And that's how he starts. He does look sinister, does some SHINING-faces, does a lot of wise-cracking and the movie strolls on. As time progresses, Nicoloson seems to get out of sync with his role. He does some wisecracking, he makes faces, utters lines here, utters lines there and that how it goes on until a real low-point, when NICHOLSON does some wise-cracking and makes the face of a rat. For the first time people laughed in the audience, but it wasn't the laugh of apprehension, it was that of disbelieve and I'd say SCORSESE would not have cherished theses laughs. As the movie progresses NIOCHOLSON becomes more and more unbelievable in his role as a hard-boiled mobster. Wise-cracking once in a while is fine, but also in this case: (much) less would have been more ... In fact as the movie progresses one starts to wonder if the mobster NICHOLSON plays is really intelligent enough to get a top position in organized crime, to become ""the king"" as he himself seems it and to hold such an organization alive with wise-cracking and his mimic antics. I VERY MUCH doubt it. I also see the difficulty of even a seasoned director like SCORSESE to say a ""no"" to NICHOLSONs antics in shooting, but that doesn't change the impression of implausibility that rests with the viewer. A middle-""management"" guy in organized crime, yeah, but the top leader in Boston ... no!<br/><br/>Since I am only allowed 1000 words, this is continued at the discussion board!"

","Dear Marty:<br/><br/>Well, you really blew it this time! Who the hell were you trying to please -- the teenagers who loved ""Reservoir Dogs?"" The infantile sadists who consider ""Pulp Fiction"" a masterpiece? What's the point in rehashing ""Donnie Brasco"" or ""Prince of the City"" and simply adding more violence? In fact, what's the point of the whole movie? That sooner or later we're all going to die, some of us by handguns? No kidding! <br/><br/>""The Departed"" is not only one of the most dreary, pointless, and ridiculously violent films ever to shame the silver screen, it represents a new low for one of America's greatest filmmakers -- you, remember?! <br/><br/>What were you thinking? That you needed the paycheck? That you wanted to work with some great actors and your fave of the moment, Leo ""he's no Howard Hughes"" DiCaprio? Face it, Marty -- whatever you were thinking -- you should have thought harder! This is a cold, calculated, implausible film riddled with plot holes and worse, it has no heart. And what do we gain from it? Is there anyone out there who feels they've somehow benefited from it? If so, I'd like to meet them -- then recommend a good child therapist!<br/><br/>Rather than a fascinating exploration of semi-psychotic behavior -- you know, the great films you used to make -- ""The Departed"" has nothing remotely interesting to say. It belongs in the cinema of juvenile nihilism carved out by an ex-video store clerk back in the last century (which I thought -- at least HOPED -- audiences had outgrown by now). <br/><br/>Marty, remember when Cassavettes saw ""Boxcar Bertha"" and told you you'd spent a year of your life on a piece of s**t? Well, if he were alive today and saw ""The Departed"" he'd tell you the same thing -- and with good reason! ""The Departed"" isn't a Scorsese picture any more than ""Boxcar Bertha"" was. It's a sensationalist Tarantino knockoff with echos of ""Goodfellas"" and more than one Lumet film -- but with none of the humor, intelligence or compassion of any of those pictures. <br/><br/>As far as the high-profile cast goes, Nicholson is no match for Pesci in the psychopathic sadist department, and Damon and DiCaprio, in all their one-note, tough guy splendor, are no match for Liotta or Depp. Sure, they're believable, but they're also deadly dull. Same with Baldwin, Sheen and Wahlberg, whose absurd character seems torn from a comic book. Vera Farmiga as the beautiful girl psychiatrist is sexy enough, but seems to be in a different movie -- one that actually has a connection to reality. The audience wants to connect with her, but since no one cares about any of the other characters (and unlike ""Goodfellas,"" we're never quite sure WHO the main character is) we become as desensitized toward her as everyone else. Did anyone really care when Leo or Matt were killed? Did anyone shed as much as a tear? <br/><br/>We CARED about Henry Hill, we CARED about Travis Bickle. You made us care, Marty -- With your genius, you made us love them! No one gives a rat's ass about Damon and DiCaprio. In fact I'd be willing to bet no one even knew Damon's character's name (Billy, was it?) until the end credits.<br/><br/>Can you imagine, Marty, anyone watching one of your films in the 70s or 80s and not knowing Travis Bickle's name? Rupert Pupkin's? Jake LaMotta's? ""The Departed"" (and I'm only giving it a rating of 2 because I love you, man -- plus Ballhaus's cinematography was great) shouldn't be grouped with the rest of your films any more than ""Bertha,"" it shouldn't be allowed to tarnish the real Scorsese pictures like ""Taxi Driver"" or ""Mean Streets."" To paraphrase one of your earliest efforts: it's just not you, Marty! More like the work of a cold-blooded punk who grew up on exploitation films and comic books (you sure Tarantino didn't ghost direct while you took a vacation?)<br/><br/>Ultimately, it comes down to the script, and William Monahan (whoever he is) is no Paul Schrader, just as last time out, Josh Logan was no Mardik Martin. In order to be at your best, you've got to WORK with the best , right? So what's with all the 30 year-olds who haven't got a clue as to story structure,character development... who haven't a got a clue, PERIOD?!?<br/><br/>All right -- relax and simmer down. It's not all bad news, I promise. And now that you've spent the last year of your life on a piece of s**t, it's time to get back on track, back to the stuff that matters -- like stories and characters people will actually care about (and I don't mean ""The Aviator""!) <br/><br/>As Harry Cohn, Jack Warner or any great studio chief might have said back before accountants started greenlighting films: give us characters<br/><br/>we can love, stories we're fascinated by. Leave the comic book gunplay and Mexican standoffs to the 25 year-old Tarantino wannabes. You're too smart to be playing their brain-dead game, Marty! Too far along to stoop to their stupid level. And tell me this: what would John Huston have to say about this picture? What would Robert Aldrich? How about Howard Hawks? Or Stanley Kubrick?? You've<br/><br/>lowered your standards, Marty, THESE are the people you've got to measure up to -- not a bunch of prepubescent Tarantino nerds who spend their lives on the Internet and playing video games!<br/><br/>But don't worry, Marty -- I haven't lost faith. And please don't YOU lose faith, either. And if you have, think of the words of the great Lester Burnham, who in ""American Beauty"" wisely said something we should all remember: <br/><br/>""It's never too late to get it back.""<br/><br/>Love, <br/><br/>a Scorsese fanatic (in spite of it all)"

Thelma Schoonmaker can't fix that error in the script. There is no tempo to the film. DiCaprio is good, very good, but you keep wishing the film he were in was equal to his role. The music is literally unoriginal and pointless. Anyone who says this is Marty Scorsese's best film and adds that ""welcome back"" crap doesn't know what they're saying. He isn't back - he's in deep hibernation. I heard better dialog in M-Squad thirty years ago. Nothing gets personal. Pirates of the Caribbean is a better film. So, be prepared.

Many of the original classic lines from the film did make it to this Hollywood knock-off such as, cutting up Leonardo DiCaprio and feeding him to the poor.<br/><br/>The method of passing messages involving the use of Morse code in the original far surpasses the method of using a cell phone text message as well.<br/><br/>If you really did enjoy ""The Departed,"" then I highly suggest renting or purchasing the original. If you enjoyed the original, then I would not disappointed yourself by watching this remake."
"writerasfilmcritic","7","2","5","11 October 2006"," Gimme a Break! ""The Departed"" is Pretty Good but Far From Great
","""The Departed"" is a fairly entertaining movie, although about 2/3 through, it definitely drags. There is simply too much reliance on cell phones as if, ""Oh, wow, ain't it something the way we can call one another at any time and, gee, isn't Generation X really interesting to watch?"" The answer is a resounding NO! You get really tired of yet another ringing cell phone and another kid picking up and blabbing away as if it's so important and so ""heavy."" Leonardo DeCaprio gives an uneven performance as the undercover cop who has successfully infiltrated the Irish Mafia in Boston. He starts out well, especially when he is being taunted by his superiors who are hoping to recruit him for undercover work, but it becomes increasingly evident that he has copied the characterization effectively utilized by Johnny Depp for ""Donnie Brasco,"" a better movie about an undercover cop who has infiltrated the mafia. Even his facial expressions start to resemble too much those used by Depp. At times, his character does hit a sort of stride, but generally, the ride strains credulity. Were I the crime boss, I'd have greased this punk the first time I suspected he might be a rat, because his denials are unconvincing. However, his IS a likable performance, despite its limitations, and I especially liked his budding romance with the sexy young psychiatrist. Unfortunately, the buildup doesn't really deliver, save for an abbreviated sex scene, mostly because the plot doesn't allow it. DeCaprio's nemesis, Matt Damon, the gangster mole in the Boston PD, never gains our sympathy. This guy is a piece of sh*t, pure and simple, and you might expect that he had some redeeming qualities, which he does not. That he gets away with all his inside machinations and is never seriously suspected by anyone in power, once again, asks us to suspend disbelief a tad too much. Jack Nicholson, as the ruthless crime boss the mole often refers to simply as ""Dad,"" hands in a reasonable performance that has been referred to as ""absolutely amazing,"" which it simply isn't. There are one or two interesting moments, such as his imitation of ""the dirty rat gnawing at cheese,"" but he fails to convince us that he is evil personified or incredibly mean and scary. This Nicholson is definitely not as good as the crazy caretaker of ""The Shining,"" nor for that matter, the inspired bum of ""Ironweed."" He's pretty good in this movie, but not great, and definitely not as good as De Niro or Pacino in similar roles. In fact, certain of the gang members, especially his right-hand man, do a more effective job of exuding pure evil. <br/><br/>This is not to say that ""The Departed"" is a bad film, only that it is clearly flawed. And the ending, jeez, it definitely IS surprising, I'll give it that, lending further credence to the idea that Scorcese wasn't really serious when he made this thing. It comes off as black comedy rather than the gruesome drama of his earlier efforts at portraying organized crime. But something about the ending, however startling, doesn't quite add up, if you think about if for a moment. With all the violence, one is almost tempted to push aside lingering doubts about several developments, but you won't get a chance to consider it until after the credits roll. The final scene sets things about as ""right"" as can be expected, but it's almost too neat and there is something unsettled here that all the hype can't sweep under the rug. If you can get in to see this flick for a discount price, it's probably worth it, because it is reasonably entertaining most of the time, otherwise, I'd advise you wait until it comes out on DVD."

The Screenplay writer only read the script and never watched the original. They waste a lot of money to buy the story! The original is much more intense and emotional. I see nothing in this one. I feel nothing to be honest. I think you need to feel something even you are not from Boston. What kind of crime sense they put up? ""Micro processor""? Give me a break!

"whcb25","7","2","5","9 October 2006"," Doesn't live up to expectations
","After coming out of the cinema yesterday, having watched The Departed I was in the mindset that it was good, not as good as the original Infernal Affairs but almost. However, when I was tossing and turning in my bed last night unable to sleep I had a longer think about it.<br/><br/>The more I thought about it, the worse it seemed in comparison to the Hong Kong version. The problem that comes to mind with American remakes of Asian films seems to be that they are unable to leave anything to the imagination. The Departed last over 2 and a half hours which is over an hour longer than the original. Why? Primarily because they obviously didn't have any confidence in the audience to work anything out for themselves. (Understandable if they were thinking that most of the audience would be American i guess).<br/><br/>The other reason that it lasted for so much longer, is because they tried to cram bits of all three of the HK Infernal affairs films into one. As well as that they fiddled around with little buts of the plot and characters. My one main criticism being the portrayal of Tony Lau's character by Matt Damon. In the original Infernal affairs you were never certain whether he was good or bad, and there was always the feeling that he may turn good in the end. Matt Damons character always appeared bad which spoiled the atmosphere of the film.<br/><br/>I was trying to think if there was anything in The Departed that was better than Infernal Affairs. Its one slight saving grace is Jack Nicolson as the baddie, but hey everyone knows Jack Nicolson can play a bad guy!! And the music was kinda alright, what with Pink Floyd and all ~ but the music from the original was good too ...<br/><br/>I'm not trying to say that it wasn't a good film. And I'm sure if I hadn't seen IA first I would have liked it just as it was. But in comparison HK wins hands down in my opinion.<br/><br/>One last thing, I hear Scorcese has a reputation for violence, but was there really any need to have that much!"

"DonFishies","9","2","5","7 October 2006"," Another excellent addition to the ever-growing cannon of Scorsese films
","By far, I think Martin Scorsese is my favourite film director. He has a solid film resume under his belt, and despite losing all five of his Best Director Oscar nominations, continues to pump out movies. When his movies are good, they are usually absolutely fantastic. When his movies are bad, even then they still have some form of redeeming quality saving it from full ostracizing. And while I was a bit apprehensive about him doing a remake of the Asian film Infernal Affairs, I have now realized that I was wrong. The Departed brings Scorsese back to his roots on the mean streets, and back to what he does best.<br/><br/>The Departed (named after what people are commonly referred to after passing on) chronicles the stories of two Boston police officers, both involved in the continued case to apprehend infamous mobster, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). One is Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), a kid with a not-so-great family history who goes undercover within Costello's group soon after graduation. The other, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), is a member of Costello's group undercover within the police department, quickly moving up the ranks. Costigan and Sullivan do not know each other, but as the film heats up, both began seeking out the other.<br/><br/>The film is just about phenomenal. I went in with high expectations, and came out totally and utterly impressed.<br/><br/>I refused to watch Affairs on principle of being so hyped for this film, and to a point, I think this helped. I knew some basic outlines and ideas of what happened in the original version, but as they played out on screen here, they look just as astonishing as I could imagine. The film is downright intense during many sequences. The cinematography and editing is seamless and absolutely awestriking. There were a few obvious nodes to his older works, but for the most part, is generally what we have come to expect from Scorsese and his films. As well, the writing is sharp and extremely strong. You may find yourself laughing hysterically at a few of the things people say, but you will also sit in fear of these people. Everyone here is a bad, yet highly realistic person. So when one of these characters makes some great jokes, you will be conflicted as to the proper reaction to give.<br/><br/>I had no problem with Gangs of New York or The Aviator, but you could tell that Scorsese was having a bit of trouble with the ambitious projects. Seeing him here, back in the same style of film as the likes of Goodfellas and Mean Streets, just brought a smile to my face after watching the entire film. You can tell the precise touches of a Scorsese film from miles away, and this film is no exception. He brings a fine art out of these dark streets like no one else can. And of course, he has the most perfect music selection of any Hollywood director currently alive and employed. He uses them to make his undeniably brilliant and memorable moments all that much better, and as per always, he succeeds.<br/><br/>DiCaprio and Damon are excellent in their roles (albeit it took a little bit before I was very trusting of either of their accents). Their slow deterioration and the fear slowly creeping in on them is an absolutely pleasure to watch. While DiCaprio gets a lot more screen time and is fleshed out more, Damon is definitely the better actor, and had the better performance. These two are believable and frightening all at once. As the film keeps moving and you get more of a sense of who these guys really are, these feelings only continue to progress. Nicholson is in top form here. He chews up scenery left and right, and practically steals the carpet right out from the other two. While I saw shades of The Joker in his performance, this is still one of those essentially totally evil acting roles. You cannot help but be scared by this guy, and seeing such a masterful actor in such a great director's hands, is just too memorable of an idea to miss.<br/><br/>The supporting cast, which includes Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, Ray Winstone, Anthony Anderson and Vera Farmiga are all superb in their small roles. None of them can even hold a candle to the other three, but their valiant try cannot go unrewarded. Farmiga and Wahlberg are particular standouts, which didn't not surprise me at all granted his newer material. They are a strong ensemble, and they bring out the great movie watching style even more.<br/><br/>If there were anything wrong with the film, it would be the pace of it all. Everyone is on the ball (even through blood-saturated death sequences), but the editing is not completely. At some points, particularly the first hour and the last thirty minutes, the film just whizzes right by. But in others, the film just slows right down. It makes the film feel totally uneven. Some exposition scenes just go a bit too long, and others are just straight and right to the point. I know that the film relies on all the exposition (and the graphic violence, which never lets up), but some of it just felt forced and a bit awkward. They make the film seem a whole lot longer than it really is. It is only a small quibble in an otherwise fantastic film, but still worthy of mention.<br/><br/>On the whole, The Departed is one hell of a movie. Packed with strong performances and a great story, this is another excellent addition to the ever-growing cannon of Scorsese films. It obviously is not as good as some of those films, but it makes an astonishing contribution to the library. I can only hope it is recognized at Oscar time for how memorable a film it is.<br/><br/>9.5/10."
"fertilecelluloid","9","2","5","7 October 2006"," Scorsese's best since ""Casino"" is a masterpiece
","This is Martin Scorsese's best film since ""Casino"" and another classic to add to the director's incredible oeuvre. It signifies the return of the brilliant director to the streets he knows so well. A remake of ""Infernal Affairs"", a great Hong Kong film, it sticks closely to the plot of its source, but it pumps greater depth into all the characters and is a harsher, grittier piece. Every sequence is stamped with Scorsese's sizzling hot, take-no-prisoners style, and every music cue is inspired. The performances, from Ray Winstone's Mr. French to Leonardo de Caprio's Billy Costigan to Matt Damon's Colin Sullivan to Mark Wahlberg's Dignam are superb. This is Caprio's break-out movie and I loved him in this. He carries a large burden on his shoulders, but he carries it with total conviction and finally busts out of his Pretty Boy bubble. Also worth noting is Alec Baldwin's killer turn as the gruff, no-nonsense Ellerby and Vera Farmiga's pitch perfect performance as the police psychologist who takes her work very personally. Michael Baullhaus, who also shot ""Goodfellas"", creates stunning, organic visuals. Thelma Schoonmaker, who cuts every one of Scorsese's films, delivers a masterpiece of clarity and visual kinetics. Everything works here. Everything resonates. Everything means something. Everything pays off. The film is a textbook example of how to make a film with substance. And how refreshing it was to see a film not filled to the gills with flashy cutting and ostentatious camera-work. This is dynamite film-making that feels like a return to the dirt, grime and psychological insanity of ""Mean Streets""."
"dslacker","8","2","5","7 October 2006"," Excellent - but not as good as Infernal Affairs - SPOILERS
","***** Contains Spoilers ******<br/><br/>The Departed takes the Hong Kong classic ""Infernal Affairs"" and moves it to Boston. Skipping yet another plot summary, I'll concentrate on strengths and weaknesses. The writing, directing, and acting is absolutely first rate. Scorscase has assembled a great cast. Unfortunately, Jack Nicholson ONCE AGAIN feels the need to do slapstick and face-muggings in many places where simple acting would have been better. Leo DiCaprio gives what may be his best performance to date - he's riveting as a man so deeply uncover that he's losing his way and losing his mind - thanks to the immense pressure he's under. Having said that, I must also say that Tony Leung's performance in the original was even better. Mr. Leung is probably the best actor in Asia and maybe anywhere. Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, and others also do exceptional work.<br/><br/>My nit-pick is this: The thing that elevated ""Infernal Affairs"" to classic status was not only the intricate story (that is preserved in ""Departed"") but the emotional connection that the audience had with the main characters - even with subtitles. When Tony Leung's good cop went down, it was devastating. When Leo DiCaprio's good cop went down it too elicited gasps from the audience I was with. But it was immediately followed by several other shootings and by the end many audience members were engaging in nervous laughter at the over-the-top violence. There was so much violence in ""Departed"" that the each occurrence held very little meaning and very little emotion. In ""Infernal Affairs"" most of the violence evoked true feelings in the audience. <br/><br/>I highly recommend ""Departed"" - its an excellent film - but rent the ""Infernal Affairs"" DVD - and watch it with subtitles - the dubbed version is crap."

","Sorry Martin, this felt very under par in terms of quality. There were parts of the movie where people within the crowd could feel the energy of a scene which lost its aim. There were laughs at parts where normal human beings would normally not laugh. Some of the lines were terrible. The editing at times looked like something out of a really bad student film. But what kept me going was the acting. When it was solid, it was SOLID. Matt and Leo are fan-freakin-tastic. The complexity of each of their characters dealing with their surroundings and the dynamic between Damon and Farmiga is amazing. Very true to life. But unfortunately the movie would anti-gravitize itself with a scene, sadly usually involving Jack Nicholson, which a line would be said or something would happen that seemed entirely out of place. Maybe that was the point to add a bit of awkward realism. But from a movie-going standpoint, it ruined the flow of certain parts. Over-all it was entertaining and the acting was phenomenal but definitely not a classic. I think Scorcese can definitely do better.<br/><br/>I don't think I've seen so many people shot in the head in a movie before."

I don't see why a movie should be ""one of the greatest movies of this year"" (or even more) just because of great actors. There are way too many twists in the plot and at some point I just didn't care anymore. I hope that people will start judging a movie more because of its content rather than the names attached to it. There is one huge plus this movie has to offer though, and that is the beautiful cinematography. The setting, the colors, the atmosphere - all of that was great.

","Sometimes you see a movie in which everybody is so thrilled to be putting on this show, that their sheer joy in entertaining you explodes from the screen and burrows into the audience's collective imagination. You can tell that these actors, these filmmakers, everybody involved in this production, you can tell they were busting at the seams with excitement. Nobody was ashamed of their influences here; Jack Nicholson's character is a giddy rebirth of Johnny Friendly from ON THE WATERFRONT, oozing menace and self-entitlement. William Monahan takes Siu Fai Mak's excellent script and bumps up the humor, the tragedy...yeah, and a whole lot of Boston slang.<br/><br/>There's a sheen of Hollywood artifice that some might decry but that I think contributes to the thrill of the show; after all, we know all these guys are playing make-believe anyway, right? Who cares if a soundstage in New York is subbing for a bachelor loft with a view of a Boston landmark? Point is, this movie has so much going for it, even what it doesn't have going for it works for it anyway.<br/><br/>Fans of the Hong Kong original will immediately note the difference in endings, and I'm still deliberating this one. !!!! SPOILER !!!! Damon getting popped in the end is, supposedly, the ""right"" thing. However, it means that his lover betrayed him, or did she? See, what ambiguity it robs from the original's ending it adds in a new shade.<br/><br/>Does this mark the return of Scorcese? It certainly is a very good sign, if it is a sign, of things to come. I for one hope this isn't the last kind of this film he does. He knows how to make these toughs work on screen...it's a rare gift."
"turloughmcaleenan","9","2","5","7 October 2006"," Scorcese's best since 'Goodfellas'
","I went to see 'The Departed' last night and was simply blown away by the acting, directorial technique and story. Other things that really sprang to my attention was the noir lighting employed - check out how Nicholson is portrayed in the film's opening scenes or the Chinatown night scenes. The performances were superb. Mark Wahlberg gave one of the best performances I've seen him do as the committed, odious Boston detective. Di Caprio was excellent as the informer caught between his police handlers Wahlberg and Martin Sheen's fatherly cop and Jack Nicolson's flamboyant crime boss. Matt Damon was great too but I thought one of the actors who really shone was Vera Farmiga as his psychiatrist girlfriend. Her acting is so natural and realistic that she should get a Oscar nomination for best supporting actress. Ray Winstone gave a really good performance too as Nicholson's right hand man though unfortunately he struggled many times with the Boston accent as he dipped into a London drawl. He falls into the same league as the likes of Michael Caine and Jude Law, as being an English actor who cannot really pull off an American accent. You wonder where the voice coaches are. This is distracting and to me a little unprofessional - if you are in a movie this big and getting paid that much get the accent right!<br/><br/>The storyline of two informers in the Boston mob and police force really brings out the best in all the actors concerned, though I will say that at times somethings are not properly explained. <br/><br/>(Possible spoiler!) The plot is really complex to say the least and in a scene where DiCaprio follows Damon's character into Chinatown whilst being communicated with by cell phone we are not clearly told who is actually contacting him.<br/><br/>(Possible spoiler!) There is also the distraction of a love triangle between DiCaprio's character, Farmiga's & Matt Damon's which I thought was not really necessary and distracted you from the overall story of cops versus crime lord. Also in true Scorcese style this has one of the bloodiest endings I have ever seen in a film.<br/><br/>Lastly Jack Nicholson I thought was excellent though I thought he was just playing 'Jack' all over again. Where is the fear when this character enters a scene? I felt he was reprising a pseudo version of his 'Joker character from Batman. His turn was mostly blackly comedic and his character did not really prove to be a deranged psychopath - more another turn of Nicholson at his charismatic comedic best. This is why I thought he was miscast, although I can't think of many other actors who could have stepped into his shoes - maybe De Niro at a push.<br/><br/>But overall this is one of the best films Scorcese has ever made and the best film you will probably see all year."

Yes it is based on the 2002 Hong Kong film entitled ""Infernal Affairs"", and Scorcese is so respectful that he actually notes this in the closing credits.<br/><br/>Prepare for a a no-holds-barred all out blazing explosion of film making! And so much fun to watch. If the ""f"" word bothers you, stay home. It may rival any Tarantino flick for harsh, but real in-this-world language. If violence bothers you, stay home. There are some moments of extremely brutal and realistic violence and bloodshed. On the other hand, if you are a fan of complex story lines, amazing cinematography, top level acting and crackling dialogue, rush out now to see this film.<br/><br/>Oh my ... the acting is as good as it gets (pun intended) with Jack Nicholson as the personification of EVIL as Mob boss Frank Costello. This is a very bad man and Jack is in his element. Sure the guy is a great actor and can pull off fluff like insomnia with Diane Keaton, but this is the Jack that we have loved for decades. He literally spews venom with his lines and facial expressions. Matt Damon, back in his Boston comfort zone (remember ""Good Will Hunting"") pulls off the role of informant with a truly believable lack of conscience that will hit you in the gut. Now what to say about Leonardo DiCaprio? I promise to never call him ""Little Leo"" again! He is now a man and flashes the acting maturity that Scorcese has been pushing him towards for a few years. Sure, he steals some mannerisms from DeNiro (watch him flick a cigarette) but his simmering emotions are plastered on his face throughout and trust me when I say, this dude has a LOT of emotion!.<br/><br/>As is Scorcese's custom, the supporting actors are also solid, believable and disappear into their roles. A bloated, washed-out Alec Baldwin is remarkable. Martin Sheen is fine and Mark Wahlberg had to be laughing out loud when he first read his lines ... I know I was! Few could pull off three or four of Wahlberg's hilarious lines without sounding like a stand-up comedian instead of a wily, veteran cop. Also fun to watch is relative newcomer Vera Farmiga who falls for both Leonardo and Damon in what is one of the few story lines that could have been better developed.<br/><br/>Toss in Scorcese's legendary pacing and camera action, an eclectic soundtrack that somehow combines the Rolling Stones, Van Morrison singing Pink Floyd (""Comfortably Numb""), Badfinger and Dvorcak, and the most complex use of cell phones yet, and you have one amazing film that will keep you glued to the screen. A bit of warning ... there is no good time for a potty break during this 2 1/2 hour film so don't buy the large drink!"

","Great movie which unbelievably gets worse from about half way through all the way to it's unsatisfactory conclusion. It's so close to being a classic but a series of bumbling mistakes contribute to it's downfall. Flawless acting, very good but not perfect direction and okay editing are here to be seen when all should be of the same standard coming from these people. The romantic triangle is preposterous when it could have been acceptable as a professional relationship and a separate romantic one and it never really serves the story any purpose but the tying up of the story is where it's classic status is strangled. The individuals outcomes are fine but the manner in which they end there are nowhere near the way they should have been. If Mexican stand offs weren't so overused.....However, recommended viewing none the less as it is captivating even as the story heads downhill, perhaps a compliment very few movies in history can boast. The possibility of Oscars will not be the main reason you will want to watch this again but I suspect this will get better and worse with repeated viewings."

","I'm a huge Scorsese fan, so I was extremely excited to see the Departed. The movie was as good, if not better then what i expected. LIke people have said, it's Scorse's best film since Goodfellas, or Casino. He seems to be returning to what he loves best: Organized Crime. It's also the first movie that I've been surprised at in years. Mostly, movie plots are fairly easy to figure out, but this had me bouncing of the walls. It has a high body count, which is always fun, meaning, classic violent scenes, only Scorsese could make look poetic. The Entire cast is perfection. Leonardo DiCaprio was it his best, ever. He became Billy Costigan, to the point were you felt that what Billy was going through, were actual moments of Dicaprio's life. Matt Damon as always was good, though not as good as Leo. Jack Nicholson, well, what can you say about him? That he is amazing. Another perfect performance. Mark Wahlberg really surprised me, he was somewhat the comic relief of the movie, and stole the screen every time he appeared. Every inch of this movie was great, and i can't wait to see it again. Scorsese, your the best there ever was! Love, Simone"

The editing is spot-on. The sound is fantastic. The music is fresh and unexpected. The writing is sharp, full of whit and humor. Very good character development. The situations are involving and plausible. The story has a great forward momentum that never lets up. Everyone involved seems like they are so into making really good work here. Not one performance is lacking. The ending is great.This movie should be the box-office smash that Scorcese hopes it will be. I don't know how involved Brad Pitt was as a producer, but this film will definitely make it's $60 million production budget back, no doubt.

","The Departed is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life. It is the only mob movie that I can say rivals The Godfather. After seeing the film all I could think of when I walked out of that theater was ""wow"". The acting was top notch. Every single person made me believe fully in their character's whole essence. Of course the directing by THE Martin Scorsese was superb. He throws more curves at you than Phil Niekro. And if you love fantastic endings then this one astonish and impassion you. This is without-a-doubt his best, most appealing movie ever, even with the considerations of Taxi Driver and GoodFellas.

"the_rattlesnake25","9","2","5","6 October 2006"," Scorsese's best? Second, after Goodfellas.
","The Departed (2006) ""You've accused me of being a rat twice now, and if you do it again I swear I'll put a god-damn f*cking bullet in your head no matter who you are."" Martin Scorsese is quite possibly the greatest director of the 'crime drama' or 'gangster' films that Hollywood has ever produced. Gangs of New York, Casino and Goodfellas, just to name a few of the excellent films he has directed and 'The Departed' is no different. Superbly written, brilliantly acted and a flowing story that is mesmerising. Typical Scorsese some will say.<br/><br/>Leonardo Di Caprio (Billy Costigan) and Matt Damon (Colin Sullivan), find themselves on the other side of the fence as one infiltrates the Boston State Police and the other the Irish Mafia, but as the discovery of 'rats' within both organisations arises, everybody becomes a suspect, especially those that are guilty. While Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) play the men at war from the different sides of the law.<br/><br/>First off the bat, William Monahan's writing is next to nothing, but brilliance. The slick dialogue combined with Scorsese's stylistic direction makes this film what it is. From the aggressive nature of Detective Dignam (Wahlberg) to the father-like, old-school Police Commissioner Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen), Monahan has the dialogue down to a tee, while Scorsese's introduction of simple cinematography allows the other techniques to take centre stage. Scorsese uses lightning particularly well in 'Departed', just like in Casino, as the darkness represents the unknown, danger, the aggression, the light shows reality in its bleakest form. Every piece of music in the film, also compliments the film very well such as 'Pink Floyd - Comfortably Numb' being played lightly over a scene that contains both sex and adultery.<br/><br/>However the real brilliance is in the cast, Nicholson, Sheen, Di Caprio, Wahlberg, Damon, Baldwin, Winstone and Dalton and nobody let's the film down. Leonardo Di Caprio (William Costigan) is particularly stunning playing a tough-guy gangster that must hide his past or face the darkest of punishments, death. Matt Damon (Colin Sullivan), on the other hand is less convincing than Leonardo Di Caprio, but his performance still doesn't let up, as his role switches quite instantly from the 'collaring-result-delivering protagonist' to the bad-guy mob man on the inside. While Martin Sheen (Queenan) and Mark Wahlberg (Detective Dignam) play there supporting roles, countering-acting 'good-cop bad-cop' exceptionally well. Nicholson (Frank Costello) played the role of the tough-guy gangster quite well, but his character was missing substance and felt a bit two-dimensional, but apart from that, the acting, just like the cast, was superb.<br/><br/>Scorsese is quite simply the master of the Gangster genre and while some may say 'it's been done before' it feels so fresh and new to a period of cinema full of horror, thriller and romantic comedies. If this film does not get nominated for an Oscar, Leonardo Di Caprio should be instead for his best role since 'The Aviator' (which was directed by Martin Scorsese as well.) If you're a Scorsese fan you will love all two hours and thirty-six minutes of this. If your not, you will still very much enjoy it.<br/><br/>9/10"
"MovieZoo","8","2","5","6 October 2006"," The Departed - Professor Scorsese teaches us all a lesson
","If you think this is the usual blood and guts gangster movie, you will be wrong. But I do not think you will be disappointed. There is so much more to this movie as long as you can put up with fiendishly clever and excessive, blood, guts, swearing and downright beautiful acting, writing, direction, camera work in an incomparable style that will be hard to beat at the next Oscar awards.<br/><br/>It's easy to say that the people going to this movie want to see at least one of the numerous famous actors. By far the best was Nicholson, but for the rest, everyone very nearly as great, they were nose to nose at the finish line. I want you to know that I have not been a big fan of the grown but still young brat pack, Dicaprio, Wahlberg and Damon, but I am now a believer and no one twisted my arm. Seriously, everyone in this movie performed extremely well. If you have something against ""blood and guts"" movies and decide not to go, the choice you make will deprive you of the best group performance I have seen in a long time. The acting is very stylistic and sometimes comically over-the-top. The writing and camera work will almost make the normal mystery buff drool for more.<br/><br/>And now, for the master himself, Martin Scorsese. Bravo! The way you manipulated the characters, drained the Red Cross of every last drop of their reserve and yet managed to make the story so easy to follow despite its surprises was sheer genius. On top of that, this was an extremely fun movie to try to figure out. When I knew there was going to be a twist, I was surprised each time how you tricked me. I suspect Jack has taken you to the dark side. Good move! Great movie!!<br/><br/>I do not give bloody movies a 10, so giving it an 8 of 10, you can see how nearly perfect this movie was."
"nived84","10","2","5","6 October 2006"," Scorsese goes back, once again to gangsterland.
","The Departed tells the story of two men working for the Boston state police; one is mole working inside the mob, and the other is a mole working for the Irish mob boss. Leonard DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan, the cadet police officer sent undercover to infiltrate the Irish mob, which is headed by Frank Costello, played by the wickedly wonderful and outrageous Jack Nicholson. Matt Damon plays Colin Sullivan, the mole inside the police force that tips off Costello on the police's activity while trying to put him away. Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg also star as police officers that are heading the investigation into putting Costello and his whole crew behind bars (or in a casket). Costigan works his way into the mob and Sullivan works his way up into the internal affairs unit of the state police, who is actually sent in to investigate who's been tipping off the mob.<br/><br/>You can see a bunch of Scorsese's touches throughout the film; from his music selections (great use of Dropkick Murphys, but The Rolling Stones song is getting a bit old now), to long tracking shots and plenty of disturbing outbursts of violence; which hit you like a sledgehammer to face in the film's final moments. Where The Departed really shines are the performances. DiCaprio is great, and this is probably his best performance to date. Damon comes through, but he won't exactly blow you away, he usually delivers good work and he doesn't disappoint here. Nicholson is a scene stealing weasel that will probably be compared to, and loved much like Pesci's wild and crazy work in Goodfellas and Casino. Nicholson is perfectly cast and has a lot of fun playing a character so wildly evil and nefarious you just love to hate the son of a bitch. And what's up with Alec Baldwin? Seriously, when was the last time he was in a film this good, and seemed to be having so much fun. And Martin Sheen was also good, but he really wasn't given enough to do in my opinion.<br/><br/>Whether or not Martin Scorsese will actually admit that his latest film, The Departed, is a remake of the Hong Kong thriller, Infernal Affairs, remains to be seen. I probably would have gotten a little bit more enjoyment out of The Departed had it actually been an original Scorsese film like Goodfellas or Casino, but this film pretty much follows the same exact plot as Infernal Affairs; beat for beat, up until the film's last minute twist ending which, no that I think about it actually does kind of make sense. Should you see The Departed in theaters? Yes, absolutely! Especially when you look at all the other amazingly craptastic movies playing in theaters right now you should definitely go out and see it, hell, see it just for the great performances; they alone are worth the price of admission. Actually the more and more I think about it, the more I love this movie. I'll definitely need to see it again, and if necessary again and again. I actually could see myself rating this one as a ten after multiple viewings."
"alienlanguage","10","2","5","6 October 2006"," A great film on every level
","I saw this movie today with very high expectations. While I loved ""The Aviator,"" and moderately enjoyed ""The Gangs of New York,"" I was very excited to see Scorsesee doing what he does best; street-grit mobster movies. Of course, he did not invent the genre, but with this movie he proves that he has mastered it.<br/><br/>Many others have described the plot, so I will not, only in saying that the plot is rather intricate, but it proves to be very rewarding and entertaining if you stay focused and glued to the screen, which is not hard when you're dealing with a top-notch cast that clearly enjoys the material. Leonardo DiCaprio proves that his brilliant performance in ""The Aviator"" was no fluke, as he shows a new level of depth in this role. Matt Damon is superb, but Jack Nicholson steals the show. His performance is in turns creepy, hilarious and realistically disturbing. Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg deliver fantastic supporting performances as well. Am I crazy in saying that Alec Baldwin is turning into one of my all-time favorite actors? His supporting roles in recent years have been simply incredible.<br/><br/>Another aspect of this movie that I enjoyed was the humor. The dialogue was great, and some lines were just plain hilarious, funnier then most comedies. Go see this movie. Movies this amazing are becoming few and far between."

"jzappa","10","3","10","7 October 2006"," Who Can You Trust In This World?
","Possibly the greatest remake of all time, ripe, multi-layered and entirely its own beast, The Departed is a swarthy, vigorous and masculine film about two men trying to live social lives that are the fundamental antitheses of their internal sensibilities. Their efforts loom to undo them, either by breakdown or lethal revelation. The unfolding of their stories concerns an ethical maze, in which good and evil don each other's camouflage. It's not what it's about but how it's about it, which is invariably concordant with a Martin Scorsese film.<br/><br/>A densely cached, morbidly hilarious and powerfully dramatic magnum opus of its genre, The Departed is set in Boston instead of, well, New York, L.A., Las Vegas. It starts with a soda fountain scene that would fit perfectly in GoodFellas. What is nonetheless purposefully missing is the basic luxury of that film. Rather than a kid who lusts after growing up to be a mobster, we have two kids who ripen as frauds: One becomes a cop who goes undercover as a gangster, and the other vice versa. Both men excel their phony personas. Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan create sympathy and levels of histrionics in the film's early scenes by showing the ""bad guy"" mingle with top officials while the ""good guy"" is abused by top officials, the former procuring a high-class condo with a view from the top while the latter's family disintegrates. The plot's white-knuckled impact relies on frail humanity. After several years, both men come to relate to, and crave the respect of, the men they are misleading. There are implicit father-son relationships all over this film, every single male character being both father and son to another to some degree. And the scenario ties the extra knot of each man being validated by just one or two of the men on the side he's benefitting. If DiCaprio's boss dies, who can corroborate that he is actually a cop? Cunningly descriptive tiers of this safe deposit are fleshed out by the customary apparatus of cell phones and computers. When the directions of the two undercover men intersect, will they ultimately arrive on either side of the same phone call? When the police suppose they have a rat amongst them, what if they appoint the rat to hunt himself? Brief subtleties are fleeting but constant in the film's very tight, very layered editing, for instance the consecutive Catholic imagery surrounding a certain plot revelation. One of the informants following another and the subsequent foot chase is an extremely well-crafted sequence, nearly on par with Henry Hill's frantic cocaine-fueled day racing the helicopter in GoodFellas. Both show Scorsese's virtuosity in employing a panicky, hurried camera, sound and music placement and lots of quick cuts.<br/><br/>The music---clever thematic connotations in the use of Lucia di Lammermoor among its rampant highlights---is so constant it overlaps. Only as the end nears is there any extensive pin-drop silence, which is that much more intense on account of our conditioning to the music. One of the film's rare silences is that long-anticipated interaction by phone, one of the final scenes before one of the arguable climaxes. It is so intense not only because of who's speaking with one another, but because at this point, The Departed has never been this quiet.<br/><br/>It is fitting to gather that Boston blue-collar Irish-American men such as the predominant cast of characters were raised Irish Catholics, and that if they have drifted away from the church's laws, they have regardless not liberated themselves of an air of guilt. Now imagine the guilt when you are concurrently committing crimes and betraying the men who rely on you. Indeed, the motivators in The Departed are the oldest in the book, the notion of one's deepest selfhood, and how it affects each character's deeds, feelings and certainty.<br/><br/>The roots of Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon's performances is that the familiar structure of movies implies that we trust most characters are behaving or communicating for themselves. Yet in nearly every scene in this movie, save for certain pivotal parts, they are not. Both actors channel this racking internal torment so that we can suppose and suspect it, though not see it. They're not sounding alarms to remind us of their betrayals. In that regard, the most truthful and candid characters in the movie are the good and evil men being deceived.<br/><br/>There is another character who is entrenched in an ethical clamp, and may suspect it although she cannot for a long time realize it. That is Vera Farmiga's psychologist who works for the police, and who circumstantially comes to know both imposters. She is at first caught off guard by the ""good guy""'s brutal eyewitness street honesty in a scene intercut with his unnerving experiences leading up to his seeing her. She is afraid of getting her feet wet outside her ivory tower status quo, but gradually her allegiance is not to her administrator but to her patient, and what a snarled thicket that turns into.<br/><br/>Really, the entire cast serves a plentiful tonic of equally ornate and nuanced performances, from the leads to Ray Winstone's deeply felt right-hand man, Mark Wahlberg's becoming rendition of an abusive staff sergeant and Alec Baldwin's cheeky, restless veteran, and to fleeting bit roles. And in an utterly self-assured, spontaneous and Oscar-worthy performance, Jack Nicholson makes Frank Costello not just a godfather, turncoat or show-off, but a crafty and infectiously charismatic man whose betrayal runs so deep with his protégé it's horribly sad. And it's representative of his real-life inspiration Whitey Bulger's betrayal of his loyal and desperately dependent Southie community."

","I love this movie, and think it's not only one of the best gangster film's of all time but probably the best movie since LOTR 1. For me movie's have been getting boring in the past few years. Very plain plot line's and bad acting. But every once in a while a movie comes out and just blows me away. in 2000 i was blown away by Gladiator and Erin Brokovich, in 01 there was a beautiful mind and LOTR in 03 Lost in translation. But the past four years have been fairly good and then the failures started up; Date Movie, Epic Movie, Basic Instinct 2, The Wickerman, and many others. by that time I'd given up spending my money on going to see movies at the theater so when this came out on DVD I was blown away and my faith in movies was restored.<br/><br/>The acting is spectacular,and to paraphrase SOMS The Departed is like the Godfather, intensified. I'm definitely not saying its better than the Godfather but it's still great. Jack Nicholson does fabulously has Costello the crime boss. There's no way anyone could tell that he was an informer and he does a great job being the puppeteer of the whole operation. Matt Damon and Leo Dicaprio were great has the rats and you could feel how hard it was for Leo to deal with the pressure.<br/><br/>My Personal favorite character and many people agree with me on this was Staff Sargent Dignam played by Mark Walberg. He is amazing and is great in the interview's at the beginning and right at the very end when he kills Colin. He deserved his Oscar Nod for it although he didn't deserve the win(Alan Arkin was just to damn good).<br/><br/>Overall My favorite movie of the decade are: 5,Erin Brokovich 4,Ray, 3, Little Miss Sunshine, 2, No Country for Old Men and 1, The Departed."

This is not a point on which I am willing to argue, because while Babel was well-acted, Little Miss Sunshine was hysterical and Letters From Iwo Jima was fascinating, no movie that year came close to being the cinematic masterpiece that ""The Departed"" is. The leads and supporting actors were not good, they were fantastic, gritty and raw. The moral fiber is shredded, the line separating good and bad faded, and drugs, money, and crime reign dominant. There was no one shining star in this film, Wahlberg, DiCaprio, Sheen, Damon and lets not forget Nicholson were superb. The camera angles were innovative and the writing was amazing, if there is one bone to pick its the semi-weak performance of the only central female character, and even that is only in comparison to the extremely talented cast surrounding her."

Perhaps the best film of Scorsese's distinguished career, it ratchets up the tension from the beginning and doesn't let up for a moment despite its long running time. Although violent, Scorsese does not dwell on the violence as he does in some of his earlier films. The all-star cast is in top form. DiCaprio is gritty as the earnest undercover cop, Damon is appropriately slimy as the informant, and Nicholson is in his element as the mob boss. Sheen, Wahlberg, and Baldwin provide good support."

","i was pretty hyped to see this movie when it first came out. the actors are top notch, the director is top notch, the locale of boston is top notch. how could it miss? ah, but alas it does... the story is so unbelievably stupid it makes me sad. nicholson is a major crime boss who befriends damon, a cop, without anyone knowing who lets him know all the ""big time busts"" going down on while an undercover cop, dicaprio, infiltrates his syndicate while being grilled by wahlberg and sheen. this sounds like a vehicle for van damme or seagal. all you need is some anti-environment oil drillers fighting some escaped prisoners and you have the complete stupidness of this ""film"" come full circle. i'll admit the acting is great but the story is so ridiculous it makes me want to throw up in terror. the terror of the popularity of this idiocy"
"jerocrowe","10","2","6","9 July 2007"," Yes, yes, Infernal Affairs...
","Yes, it is a remake of Infernal Affairs, and yes, it is much longer and not as tense. But even with the same plot (and many of the same scenes, done very similarly), The Departed explores the thematic underpinnings of its plot more strongly. What Scorsese does here is take Infernal Affairs and play it to his strengths, which is the characters. The plot drives Infernal Affairs forward, and the characters are very well developed and their identity crises understood. The difference between Infernal Affairs and The Departed, though, is that it dwells on the characters and their relationships much more.<br/><br/>The movie could be cut down significantly, but Scorsese didn't make this movie to make a quick and easy remake of Infernal Affairs. Thematically, Scorsese has always made movies about men trying to find their role in their world. That theme is central in Taxi Driver, Goodfellas... Even his ""No Direction Home"" Bob Dylan doc. The plot of Infernal Affairs is the springboard to this theme. This is not a movie about two moles trying to outsmart each other; it is about several characters trying to come to terms with lives that are essentially lies.<br/><br/>Of course, the cop and the crook are rats. But the mob boss is an FBI informant, the psychiatrist/girlfriend had sex with the cop and the crook (and who knows who's the father of her baby). The focus on these other characters (and others - the subject of lying comes up a number of times in the film) makes this one different from Infernal Affairs.<br/><br/>The technical aspects are all excellent, as should be expected from Scorsese. The acting is great, though I can't tell if my discomfort from the Boston accents is because of the other actors being in other movies without them or because I grew up outside of Boston, around the real deal. However, again, this movie is given its own identity through the setting and the differences that Scorsese outlines compared to the movie it's based on.<br/><br/>Infernal Affairs is a great HK thriller, straight and to the point. It's artful and tells the story better, but The Departed wants to work on more levels, and for the most part succeeds in drawing the attention away from the plot and the two cops on onto the myriad of characters, their similarities all on the surface."

Subplots dead-end and go nowhere, and the main plot resolves by the lame-brained expedient of having every character just get shot and die. In short, the ending just stinks on ice and ruins the entire film. There are other reviews here that go into the problems in great detail and do a fine job, I just wanted to second them."

","Yeah, Scorsese should have an Oscar or two on his fireplace mantle, but surely not for this.

The sub-plots are the inventions of a fool with no imagination. In total, the story is unadulterated drivel, not even worthy of B-movie status.<br/><br/>Without the fantastic cast assembled for this film, and without Scorsese's masterful hand to erect a visually exciting film experience, The Departed would have ended up going straight to video. Maybe it should have anyway. In terms of film history, it's a dirty shame Scorsese got his statuette for this shallow piece of nonsense."

Good guy, bad guy, is the bad guy good and vice versa, who can you trust, and throw in a bit of violence, some of it that (i hope) has the intention of providing a twist. Easy.

","I know that sounds stupid, but I came into this absurd (but entertaining) movie knowing absolutely nothing about it and actually watched half of it before I realized that there were two different (but physically very similar) actors playing two different police officers. Until then, I had thought that it was some kind of weird metaphor and that I was watching a surreal exercise on the order of ""Stay"" or, better yet, ""Fight Club"". (What a coincidence that ""The Departed"" was produced by Brad Pitt!)<br/><br/>I was attracted to the movie because of my GREAT admiration for ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"", which in my opinion are the best of the gangster films - sweeping, thrilling, detailed, multi-layered, open-eyed pictures of organized crime to which romanticized pap like ""The Godfather"", for all of its virtues, can't be compared. (I've watched ""Goodfellas"" on cable over and over again, and I'm just as fond of ""Casino"", which isn't played nearly often enough.) And knowing nothing about ""The Departed"", I watched most of it believing that it, too, is about real-life gangsters. There really was a mobster called Frank Costello, and I assumed that the movie is a factual account of his downfall.<br/><br/>My first clue was the cell phones and beepers, which left me asking myself when such devices first came into popular use.

I'll just say this, that it just goes to show you that even a great director like Martin Scorsese, intimately familiar with the workings of the underworld, can come up with surreal nonsense when he puts his mind to it, and when he doesn't have the real world to base his logic on.<br/><br/>PS: Speaking of surrealism, I read on Wikipedia that the real-life ""Frank Costello is the godfather to ABC reporter and FBI Assistant Director for the Office of Public Affairs John Miller, whose father and Costello were close friends.""

How Mark Wahlberg deserves a nomination for those is beyond me. While much of the sexuality and profanity are over-the-top, Damon's and DiCaprio's performances are second-rate, Nicholson plays just another nut, and, as much as it pains me to say this, Alec Baldwin is the film's only redeeming quality in quite possibly the best role he has ever played.

These actors don't need this level of vulgarity to make a point. Properly used, civilized words can convey emotions and story lines far better than the 4-letter words this movie throws at you in virtually every scene.

I certainly do not need to see someone's brains projecting through the air or splattered on a wall to appreciate that someone has been killed. I also do not want to see both bad and good guys die by the end of the movie. A movie without heroes is of no value socially. And, the questions - why were certain scenes included bringing up questions that weren't answered by the end? What was in the envelope given to the psychiatrist? Did she ever give to anyone? And, why did the suspended cop show up and kill Costello's mole? Was he aware of his role, did she give him the envelope so he'd know the truth or was he just angry that this guy had usurped his position of importance in the division? If he had the evidence, why didn't he be the hero and turn him in? What happened to the envelope, really? Why was the scene even included if the envelope wasn't going to be involved later? (Unlike the envelope full of Social Security numbers collected by Costello.) Sure, there were definitely surprises - unexpected scenes that took place, but they just made me sick and want to leave as soon as possible. I detested this movie. It only glorified violence and bloodshed. If it wins an Oscar....if it even gets nominated....I will forever hold that process and those awards in contempt because they will have no value whatsoever at that point.

"jamesn-4","10","2","6","10 October 2006"," Sheer Genius
","The Departed fuses Scorsese's cine-literate panache with a gleeful lack of pretension that is certain to give him the most commercially-successful film of his career. The Departed is the most full-on, story-driven film that Scorsese has made since his last re-make, Cape Fear, in 1991. Does this signal a dumbing down of the sensibilities of a director now so finally exasperated at his inexplicable inability to garner a Best Director Oscar? Absolutely not, for Scorsese tells stories better than any director in Hollywood. And while the exasperation may be true, this is not a dumbed-down movie. In fact, it may well be the smartest and most engaging film you'll see all year. That it manages to be so while still containing all of Scorsese's staple themes - guilt, redemption, the precariousness of modern masculinity, and the bonds between men - makes it damn near a miraculous piece of work.<br/><br/>The Departed follows two young men in the Massecheusetts (sic) State Police - fast-rising, cocky Sullivan, and wrong-side-of-the-tracks Costigan. Each is picked to be a covert spy, but for opposite sides of the law. Billy is recruited to be an undercover cop with a mission to infiltrate the ring of Boston kingpin Frank Costello; meanwhile, Costello himself has earmarked Sullivan to be his eyes and eyes in the PD since childhood.<br/><br/>The film spans two tumultuous years in their lives as both begin to wilt and crack under the weight of their daily deceptions. When each side is made aware of the other's existence, the race is on for both young men to find the other first...<br/><br/>Such a flimsy summary of the film's premise really doesn't do justice to William Monahan's script, which has taken a taut Cantonese film, Infernal Affairs, and beefed it up so that every character (save the muddle that is Vera Farmiga's police psychiatrist, dating Sullivan, counselling Billy) has quirks, mannerisms, and the suggestion of a third dimension so lacking in most Hollywood films. By adding the element of an ingrained Catholicism of the Boston Irish, Monahan promotes The Departed from the 'competent thriller' to something approaching a modern tragedy.<br/><br/>Damon plays superbly against type as a cocky, near-weasel-like detective who is slowly realising he has been in over his head since the day Jack Nicholson's crime lord first picked him out in a convenience store. Nicholson has never been more enjoyable as a completely racist, misogynistic, thoroughly evil gangland kingpin - such is the glee with which he spouts his (presumably oft-improvised) dialogue that he recalls his performance in such signature films as One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, or The Shining. (Indeed, the film is so dismissive of the current constraints of Hollywood's liberal, PC brigade, that it at times seems a hark-back to the glorious decade in which directors like Scorsese, Coppola, DePalma, Friedkin and Cimino thought big, shot bigger and cared little for box office).<br/><br/>The supporting cast is superb - special mention goes to Alec Baldwin, who continues to prove that he is still one of the most reliable of supporting players in America. British acting living legend Ray Winstone also cuts a memorably fearsome figure as Costello's right hand man, Mr French; although his accent is a little hit and miss, Winstone's undoubted natural hardness make you believe him. As mentioned, Vera Farmiga is a bit lost in the field of Y chromosomes, but Monahan has amalgamated, essentially, THREE female characters from the original film into one, multi-functional, and very questionable female presence. Scorsese doesn't often get women right in his films, and one of the ways he tries to compensate for this is to make them the sort of 'moral anchor' in the film. Farmiga serves this role.<br/><br/>But this film belongs to Leonardo DiCaprio, who has finally found a Scorsese role that plays perfectly to his appearance and strengths. Here, DiCaprio gets to make use of his natural, near-infuriating boyishness, and he has just the right amount of presence now to play young buck in the crime outfit, dominated by heavyweights like Nicholson and Winstone. And, throughout the film, his Billy Costigan is on a downward slope to paranoia and breakdown, a decline that DiCaprio charts with a subtlety that so few of his contemporaries can manage.<br/><br/>But, as with any Scorsese film, the discussion will always centre around him. Not even Spielberg works under the weight of expectation that Scorsese does; and it's a testament to the fact that Coppola has made nothing by rubbish for the last twenty-odd years, and DePalma too, has lost his way, that film lovers still get passionate about his work. I can't imagine too many devotees being disappointed by this film. After two Oscar hunting films, he has finally said, F*** it, and threw his considerable talents behind a balls-to-the-wall thriller that is by turns, Scrosese-esquire and Hitchockian, with bags of mass appeal. Spielberg could have made a 4-star movie of this; David Fincher could have done the script proud. But only Scorsese could walk the commercial and artistic line so deftly, so brilliantly, and leave his peers and pretenders standing.<br/><br/>The Departed is the film of the year, no question. And film lovers everywhere should rejoice at having Martin Scorsese back at the top of his game."

As it turns out, there was nothing that the Departed adds to Infernal Affairs. NOTHING. Everything is the same - down to the smallest dialogues (e.g. who's a cop?), camera angles, the setup of the police station (with glasses and blinds), locations (rooftops, skyscrapers in the background). If Andy Lau and Tony Leung could have worn DiCaprio and Damon masks on their faces while making the Infernal Affairs, I would not have noticed the difference.<br/><br/>Don't let me stop you from watching the movie, however.

"seaview1","9","2","6","7 October 2006"," THE DEPARTED - Scorsese's Gangs of Boston
","No one has depicted the modern underworld better than film maestro Martin Scorsese who has melded cinematic acumen with his Italian-Catholic upbringing to form a trilogy of unparalleled morality plays: Mean Streets, Goodfellas, and Casino. The trilogy has become a quartet by default as the director tackles the Asian cult classic, Infernal Affairs, and has fashioned The Departed, a film so good up until its stunning conclusion, it almost can't possibly live up to its steadily built, character driven narrative.<br/><br/>Set in Boston, mobster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) rises from small time hood to major crime boss. He befriends and mentors a boy, Colin Sullivan, who, as a grown man (Matt Damon) has studied his way to the State Police academy. Simultaneously, another young man, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), is about to graduate as a policeman. A task force is formed to build a case against Costello. Led by Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg), Sullivan and Costigan are recruited for the team separately and unbeknownst to each other. Sullivan takes advantage of his status by tipping off Costello and keeping the kingpin one step ahead of the law. Costigan infiltrates Costello's crew while Sullivan ironically leads an internal investigation into probable traitors/informants in the police department. Soon, Costello and Sullivan realize that there is a 'mole' in their own ranks too, but who can it be? It becomes a perverse game of cat and mouse as the policemen try to expose each other. Furthermore, Sullivan begins dating Madolyn (Vera Farmiga), a police shrink who also counsels and then forms a bond with Costigan. Realizing that he is about to be discovered, Costigan wants to be extracted by Queenan who senses that the situation is desperate. As the task force closes on Costello, Sullivan zeros in on Costigan's identity by tailing Queenan, and thus good and evil are set on a collision course with startling, tragic finality. <br/><br/>Here we have a dichotomy or duality of two men, Sullivan and Costigan, both intelligent, well read, and streetwise, who happen to be on opposing sides and for a majority of the story, unaware of each other's identity. Costigan is the noble undercover cop whose life is in ever increasing peril and Sullivan is the hotshot policeman who will do anything to protect Costello. Then there are the surrogate fathers as Nicholson's Costello mentors Sullivan while Sheen's Captain Queenan shepherds Costigan. It is amusing to see how Costello sort of adopts Costigan and Queenan is the elder to Sullivan at the police station. It is a parallel family nucleus turned inside out. <br/><br/>The acting is simply put-great. Jack Nicholson convincingly portrays a powerful mob boss with utter arrogance and ruthlessness. His dialogue is chilling and at times outrageously funny. Damon, in his old stomping grounds, sports a New England accent and does a very credible job as the heavy. DiCaprio demonstrates an ever-growing maturity in his roles; his recent partnership with Scorsese is proving fruitful (Gangs of New York, The Aviator). You have to hand it to Scorsese as one of the few directors who can attract the best actors who are dying to work with him. How else could such lead actors as Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin (who is a riot as a profanity-laced FBI boss), and Mark Wahlberg accept what are essentially supporting roles!<br/><br/>The film does miss on a couple points. It would have meant more if the relationship of Madolyn and Sullivan had been explored with more depth, and the emergence of Costigan in this unlikely triangle would have had more poignancy. Likewise, at the end, those relationships are left unclear and never fully explored as much as we want after we get so involved in these characters good or bad as they might be. The film is a little long but never uninteresting, and when it reaches its astonishing ending, it is sudden and jarring in unexpected ways that reach Shakespearean proportions. <br/><br/>Scorsese is still very much in command of his medium, as he will throw in a cinematic device like an iris-in shot or freeze a frame here or there. (Editor Thelma Schoonmaker, his long time collaborator, is in fine form juggling a dozen characters and maintaining the tension at a very high level for a long time, no easy feat.) Though Scorsese's early Mean Streets (1973) was a fictional tale of low level hoods, it was also semi-autobiographical in its depiction of the people he knew. Goodfellas (1990) and Casino (1995) took a semi-documentary approach that held a fascination of real life events amid a dramatic storyline. In terms of structure, The Departed, while similar in spirit and energy to his previous crime dramas, shows Scorsese fabricating essentially a purely fictitious story, and as always, he has a knack for depicting the inner workings of organized crime with realistic bravado.<br/><br/>There are echoes of the films, The Corrupter (featuring Wahlberg), Donnie Brasco and Reservoir Dogs (also a Hong Kong inspired plot) with their questions of loyalty and betrayal. While earlier police corruption stories were told primarily from the police/protagonist's point of view like Serpico or the great Prince of the City, The Departed takes an equal time approach with its protagonists and antagonists.<br/><br/>The movie contains raw violence including a brief but action packed climax. The profanity is excessive but realistic, and at times there are amusing cussing matches between the various factions. It's hard to wrap your arms around The Departed because there's just so much to savor and admire while also wishing that the radical change in tone at the end weren't so jarring to the rhythm of the plot. It's basically a film about rats, and you know what happens to rats."
"StayPuft003","8","2","6","7 October 2006"," High Expectations
","Going into Martin Scorsese's new film The Departed, I had the highest expectations I've ever had for a film. I heard from some people that it was better than Goodfellas, a feat only a few rare films achieve. Well, to be honest, I was a little disappointed. It was not the greatest movie ever made, but it's definitely up there, and for many reasons: 1.The acting, as guessed, is absolutely superb. DiCaprio showed that he can finally act well and be a good lead. He played his character believably and I could sense his emotion well throughout. His Boston accent was a little off at times and seemed exaggerated, but he can't be perfect. To me, this was the perfect role for Matt Damon. I never really liked him, he's not in very good movies, and his character was very unlikeable in this, which I think fit him very well. His Boston accent, of course, was phenomenal, because it was natural. Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin also gave top-notch memorable performances in for this stellar cast. Now, to the two best performances of the film. First, Mark Wahlberg was truly perfect for his role. His character was the funniest of the movie, with a curse word coming out of his mouth every other word. His tough attitude proved to be pivotal towards the end of the movie, and he stole every single scene he was in. Jack Nicholson, as well, was perfect for his role. Every word that came out of his mouth made me believe more and more that he was not Jack, but Frank Costello, his character. He, too, has some very witty lines due to his character being crazy, as usual for him. I wouldn't say it was an original character, but it was definitely perfectly played by Jack, and I feel that this will get him his Oscar.<br/><br/>2. The Plot in this movie is one of the more original ideas I've heard of recently. I had not heard about Internal Affairs before this film, so I thought the idea of following a rat in the Mafia and a mole in the police force was very unique and I was attached to it immediately. There were some twists, some turns, and everything in between, but the movie ran smoothly and I wasn't confused at any single point.<br/><br/>3. Going into the movie, I expected a very serious film with maybe slight bits of humor. I was pleasantly surprised. This movie had some legitimate laugh-out-loud moments, mostly coming from Jack's wackiness or Whalberg's temper and flare. Also, the humor wasn't at random, it helped develop the plot line and reveal things about the characters.<br/><br/>All in all, The Departed, while not the greatest movie ever, is definitely the best movie of the year so far and I feel that it will get many Oscars, and I hope Scorsese finally gets one for this masterpiece that should not be missed."

","Jack Nicholson does the best rat impression ever. With his teeth and lips, ""eeww"", the best rat I've seen in the movies. Movie is pretty good, fast, so many twists and turns. Vera Farmigah is a little old for Leonardo and Matt but hot. Martin Scorsese has done better movies and so has Jack Nicholson. I like Mark Wahlberg's character who constantly swears at people and abuses them. I'm pretty sure this movie will win at least one Oscar in some category, but as usual Scorsese will get unlucky that particular year when someone else makes a better movie passing him for the be st director. But again you never know, Academy people not always give the award to the best in any category rather who they think deserves over a period of time. Academy passed Denzel Washington for Best Actor in Hurricane and gave it to Russel Crowe in Gladiator, then when Russel Crowe deserved it in A Beautiful Mind they gave it to Denzel for playing Training Day (a corrupt cop), go figure."

The Departed is most certainly a return to themes touched upon in older films such as Goodfellas, and even Taxi Driver, but more than his other recent projects, it seems Scorcese has ""matured"". Yes, this sounds strange - a director like him has always been an eloquent and masterful one - but here it seems as though he is looking back upon his career and making decisions based upon those that seemed correct in his past. The film? why worry - the plot is as similar as Heat, or any other crime thriller - the secret is in the delivery, and the way the director coaxes masterful performances from the cast. Magnificent."

And, given actors of the caliber of Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, those characters are fleshed out to the point of bursting. This is Nicholson in his prime, the Leonardo of the serious acting chops and Matt Damon filling out what could be a thankless role beyond the brim. Vera Farminga who is ideally cast as the person who anchors this cops and robbers world to the larger universe the rest of us inhabit. Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen are terrific, creating multidimensional people from what might otherwise have been one-dimensional stock characters. And if nothing else, Alec Baldwin has a great time with his part.<br/><br/>In a quick two and a half hours this movie moves briskly, and the finish is a sprint that will leave you breathless.<br/><br/>Personally this movie compares favorably to the best films I've seen in the past two or three years. Go see it -- you won't be sorry.<br/><br/>(NOTE: this movie has been described in other reviews as pretty gory, and while there aren't many blood splatters left on the cutting room floor, its not as bad as you might think.)"

","This by far is the best movie I have ever seen!! The cast was excellent and the plot is great. The movie was full of action and a great storyline. You always had to pay attention since there was never a dull moment in this movie. I really believe Scorsese will finally get his Oscar Award for this movie. I went into this movie knowing it would be good, just from seeing a few of his other movies. I had no idea The Departed would be this excellent though. This is also a movie you should probably see more then once. The plot is great but watching it a few times you pick up on little things that help you understand everything a little better. A lot of Scorsese's movies are very detailed when it comes to the storyline. I highly recommend seeing this movie even if you aren't a big Martin Scorsese fan."
"tccandler","10","2","6","6 October 2006"," The Consequences of Misplaced Loyalty & Trust
","Film god, Martin Scorsese has directed his ""hardest"" film to date... And that is saying a lot! My own knuckles hurt after watching this film, packed to the rafters with pistol-whippings, face-crunching fists and round-house kicks to the teeth. ""The Departed"" is an emotionally paralyzing face-off between the State Police, the mob, and their respective informants / rats, on the cold-hearted back alleys of Boston, Mass.<br/><br/>What makes this film so superbly successful is the way Martin Scorsese marshals this complex story into a brisk moving, completely understandable, entirely real piece of cinema that strikes a chord deep inside the viewer. When the final credits start to roll, you will let out a deep breath of relief... One that will feel like it has been held since the first frame of the film.<br/><br/>After an initial introduction to the life and crimes Frank Costello (Nicholson), the legendary Boston mob boss, we join the proceedings as William Costigan (DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Damon) are graduating from the State Police Academy. Each near top of their class, they are forced in very different directions when they reach the detective unit.<br/><br/>Sullivan is assigned a lofty rank as the star rookie on the force. However, his loyalties do not lay with the boys in blue. He has been quietly raised since his early teens by none other than Frank Costello.<br/><br/>Costigan is offered a vastly different assignment. His records erased, his graduation deleted... He is required to go undercover, a plant directly into the heart of the mob itself. After a cosmetic 4-month stint in jail, he is released with a bad reputation and worms his way toward Costello's clan.<br/><br/>The film shifts gears and stories faster than you can blink, allowing us to spy on this cat and mouse thriller. The camera acts as our informant. And let me tell you something... Every piece of information this films leaks is fascinating.<br/><br/>There are tales of female infidelity, police futility, mob brutality, penile immobility, cell-phone connectivity. OK, I stretched for that one. The story leads to its logical and somewhat inevitable conclusion, taking no prisoners along the way. Every character plays an important part at some point... And not every character is what they first seem to be.<br/><br/>Marty Scorsese is masterful here. He may just have earned himself another Oscar nod. He is going to get one someday... It probably should be for this film. His camera flows like no other director's ever has. It is kinetic and forceful, a perfect match for the characters and the story.<br/><br/>The cast is just about as good as it gets. If you were still on the hedge about Leo -- Forget about it. This is a master craftsman at work. His intensity and power is every bit a match for Jack Nicholson's efforts. In fact, there are scenes where Jack disappears behind Leo's force.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is fast becoming a great actor. This is his most complex role to date. He imbues Colin Sullivan with a conniving intelligence that has the police looking in all the wrong places.<br/><br/>Alec Baldwin has long deserved Oscar recognition. He should get a Best Supporting actor nod here as the Police Captain. He has one tremendous moment where he raves about the Patriot Act... It is a superbly satirical jab that I presume may have been his own ad-lib.<br/><br/>Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, Vera Farmiga & Ray Winstone round out the first-team cast with the utmost class. I am sure this film will be considered by the Screen Actor's Guild for Best Ensemble.<br/><br/>I cannot imagine any sane human being watching this film and not placing it in their year-end Top 10 List. ""The Departed"" is so raw and so heavy-hitting that it doesn't stop at your eyeballs, it rips right to the core of you. It is the most involving film of 2006, so far. It is the most supremely crafted film of 2006, so far. It is the best film of 2006, so far. And I doubt whether I will see a handful of films the rest of the way that will challenge it for the top spot.<br/><br/>Â© Written by TC Candler IndependentCritics.com"
"ps42","10","2","6","6 October 2006"," Yes, Its Really THAT Good
","I walked into The Departed with pretty high expectations from Scorsese and his cast of all-stars, and walked out with all those expectations fulfilled and more. Scorsese makes his first film in a while that is truly up to par with his classics. Everything about it clicks together perfectly.<br/><br/>The acting is top notch on all fronts. Everyone in the film gives a career defining performance. Jack Nicholson steals every scene he's in, with his best portrayal of a villain since The Shining. If he does not receive at least a nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars this year, I'll be shocked. Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio also turn in spectacular performances, Leo especially made the character of William Costigan his own, although the both of them tend to overdo the Boston accent a bit (I'm from Mass, and the accent just isn't that prominent). You can really feel a sense of stress and urgency in their voices that does not come off as forced. Whalberg's performance is probably the weakest of the four leads, but that doesn't really mean anything. His job was still rock solid, but just pales next to how well the others took their roles. Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, and Vera Farming all have well acted supporting roles as well.<br/><br/>The plot, without telling you anything about it that isn't already out there, revolves around the Massachusetts State Police trying to pin down reputed mobster Frank Costello (Nicholson). Costello's character appears to be loosely based real life Boston mobster Whitey Bulger. Each organization has a mole in their ranks, and the bulk of the action comes as they hunt each other down. It really blurs the line between good guy and bad guy. Honestly, I don't think the film had a single legitimate good guy in it. This is a film that you'll want to see repeatedly, you'll pick up new plot details every time. It's a very realistic portrayal of the struggle between the law and organized crime, and a very poignant portrayal of the struggle for identity, motivation and meaning for the soldiers on both sides of that war. Scorsese could have ended the movie at about the 115-minute mark, but chose to go on and wrap up the unresolved conflicts of all of the characters, and that is what separates this from a run of the mill crime drama.<br/><br/>The violence in the film is some of the most realistic I've ever seen. Plenty of gray matter paints the walls during the course of the film. The soundtrack also works very well, centrally using Boston natives the Dropkick Murphy's cover of ""I'm Shipping up to Boston"" to craft a great city atmosphere at the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>The Departed is the best film I've seen this year. It knocks both V for Vendetta and Little Miss Sunshine out of the tie for the top spot on the list. The The 150+ minute runtime just flies by. It'll grab you by the neck and pull you in to it and hang on for dear live."
"hkmanwah","10","2","6","6 October 2006"," This tantalising story traces the race between opposing moles. This is interwoven around the Irish American gangs in Boston, rather superbly led by an ""on form"" Jack Nicholson
","As an Englishman living in Hong Kong, i am in the unusual position of having seen the original ""Infernal Affairs"" in the cinema in 2002, and now ""The Departed"" in the self same cinema 4 years later. Both are first class movies. The remake is very loyal to the original, and only locations and a few minor changes have been made. It is one of the best movies of this genre i have seen in a long time. Probably the best since i saw the original one. I would say that Martin Sheen was slightly miscast, and Matt Damon, although good, does not get the same sympathy from me as did Andy Lau in the original version. The point about this is that you should like this character,which is at odds with the fact that he is a bad guy. I tended to like Andy Lau, whereas Matt Damon was not quite so likable. This is a rather ""picky"" point, and would probably only be picked up by somebody who has seen both versions. I was amazed that two and a half hours disappeared without trace in the cinema, and i truly wanted to see more. An excellent movie that deserves a number of accolades. I am sure we will be seeing those during next years round of awards."

The story and pacing of the movie was very exciting. Excellent and must-see. Violence and blood abound, so queasy ones beware. The actress who played the love interest seems inadequate in her role, being the only unknown in the cast (to me, at least).

"giodracondrum","5","1","2","23 January 2020"," Martin Scorsese's messy good time.
","This is the first in my exploration of Scorsese films after only having seen The Wolf of Wall Street and The Irishman-<br/><br/>That being said, I was very confused by this film as it felt so out of focus for something of Scorsese's caliber- also quite cheesy in a lot of places.<br/><br/>The opening was enough to have me gripped but quickly lost my interest due to it's lack of time control. The edits jump forward in time almost disregarding early set up far too quickly. This would not have been that big an issue but it goes for the entire run time of the film and does not let a lot of the gravitas of certain sequences breathe. You go from seeing Matt Damon's character in the academy to randomly jumping to Leo's character also going through the academy but it's later noted that they did not go at the same time. Later in the film events that transpire over years and months quickly fall out. Leo's character goes from being a low level crack/cocaine dealer to apart of Nicholson's inner circle far too easily. It feels as though this film wanted to be a limited series and had to crunch the script into a lengthy, yet brief, movie run time.<br/><br/>The screenplay however, is very gripping. The dialogue is incredibly well acted although at times feels as though it clashes with its darker more world weary narrative. I loved seeing Jack Nicholson attempt to toy with the police and Leo have outer turmoil over getting caught- a realistic paranoia. My personal beef with the writing here is that none of the emotional scenes carry the weight they should because we are shown something radically different almost immediately after. Time is the main reason this is apparent as the film jumps ahead as if saying that the last scene was simply ""back story"" for the next scene. This is weak to me as instead of feeling like a flowing narrative, we're presented small scenes (tastes if you will) of the characters' plights.<br/><br/>The musical score by Howard Shore is solid and the soundtrack choices fit their scenes but none really stood out in a particular way to elevate a scene beyond simply just having a backing track. Overall it was decent but not nearly as memorable as a lot of the sequences in most Scorsese movies.<br/><br/>There are many memorable shots in this film but I don't really remember that many standout sequences that felt whole- the editing cuts them down tremendously. Some of the best are usually in relation to what's happening with Nicholson's gang and we are given a lot of it from Leo's perspective which is always tense as he has to stay undercover. It's very smartly shot but feels very early 2000's in terms of color choices and overall is great for Scorsese but not as strong as some of his other line of work as I have seen.<br/><br/>Now I come to my biggest gripes with the movie (MAJOR spoilers ahead). The entire end sequence feels so rushed and almost too satisfying, so as to say that the events that have been suspenseful all throughout the film are just over in a snap. This normally would not phase me but it goes in line with the pacing of the film being way too rushed and it chugs through these last major sequences- filling them with unnecessary side characters for almost no reason. Leonardo devises a plan to perform a citizen's arrest after having just quit the force on his own terms to avoid the inner corruption he had discovered. The scene has no build up; we immediately see Damon's slimeball character go up to the meeting place with Leo without any real suspense as we already have an idea of what's gonna go down. The ""twist"" is presented when Leo takes Damon down an elevator and comes out the other side brains plastered over the back wall. It's revealed that the Irish gang had another mole in the force. What a twist! It comes out of no where and then is immediately resolved by having that character killed off. Next we are shown Leo's funeral where Damon's wife is shown to want to leave him, as it also been implied that her baby is not his. Next we are shown what is perhaps the cheesiest scene in the entire movie as we see Damon return to his luxury apartment where everyone now hates him for whatever reason like side characters in a kids movie looking down on the bully character. He walks in and is killed in an almost slapstick fashion by Mark Wahlberg's character who is presumed to not even be working for the police anymore. Then the final shot of a rat on a railing- just pure cheese. That felt like something from a Pixar ending more than anything as they specifically use the word rat multiple times in the film to highlight traitors. It's meant to be unsubtle and it just feels like the absolute cheesiest way to end the entire ""drama"".<br/><br/>Compare all of this to The Irishman's absolutely brilliant ending where every loose end is tied neatly- all helped by the film's long runtime. In the Irishman we are shown how each character's relationship to each other is shattered by its ending and how Robert De Niro's character, Frank, has to carry the guilt with him until he finally dies. It feels mature and earned. Another thing that film does is show Martin Scorsese's emotional maturity as it still manages to have funny sequences but they do not compromise the serious overall tone of the film.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese is an incredible director and his body of work speaks for itself. None of my criticism is fact and this is just my personal opinion. I did find the film entertaining and I was never bored- just could not help question a lot of the creative choices for the narrative. I loved the other works I have seen from him and I don't expect to love every creation from a single mind. After all, film is a group effort- this one just wasn't for me."

","This blockbuster, high concept Hollywood film was directed by Martin Scorsese and featured a star cast of Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen, and Mark Wahlberg. The story is loosely based off the violent life of former South Boston crime lord James ""Whitey"" Bulger (Nicholson), as it follows an undercover cop (DiCaprio) trying to infiltrate the Irish Gang of Boston and also identify a mole (Damon) in the Massachusetts State Police Department with the help of Detectives Queenan (Sheen) and Dignam (Wahlberg). The film shows two men, Captain Colin Sullivan of the State Police Department (Damon) and Billy Costigan (DiCaprio), an undercover cop infiltrating the murderous and crime-fueled Irish Gang, led by boss Frank Costello (Nicholson), attempting to discover each other's identities while also trying to live their professional lives as the complete opposite of their inner selves. This film can be labeled as a cinematic masterpiece, as Scorsese uses the best actors of our generation to convey a story of murder, crime, and love in over three hours of suspense, action, and thrill.
Nicholson delivers a masterful performance as a mob boss who thrives off of murder, extortion, and drug use. His mixture of evil tendencies and smart business tactics make it thrilling for the audience to watch him as the movie progresses, and to eventually see him slip into madness as he tries to identify who the ""rat"" in his gang is. DiCaprio, the lead actor in this film, does an unbelievable job of portraying his characters paranoia as an undercover cop - someone always looking over his shoulder, always afraid that he'll end up dead at any moment. His paranoia initiates direct paranoia towards the audience as well, as Scorsese keeps us on the edge of our seats as the movie progresses and Billy Costigan is one step away from becoming another undercover killed in the line of duty."

Anyway, the story is the tipical ""Scorsese type"" but in this case set in Boston. There is no place to boredom here, you can find plot twist, deaths, chases, monologues, great music and emotional moments that deserve your time. Every each scene has something unique, whether is the great acting, the marvelous music (Rolling Stones or Pink Floyd) or the exquisite dialogue. However, there is one factor that made this movie my favorite of all time, and that is the camera of MARTIN SCORSESE. If you want know why this man is considered among the best directors of all time you need to study this movie. DYNANISM is the word, Scorsese is not telling you again the usual mob story, in this movie he is guiding you through an experience of mystery, fun, excitement, violence, love and betrayel.

I just think that the two roles of the leading men should have been switched. Damon is a tougher guy than Dicaprio. And Wahlberg is tougher than both of them; but he was cast perfectly. Dicaprio in a fight with Wahlberg? I don't think so. Dicaprio as a tough guy? Sorry, I'm not buying. Didnt buy him in Gangs in New York as a tough guy, either. Just like I never bought Mongomery Clift as a tough guy in From Here to Eternity or in The Young Lions. Seeing Dicaprio win a fight with anyone in a film gives me the same feeling as when I saw Clift win a fight with John Wayne in a Western. It just didnt convince my senses. Other than the switch in the lead roles, the film is almost perfect. (except for the love scenes with Dicaprio, which pretty much fall into the same category as the fight scenes. Please.

"jamheigei","9","1","2","26 September 2018"," Directing Expertise And a Phenomenal Cast
","Martin Scorcese once said about this movie >>it's the first movie I've made with an actual plot<< (not the actual quote but you get the point) and compared to most other crime films of the 2000s, that's very true. It's complex and every aspect of the plot is displayed in a manner where yes, you understand it, but you're also often enough busy figuring out who knows what (because you the viewer know everything).<br/><br/>What really makes the movie outstanding though is the cast and production. Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg play amazing and the performances of Leo DiCaprio and especially Jack Nicholson are truly impeccable. Not a false note anywhere; I might have given Nicholson the Oscar if I could. 
The last (and greatest) aspect of the movie is Martin Scorcese's directing. Just by watching the movie and not even paying attention to what's going on in the story, you see how much of a directing veteran he is. Every shot has a purpose, every line fits perfectly into the scenes. There are so many details that even other great directors don't remotely think about. I've found this kind of attention to an immersive world only with one other man in a similar way: Steven Spielberg.
Don't get me wrong; other directors create immersive worlds and have a wonderful directing style (Fincher, Nolan, you name them) but few do it as seamless and effortless as Scorcese and Spielberg."

","In South Boston, one man reigns, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). As he himself explains, he rose from poverty, little by little, to become the leader of the leading gang in SB. Naturally, he is a thorn in the side of the Boston Police and they live to bring this man down. A secret task force is formed and Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio), a cleancut boy from South Boston who has graduated from the police academy, is given the special task of infiltrating Frank's mob, pretending to be a sworn follower. This is dangerous work indeed. However, Frank has the same brilliant idea. If the gang had a plant in the police department, above reproach, then he would know when the police are coming to mess up his plans. A disciple from his teens, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is the perfect choice; he is bright, good-looking and seemingly genial. He fools most everyone, including the brass (Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg) and a psychologist (Verma Farmiga). In fact, Colin and the shrink begin a relationship while, at the same time, Cop Sullivan is relaying crucial information to Frank. As such, eventually, Billy and Colin cross paths and get suspicious of one another. Billy even goes after Colin's lady. So, whose ""traitor"" in the midst will be the most successful? How many lives will be sacrificed? This brutal but splendid film is not really for the most faint of heart. Nevertheless, is ultra-fascinating plot has to be seen to be appreciated. The story even eclipses the GREAT work of Nicholson, Di Caprio, Damon, Farmiga and the entire crew. What a breathtaking twist and turn tale of betrayal and goodness. As many critics have found, this may be the ultimate Scorsese film as his hands are behind every scene. Thrillers come and go but The Departed will stay around for the ages."

","There are lots of things I didn't like about this movie, namely the entire cat-and- mouse plot line. How could neither Billy Costigan nor Collin Sullivan nor anyone else not figure out that those two are the double agents? It seemed pretty common knowledge that Collin grew up under the wing of Frank Costello and that bad things keeps happening after Billy joins Costello's mob. Is Costello really that trustworthy and critical a thinker to believe correlation doesn't equal causation? The alliterative names are also confusing. I'm not a fan of early-aughts Marty or Leo, but Leo isn't bad in this role. Matt Damon's face and voice are too boring to play a villain, Martin Sheen's character is pretty thankless and dies easily, and Marky Mark's character is just a rod for the sake of being a rod - hardly enough meat to develop an Oscar- worthy performance.

Scorsese may often work with the same actors and direct stories around criminal life, but there is not a specific distinct style when it comes to his films as you would find with directors such as Tim Burton, John Carpenter, or Christopher Nolan. I mean, how can you compare Hugo to Casino stylistically? What IS behind a lot of Scorsese's films is great storytelling, and The Departed is no different. Though Scorsese deserved an Oscar long before 2007, The Departed lives among some of his greatest work.<br/><br/>While it may not be a very diverse ensemble, the cast in this film is simply phenomenal. It consists of iconic white male actors both old and young pulling off their roles as cops and gang members perfectly, and Vera Farmiga doing a ""good enough"" job as a therapist for young cops and undercover workers. While Mark Wahlberg earned himself a deserving nomination for best supporting actor, the actor who steals the show is Leonardo DiCaprio, who probably would have also received a nomination if he had not worked on Blood Diamond the same exact year. We don't know whether to be terrified of Costello (Jack Nicholson) or if we should nervously giggle at his dark sense of humor, Alec Baldwin is at his A-game as an excitable investigator, Matt Damon is Boston personified, and Martin Sheen reminds us why he shouldn't be associated with Charlie Sheen in this day and age. Phenomenal work all around, and one last note is as odd as this may sound, Mark Wahlberg excels at swearing in this film. Funny s***.<br/><br/>Based on the foreign script ""Infernal Affairs"" (which this critic is eager to watch) The Departed is unsubtle in its focus on ""rats,"" double agents both in the Irish mafia of Boston as well as the state police force. Matt Damon is a man who was practically raised by Frank Costello to become a rat within the state police while Leonardo DiCaprio plays a young man who grew up in a notorious family who wants to turn his life around by becoming a true cop. Nobody would believe him in a uniform, so Sheen and Wahlberg ask him to gain Costello's trust and he becomes a rat within Costello's gang.<br/><br/>Morality is what is at stake in The Departed. The morality of lying is the most notable since the film is focused on double agents, but even the love triangle developed between Damon, DiCaprio, and Farmiga brings this into question. DiCaprio tries to get under Farmiga's skin at first asking if she lies in general, and as she gets closer to him she confesses that she would lie if her boyfriend (Damon) saw her together with DiCaprio. As we realize that Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio are not the only ""rats"" in the story, it brings not only the morality of lying into question, but also it calls for the audience to ask how we can determine who is on which side of the law. Is there a line? Is the law black and white? Or are there exceptions when it comes to double agents?<br/><br/>While the narrative is amazing, it is important to note that this film is littered with swearing and violence, so keep that in mind if you're sensitive to these issues or if you are considering letting a child view this movie. Regarding these same issues, do NOT watch this film on cable TV as it is censored to the point where the dialogue becomes ridiculous and you cannot take the film seriously. Other than that, this film should one day become a required screening in college level film courses; a true masterpiece.<br/><br/>4.0/4.0"
"acytryn","9","1","2","15 March 2016"," My review of The Departed
","The Departed is a Martin Scorsese movie about two cops from South Boston that join the Massachusetts State Police Department. One character, Colin Sullivan, played by Matt Damon, joins the force as a mole for Frank Costello, played by Jack Nicholson, the boss of the Irish mafia. It is Frank Costello who has groomed Colin from a young age to be a part of his syndicate. Colin infiltrates the state police, rising through the ranks and gaining the trust of the higher brass of the state police. Colin fills Frank in on what all the police know about him. The police cannot understand why Frank is always one step ahead of them.<br/><br/>The second character is Billy Costigan, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. He is a police rookie assigned to be an informant for the police department. His family has ties to the mob in South Boston, so he gains the trust and credibility of Costello. As both cops infiltrate each other's organizations, they learn that each organization has a mole. They now must protect themselves and figure out who is the mole.<br/><br/>The theme of The Departed is self-identity. Both characters have no family to speak to. In the beginning of the movie, Colin is being raised by his grandmother. He was groomed by Costello during his teens to help run Costello's Irish territory. We also see through a flashback that Billy's mother passes away and he disowns his mother's brother. The only family he has is his small time drug dealing cousin, Sean, played by Kevin Corrigan. Through their infiltration of each other organizations, they seem to lose the only small identity they have. The only person who knows Colin's true identity is Costello. Everyone on the force thinks he is a great cop. He moves up through the ranks quickly. Even Madelyn, the police psychologist, played by Vera Farmiga, thinks he is a cop. She lives with him and is carrying his child, and still does not know who he really is. It is also Costello's code name on the phone ""Dad"", that is ironic. Is that the only father figure he has ever had?<br/><br/>Billy's identity is only known by Det. Sgt. Dignam, played by Mark Wahlberg, and Captain Queenan, played by Martin Sheen. No one else on the force knows the identity of Billy Costigan. Those who know Billy, think he dropped out of the police academy, and did time for assault and is on probation. His families tie to the Irish mafia, raises no eyebrows when he joins Costello's crew. Captain Queenan keeps an eye on Billy, is this his only father figure? As the movie moves along, both characters learn about each other. Billy is getting scared. Costello tells him there is a rat in the group. Billy also finds out Costello is a FBI informant. While Billy and Queenan meet up, Colin informs Costello and crew about the meeting. While trying to protect Billy, Queenan ends up being thrown from the roof. On his dying bed, Delahunt, one of Costello's men, played by Mark Roleston, asks Billy why he ended up at the right place to ambush Captain Queenan. He told him the wrong address by accident. Before Billy reaches for his gun, Delahunt dies. Colin is also told there is a mole in the special operations unit. He is moved to internal affairs to help find the mole. It is during this time that both characters feel the walls are closing in. During one scene, Billy is following Colin from the theater. The dark streets and the sound of footsteps splashing through rain puddles, gives us a suspenseful feeling that one of the characters will be found out and caught. As Colin pulls his knife and jumps out from behind the truck, it is the restaurant worker that gets stabbed. This is a sigh of relief for the viewer believing Billy was going to be the victim.<br/><br/>The conclusion of the movie moves quickly. Sullivan learns from Queenan's diary that Costello is an FBI informant. Colin is now worried about losing his identity The police, with Colin in the car, follow Costello to a cocaine drop off. After pulling up to the building, gunfire erupts between police and Costello's crew. It is there that Colin confronts Costello about being an FBI informant, and questions if he was the next guy that Costello would give up. As Costello goes for his gun, Colin shoots him several times and kills him. The next day at the station, Colin is applauded for killing Costello. Thinking all is over, Billy shows up to Colin wanting his true identity back. While Colin goes to another room to check computer, Billy finds the envelop with ""citizen"" written on it. He has found the mole. Colin also found his mole, and erases all of Billy's records.<br/><br/>A few weeks later, Costello's lawyer sends Billy recordings of Colin's and Frank's conversations. Billy then sends them to Colin. While looking at the mail, Madelyn finds the tapes and starts to listen to them. Colin then contacts Billy and they plan to meet at the same building where Queenan died. Billy blindsides Colin and intends to arrest him. While in elevator, Trooper Barragan, who no one knew was another mole for Costello, kills Billy. Then, Colin kills Barragan so there are no witnesses to this crime. After all the funerals, Colin comes home with packages and finds Det. Dignam. Dignam shoots Colin in his apartment. Was justice done?<br/><br/>The last scene of the movie is a rat on the railing with the justice department behind it. Did Billy and Colin die without ever having a true identity? The one identity they both had in common was being a ""rat"" in each other's organization."

"karaguenette","10","1","2","7 March 2016"," Fantastic Film One Of my favorites (mild spoilers)
","Pretty amazing. The writing is fantastic the acting is phenomenal and one of scorceses best directed films. I could ramble along about this movie forever, it's fantastic. It can make you sympathize with horrible people. Billy Costigan(Leonardo di caprio) is one of the best written characters ever, you can't avoid feeling bad for him and wanting to help his life out and make it better. Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is his opposite. He had a rough childhood like Costigan but grew up with a mob boss. He infiltrates his way into the police feeding the mob everything very secretly and cleverly. The ending is amazing. It doesn't satisfy you and it shouldn't. I love movies that don't satisfy you. I think it's amazing when a main character dies. The film will stay in your mind for a while and I would recommend it to anyone really. It's depressing and it goes to show what people will do for their own gain which is shown in Costello ( jack Nicholson ). Mark wahlberg is fantastic as well he plays a jerk who we really don't understand why he is the jerk that he is and he murders Collin because he let his boss die. Overall it is my favorite scorcese film although it's not his his best."

","This excellent Scorcese combination of ""Black Mass"" and ""Infernal Affairs"" combines the semi-true story of Gangster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson, based partly on James ""Whitey"" Bulger) and the story of two moles planted in the Boston Police Department, each looking for the other, and their identities hidden from each other until the very end of the story. The Context is basically recapped in the 2015 film ""Black Mass"" with Johnny Depp"", minus the elements from ""Infernal Affairs"" but still retaining the idea of an FBI agent protecting his informant- In whatever underhanded ways he could.<br/><br/>Matt Damon as Colin Sullivan seems to be the clean cut Boston Detective, and Leo DiCaprio as ""Billy"" as an undercover cop who ironically becomes the most trusted member of Frank Costello's gang, and seems to be the worse off of the two. They both connect to a Police Psychiatrist Madolyn (Vera Farmiga in a more sexy role than she had in the remake of Manchurian Candidate) who becomes a pivot piece for the plot.<br/><br/>There is some great Age Regression for Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello, who takes Sullivan in as a young man and grooms him to become his mole. Meanwhile, ""Billy"" as part of his cover is trained by spending time in the Hoosegow.<br/><br/>It is known to Costello that there are police informants peppered through his organization, and most of the story is Costello trying to find out who these are, while Billy at the same time tries to protect who he is. Costello charges Sullivan to discover the informants, so basically the who things balance each other out. But the ways these two plot points interact, make this an interesting watch. And of course there are many examples of Scorsese humor dotted throughout in bright red grisliness- Some of these hold up to the burying alive of Billy Batts from Goodfellas.<br/><br/>The question is, who's the rat? And who's the real rat? When is a rat not a rat? Sometimes a rat can be two different things."
"asminc-780-789057","6","1","2","13 February 2016"," The original is way better
","The original film was written and made in HK. The plot and acting in the original film are both brilliant and unpredictable. This Hollywood remake added a lot more Hollywood ""cheese"" that just make it cheap. There's nothing subtle about it, like a loud kid trying to copy a much mature original. The female character tangled up between both guys, frustration is always shown with anger and no other dimension. Sure, the remake has to adopt to a different background and fit the time and space, but the unexpected twists and turns in the original film felt forced and made up in this remake. And I never thought I would say this, but the acting in the original film is way better than these Hollywood big names. Everything fits naturally in the original, the remake seems like everyone is trying to be louder than others."
"samfischer88","10","1","2","12 February 2016"," Fantastic Story with Great Acting
","This might be the best story that is brought to screen. I know The Departed was originally based on Infernal Affairs, but Scorsese really adds an extra ""wow"" factor. <br/><br/>The Departed contains my favorite cast ever with Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon, Sheen, Baldwin, and Wahlberg. They all have the east coast feel and play the gangster and cop roles perfectly. I don't think a better cast could have been found. Nicholson seemed to be passing the acting torch onto Leo here as it is a treat for the viewer to see these two bring out the best in each other. Wahlberg surprised me in his limited role. He plays the loose cannon cop perfectly and really adds a presence to his scenes. <br/><br/>Scorsese really set The Departed apart for me though. All of his little touches that make his movies great were involved. You cold tell with his unique use of cinematography, realism, and music. Everything was emphasized. Each moment was big and built to a powerful ending. He finds a way to connect the story together in a way to keep everyone on the edge of their seat the entire time. Scorsese has made some great gangster movies, but this is by far his best. It definitely stands alone. <br/><br/>This movie in general deserved every award it received and probably more. I thought from top to bottom this was as close to a perfect movie as I have seen in my life. The story was already intriguing from Infernal Affairs and the best cast imaginable was brought together. Scorsese took these elements and created his masterpiece. <br/><br/>Go see this movie immediately; 10/10"
"aciessi","7","1","2","13 January 2016"," Ratted Out
","I haven't been living under a rock, and neither have I been in a coma, but I just watched The Departed for the first time. I know, where have I been? My love for Scorsese films runs so deep, how did this movie pass me by for so many years? Anyways, I thought I knew what I was getting myself into when putting this on. I thought it would be some kind of worthy successor to Mean Streets, GoodFellas and Casino. Another Scorsese mob classic? Well, I wouldn't call it a classic. It's a very good film, i assure you, but it in no way compares to the genius of his very best films. It is hard to compare any mob film to the greatest mob film of all time, but when it's made by the same director and you notice all of these little setbacks, it's hard not to be slightly disappointed.<br/><br/>The acting is by far the film's greatest strength, DiCaprio and Damon provide great intensity in their scenes, no matter how subtle. Jack Nicholson as Frank Costello definitely delivered the best performance. It's that same brand of craziness, and evil, that Nicholson does so well. As an interpretation of Whitey Bulger, it's pretty creative. This is much more of a grandstanding version of Whitey. Watch Black Mass, however, and you'll see a more entrancingly real portrayal of Whitey by Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>The movie's mystery aspect had me very interested, and so did it's brilliant direction from Scorsese himself. This is, at the end of the day, an action picture. Reminded me a little of a ""Geezers with Guns""/Guy Ritchie film. Perhaps that is why I felt so differently about this film than his others. It doesn't have Scorsese's words, or even his ideas. That is kind of what draws me to his movies the most. When Marty has his own idea, and puts it to work, you can really tell the difference. His heart and soul is in the picture. Here, I think he just does an excellent job directing someone else's idea. What's sad is that this is the film that granted him his long- overdue Academy Award for best director. Really? This is the film that deserved it? Where were you all during Raging Bull?<br/><br/>I'm being too harsh on a good film. It is a good film. Just not one that I'll think about when I think about one of my favorite directors."
"Screen_Blitz","10","1","2","21 December 2015"," Martin Scorcese's The Departed is a modern gangster drama masterpiece
","No director has boasted a stricter understanding of the gangster genre than Martin Scorcese, at least not yet. His filmography dating back to 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' greatly prove this. We have seen a devilishly gritty portrayal of Henry Hill in the former movie, we have seen the portrayal of a crime family caught in the hazardous world of illegal gambling in the latter. If there is any director who's shown competition against Scorcese in breathing grit into the image of mobster families, it is Francis Ford Coppola with his uncompromising cinematic classic 'The Godfather'. This violent, gritty crime- thriller sees Scorcese continues his trademark cinematic ambition with showcasing an authentic take on the life of mobsters in the complicated world of crime. What many filmgoers may not to know is that this modern gangster piece happens to be a remake of a Chinese film 'Internal Affairs', following roughly the same plot and story structure. Set in the crime-ridden city of Southern Boston, Leonardo Dicaprio plays Billy Costigan, a brash undercover cop and former convict of the Boston Police Department, who is assigned by Captain Queenan (played by Martin Sheen) and Staff Sergeant Digman (played by Mark Wahlberg) to infiltrate an Irish mob gang run by Frank Costello (played by Jack Nicholson). With FBI informant Colin Sullivan (played by Matt Damon) set as Costello's mole and trusts of long-time friends and business partners put to the test, Costigan gets involved in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse as the two fight to uncover each other's identities. <br/><br/>In the world of modern day mobsters, things gets complex in a brutally ugly way. And director Martin Scorcese more than just demonstrates here. Keeping the high stakes high and the story engaging, Scorcese places a nasty twist on the mobster genre with this crime-drama where almost none of the characters are who they say they are or make out to be. Then the question that lies throughout the entirety of the plot is who are the good guys and the who are the corrupt ones. The question which lies among the characters escalates into a tautly-paced race against two of the main characters Billy Costigan and Colin Sullivan racing to discover each other's identities. With gunfights erupting in the streets of Boston and the lives of close allies threatened by corrupt individuals handled by the antagonist and crime boss Frank Costello, the film proceeds with an appropriately dark atmosphere. Scorcese does a magnificent job on propelling each scene with near-constant tension and substance, and persistently maintains absorbing character development to keep things engaging without losing track of momentum. Leonardo Dicaprio's Billy and Matt Damon's Colin along with the roaring tyranny of Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello are driving forces of the plot as one of an undercover cop fighting for the truth, and the other is a backstabbing mobster who disguises an law enforcement to put the other in the pawn of their dubious plan. As the body count rises and the identities of the aforementioned characters are exposes, everything builds to a startling climax that seals the deal. Like many of Scorcese's pictures, there is plenty of bloodshed and hard-hitting violence to paint the ugly, but true portrait of the crime underworld. <br/><br/>Leonardo Dicaprio, who last collaborated with Martin Scorcese as Amsterdam in 'Gangs of New York', suits up in the center figure of the film here and propels himself with plenty of fortitude and intensity in the role. Dicaprio has proved he is capable of playing roles of both the right and wrong side of the moral compass. His powerhouse portrayal proves is talented at channeling with both anger and striking humanity. Matt Damon, often known for playing the hero role or perhaps an ordinary human protagonist, is given a whole another ball game here. Shifting from his good guy persona to a corrupt individual with a perplexing agenda, Damon gives a genuinely versatile performance that marks easily one of the highest points of his career. Mark Wahlberg plays the trusted supporting figure of Dicaprio's protagonist and certainly makes a big name of himself here. His performance is strong and shines of emotional depth. But perhaps none of these actors are able to compete with Jack Nicholson who boasts a gritty portrayal of the ruthless mob boss Frank Costello. Although Nicholson is no stranger to playing character with violent tendencies, especially after playing the psychopath Jack Torrance in 'The Shining'; Nicholson propels with a sinister appeal to the role that makes this long-time actor stand out among the rest. His character, greatly inspired by real-life Boston gangster James ""Whitey"" Bulger, is about as darkly charismatic as many gang bosses in cinematic entries -- nothing more, nothing less.<br/><br/>The Departed is a thrillingly enthralling modern-day gangster drama powered by Martin Scorcese's superb direction and powerhouse performances by a brutally talented cast. This Scorcese piece is an astounding cinematic effort that not only transcends the gangster genre, but marks a powerfully stunning masterpiece that is more than likely to stand the test of time in many years to come."

","The Departed was a fascinating movie chronicling the Massachusetts State Police Department's battle with a Boston mob led by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a young, aspiring police officer with family ties to the mob. Seeing this as an opportunity, the police department sends him undercover to infiltrate the mob and become close to Costello. At the same time, Costello sends one of his own men, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) to become a police officer and infiltrate the department to stay one step ahead. This turns into a high stakes race between the two men to find out the identity of the other. <br/><br/>There seems to be a strong theme of morality in the film, as it has a classic good cop-bad cop storyline. What is fascinating is how both Costigan and Sullivan have to pretend to be exact opposites of who they are as they play their undercover roles. On multiple occasions, Costigan admits that the stress and anxiety of living a double life is causing him problems psychologically, knowing he is one screw up away from being killed. Sullivan is also dealing with his own issues of leading a double life, which begins affecting his relationship with his girlfriend. <br/><br/>Two aspects that I thought really enhanced the overall vibe of the film were lighting and music. As most of the story centered on the mob and illegal activity, many of the scenes were shot with a low contrast. In particular, there were several bar scenes toward the beginning of the film where Costigan got into some fights with members of other mobs as a way to impress Costello. Another crucial scene where an illegal deal took place between Costello's crew and a rival gang also exhibited this lighting style. The low contrast element did a great job of setting the tone for the illegal activities as well as making the audience feel like they are a part of that world. The music choices also set the tone very well for some big scenes in the movie. The best example of that is the song 'Shipping Up to Boston' by Dropkick Murphys, which is used several times throughout the film, including the climatic chase scene at the end. The song naturally has a Boston vibe and fits great with the mob culture that is portrayed. All in all, The Departed was a riveting film, and one that does a great job portraying mob culture as well as the humanity and morality involved in pretending to be somebody you are not. If you are a fan of other Martin Scorsese films, such as 'Gangs of New York,' then you will absolutely love this film."

","The Departed (2006): Dir: Martin Scorsese / Cast: Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen: Captivating crime thriller about death and the transformation of power. Jack Nicholson plays a powerful crime lord spotlighted by F.B.I. Leonardo DiCaprio plays an undercover cop undergoing a dangerous mission to expose the target. Matt Damon is rising in position in law enforcement and exposing information to Nicholson thus leading to both young cops in a fatal position. Martin Scorsese displays the dark side of the law. Nicholson is excellent as expected chewing scenery with sly dialogue under disgusting circumstances. His power will gradually slip until it is turned against him. DiCaprio showcases the frustration placed in a situation of limited exit. He is aware that someone within the department is leaking information but it becomes a dying battle for victory. Damon in similar circumstances must cover his tracks but eventually his sin will find him out in the most fatal surprising ways. Mark Wahlberg steals scenes as a cynical Sergeant who undergoes ill treatment before using questionable methods to bring justice. To complete this flawless casting we have Martin Sheen as the police captain who recruits DiCaprio. Technically compelling view of undercover law enforcement that no one will wish to depart to.

The high levels of drama are very crucial to the story. It can be a bit overwhelming the first time watching it, but that's just because it's so good at bringing all the elements together to create such a compelling storyline.

","The Departed is a motion picture phenomenon that was the best movie of the 2000s without the uses of elaborate special effects. It was also the one that put the entire cast back on the map. Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese were doing well with other movies earlier such as Gangs of New York and The Aviator, but The Departed made them rise to the top again. This is one of Scorsese's top 5 films he has ever made.<br/><br/>The Departed follows two parallel stories about two polar opposite young men that are involved with infamous Irish mob boss, Frank Costello (Nicholson). The first character we get to know is Colin Sullivan (Damon) who is taken in by Costello when he was a boy. Sullivan worms his way through Boston's police academy and eventually into the State Police in its Special Intelligence Unit that focuses on organized crime. Damon gives one of his best performances as a slick undercover mobster.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio gives his best performance since Titanic as Billy Costigan who grew up on the wrong side of town. Knowing of his family ties, Captain Queenan and Sergeant Dignam (Sheen, Wahlberg) recruit him to go deep undercover to infiltrate Costello. Queenan and Dignam are the only people in the world that know Costigan is really a mole. Costigan is rough and brutal, unlike Sullivan who is calm and rational. Both eventually romance with police psychiatrist (Farmiga).<br/><br/>Both infiltrate their respective units which is so awesome. The whole time you wonder: is it harder for a bad to pretend to be good, or a good guy pretending to be bad? Both DiCaprio and Damon's roles sound kind of easy to play, but both characters are too dimensional to be just any thug and pretty boy.<br/><br/>Both men learn that there is a ""rat"" Costello's crew. The audience knows that both Damon and DiCaprio are rats, but on different sides of the law. The film really heats up as the stars attempt to fish out who the ""rat"" is while trying to keep their own true identities hidden. The movie is already red hot, but gets kicked into overdrive as one or both ""rats"" become known to each other.<br/><br/>A I mentioned earlier, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon give astonishing performances. The Departed has a star-studded cast with the likes of Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Vera Farmiga, Anthony Anderson, and Ray Winstone, all of who give sick performances.Aside from the general acting, the way the characters are developed and the chemistry between them is just uncanny. Sure the movie is foul and violent, but that doesn't diminish anything. In fact, it just adds excitement. Regardless, the movie is purely character- driven to the max. In fact, the parallel stories and the character-driving is at a Shakespearean level. Shakespeare wrote lots of plays with identical plots that eventually come together and are purely character driven. The Departed is no different.<br/><br/>Aside from the character development, chemistry and plot development, The Departed's themes elevate this film to immortal standards and give it the timelessness it has. It is also that last piece of the puzzle that makes is neo-Shakespeare. The themes of identity, right and wrong, loyalty, and family are all undertaken is such serious and original ways. Sullivan is so deep as a cop that he really starts to uphold the law and do right things, while still being loyal to his ""father,"" Frank Costello.

"Barev2013","1","1","2","3 May 2015"," The biggest DUD ever to get an Oscar -- crass commercial crap
","THE DEPARTED, viewed at first Rome film Festival, October, 2006.<br/><br/>In response to email asking if I thought this was Scorcese's big comeback after a run of flops and flubs. Wed. October 17, 2006 Ahoy, Tomasso -- Yessiree -- Life is pretty sweet here in Rome at the moment, and I'm glad you asked about Scorcese! I was just getting ready to knock out the usual cagey, diplomatic, journalistically correct (JC) review of ""The Departed"" but with you, of course, I don't have to hedge my bets or pull my punches, and can tell the Truth -- the Hole Truth, and nothing but The Truth... So, for openers, the bottom line is, NO --this is not the great comeback for Scorcese -- in fact it's a regression even further back into obvious crass commercialism than was ""Aviator"", which was pretty damn regressive, not to mention a pile of horseshit. To start with, both Nicholson AND Dicaprio were SEriously miscast -- The best role in the whole film is Marc Wahlberg -(fast becoming my favorite Hollywood actor) - - who should get a Purple Heart for having to give his all in the company of these phony stars who walk away with all the credit --as if there was anything creditable to speak of -- while he actually keeps this monstrosity afloat whenever he's on. The interview following the press screening was FAR more interesting than the film itself, which I found hard to actually sit out and squirm through For one thing, too much rapid artsy-fartsy inter-cutting between the parallel stories of how Dicaprio and Damon infiltrate the police department and The Mob, respectively. The whole shebang was far too intricate for a Boston based gangsta Story and shoulda ""stayed in bed"", which is to say, in Hong Kong, where it started out -- and where it belongs. An exercise in glossy malarkey all around -- (Scorcese makes Good-Looking, high-GLOSS films -- even if there's no 'there' there otherwise...) and also -- according to Scorcese in the following Press Con, an exercise in ""experimentation"". Well, maybe that was the problem -- It's so Experimental that it falls apart in every other scene without ever getting it together anywhere in between. The only thing that makes it more or less tolerable are the very good supporting roles by Alec Baldwin (always good), Wahlberg (always superb), and Martin Sheen (always interesting, especially now with white hair), but there is one key supporting role that is pathetically bad --the police psychiatrist, played by an unappealing) actress by the name of Vera Farmiga. For ChrisSake -- Whoopy Goldberg would have done a much better job! This gal must be a friend of the family -- in fact the whole film feels to me like an expensive home movie made by Scorcese for and with his family and friends. The bottom Line? P. U. -- ""The Departed"" sucks heavily. Glad you asked.<br/><br/>Given the obvious star power of the main cast and the advance hype to the effect that Marty is ""back in stride doing his gangster stuff"", I would be hesitant to predict that this awful picture will go under in America, but somebody watching the parade just has to come out and say it --when the king ain't wearing a single darned stitch!<br/><br/>As for the main roles, it's maybe not so much that Jack Nicholson was miscast as an Irish Maffia don, but rather that he's gotten to be such a gigantic Ham that all he ever does anymore is imitate himself or play an old creep on constant Viagra overdose. Nevertheless, because of some sort of star-inertia principle (a moving Hollywood Box Office Force tends to keep moving in a straight line as long as money can be drained out of it), his face and name still sell tickets. <br/><br/>Viggo Mortensen would have been more credible in the role. <br/><br/>As for Leonardo -- well, to see the way he beats the crap out of all kinds of heavy thugs in this pic with the greatest of ease, you'd have to think he was the baddest ass who ever lived. A bare-knuckled Billy The Kid, when actually we all know he's a frail, sensitive, loving chap who wouldn't hurt a fly -- be cause he doesn't have the strength to! <br/><br/>This all has about the same credibility level as a tubercular looking Montgomery Clift knocking John Wayne for a loop in ""Red River"". Matt Damon, the third big name in the cast, is acceptable since he's not called on to do anything but what he always does best -- a grown up hoodlum with a working-class Boston accent who wishes he could have made it to Harvard. <br/><br/>Hate to disappoint you, pal, but let me know what you think when you get to see it -- and just remember: Never trust a film critic! -- not even me.Alex in the press room, Rome.<br/><br/>ROME DIARY, REPORT 4 -- PRESS CONFERENCES -- AND FILM"

","STORY<br/><br/>It isn't until later on in The Departed that you realize how important and well-crafted its beginning is: Two Bostonians, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), nearly cross paths when they're interviewed in succession by Sgt. Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) and Capt. Queenan (Martin Sheen). Costigan is chosen to infiltrate the mob in order to get to Boston's most feared boss, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), and he'll have to put in some time in the slammer and on the streets before gaining a shred of creed; meanwhile, Sullivan, clean-cut and articulate, is pulling the ultimate job for Costello by infiltrating the state police department and alerting the mob boss of their every move. As the two moles become more involved in their undercover operations, the groups they're infiltrating begin to smell something fishy. And so commences the chess match between Costigan and Sullivan to reveal each other before their respective non legit-colleagues do.<br/><br/>ACTING<br/><br/>For any actor or actress who truly enjoys the art of his/her job, more so than the sexy brink of it all, something as come together as The Departed must seem like the customary ""candy store."" Maybe that explains why DiCaprio, Damon, Nicholson and Wahlberg all signed up instead of carrying their own separate blockbusters for likely a much bigger payday. DiCaprio and Damon do what they do in every movie: give their best performances to date. Each plays completely against type, flaunting the fact that genuine movie super stardom isn't born out of good looks alone. For Nicholson, his career nearing the half-century mark, it's no longer easy to qualify and rank his performances, but Costello is one of his high points in a career pretty much devoid of anything but. Wahlberg steals the funniest lines, especially with his in born Boston accent, but Sheen often catches them before they're allowed too much laughter. It doesn't end there, though: Alec Baldwin (as a fellow officer), soon-to-be breakout star Vera Farmiga (as a police shrink who ends up playing a central role), Ray Winstone (as Costello's right-hand man) and Anthony Anderson (as a young cop familiar with both Costigan and Sullivan) all shine. Unprecedented chemistry among an unprecedented cast is as much a theme here as revenge!<br/><br/>The Departed is with no doubt a total masterpiece and it is easily my top five movies of all-time. The directing was total piece of wonderful art and the acting is beyond outstanding. This is the kind movie I recommended to an older audience, who will love a movie that offers crime drama like no other film has ever before. It is must buy on DVD or Blu Ray and a must see film"

"amillerz3","10","1","2","12 April 2012"," The Departed: My Personal Favorite Movie
","To all who have criticisms of this film, take about 50 steps back and understand a few things. First of all, I understand that this is a remake of a great Japanese movie, so obviously certain elements of the plot and the script will be replicated. Second, in Martin Scorsese's infinite genius, he altered other elements of the story to make it seem more original and more unique to his directorial style. Now, we may discuss the movie.<br/><br/>Let me open with this: I am a HUGE Martin Scorsese fan. I have seen most of his movies and I have loved almost every single one. He presents a life so different from the suburbia in which I live, so I am immediately attracted to these new lifestyles and the associated problems. However, most of his movies don't really have plots, per say. They have stories (the movie is about this), but they don't have plots (this happens, then that, then the other thing, then it ends). The Departed is truly Scorsese's first real movie with a plot. Even Scorsese himself called The Departed, ""My first film with a plot."" This plot is one of the most coherent, intelligent plots of any movie I have ever seen. In order to not spoil any events, I will end my discussion of plot right there.<br/><br/>Let's go to the script. Phenomenal in every sense of the word. Every syllable is meaningful in this story. Even the 250 or so f-bombs have their use. For the dramatic dialogue, it creates a more intense atmosphere. Doesn't someone cursing sound angrier than someone who isn't? However, in the scenes with a (relatively) lighter mood, the curses make the conversation more lively and, at some points, humorous. Here's an example:<br/><br/>Dignam: ...this s***hole's got more leaks than the Iraqi navy. Ellerby: Go f*** yourself. Dignam: I'm tired from f***in' your wife. Ellerby: How's your mother? Dignam: Good, she's tired from f***in' my father.<br/><br/>That is just one example of the many darkly humorous moments that make The Departed more than just a drama, but a blend of various genres.<br/><br/>Let's move on to individual characters. After reading some of the other reviews, there have been claims that Dignam is an unnecessary character. That statement is more untrue than any negative comment I have ever heard about this movie. Dignam fills so many roles in this film that if he were removed, the movie on a whole wouldn't even be half as good. First, he is comic relief, cursing out everything that moves. Wahlberg does an excellent job of filling this role. Second, he plays the foil to Sullivan. Sullivan is the supposed goody-two- shoes with a secret. Dignam is an a**hole, but he has no secrets and is devoutly loyal to the police force. Finally, he essentially creates the blend of good and evil within Sullivan. When we meet Sullivan, we immediately think ""bad guy"" because of his association with Costello. Then we meet Dignam, and he consistently picks on Sullivan. Now, we can relate to Sullivan, because we've all been in the position where we have been picked on by someone of a ""higher rank."" Therefore, we see Sullivan as part good, part evil.<br/><br/>The acting is superb. I don't think that there are many movies that top the acting in this film. I would especially like to recognize the performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon. What makes their acting in this movie so incredible is it isn't about what they say, but it's about what they don't. I read a review on this site saying the Matt Damon didn't emote. I would like to respond by saying that he did, but in such a subtle way that you really have to sit down and analyze the film over and over to see it. That's why his performance was so brilliant. However, it was very rare that this occurred. Why? I will answer this question with another question: If your character is a liar, how does a liar emote? How can someone who has been trained his whole life to keep everything inside emote? And as for DiCaprio, he gives, in my opinion, the best performance of his career (as far as I am aware). His character is so deep and complex that the web of lies created around him is impenetrable. It is almost impossible to tell what he is really thinking at any point in the movie. What does he really want? Who is Billy Costigan?<br/><br/>Finally, for those who complain that this film is very boring, I have some disturbing news for you: in order to be a film aficionado, you will have to watch movies MUCH more boring than this (Gone with the wind, Patton, etc). If you find this boring, have fun with everything else in film history.<br/><br/>Overall, The Departed, in my opinion, marks a grand achievement in the career of Martin Scorsese. He has taken his traditional interest and knowledge of the mafia and given it a plot unlike anything I have ever seen. He combines the common themes of his movie with a story from another country to make a truly unique film, no matter what anyone says. The acting is superb, the script is impeccable, and the characters are all very complex beings wrapped in webs of lies so tight that it is impossible to analyze anyone in this film. Go see The Departed (or re-watch it to look for the things I mentioned)."

","Martin Scorsese, Jack Nicholson, Leo DiCaprio and Matt Damon. When these stalwarts converge, then it's either over or forever. Thankfully, it's the latter in this case. Despite being released in 2006, The Departed feels so different, so exclusive, and so distant from all the average been there done it crime dramas. There's nothing too great really about the plot. The suspense isn't very absorbing nor is there an eye popping conclusion. But then that is why you call Martin Scorsese a legend. Because the same screenplay would have resulted into a 7-7.5 flick. But Scorsese's handling of the subject and the script(Monahan truly does a great job) is mind blowing. This crime thriller doesn't seem to belong to this era, but to one when ""we were not born and great movies used to grace the screen"". On the acting front, Jack Nicholson reminds us yet again of his immense talent(remember The Shining, Chinatown). For me, he certainly stole the show. DiCaprio was awesome as well.. he surpasses Damon at least. Well , this is Scorsese treading the gangster path. What the f u c k do you expect?"

","Don't get me wrong; I love the Departed. I've seen it numerous times and I never get tired of it. The shots, editing, actors, are all on point. It's hilarious, suspenseful and at times, disturbing, just like any other crime movie. However, thanks to the abundance of the f-word in the movie, I now find it a bit silly; seriously, you won't need that much f-words in the movie like that. There were some lines in that movie that did not make sense with the cursing. But oh well, it's a gangster-thriller. The Departed is not a terrible movie but it's certainly not one of Scorsese's finest movies like Goodfellas, Taxi Driver and Mean Streets (my favorite Scorsese film). Honestly, I didn't know that it was actually a remake of some Hong-Kong Crime Thriller that's deemed superior to The Departed. I'm now interested in watching that version.<br/><br/>About the Departed: if you're turned off by profanity, sudden explicit violence and aggression, don't waste your time by watching this movie.

"Karl Self","Null","1","2","14 August 2011"," Sad effigy of a Scorsese movie
","I love all Scorsese movies (except maybe Kundun) and thus was stoked to see ""The Departed"". And then sorely disappointed. The movie feels as if Scorsese had made it after a suffering major stroke, as a mere shadow of himself. All the ingredients are there (including the Stones-laden soundtrack) but they don't gel. The movie seems hammy, over the top, vain and self-indulgent, implausible, and simply boring. Like small-time director meets over-sized budget. We follow the stories of two young cops (Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio) in a Boston dominated by the god-like Irish mobster Costello (Jack Nicholson); one cop infiltrates the gang, the other cop is on the mob's payroll and infiltrates the police. My first problem here was simply that the two cops are physically so similar that I had a hard time keeping them apart. Then: the script is always hammy, always implausible, never original or intriguing. For example, I didn't buy the scene where one student at a police academy tells another that his girlfriend won't, erm, fellate him until he passes. Crass, yes, supermasculine atmosphere, check, but how gay is it to tell the guy jogging next to you about your sexual regimen (or lack of it)? Throughout the movie men spout abuse at each other to a point that it seems more like SNL on Tourette than Scorsese. Maybe it's the erroneous vision of an old man about how young bucks interact these days. Even Nicholson as the mobster comes across not so much scary but more like an old queer. In one scene he walks through a restaurant after he has been ""interrogating"" young members of his gang (""One of them gave the wrong answer!"", and he is covered in coagulated blood like a butcher at the end of a long day at the slaughterhouse. Lay it off Martin, I'm not buying it. And finally the movie is about an hour too long for the thin plot.<br/><br/>Another hole: the cop infiltrating the mob is stressed out and goes to see a police psychologist (even though his mission is so super-top-secret that only two men at the PD know about it). This sexy shrink happens to be the girlfriend of the other cop (the one who works for the mob). And although she's just moved in with Matt Damon, for Christ's sake, and although her patient is clearly on the edge and aggressive, she starts an affair with him. Despite this the movie makes her out to be morally impeccable to allow her to be morally incensed about the double-dealings of her boyfriend.<br/><br/>By the way, I haven't seen the original and don't care how it compares to it. ""The Departed"" could not do justice to the original and still be a good movie -- unfortunately, it isn't a good movie."

","I have read quite a few books about the events detailed in this movie. Even with this encyclopedic information at hand, I still found the movie very very confusing and I think it was because they tried to make it an amalgam of all the Infernal Affairs movies and also incorporate the real stories into one coherent story. <br/><br/>The one big noticeable thing that the movie does not cover is how the BPD probably had the most moles working for all the different factions. Since a lot of the BPD are drawn from all the different neighborhoods in Boston, the complexities of their various clan and ethnic loyalties probably deserve a movie of their own.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good, but I have definitely seen better performances from all the principals in other movies.

"johnnyboyz","6","1","2","23 December 2010"," Agonisingly ordinary, routine little cops and criminals piece which is best described as minor Scorsese.
","The Departed is a curious thing: a Martin Scorsese concept movie. Here's a piece by the renowned director running on a sentence long pitch which reads something like: ""there are these two fellas; one's an undercover cop pretending to work with the mob while the other's a mole employed by the mobsters mixing it with the cops"" – there's your pitch, now run with it. I've nothing greatly against The Departed; it's a serviceable and workable enough little thriller which darts along at a merry old pace but it is an oddly cold; oddly distant; unmoving and strangely uninvolving piece, punctuated by individual 'moments' or 'bits' that take what has been a flagging film up to the respective point before consequently dragging it through a hedge in the proverbial maze thus onto another path entirely. Where Scorsese has dealt with the gangster genre in spits and spots before, namely Goodfellas and Casino, and done so in a manner that took us right to the brink in terms of either coming to side with the characters or despising them, The Departed chugs along with both its post-""24"" and post-Bourne mannerisms as well as droll causality as it runs on a very specific premise plus routine character arcs. Where rather gloriously straddling that line between glamorisation and demonisation in the past, Scorsese has effectively relegated himself to mainstream fluff feigning to be about something whilst running on star power. In short, it is highly underwhelming and staggeringly average.<br/><br/>The two primary players of the film are Leonardo DiCaprio's Billy Costigan, a Boston police academy graduate hired by Martin Sheen's top police captain Oliver Queenan to go undercover for the department so as to spy on mobster Frank Costello (Nicholson); and Matt Damon's Colin Sullivan, another police academy graduate this time groomed by said mob boss from a very early age to go through the system and work on the inside of the police force for the crooks. Around this nifty little premise Scorsese effectively proves he can structure a few tense set pieces and create a tone of uncertainty and paranoia, predominantly from Costigan's perspective which is further aided by DiCaprio's performance of a man suffering certain emotions thus rousing the material at specific points. Little in the way of the duality they share is explored. Each men play roles within roles; both men are on the wrong side of a verbal battering from Mark Wahlberg's Staff Sergeant named Sean Dignam, Dicaprio more-so because we need the entire back-story of his life up to this point spelled out to us so as to know whom we're dealing with; and both men come to form relationships with Vera Farmiga's police psychiatrist Madolyn Madden.<br/><br/>For large chunks of the film, we don't get it; we don't understand. People charge and dart all over the screen going through what the overly complicated, under nourishing narrative demands of them; a similar sense of 'going through the motions' equally as apparent on the other side of the camera in Scorsese's directing. The plight of Costigan, this angry young man with parents whom are deceased and from a very limited background, and his inauguration into Costello's gang so that he may effectively risk even more by branching out into more serious things, is workmanlike; competent and quite taut. Costigan appears smart, too smart and has nothing to loose. As one individual recognises early on: ""you can't trust a man with nothing to loose"". Costigan's faux-boss in Costello, with his womanising attributes; casual cocaine use and analogies to bodily excretion embedded within his threats, is rightfully piggish and carries all the necessary traits required for us to accordingly despise him, although is played like a cartoon character and is difficult to take seriously. Costello's aid is a gangster named Mr. French, played by he-of-a-wavering-accent Ray Winstone; Winstone does his thing, a mixture of what he's done before in things like Nil by Mouth and what-have-you, and does it in his sleep.<br/><br/>The film uneasily cuts back and forth from DiCaprio and Damon, Damon of whom runs on a strand that isn't interesting and, dare I say, doesn't seem particularly necessary. Damon's cold, robotic expression throughout the film echoes the physical detachment we have from the film itself; when a time comes much later on for him to actually react to a quite incredible scenario, given the context, he has overseen - the sequence feels more grandeur and more incredible than it actually is because he's being asked to react to something; he's being asked to do something. Most of the dialogue in the film exists to advance whatever proceedings are required to move us all along; vacant are genuinely chilling moments of eerie realty, the likes of which might echo Travis Bickle's scociopathic monologue practises or long pauses on Jake LaMotta as he inhabits a locale, heaving and breathing - bordering on a fit of rage.<br/><br/>The sheer simplicity of it all is highlighted during one scene in which some of Costello's lesser goons stand around the entrance to a place of business randomly accusing passers by of being undercover, or ""rats"" – one of whom, in a jovial manner, is Di Caprio's character. The sequence is inter-cut with Damon's Sullivan sitting competently at a desk and computer frantically trying to run through whom of Costello's men might be untrustworthy, highlighting just how thoroughly more skilled one man is compared to many - yes, we gathered this ninety minutes ago. The Departed is scatty and detached, it's an alienating and frustrating film book-ended by individual bits and pieces that resonate; but if there's a reason they do, it's because droll story-telling is being momentarily interrupted by a moment which just 'happens', not because the film itself is especially engaging. Where many have lauded it and where The Academy itself buckled into rewarding Scorsese with the ultimate, it was merely dry and limp."

But they knew nothing about Sullivan, although his entire past is linked to the bad guy Costello? Why did Costello believed Costigan? Why was Costigan so violent toward the people in the shop? To make his disguise/cover work? *How could anyone suggest Wahlberg as the best supporting actor of the year? For what? Forcursing?

"lone_wolf_fenrir","8","1","2","13 July 2010"," So-so remake of an excellent movie
","Don't get me wrong, this movie is good, entertaining and the actors play well. The real problem is that this movie, while good is far from the movie it originated from... The original one, infernal affairs, was incredible and is really more realistic than the departed. It also has a much better pace, the movie is faster and still manages to produce more complex relations between characters.<br/><br/>Some important elements from Infernal Affairs were curiously removed -- such as as the scene where the police crew and the Mafia crew are sitting in the interrogation room immediately after they have just learned that each has a mole. As the Mafia boss and the police superintendent scan the room trying to get a clue as to who the mole might be, the scene effortlessly shifts from comical to tense all the while illustrating to the audience how faceless and destructive these moles actually are -- creating more of a sense of urgency to uncover their identities. Additionally, in the final scene in Affairs, the only person that knows the true identity of the undercover cop is Lau, the other mole. This minor detail makes the circumstances that much greater for both characters during the climatic rooftop scene. In Departed, we know that the Wahlberg character is still running around somewhere with this insider knowledge, making the desperate rooftop scene a little less...well, desperate.<br/><br/>The ending of the departed is disappointing too, it had to be a happy end...why ? Why do US filmmakers always think a happy ending is better ? It's not.<br/><br/>To sum it up, a good movie but not as good as its Chinese rival. If you liked this movie, you have to watch infernal affairs."
"paul2001sw-1","6","1","2","21 March 2009"," Reheated affairs
","Martin Scorcese has directed some fine movies, but his remake of 'Cape Fear' was amongst his weakest, a near-identical (and thus pointless) remake of the original. So news of 'The Departed', his version of 'Infernal Affairs', made me apprehensive. For those who don't know them, 'Infernal Affairs' and its two sequels, were brilliant films: violent yet cool, stylish but in no way shallow, and for a westerner like myself, interesting for their take on the Hong Kong underworld (a refreshing contrast to the over-familiar world of American gangsters). To be fair, in this case Scorcese has borrowed the plot elements but made his own film, a long way from a straight copy. Unfortuantly, he has also lost most of what was great about the originals. In the place of the cool, interesting world of Hong Kong, we have a very loud and direct movie full of wisecracking, foul-mouthed, ultra-macho American hard-men. Some of the writing made me squirm, it's not that the lines themselves are especially bad, but there's a depressing lack of originality in the way the script is constructed. Secondly, in the original movie, I cared for both leads, but in this film both Matt Damon and Leonardo di Caprio's characters (it's a starry cast all round, with a face you recognise in every role) are equally unappealing. And whereas the original movie dared start with the setup complete, leaving questions about how the plot got to this situation unanswered (at least until the sequel), Scorcese lacks the courage to do the same, walking us through the complete story in broadly chronological order, then adding some random, pointless minor time-shifting (the occasional scene shown out of sequence) as if in homage to his predecessor, while failing to understand the rationale of the device. The sad thing is that some of Scorcese's early movies, such as 'Mean Streets' and 'Taxi Driver', were as fresh and unexpected as 'Infernal Affairs' was; but in 'The Departed', he has reduced a classic to the Hollywood model of what a gangster film should be, and somehow won as Oscar for the achievement."

","This movie was great. I just had the chance to watch it for the first time, and it meet everything that anyone had said about it. Leonardo DiCaprio is great in this film. This is I think his best film or right up there with Blood Diamond. I don't want to hear from any of the DiCaprio brasher you know nothing. If you were like me and made you opinion based on Titanic then you should say nothing until you see this and Blood diamond. Everyone in this film did great. None of the big names tried to out do another. The only complaint in the acting is Matt Damon. I have never been a big fan at all, but he did pretty good in this one he just did not do as well as some of the others. He just does not seemed to be believable as a bad guy. That was my only problem with the movie. Jack Nicholson was at his best. Great film better than what people can even tell you."
"Reel_starz","10","1","2","16 November 2008"," A brilliant, engrossing crime drama
","""I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me."" So starts The Departed, one of this decade's finest movies. The above quote is spoken by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), the ruthless, unpredictable leader of the Irish mob that terrorizes South Boston. He is the most wanted criminal by the Massachusetts State Police, a.k.a. the Staties. A young cop with a shady background named Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) has been recruited by Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Staff Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) to infiltrate Costello's ranks. Little do the police know that Costello has already inserted his own informant, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), into the police department.<br/><br/>Even from the first two lines, the film manages to capture the audience's attention and hold it for over two-and-a-half hours. Armed with one of the wittiest, most unique scripts in years and an amazingly talented, A-list cast, director Martin Scorsese finally returns to what he does best: gritty noir-like films about the merciless, uncompromising world of organized crime. Filled with almost painfully realistic violence and more profanity than I ever thought possible, The Departed portrays the stresses and dangers of undercover life with pitch-perfect realism while managing to retain elements of touching and heartfelt drama. The characters are all well-developed and three-dimensional; even though they have their flaws, viewers come to really care about their triumphs and failures. Especially upon multiple viewings, it is possible to detect a sophistication and intricacy in The Departed that is absent in the majority of crime dramas. This is not a film for the sensitive or casual viewer and the intense plot of loyalty, betrayal and deceit has the complexity of a Shakespearean tragedy. In short, The Departed is a must-see film."
"naylmp","10","1","2","1 November 2008"," Absolutely loved it
","Wow! One word that I uttered when the end of this film regretfully came. Though normally not a fan of this particular genre, I found myself absolutely captivated by the genius of Martin Scorsese. The Departed is nothing short of incredible with spectacular acting all round (I could give all the names of the great actors but frankly, there isn't enough time in a week). How this film didn't earn more Oscars (although Mark Wahlberg fully deserved his) is a complete mystery to me. Anybody who loves the kind of crime and gangster movies should watch this film and bathe in its brilliance. Anybody who doesn't love the genre should watch this film and wonder why they don't watch more films like it. In short - pretty damn good."

","This movie is actually pretty damn good, Jack Nicholson's acting was brilliant, I literally can't get enough of it when he is playing a somewhat 'insane' role in his movies and he did this one amazingly. Leonardo DiCaprio was also great as Billy Costigan. The ending was quite a surprise as well, I won't spoil it but hey, it's nice to see something different compared to everything else. The only drawback to this movie is that I think there was a bit of boring dialog that didn't serve much of a point, but otherwise, entertaining film! Give it a watch.<br/><br/>Overall, I give it a 9/10, some of the best acting I've seen, very memorable scenes, priceless."

","The Departed is one of the greatest movies every made. It has everything you need for a great movie. It is filled with Hollywoods A-List celebrities, it has a legendary director, and it contains in my opinion the greatest script ever. Even better then Casablanca. This movie has every thing you look for when you go to the movies, it has action, drama, comedy, and romance. One thing I especially like about this movie is that every character has his own moment. Even characters like Fitzy and Delahunt. The movie is filled with career best performances by Dicaprio, Damon, Whalberg, and even Anthony Anderson. As for the director I do not think that Martin Scorcese could of made a better film. As of now I have not seen Raging Bull, but I have seen Goodfellas and even though I think that it is one of the greatest movies of all time, The Departed tops it easily. This is definitely Scorcese's best work."
"TrickTaylor","8","1","2","10 March 2008"," Excellent....with holes.
","This film came out 2 years ago, so sharing my thoughts on such a popular yet relatively old release is purely an exercise in boredom. Good thing I'm not the only one who could be accused of that here.<br/><br/>Unlike many who have submitted comments about The Departed I have not seen Internal Affairs, so I had nothing to base the movie on but itself. In an era of really bad movie making it was a pleasure to view this film and realize that there are still people trying to make impactful mainstream movies. The Departed is far from perfect, but it is top quality movie making with a top quality cast.<br/><br/>Please forgive the random nature of my thoughts on this movie. First, for some reason I enjoy star-studded casts. It is fun to see so many recognizable actors apply their craft together. I thought Leo DiCaprio was sensational as William, but it is still hard for me to watch him as anything other than Titanic boy. Nicholson's role was beefy, a great opportunity for Jack to ham it up a bit. Ironically, if anyone gets lost in this film it's him. His quirks were eluded to, but rarely shown on screen. To me, that made Costello too one dimensional.<br/><br/>The script was gritty, but not without its holes. The female psychoanalyst subplot seemed trumped up, and I am not at all convinced any professional in her spot would strike up a relationship with William. I also agree with a previous post that said that the film could not decide if Costello was a big time crime lord (micro-processors) or a small time hood (lunch counter shakedowns). Maybe it was hard to swallow the sensational when the film tries to be real and gritty.<br/><br/>The final scenes have gotten a lot of discussion and I agree that the conclusion seemed rushed. Everyone gets shot and that's it? I would have liked the movie to go back to Walberg and Baldwin's characters for a little closure.<br/><br/>The Departed is no Godfather, but it is a nod to classic, raw 70's gangster movies. Despite some questionable plot decisions it still delivers like few movie of its ilk can."
"st-shot","5","1","2","11 November 2007"," The Good Fellas in Boston - Episode 4
","It's more from the boy who gave you Good fellas, Casino (Good Fellas goes to Vegas) The Gangs of New York (The Good Fellas go Back in Time) with his latest of the series, The Departed (Good Fellas in Boston). Yes it's more illegal mayhem featuring ruthless mob bosses, cold blooded killers, well edited acts of violence and murder serenaded with nostalgic pop music.<br/><br/>All of these films are variations in one form or another from Martin Scorsese's highly original and brilliant first color film Mean Streets. By the end of the 80's he was probably America's finest active director with a resume that included two classics, Taxi Driver and the remarkable Raging Bull. Good Fellas was a well made update of Mean Streets. A kind of Mean Streets grows-up with a bigger budget and glossier look. Still it lacked the grittiness and energy of Streets. Casino had Pesci and Di Nero taking the same act to Vegas. It was back to New York and a century earlier with Gangs. This time it was Daniel Day Lewis and Leonard DiCaprio doing Bobby and Joe. <br/><br/>Now we have The Departed with a hammy Jack Nicholson and Leonard DiCaprio doing a full court Brando in this tale about police corruption and the Irish Mafia in Boston. The same Scorcese themes and devices (corruption and betrayal, vulgarity and violence) are nuanced to fit the Boston Irish stereotype. Bad accents abound with Martin Sheen's inebriated Ted Kennedy taking the honor as best of the worst. The rest of the actors displaying ""Irish tempers"" are uniformly bad. They rank with Day-Lewis unintentionally comic performance in Gangs.<br/><br/>So if you like the series (the Oscar crowd certainly did) you'll get more of the same in The Departed. Marty won't disappoint. He's a celebrity icon now but I liked him much better when he was an artist."
"alfiefamily","8","1","2","10 November 2007"," Marty and company score with ""The Departed""
","First of all, ""The Departed"" is a very good Martin Scorcese film. It is not however, a great Martin Scorcese film. Scorcese does what he does best. Moves the action along, creates powerful, interesting camera shots, gets wonderful performances out of his cast, and beautifully uses rock and roll to score his action. All of this is what we expect in a Scorcese film. <br/><br/>What we do not expect to find in his films is contrived plot twists, sudden, ""clean' endings, and sub-plots that do not add up to much. Unfortunately, all of these short comings are found in ""The Departed"". The message of the film seems to be, that the world is full of rats, be careful. The message is drummed into our heads over and over again. The movie goes on too long, with both the villains and our hero coming unglued too many times. Okay, we get it. Move along.<br/><br/>Standout performances are given by Nicholson, Wahlberg, Damon and especially DiCaprio. Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin also do a nice job. DiCaprio is a cop who is working undercover on the inside of Nicholson's gang, while Damon, is a cop who is pulling double duty working for Nicholson, and trying to identify the potential mole in their midst.<br/><br/>The story meanders from one killing to another, and shows how in the mob, no one can be trusted, and the extent to which they will try to weed out the moles. It goes on and on until a very unlikely ending comes along. While the rest of the movie was at least interesting, the ending was such a disappointment, that I had been cheated.<br/><br/>Even with that, I would recommend renting this film, just on the basis of the strong performances of the actors.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

While Jack Nicholson Proves once again, that he is on top of the acting hierarchy; he makes it hard to believe he has never acted as a gangster in the Irish Mob before in his career!

Shameless recycling for someone like Scorcese. I will never be able to say that this is one of Scorcese's best movies, simply cos it is not really his film, to my opinion. Even the police bureau with the glass offices looks the same...<br/><br/>I'm not blind for some additions like a better character description, and the adaption to American urban setting. In the end, the fantastic main actors saved my impression, so I still could enjoy the greatness of this film version. But let's never forget that the original was already very good!"
"tommymax","9","1","2","25 October 2007"," Pretty darn good -- I think.
","Well, I just watched this last night (actually ending @ 3AM) so it would be nice if I can edit this comment later, but I think I'm giving this a 9 (or better). I think the main thing I want to say about it is that it's a film that I want to watch again and maybe more than twice. I found the way it was cut in the early part of the film was kinda ""preview-like"" in that the images shown jumped around like you see in a preview. I frankly was quite confused for a lot of it because I had trouble telling Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio apart during a lot of those scenes. They were dressed a lot alike during much of it, yada yada yada.<br/><br/>Now, admittedly this is largely a function of my own stupidity (or ignorance) but I still found it hard to follow the significance of what was happening. That would have been more annoying if I had been seeing this during its run in the theaters, but it's not a problem now that it's on DVD. In fact, it makes it a good thing because I can go back and catch what I missed the first time thru.<br/><br/>I suspect the effect was intended, but that's just a guess. There seemed to be a general theme of ""confusing the viewer"" throughout the film. Makes for good repeated viewing. Also, mixing up the two characters enhances the main theme of the movie as it ""blends"" them to the point of making them somewhat ""indistinguishable."" As Jack's character points out: when you're facing the business end of a gun, ""what's the difference?"" Billy and Colin weren't that much different after all, were they? Each was performing the same function for his respective ""side."" The film reminded me a LOT of Goodfellas, one of my personal favorites. It was most definitely and obviously a Scorsese film as his stamp is all over it. It's a fine film and worthy of praise. Very powerful and had me engaged throughout. And eager for a 2nd viewing. I guess that speaks highly of it.<br/><br/>Leonardo's performance was superb. So was Jack's -- but we've come to expect that, and he was largely just Jack being Jack. Matt Damon was fine but I think I'm not all that much of a fan; and I think Leonardo's performance just overpowered Damon's. Maybe it's just me. I'm not a Leonardo fan but I might be on my way to becoming one. He could be the new Johnny Depp -- if he isn't already.<br/><br/>Excellent film. Highly recommended. But be forewarned, it's violent."

","I really liked the premise of the movie. DiCaprio and Damon play two guys who grew up under very similar circumstances, one becomes and undercover cop in the gang of Jack Nicholson, the other goes on to be Nicholson's rat at the State Police.<br/><br/>For the most part, the movie is a dark and serious gangster drama. But then there are some weird moments. Mark Wahlberg's character is satirical at best and harshly contrasted by the calm realness of Martin Sheen. Alec Baldwin borders comedy as well and Jack Nicholson spends half the movie balancing the thin line between satire and reality. Add to that some situations that struck me as more funny than anything else and I'm stuck with a mixed feeling about the movie as a whole."
"shhimundercoverdamnit","10","1","2","15 October 2007"," The Departed
","Martin Scorsese's ode to gangsters and cops is profane, brutal, bloody and brilliant. Having seen the film in the theatres, I was more than glad to shell out some more money to buy the film on DVD. So where do I start? The Departed is a film of the ages, a visceral tale of crime and consequences. Of corruption and power. Of loyalty and suspicion. It is through these lines that the characters cross, double cross and collide.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio has never been better. Having been a fan of his for a long time, I have to say that he has really started to come into his own since hooking up with Scorsese, having scored a number of deep and tragic characters. Thus, in the Departed. He plays a rookie cop by the name of William Costigan who had grown up all around crime. Thus, making him the perfect mole- a mole on the inside of the Mob run by boss Frank Costello ( Jack Nicholson). It is now, Costigan's job to win both Costello's trust and help his detective handlers ( Mark Wahlberg & Martin Sheen) bring Costello down. But it is SIU officer Colin Sullivan ( Matt Damon) who holds everyone's trust.<br/><br/>The film also has a brilliant supporting cast as well, led by the always intense Ray Winstone, Vera Farmiga, and come on, Alec Baldwin was awesome here. "" Patriot Act. Patriot Act. I love it, I love it, I love it."" Between Wahlberg and Baldwin lie some of the best quotes of the movie.<br/><br/>One of my favorite scenes from the film was the scene where DiCaprio's character freakin kneecaps this guy, who then reveals that Costello is an FBI informant. The guy then hilariously starts crying. ""I thought you were supposed to go into shock! I'm not in shock! It f*cking hurts!"" Another scene that I thought was beyond brilliant was the DiCaprio and Damon silent cell phone interaction. There are also several "" Holy ....... Did that really just happen moments"" as well. I won't spoil them.<br/><br/>My favorite line was probably the one line where Matt Damon referenced being Irish and how we ""don't try to fix a mistake, we live and bitch with it...."" Searing, can't look away film-making. Bravo, Mr. Scorsese."

Stop analyzing movies frame by frame, assuming that cheap skepticism lends superiority or some other assumed virtue. <br/><br/>First off, it's a movie. A really good one. Second, it's a far cry from stupid action flicks where lone strongmen storm armed fortresses. <br/><br/>Finally, you can't put human behavior in your dumb little test tube. Just as one parallel example, here's a quote from Wikipedia considering the demise of Jesse James: ""With his gang depleted by arrests, deaths, and defections, Jesse thought he had only **two men left whom he could trust**: brothers Bob and Charley Ford. Charley had been out on raids with Jesse before, but Bob was an **eager new recruit.** To better protect himself, Jesse asked the Ford brothers to move in with him and his family. Little did he know that Bob Ford had been conducting secret negotiations with Thomas T. Crittenden, the Missouri governor, to bring in Jesse James."" (asterisk emphasis added)"

I doubt it.<br/><br/>Let's go to the plot outline first. It focuses on two characters, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) and Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio). Both are new police officers. Sullivan has been patronized, since his childhood, by big mobster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), and now that he's a cop, he still works for him undercover. Costigan is recruited by Capt. Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) to become his undercover man in Costello's gang. What ensues is the narration of how each of them gets around under their circumstances, and how both Costello and Queenan begin to suspect there's a spy on their side, but they don't know who it is.<br/><br/>I found the central part of the movie the most enjoyable and coherent. The introduction was exhaustive, maybe too exhaustive. The ending was very good too. But, like I said, it's the story details and episodes that make the best part of the movie. I especially appreciated how Costigan's side of the story is told, and I found his character much better developed than that of Sullivan.<br/><br/>I found nothing very wrong about ""The departed"", but I was bothered by some inconsistencies along the way, especially one, which kind of downgraded the movie a little for me. Again, probably, if this hadn't been such a generally applauded film, it wouldn't have mattered... or maybe it would.<br/><br/>Overall, a good thriller, but I didn't find any particularly deep content to it, nor anything that hasn't been said a million times before in this kind of movie.

While Matt is one of Nickolson's boys who has landed a cop position. It is soon believed there is a rat in the police force and it's Matt's job to find the rat.

There are no winners in these bleak lives, but there are plenty of rats in the race.<br/><br/>With his fine sense of music, Scorsese continues to place the right songs in the most appropriate places in ""The Departed"". With the Stones' ""Gimme Shelter"" in the background, he introduces his king rat, Costello, and as Jack gives his audience his best seductive smile, the lyrical aftermath of ""Sympathy for the Devil"" can almost be heard to begin its refrain in your brain. It's those kinds of touches which make ""The Departed"" an excellent film, a film where, ""every cop's a criminal and all the sinners, saints."" As heads is tails, just call Jack, Lucifer, as I believe this film explains.<br/><br/>But what would Lucifer be without his collaborators. Nothing. He needs them for his power and they need him in order to taste and smell same. They kneel and he arbitrarily and capriciously dispenses death.<br/><br/>This is not a nice movie about nice people.

"RResende","7","1","2","8 July 2007"," Martin looking back to himself
","Scorcese went back to his past as a filmmaker. In his latest projects he had been exploring the possibilities of moving his camera around, in my view fundamentally in two directions: - exploring space, architecture, the surroundings; - provoking sensations, in this case attached to a character (or several) and transmitting those sensations to us, audience. In this case, i'm naturally speaking of ""Gangs of New York"" and ""The Aviator"". The first one was more bold in this concerns, the second was more thought up, maybe more refined and multi layered (it introduced colors, the evolution of time and revived the character centered camera moments). I valued those projects because Scorcese took some risks and tried to make an evolution as a director. He didn't arrive at ""safe land"" or real conclusions. But that is the meaning of experimenting. trying solutions.<br/><br/>With this one, he put some of those experiments aside. That apparently, i mean. In this picture, Scorecese turns back to his character exploitation. It's all about characters. The actions moves along based on the character's mental state, fears. I talk, of course, about Damon and DiCaprio. Nicholson is no long the fear provoker of The shining, nor the sharp detective of Chinatown (and specially Two Jakes). He brought here some of the comedic kind of performance he developed in his last years lesser projects (this is a side note). So, the over layering of main characters allows Scorcese to make more complex his previously quite simple (and many times uninteresting) game of Goodfellas or Casino. It's a refreshing of his ""formula"", based, i believe, on trying to extend to the way he ordinarily developed his characters the experimental attitude of his latest projects. I suppose this was to be a side project on his newest tendencies, but i hope the high success this one had doesn't make Martin give up the experiments he had been conducting... Anyway, to this point, The Departed follows the kind construction Scorcese masters the best: the character driven one.<br/><br/>For every technical aspect, this is obviously nearly flawless; and i wanted to watch this without having watched the one which this remakes. I didn't want to base my comment on that other film.<br/><br/>My evaluation: 4/5, nevertheless i hope Scorcese continues his last 5 years tendency, he may get somewhere new to his standards.<br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

","During the late 1970s, in South Boston, Irish mobster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) selected his ten year old, future protégée, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), to graduate from the Massachusetts State Police Academy. When he finally graduated from the academy fifteen years later and subsequently became an informer for Costello, one of his classmates, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), was assigned as an undercover cop to filter through the corrupt, underground business of Costello. His administrators, Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) and Queenam (Martin Sheen), require him to wait until the exact right moment to take down Costello. Both Costigan and Sullivan are overrun by their double-lives as they are determined to find the ""rat"" in both the mafia and in the Police.<br/><br/>In ""The Departed"" Martin Scorsese tries to depict a simple message: you get what is coming to you. This message is not depicted until the very end of the movie when Sullivan is shot when he walks into his apartment. It really did not seem logical for one of the main characters to escape his own fate. Anyone could have guessed that Costigan would die simply because he was tied up in the mafia. Everyone who is ever involved with the mob ends up getting himself killed. Even though Costigan was one of the ""good guys,"" he still should have known what he was getting himself into. It can be seen in ""The Departed"" that everyone who is fraudulent is punished for their actions.<br/><br/>As for me, on of the best scenes of the movie is the very last one. After Sullivan is shot in the back of the head by Dignam, the camera fades away and shows a view through the window of the Boston Police Department. With the department in the background, a rat runs across the windowsill. This is great symbolism in the fact that is characterizes good and evil in the rat and the Boston Police Department. This last scene seems to add a finishing touch that leaves a constant reminder of the differences of both good and evil."
"ah`Pook","6","1","2","19 May 2007"," Confused and ultimately disappointing - gangsters and cellphones.
","Endless respect for Martin Scorsese - I love Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, After Hours, King of Comedy, GoodFellas, and Last Temptation of Christ - but The Departed was just plain muddled and somewhat pointless, not really deserving of inclusion in that list. Doublecrossing, triplecrossing, quadruple-crossing gangsters plus a lot of cellphone silliness, edited like a 2 and a half hour movie trailer with some great actors turning in wildly uneven performances. Jack Nicholson is manic and rambling, completely over the top and not very believable. Matt Damon simply fails at conveying real emotion and Leo DiCaprio is monotonously tortured, Martin Sheen and Vera Farmiga are wooden and lifeless. Surprisingly the best acting is delivered by Alec Baldwin (hysterically funny) and most of all Mark Wahlberg (completely believable as a tough-as-nails state police sergeant). At no point did I see anything which resembled the real operations of organised crime, the police, or even psychiatry - Farmiga's character breaks every rule, constantly - she is described as a 'hot sh*t' psychiatrist, but I would argue about 'hot' being appropriate in this context. The twists, turns, folds, and manipulations of the plot do not reward the attentive viewer, they merely allow Scorsese to move from set-piece to set-piece. The rapid-fire editing condenses the story to only the most significant events, and I think here he has gone too far, as the exhausting pace feels more like an ordeal than a story. The appearance of the rat at the end is like some kind of joke - symbolism so leaden you can't possibly miss it. I didn't even like the soundtrack, especially the inclusion of 'Comfortably Numb', a song from the soundtrack of The Wall (another muddled mess of a film!) which does not describe any character's state of mind. On the positive side, there is some great bravura filmcraft, and it's never really boring, and Wahlberg is just superb. It's still better than most of the genre in the last decade and as usual some fantastic ideas (the cross section of the cellphone secretly texting in Damon's pocket, for instance, was great). My advice would be to watch Internal Affairs if you like this sort of film. I rate it 6 out 10 because it's never mediocre. It just falls very short of a classic."
"mckenzietm","8","1","2","14 May 2007"," Don't be fooled... this is Infernal Affairs remixed by Hollywood.
","Sorry to burst your bubble, but this is no Yank film. It's a Chinese film series from Hong Kong, a place where the industry still has some original ideas, called Infernal Affairs (1-3). In fact, I have been watching Hong Kong cinema for about 10 years because I'd gotten so bored with the shallowness of American film plots. The real shocker for me was to hear about ""this great movie called The Departed"", to rent it, and to feel totally ripped off. I've owned the Infernal Affairs DVD set for a few years now and in my opinion, putting white actors in the movie, giving them Boston accents, and making small changes to the script does not a new movie make. These Americans should be ashamed for not giving the original Chinese writers enough credit. Instead, they act like its an American film instead of an American adaption of a foreign film.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. The acting talent in this version is outstanding- probably the best in America. But if you want to see a more realistic, more developed version... see the original (don't worry there are subtitles)."
"mattrochman","5","1","2","13 May 2007"," Not bad, but undisciplined, unoriginal and silly
","Goodfellas was generally worthy of a best picture Oscar. Unfortunately it was released the same year as Dances With Wolves and lost out to it (rightfully so, to be honest, but only becayse Dances With Wolves was a rare masterpiece). <br/><br/>The Departed faced little competition the year it was released and Scorsese did deserve a best picture Oscar so this film seems to have been given that accolade, but probably didn't deserve it. <br/><br/>This is far from Scorsese's best work. There are a number of problems. First, this film was based on a foreign film called Infernal Affairs and in my view, the film really doesn't depart from the original much at all (if you'll forgive the pun). Ultimately this made the film easier to make and there's an obvious lack of originality at the end of the day.<br/><br/>Then there was the undisciplined Jack Nicholson. Somehow, it felt like they told Jack what the scene was generally about and let him improvise his entire dialog and acting. It was way too over-the-top and muddled the film's tone, even though it was fairly amusing. I think keeping him in check and 'directing' him properly would have made for a better film. <br/><br/>The fact that it borrowed some cinematic styling and even songs from Goodfellas and Casino, resulting in a bit of a recycled finish to the film. <br/><br/>In addition, there are some scripting issues and over-exaggerated portrayals, such as Marky Mark's crude and often stupid character. Similar for Alec Baldwin. It didn't add anything to film's depth and seemed contrived and overdone for the sake of contrast. <br/><br/>Di Caprio played the same old part he always plays and while some disagree, I don't rate him as a serious actor. Though Scorsese seems to like recasting him. <br/><br/>Matt Damon played his part well though. <br/><br/>The long winded, far-fetched twists and turns became ridiculous by the end. Not a film that one would bother re-watching in the years to come, unlike Scorcese's previous efforts."

"Nicholas_perry","8","1","2","2 May 2007"," Great but not as great as Infernal Affairs
","I watched Infernal Affairs before The Departed. Even though I enjoyed The Departed I liked IA more. One thing I did like about The Departed was that the casting very well done. Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio where very good as the moles, each was very convincing as their characters. Mark Wahlberg was very entertaining as Dignam, as was Alec Baldwin as capt Ellerby. One of my favorite scenes was where Bladwin goes after the tech guy that couldn't set up the cameras right.<br/><br/>Martin Sheen played his part well as a semi-father figure to DiCaprio. Jack Nicholson was also enjoyable as Frank but some of scenes here he was over the edge like that of the cocaine and the hooker could have been left out. Vere Farmiga was good but unfortunately was obviously the weakest link in this cast. <br/><br/>In The Departed there were some changes that added to story and some that I thought shouldn't have been made. IA setup where Yan had already infiltrated the triads was much more convincing believable then showing how in a short time Costigan had infiltrated Frank's gang. The lack of the music shop scene from IA was disappointing as it lost the connection to the sound system and a element that showed how the two moles mirrored each other, but by combining the two female roles from IA into one created more conflict between the moles. <br/><br/>The addition of Dignam, while entertaining, cause a problem for me as it was hard to believe that after Capt Queenan's death that Dignam would just leave the case without giving up who the mole was. <br/><br/>The ending was one of the most important change and the change I hated the most. I felt that by having Sullivan being caught and killed fell into the American idea of the bad guy never wins. <br/><br/>While the original was better I felt by making these changes among others cause The Departed to become a movie of its own rather then a simple adaptation."
"mcsheehey","8","1","2","1 May 2007"," Not a Bad Film, But Overrated
","Over the years, Scorsese has delivered more American classics than any other director. From ""Taxi Driver"" to ""The Aviator,"" he has always turned in fantastic work. The question is, is the ""Departed"" fantastic, or is it simply good? I would go with the latter.<br/><br/>If there's one thing that has put a serious dent on the quality of thrillers, it's the cell phone. Instead of a heated chase in which the two men have nowhere to turn, the chased man can now simply call for support on his phone. Suspenseful and intense? Not so much. As far as thrillers go, ""The Departed"" is a good one. The characters are interesting, the plot moves quickly, and the acting is fantastic.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon both turn in exceptional performances as a sheep in a land filled with wolves and a wolf in sheep's clothing. DiCaprio should have been nominated for an Oscar for his role as the constantly bad luck-ridden Billy. Damon also sets the tone right for the most part as Colin, though I feel that he should have made the role a bit more likable.<br/><br/>The best performance in the film belongs to Jack Nicholson, who plays an intense crime boss with a dirty mouth, eyes like a hawk, and power like that of no other man. It surprises me that he received no nominations, when his work in the film was potent and frighteningly brutal. He deserved the nomination much more than Mark Wahlberg, who does little more than strut around and talk in a thick accent.<br/><br/>These great performers, along with Alec Baldwin and Martin sheen, make the film very entertaining. The script suits the actors well, and is often quite funny. Still, this film is never elevated to the level that Scorsese's past films have been. It is a good movie, and I understand that the Oscar was more of a tribute to Scorsese's career, but the film does not quite measure up as a classic in my book. Better luck next time, Marty."

","I believe that ""The Departed"" wants to be the new ""The Godfather,"" but to me, it misses the mark. The storyline and cast have all the potential in the world, but both fail, or are let down by the cast and their performances. By the way , I am a big Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, and Mark Walhberg fan to begin with, and Leonardo DiCaprio won me over in this role. I'm not sure if the actors or the director failed here. I think Nicholson and Wahlberg overact their parts to the point of being ridiculous, but were they instructed to play their roles this way? I think Damon and DiCaprio, as their characters of course, make ludicrous decisions in the climactic scenes of the movie. There are a number of other faults with the movie, but these are the most important and the most egregious. This is the first movie on which I have ever commented on IMDb. Most times, I am in general agreement with what I consider an astute group of IMDb readers and staff, but this one I don't get. I am stunned that this movie won best picture (unless it was for overlooking Scorcese for far too long, rather than it being the best movie.) Maybe I need to watch it a couple of more times to let it grow on me, but I really don't believe that I will be able to make myself sit through it again."

Acting is good all-round, with the slight exception of Jack Nicholson (yes, he's better than in his usual roles, but that's not saying much for someone who hasn't shown any great range in, well, decades). The performances that stand out are Leonardo DiCaprio - MAN, does he capture the intensity of this character - and Mark Wahlberg. Where does the movie fall flat? Well, it's nothing special... nothing all that new. Undercover cops, one who's a double agent, who'll-find-who first, etc etc. I didn't find the direction to be particularly amazing at all - Scorsese has done much better.

In the words of Alfred Hitchcock, this movie was all McGuffin! Or lots of sizzle but no steak! Plot holes galore. It had more loose ends than Keanu Reeves after a month in prison. Most of this convoluted film is a complete waste of time.<br/><br/>Here is the SPOILER! Within the last ten minutes of the film we are introduced to a character as almost an afterthought, that would have changed the complexion of the entire film! Rendering the film we just spent two hours watching a pointless waste of time! Sure for people expecting Marty's usual splattering blood sequences, you'll get plenty of those. Plenty of graphic physical violence but no real story.<br/><br/>Basically the story goes like this... Low level hood (The GREAT Jack Nicholson) contends with a rat from the police force that wants to know about an undercover agent (Leo DiCaprio) in the ranks of an Irish mob in Boston that no-one really cares about, you shouldn't either. The rat and the undercover agent share the same girlfriend. The undercover agent gets whacked by another undercover agent/rat that Marty finally decides to tell us about in the last ten minutes. The rat (Matt Damon) gets whacked by a disgruntled cop. And as the rat's body lays dead in his new apartment, a real rat scurries by the window... Closing credits.<br/><br/>Clichéd, hackneyed, weak, amateurish, bloated and convoluted.<br/><br/>Save your money, rent Goodfellas again! At least in that one you gave a crap about the characters!"
"frankjspencejr","4","1","2","24 March 2007"," Did I see the wrong movie?
","I am floored that this movie has been so well received. After seeing the Hong Kong film ""Infernal Affairs"" several years ago, I found the Departed (surprisingly) to be deficient in every way: style, appearance, coherence, story, ending. DiCaprio's character is searched thoroughly in one scene, and in one a bit later he's wearing a wire, and he's not searched. Jack Nicholson's character, a crime boss, knows he has a mole. He suspects the ex-police academy student DiCaprio. But DiCaprio implores him ""I'm not a cop!"" Well, there you go, that settles it. Nor tail, no nothing'. At the end he mails the damning evidence to Matt Damon's character, the mole. Why not to someone else? At times the dialog was so muffled and fast that the Departed could also have used subtitles like the foreign film.<br/><br/>There were some strong performances from a talented group of actors. It was fun watching Wahlberg and DiCaprio spar verbally. Nicholson was, well, Nicholson. My criticism is directed at the screenwriter and the director. Ironically, they both won awards. I know Martin Scorcese has been around a long time, making gritty violent films. He is apparently revered in the business. He's probably a wonderful guy. I'm just not a big fan. For a superior experience I suggest Infernal Affairs."

The movie has an unrivaled pace, which I think is both innovative and so natural that I expect to see it emulated (and possibly improved upon) a lot. Not only are there really high paced scenes, not unlike Requiem for a Dream, but the pace is high all the way through and it gives the movie some serious momentum.<br/><br/>Not a typical Scorcese, his craftsmanship still shines through and it makes me wish he would start making more movies that depart from his usual themes. There's some weak bits, like the limp relationship hook between the two main characters and the shrink. Some more Hollywood clichés find their way into the movie, but it's never really in the way of a decent picture.<br/><br/>But then we come to it: The Elevator Scene.<br/><br/>Up to that point, a carefully constructed plot has you in your grips, on a roller-coaster ride with casualties left and right. And then, the worst of the worst: a deus ex machina ending... It's no just bad and easily forgiven. It's horrible.<br/><br/>Despite all the good things you can say about this movie, it's about the story and the plot first and foremost. And to destroy it with a completely unpredictable and unrelated character, for no apparent reason other than proving the point that everyone is a rat and the world is going to hell, is weak. Nothing but weak.<br/><br/>This one takes the throne. For me personally, it replaces the Dallas ""it's all a dream"" scam. The Oscar for ""Best Writing"" goes to a flimsy deus ex machina tale...

","I haven't watched Infernal Affairs. I watched The Departed and The Departed alone. And I watched it twice to see whats there in this movie. It has all the hardcore elements of any gangster movie which could have only come from the master of gangster movies - Martin Scorsese, and no one else. What I don't understand is, why even the idea of a gangster extends to the Police Department. I don't expect to see a clean police but they don't seem much different from the gangsters portrayed in this film. Extremely shameful dialogues. The wits were cool and enjoyable though, throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson has done one of the most irritating roles I have ever seen. He didn't act. He has lived his role. Thats the mark of a great actor like him. He has done it excellent. Even though, the role given to him is too irritating for a movie-goer. It made me wanna look elsewhere when he came on-screen.<br/><br/>Matt Damon has done really well. I have high respects for him since Ripley and Bourne. His expressions are natural but sometimes he seems to be quite confused of his role, which I believe any actor would feel if they are given such a script and such a character.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is wonderful. His role absolutely suits him. I think he is the only one in the movie who must felt comfortable with what was given to him and enjoyed doing it. He shines throughout the movie from an after-school trooper to a beaten-up statie on the roof top.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg should have turned down this offer. Swearing and too much swearing. Any guy could have done his role. He is a great actor but he is wasted in this movie.<br/><br/>As far as the movie is concerned, its well made. Top notch direction and cinematography. The script and screenplay are too shaky. Some of the dialogues are tried to sound like Pulp Fiction or Goodfellas. But none of them carry any interesting message. Most of them are, in two words, boring and pointless. Its really difficult to believe that someone who made a masterpiece like Casino could make The Departed and that too after so many years of experience.<br/><br/>I consider Casino and Goodfellas as two of the greatest and purest gangster movies of all time. Scorsese has excelled in both of them. I really wonder why should he have done this movie after all. I am glad to see that it has gone to IMDb #71. I am also glad to see a lot of people liking this movie. I only wish I could share their affection for it.<br/><br/>Watch it once. You may like it for the multi-mega-starrer aspect, Scorsese's masterful direction and for the suspense in the end. But you may not like it for the movie on the whole. The only question which I had at the end of the second screening was why this movie got the Best Picture Oscar. Some of you might feel the same, some of you might not. I'll leave it up to you.<br/><br/>The Departed should have never been started."

For people in the US, maybe the ending is the ultimate, or even the ending is mob-like. But that doesn't take away the fact that another bullet in another head simply is an easy ending. No matter if it was unexpected, it is too simple, too lame, too much America for the world. No matter the actual role of guns and violence in mafia and society as a whole, the ending had a twist already and didn't need another. Death is no true punishment, but for most criminals an escape from trial and conviction.<br/><br/>Why build up the safety letter if something happened if it still was never used?

Without trying to give anything away, many of the relationships and resolutions become infuriating towards the end.

","Most of The Departed is engaging and taut, with undercover characters always teetering on the edge of having their true identities discovered by either the cops or the crooks, and those parts of the film make for good cinema. However (spoiler alert) when Frank Costello (Nicholson) is prematurely killed in a run-of-the-mill drug raid that looks like it came from a lackluster TV series, the film loses something extremely important, and becomes a lesser movie because of it. Costello's character was the evil engine that drove the film's mood of menace and foreboding. As long as he lived, our hero DiCaprio was in constant peril, and Costello's influence infused everything, from DiCaprio's dissembling to Damon's character's double- agent work in the police department, with significance. There could have been a great climax involving the two rats and the Big Cheese their world revolved around. Instead, the movie falls apart and just meanders to an ending involving a supporting character delivering the coup de grace that should have been DiCaprio's. It was almost as if the filmmakers realized how long the film was running and decided to wrap everything up with whatever characters they had left. All in all, it's better than most mainstream films you might happen to see, but it's not worthy of an Oscar."

I am a great fan on Jack Nicholson and he was perfect in his role, unfortunately my disappointment came through his character on the scene where he shows his member when him and Leo are in the movie theater! That was a very gross and completely unnecessary event, which only contributed for a stronger ""R"" rating, maybe that's why some people comment that Scorcese has been doing more ""commercial"" films lately trying to get the Oscar ( which he got... ). Anyway the movie would loose nothing without that grotesque scene and I was really disappointed at Mr. Scorcese for including it and Jack for accepting doing it! Actually I watched the movie on DVD in my home theater, so I'm not aware if the theater version explicitly shows it like that! The plot is very rich with details, all very well characterized by the actors. Like someone else said, the end was cut too short for everything that happens, mainly considering other scenes which were a bit longer than needed. As I said before, I was overwhelmed by the excellent photography."
"fhn15","8","1","2","3 March 2007"," Very Good, not great.
","Well shot, well scored, well edited--for once events that are supposed to be happening simultaneously feel like they are happening simultaneously, and its also a nice way to suggest passage of time)-- well acted, well directed, and well written--the characters are always smart, and the screenplay almost always refuses to cheat. And yet, the romantic subplot is contrived. What are the odds of a cop and crook, particularly the cop and the crook who are working against each other, falling for the same girl? Why not give each a different girl to aid in developing their characters? Not having seen Infernal Affairs, I couldn't say if Monahan lifted this element from it, but it is unnecessarily economical decision nevertheless. It also brings the movie down to the level of a genre picture; though, like Heat and Collateral, a very good one. It would never have won Best Picture if Taxi Driver had."
"BlackMan90","10","1","2","1 March 2007"," Best film of the year
","The Departed, based on the Japanese film, 'Infernal Affairs', is the best film of the year and never fails to entertain.<br/><br/>It's about an undercover police officer (Leonardo DiCaprio) who infiltrates the mob (Lead by Jack Nicholson), and a young gangster (Matt Damon) who infiltrates the police department. William Monahan's writes the best script of the year. His Boston dialog and aura, diverse characters, and quick twists will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of the best performances of the year. He plays his character with an anxious fidgetyness and a bunch of controlled fear and anger. Matt Damon gives a criminally underrated performance. His character isn't entirely bad, but I feel that he does the deceptive things he does out of honor and devotion to his 'Dad'. Jack Nicholson is a constant threat in this film. His tenacity and unpredictability strikes fear in the hearts of everyone he comes in contact with. He demands respect and he gets it. His chemistry with Leo and Matt is top-notch. Mark Wahlberg play an A-Hole in every form of the word. If he doesn't know you, he doesn't like you and doesn't get to know you and Wahlberg plays it with perfect arrogance. Vera Farmiga holds her own on the screen with DiCaprio and Damon, but she is easily forgotten. Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, and Ray Winstone add great veteran backup. Props to Marty. This is the best cast of the year.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese perfectly crafts this crime thriller. The cinematography, editing, and Howard Shore's pulsy score gives the film a deadly Boston personality. He perfectly paces this film and gives it dramatic tension and suspense at the right moments. On an emotional level, he shows what life on the undercover is like. Always having to look back behind your back can wear a person out.<br/><br/>All in all, The Departed is a brilliantly acted and directed film. Marty's best yet."

","I've followed the production of this movie (on this site) for the last couple of years and by God was I excited last night as I finally held a copy in my hand. However, after watching the movie I felt somewhat disappointed. Don't get me wrong I thought it was a good, solid movie but it all just felt a bit pointless.<br/><br/>Many people have said it's hard to like the characters??? I myself found it harder to believe these characters exist!!! and if they do then Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon and esp. Mark Whalberg definitely failed to convince me (and I love JN). The best thing about this movie has to be Leonardo DiCaprio. As usual his pulled of another challenging role. His instinct as an actor is remarkable and in 'The Departed' he really gets the chance to spread his wings and is brilliant in depicting the often conflicting sides of the human psyche. (with great insight fullness and sensitivity)<br/><br/>I love Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Casino etc. only like the latter two in particularly, Martin Scorsese just fails to hold his concentration right at the last and ends up presenting us with an atrocious film IN TERMS OF EDITING. If you haven't noticed it go and watch it again. Sorry to mention it, but it really annoys me, as it's just careless and distracting.<br/><br/>All in all I would recommend this movie as it is entertaining, there is good characterisation and yes it is well directed. However, if your hoping to see a film some people have described as the best in 10 years, then think again. This movie lacks the intention and, well, ending to leave any real satisfaction. It's like eating the most finger licking meal in your life, only then having to wait for a dessert that never arrives. For those of you on a diet this should fill up you nicely."

"waltfrith1","Null","1","2","24 February 2007"," Crime central.
","The best film of 2006, in the tradition of 'Mean Streets', 'Taxi Driver', 'Raging Bull' and 'GoodFellas', is a film that is right up there with the best work that director Martin Scorsese has ever done and this is the best written film of those previously mentioned. This cat and mouse story of of a crooked mole (Matt Damon) inside the Boston state police force and an undercover police officer (Leonardo DiCaprio) inside Boston's Irish mob is a convincing and evenly paced thriller with enough high points leading up to its conclusion that would make Mount Everest jealous. Mark Wahlberg, as a foul mouthed and self righteous staff sergeant on the force steals every scene he is in and Jack Nicholson's sinister portrayal of the film's mob boss is as lethal as any crime boss we've ever seen, only Jack is smoother than all the rest. With support from others such as Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin, 'The Departed' captures the appeal of the obligatory violence that Scorsese is known for in his films and this is an instant classic that is not only one of Scorsese's best but it is arguably one of the best crime films ever made."

"goldenplatestudios","Null","1","2","17 February 2007"," A gift of cinema
","This film is something I will talk about for a long time. I have been a solid fan of Scorsese since Mean Streets but no film has smacked me to the ground in awe like The Departed. <br/><br/>First about the script and directing. The story flows perfectly. There are no scenes that in the film that don't NEED to be in the film. Each scene something relevant is revealed and it continues the story in rapid progression. Nothing is revealed too soon and nothing is held back to long from the audience. A masterpiece of writing. The character are fitting, specific and interesting. Throughout there is a curiosity of what's going on and where it's going without being annoyingly confusing. The cinematography is gorgeous. All the shots are perfect, the lighting is gorgeous and it sets the perfect mood for the scene. The directing is amazing. There is that Scorsese feel to the film, realistic with a touch of insane fantasy. A true piece of art. <br/><br/>Now on to the cast. First we'll start with the king, Jack Nicholson. Another 10 point performance under his already outstanding record. He portrays a mafia boss with such charisma and insanity that you can't take your eyes off of him. No matter how evil his character is, you still find yourself rooting for him. An outstanding performance, I would honestly say one of his best. Matt Damon has a huge role in this film and for the first time I didn't want to jump through the screen and kill him. I can't stand Matt Damon but I was able to tolerate him for this film. The huge surprise to me is Leonardo Dicaprio. Like Matt Damon I have always thought that he was overrated. He proved me wrong in this film. He gives an award winning performance. Amazing. You can't take your eyes off the screen any time he's on it. He owns the scene every single moment unless he's in the scene with Jack. If that is the case, You can't decide who to focus on. <br/><br/>This film is a classic and I guarantee you wont regret watching it."

Maybe I missed them but I was pretty sure that they weren't in the movie. Does anyone know what happened with them? Or was I under the wrong impression? Either way I'm confused. Overall I thought that the movie was pretty good but that the end needed a little work. Jack Nicholson is the man and I loved his performance and Leonardo has come a long way since Titanic. I thought that Damon did well in his role too. I could have used a little more Wahlberg though I didn't like the fact that they wrote him out at the end until the final scene."

While the deaths came as no real surprise, the rapid succession made each inconsequential. I was highly invested in these characters, and I, the audience, deserved a fitting reckoning, a flourish. A shot in the head by a civilian! No humiliation; no atonement. The rat symbolism was contrived, and definitely not compensation for a muddy ending. So why did I still give it an 8? Because it was a really good movie; the disappointing thing is it not ending up a great movie."
"dwolf","4","1","2","15 February 2007"," Great Characters But Full of Plot Holes
","I was looking forward to seeing this movie. I begin my review with this statement because high expectations unmet can't help but affect our opinions.<br/><br/>The acting was for the most part excellent. The direction was excellent, especially cinematographically. But the writing left me cold.<br/><br/>Often times writers will sacrifice believability for plot twists or mere convenience. This happens in The Departed. Characters often act in ways which don't make any sense.<br/><br/>Examples: (warning plot spoilers)<br/><br/>Dignam and Queenan know everything about Billy Costigan, including intimate family details, but don't know that Sullivan grew up working for Costello, that Costello came to Sullivan's graduation at the police academy, that Costello was paying for Sullivan's apartment that he obviously couldn't afford on his own etc.<br/><br/>Near the end on the movie Sullivan's story of the shootout would have never satisfied any investigator on his word alone.<br/><br/>Both of these occur for plot convenience only and are not believable. There are many other examples.<br/><br/>It should be noted that while most of the characters were fantastic there were two major exceptions.<br/><br/>Dignam's character has NO redeeming qualities; he is a one dimensional hot head. Why does Queenan put up with him?<br/><br/>Madolyn has to be one of the most dull love interests in recent memory. The energy in the movie dies every time she is on screen. This is made worse by the fact that she, coincidentally, is the love interest of both male leads.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this move and I didn't hate it. I only wish the plot had been thought through a bit more."
"sidewinder572","9","1","2","14 February 2007"," A long awaited return to form
","The Departed is a consistently engaging crime thriller from director Martin Scorsese. It's also the Scorsese film that I've been waiting for since Goodfellas, and I'm sure others feel the same way too. This film is a remake of the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs, however this review will make no comparisons to that movie. Leonardo Dicaprio and Matt Damon play two moles. Dicaprio plays Billy Costigan, a rookie cop who goes deep undercover to take down mob boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Matt Damon plays Colin Sullivan, the man working for the state police as Costello's mole. The film also features Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin. Wahlberg gives the best performance of his career and nobody can play the sinister bad guy like Jack Nicholson.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese is the master of the crime drama, as he as proved time and time again. His previous two films (not counting the Bob Dylan documentary Nor Direction Home) The Aviator and Gangs of New York had their merits, but they were missing something that the classic Scorsese films contained. Aviator was an interesting bio pic. while Gangs was defined by an Oscar worthy performance from Daniel Day Lewis. The Departed however is a return to form. Its main strength lies in the story telling, Throughout the film and especially in relation to the Damon and Dicaprio characters. You don't exactly know who's good or who's bad. It constantly keeps you guessing as any great Drama should.<br/><br/>The Departed is definitely Scorsese's best film since Goodfellas and dare I say it's better then that. Actually I won't say that, quite yet. Time will decide that factor. I won't go the full 10 yet. More like a very high 9 1/2. That in mind The Departed is an excellent crime drama from the master of the genre and one of our greatest filmmakers."

","I am coming down from the buzz that is watching this movie. You know a film is good when you are nervous scene to scene. Marky Mark did an amazing job, my favorite character in the piece. It was a new situation for me watching Damon as the ""bad"" guy. He did a convincing job. Jack is nasty, Alec good as always and the hot chick who played the Doctor was...hot. I lived in Boston for awhile and enjoyed the familiar location. I really can't say enough about this film. It is gory, which I like, but may be too much for some. For some reason, Leo and Marty work great together. Proof of this is easy to see if you watch The Aviator and The Departed back to back. Two totally different films with Leo playing unique and polar opposite characters. The performances in both are Oscar worthy and Marty deserves much of the credit. Hopefully this is Marty's year, he has my vote."

I had regretted not seeing it in theaters and I jumped at the chance to finally witness the film that many people call the best of the year. This film is great! I get really mad at movies that resort to tired plots and twists that you can see a mile away and this didn't fall into those traps. Scorcese has made an intense, riveting crime drama with some superb acting. Nicholson was his usual manic self and Walberg and Damon did well indeed but I was blown away by DiCaprio's tortured performance. He really seemed like a man on the brink who was under way too much stress for one person to handle. The screenplay of this movie was really well written and Scorcese didn't rush any of the events, keeping me guessing as to what might happen until the very end. The scene where Leo's character chases Damon in the alleyways of South Boston stood out as very intense and you never feel like any character is safe. I highly recommend people who haven't seen this movie at least rent it. I did not give the full 10 stars because I want to see if the movie stands up to repeated viewings, then I will feel safe calling it a classic.

Jack is great, as always, Leo shows much emotion and range, Damon is a piece of cold blooded work, Wahlberg is fiery and funny, and Baldwin is becoming a truly great character actor, damn near stealing all of his scenes.

","""The Departed"" / 2006/ Directed by: Martin Scorsese / Written by: William Monahan / Starring: Leonardo DeCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen.<br/><br/>""The Departed"" is a welcome change for director Scorsese from his last few films. Here he returns to an old school style crime thriller. With a first rate cast, an excellent adapted screenplay, strong lead and supporting acting, this film delivers in major aspects. Longtime veteran of Scorsese film's, Thelma Schoonmaker delivers some impressive film editing. The pace and rhythm of the film are near perfect, suiting and serving the story very well. The film begins with Nicholson's character narrating. We quickly learn his character and what he is about. We receive some background information on the story and main characters at this time. The film convincingly shows corruption on both sides of the law. Monahan's adapted screenplay, from ""Infernal Affairs"" changes the story setting to present day Boston. Damon's character quickly rises in the Boston State Police Department. DeCaprio gives one of his best acting performances ever as a misguided, violent tough guy with heart. I felt the film deserved two more Academy Award nominations: Jack Nicholson for Best Supporting Actor and Thelma Schoonmaker for Best Film Editing. I was surprised by the humor at the beginning of the film. Though all lead and supporting acting is impressive in this film, Wahlberg's character is my personal favorite here. I liked his tough, tell it like it is, no holes barred style. The film does has a few weaknesses such as the love interest story with the psychiatrist. The acting performance by Vera Farmiga as the psychiatrist is solid and convincing. Her character does serve well to show the personal weaknesses of DeCaprio's and Damon's characters. But it does not serve to move the plot forward. My only other minor complaint is the ending with the rat walking on the balcony railing, not really necessary, but perhaps, a last minute choice for a humorous exclamation point to who the villain really was."
"dromasca","8","1","2","10 February 2007"," Scorsese back in gangsters movies genre
","The return of Martin Scorsese in the gangsters movies genre is certainly a spectacle to watch. It takes a Scorsese to gather such a crowd of stars and herd them into a consistent and coherent film like this.<br/><br/>The story inspired by a Hong Kong movie is about two policemen belonging to the same generation in the police academy becoming each of them a mole - one for the police with the Mafia, the other within the Mafia for the police. They do not know the identity of each other and their mirrored cat and mouse game is at the core of the story.<br/><br/>Matt Damon and DiCaprio play the two main roles, and the mirroring of their fate reflects also in the acting, while sharing the fears of not being discovered and - how not - sharing also the love of the same woman. Although the credibility stack is raised very high in the movie Scorsese succeeds to make it interesting and slaloms well through what could have become a too heavy epic. As a viewer I hold my breath towards the final scenes filled with violence and leaving a number of corpses that rivals with a Shakespearean tragedy.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson creates another of his memorable demonic characters in the role of the chief gangster who manipulates a mole in the police, while fighting to discover the one in his own ranks. It comes as a surprise that the shrewd and mean characters eventually dies at the hands of the unexpected character, but if you look well this is a story where everybody seems to be killed by the wrong man.<br/><br/>It is said that Scorsese and Eastwood are front-runners for the best movie and best director Oscars this year. Their two films are two different types of American epics, two poles of the American saga told in their specific ways and styles. 'The Aviator', the previous epic of Scorsese had similar ambitions but failed. Frankly I like that one less. This time, back in a territory that seems familiar, he may have a good chance again."

His performance has evolved beyond doubt if one has already seen his other movies like 'Gangs of New York', 'Titanic', 'Romeo + Juliet'. I hope he grabs an Oscar for the great effort he has taken for this particular movie. 'The Departed' has a good storyline and gives an everlasting impact on the viewers. It really has been successful to portray the risk involved for men working as under cover police. This movie has everything that viewers can ask for 'action' and tons of 'thrills'. I will not go into details on the main plot as it will ruin the excitement for those who have not yet seen."
"cinephile9-1","10","1","2","7 February 2007"," A Boston based gangster film concerned with spies within both law enforcement and criminal organizations.
","A superlative adaptation by William Monahan of the classic Hong Kong policier ""Infernal Affairs"", this film features brilliant twinned performances by Matt Damon who brings cerebral intensity and Bostonian authenticity to his role and Leonardo DiCaprio who provides visceral conviction and a newfound screen maturity. Scorsese's direction is masterful, whether the scene be one of emotional intimacy or multi-levelled duplicity. Both emotional and physical violence are rendered with subtlety and maximal impact, producing a total work of such power that it merits Scorsese a long overdue Oscar. Truly, this film is a worthy companion piece to ""Mean Streets"" and ""Goodfellas"" as a gangster classic.<br/><br/>Besides the aforementioned worthy of Best Actor performances by Damon and DiCaprio, special mention should be made of Mark Wahlberg's searing performance which virtually defines the category, Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role. He nails every scene he's in and perfectly captures the Boston cadences of his poetically profane policeman. Wahlberg's performance lingers in the memory long after the film is ended,as does Jack Nicholson's, but for quite the opposite reason. Once he emerges from the shadows,literally, Jack delivers such a bogus and over the top performance that he threatens to derail the whole enterprise. Wasn't Brian Cox or some such closer to the grain actor available? Nicholson's performance has the same pungency that Boston harbor did before the recent cleanup.<br/><br/>If one is a fan of Hong Kong action films, classic American gangster films or psychologically complex thrillers, ""The Departed"" satisfies on virtually every level."

It maintains a low budget quality, that gives it a gritty hard edged, almost black and white reality look. All the performances work, with DeCaprio at his best. He should have gotten a nomination.

From the smallest bit to the leads it is excellent. Wahlberg made you dislike his character from his first appearance. He should be a shoo-in for Best Supporting Actor.

"bburns","10","1","2","3 February 2007"," The best film of 2006
","He's back! He was never exactly gone, but he's back! The musical mix of Italian opera with the Rolling Stones, the quick-cut edits and off-kilter camera-angles, the hyper-violent stories about unstable people in the underworld. Only one guy can put all these elements together into something that transcends the sum of its parts, and that's Martin Scorsese. His new movie ""The Departed"" is his finest work since ""Raging Bull"".<br/><br/>It is not an insult to this movie to say that it has much the same plot as ""Mean Streets"" and ""GoodFellas"": Impressionable kid (Matt Damon) grows up loyal to a mob boss (Jack Nicholson) who gives him the fatherly affection lacking in his own home, but then comes to realize that the man he idolizes may not have his best interests at heart.<br/><br/>This is not to say that Scorsese is slavishly following his old formula (the way he did in ""Casino""). The movie is about South Boston Irish instead of Brooklyn Italians. Robert DeNiro, Harvey Keitel and Joe Pesci are nowhere to be found. Scorsese does not make a cameo.<br/><br/>But the biggest difference is the one that I feel puts this movie a cut above ""GoodFellas"": There is just as much--if not more--attention paid to the police trying to take down the crime boss as there is to the criminals themselves.<br/><br/>The basic conceit--taken from the Hong Kong film ""Infernal Affairs""--is that Massachussetts state policeman Colin Sullivan (Damon) is feeding information to mobster Frank Costello (Nicholson). Meanwile, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), while technically not on any law enforcement payroll, is asked by the cops to become a member of Costello's gang and secretly feed information to his police handlers. Neither man knows who the other is until it is too late.<br/><br/>I liked that the movie focuses on the parallels between the two leads. Sullivan looks up to Costello as a father figure, just as Costigan loves Police Captain Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen). And both father figures have fierce lieutenants who don't particularly like their young charges. Costello has Mr. French (Ray Winstone), and Capt. Queenan has Lt. Dignam (Mark Wahlberg). Both are in love with police psychiatrist Madolyn (Vera Farmiga).<br/><br/>I also liked that for all the plot twists and double-crosses, there is no sense of the surprises being forced by a filmmaker who is a little too proud of his own cleverness (i.e. ""Millers Crossing"", ""The Usual Suspects"").<br/><br/>As much as I loved this movie, I found myself asking some questions once it was over. Like how is it possible that two artists of the stature of Scorsese and Nicholson never worked together before? When are they going to work together again? (Please let it be soon.) How could the Academy nominate Peter O'Toole for a dull role and ignore Matt Damon, who was the soul of this film? How could the Academy nominate Alan Arkin and Eddie Murphy for supporting roles in their cheesy films, but not Jack Nicholson or Alec Baldwin in a masterpiece?<br/><br/>In 2004, after 14 years of big-budget misfires, Scorsese finally proved with ""The Aviator"" that he could make a great film that didn't have the look or feel of his work in his 1973-1990 low-budget heyday. And with ""The Departed"", he proves that for all the wannabes who have sprouted up since 1990 (Michael Mann, Ted Demme, David Chase, etc.), the best person to go to when you want the look and feel of Scorsese's early work is Scorsese himself. Not quite as great as ""Mean Streets"" or ""Raging Bull"", but slightly better than ""Taxi Driver"" and ""GoodFellas"". 10 out of 10."

","Yes, The Departed is a good movie- a good story, told well. But it ain't what it's made out to be. The movie is fast-paced and well shot. The intertwined stories of rats in bot the the 'good' world and the 'bad' world is a catchy concept. The performances are good and Jack obviously delivers his best. The other actors except Mark have nothing new to offer and the fact that DiCaprio gets a nomination is surprising, as he hasn't done something in this movie that he hadn't done in his older movies!<br/><br/>The numerous nominations and wins coming along the way are according to me a result of good PR! If you want a good entertaining flick - this will do. If you wanna go see Oscar material - i suggest you pass!"
"rralleigh","7","1","2","29 January 2007"," Scorsese has lost it
","This movie, and Gangs of New York have shown me that the master is on the wane.<br/><br/>Both movies are watchable and hold your interest, yet both lack that essential spark to make a great movie.<br/><br/>Partially this could be attributed to the actors, who are good, but will never be as good as Robert De Niro, but I would tend to blame the director, because the actors put on some good stuff sometimes. There are many scenes which should have been reshot, with more understatement from the actors.<br/><br/>Leonardo Di Caprio is surprisingly engaging, he was almost excellent, if he hadnt overplayed his ""Do they know?"" intense nervous glare. With a mug like that, Nicholson would surely have got rid of him long ago.<br/><br/>Secondly Matt Damons character is not explored, we have no idea about his motivations. He didn't have enough screen time, and his character suffered from that. we didn't see him develop any conflicts. And his character was stupid to the extreme, jumping on the phone to his ""Dad"" after every meeting. Not to mention leaving that envelope around (a crude directorial ploy. Couldn't he have thought up a more subtle way for him to find out?) I think Scorsese has just given the film to Di Caprio and Nicholson, because they put on the best performances. Thats bad directing, or actually lazy directing. Thats whats missing in both these movies. They're not perfect. You look at goodfellas- not one scene, nor any aspect of that movie could have been improved. It was a perfect movie. Same goes for Raging Bull, Taxi Driver.<br/><br/>This one is good but not great.<br/><br/>The final straw for me was the rat on the balcony. What a terribly crude way to end the movie. It was a cheap, dumb, and insulting end. And whats with all the stupid plot twists? Personally, I prefer an ending where the characters have to live with something, or simply leave things unresolved.<br/><br/>Everyone getting shot in the head just makes one feel deflated."
"stile1973","8","1","2","28 January 2007"," Outstanding
","The story is centered around the life of Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) who is working as an undercover police detective infiltrating the organization run by Frank Costello (Nicholson). The plot is complicated by the fact that Colin Sullivan (Damon) is a mole in the police department tipping off Costello and preventing the big bust from happening. Tensions build as Billy and Colin try to discover the identity of one another, and both sides discover that there is a rat/mole working in the respective organizations but unsure of who it is.<br/><br/>The screenplay is top notch and deserves an Oscar nod. The performances are outstanding all around and I was especially impressed with DiCaprio who plays his character with a nice blend of toughness and vulnerability. Excellent direction by Scorsese - who has shown time and time again that he knows how to tell an outstanding crime story.<br/><br/>The only drawback for me was the ending - for me it was a double surprise ending but I wanted something a little more emotionally and intellectually satisfying.<br/><br/>Overall I highly recommend this film. One of the best pictures of 2006 for sure."
"wrathchild712","10","1","2","28 January 2007"," Movies don't get much better than this.
","D'you know the types of movies from which you walk out after your first view knowing (not thinking, but KNOWING) that it's among your favorite movies ever? D'you know how rare it is for a movie like that to come along? A movie that strikes you like a Muhammad Ali punch, appealing in all aspects to your movie-going senses? Well, my friends, the Departed is one of those movies. I could be blunt and end this review right now by saying there's simply nothing wrong with this movie and giving it 10 stars. And while that's absolutely true, why be blunt? In the opening scene of the movie, whilst you're flying through the skyline of Boston and hearing the Rolling Stones' classic ""Gimme Shelter,"" you just know this will be one hell of a movie.<br/><br/>We've all seen mafia films, or just films focused on crime in general, where the plot focuses on the identification of a rat in the system. The rat, typically viewed as ""bad"" (for lack of a better turn) by the criminals, who have the audience's sympathy, is eventually found out, eliminated and voilà! The movie ends with the criminals winning and the audiences happy. But The Departed takes it to a completely different level, having not just one - but TWO rats; one working IN the Police Department FOR the mafia and one working FOR the Police Department WITH the mafia. It is here that the movie really succeeds, because both characters, with their completely different agendas, merit your sympathies throughout the film, and you're constantly questioning who to root for in the conflict.<br/><br/>The movie has so many solid performances that it should be illegal. Of course there are DiCaprio, Nicholson, Damon and Wahlberg to be spoken of, but even actors like Alec Baldwin (who I stopped taking seriously many years ago) Anthony Anderson (whom I've never much cared for) contributed positively to the film. My personal favorite performance was from Mark Wahlberg who, asshole that his character Dignam was, still delighted you every minute he was on screen.<br/><br/>As mentioned earlier, the soundtrack is a pivotal contributor to the overall effect of the movie. Scorsese used more popular, mainstream music as a backdrop, rather than predictable, clichéd orchestral and Opera music. (Although the latter does make an appearance in one scene of the movie.) He compiled a soundtrack of songs that fit each scene in which they were played. The aforementioned opener, ""Gimme Shelter,"" for example, gives you that cool, collected feeling while being used to depict the cool, collected nature of Frank Costello's earlier years in power. Later, the best used song in the soundtrack, Dropkick Murphys' ""I'm Shipping Up To Boston,"" reminds us all that, even though it's a mafia film, all the sh*t's going down in Beantown.<br/><br/>I'd compare the film to another Scorsese masterpiece, Taxi Driver, for one main reason. Both start out as ""solid"" movies, movies that entertain you and are worth the price of admission, but then develop into true classics as the reels roll on. (Pardon the pun.) With Taxi Driver, it was Betsy's rejection of Travis Bickle that catalyzed his dramatic character change. Here, it was the first MAJOR murder. (I say major, because there are numerous smaller ones throughout the film of little to no consequence. I won't further spoil this movie in naming the murder, but once you see it, you'll know - and the movie skyrockets from that point on into sheer ecstasy.)<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese SHOULD win the Best Director honor at the Oscars, and The Departed SHOULD win Best Picture this year. (They may or may not; you never know, given his luck with the Academy.) Regardless as to trophies and the decisions of a select group of so-called ""movie experts,"" anyone who considers themselves a TRUE movie fan should see this movie. It might just be the best film Scorsese's ever made and, yes, it cracks my top 5 list.<br/><br/>10/10"
"TalosIV","Null","1","2","28 January 2007"," The best movie I've ever seen, that I also didn't like....SPOILERS
","The acting, direction, cinematography....all first rate. Technically, a brilliant film. The tension built up nicely. The film didn't seem two and a half hours in length.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the payoff didn't work for me and the film, as a whole, was bleak and cynical. I had emotional investment in only one character, Costigan, and he gets his brains blown out. OK, OK...I'll admit, it was nice not to have the typical clichéd ending. Costigan would have been greeted by applauding cops, like Sullivan was. Then, on the verge of a big promotion, would have handed in his shield and walked out onto and down the street.....camera rises...fade to black.<br/><br/>So, I'm OK it didn't end that way. But holy moly, everyone gets shot in the head. Just as a matter of fact, it seems. There's no real ""good guy"", again, not necessarily a bad thing. However, you MUST be emotionally invested in someone. For me, it was Leo but just barely.<br/><br/>Essentially, everyone was a rat. That was pounded into my pointy little head from the first frame and then pounded in again and again and again. That's a lot to wade through just for that message.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the film felt like a waste of time. Everyone dies. Well, except for Dignam. And...every cop is dirty. Not just a little dirty....but shoot the other cop in the head, dirty.<br/><br/>Big disappointment. Maybe my love of 'Goodfellas' is blocking me. But I don't think so. It was one of the best films of the 90's."
"dierregi","6","1","2","28 January 2007"," Too much Nicholson is not a good thing
","""The Departed"" starts strong, a taut thriller that leaves you on the edge of the sit for about half his length. Midways, things start to go wrong. Actually, they start to go nowhere. Once we have firmly established who are the good guys and who the baddies, and also the fact that  allegedly  there is only a thin line in between, the movie gets stuck in a rut called the Jack Nicholson over the top performance.<br/><br/>It is regrettable to think that this could have been a truly great movie without Jack Nicholson. He is given possibly the longest screen time and during all of it, he just goes along doing his usual stuff, the mad grin, the lecherous wink, the foul language, etc Nicholson by the book. Nicholson and more Nicholson. We are not spared even a very choreographic final scene, so fake that even an amateur actor could have played it better.<br/><br/>It is a relief that Nicholson did not get nominated for this part. The movie is quite compelling when he is not on screen. Di Caprio is surprisingly good, playing vulnerable in a credible way and also Damon, playing creepy even better than in ""Ripley"". One really sides with Di Caprio, the lonely, unappreciated, unloved hero, hoping for a happy ending. Unfortunately, we know that in this sort of movies copious bloodshed and tragedy rule. Luckily, Wahlberg in a key role is around to provide some sort of satisfactory closure. Wahlberg almost disappeared from the screen after several good performances, which is a pity because he is gifted. It would have made the movie a lot more interesting if he and Martin Sheen had more time on screen, rather than the lamentable Nicholson.<br/><br/>On the whole, this is a good movie, but not a great one. For sure the script denotes some ignorance of police procedures. The whole investigative side requires massive doses of suspended disbelief. It seems rather bizarre that a police inspector is given the job of checking the background of all his fellow officers only because his boss likes his face, but without anybody checking his background or working with him. An undercover agent has license to kill and no duty to report criminal actions while actually taking part in them. An FBI informer, thanks to his status is free to continue his criminal career. Does it mean that if I talk to the Feds I can go around killing whomever I want? Finally, half hour could have easily been chopped off, perhaps by eliminating most Nicholson scenes, and the end is definitely muddled up, with Damon absurdly shown as being constantly free of suspicion. In other movies police officers get suspended for a lot less of what Damon gets away with in ""The Departed""."
"boojnation","10","1","2","27 January 2007"," Best Scorscese Movie Ever
","I've seen Goodfellas, Raging Bull etc. and I must say that The Departed is the best movie that Marty has directed. Stellar performances by DiCaprio, Damon, Whalberg and (my favorite performance in the movie) Alec Baldwin. Jack Nicholson has the problem that he has in all of his movies. He's still Jack. Every single movie that he's in he's the same guy. He doesn't even decide to use a Boston accent. But, he's entertaining enough to keep a 10/10.<br/><br/>Once again, Scorscese is brilliant in song choice for this movie. Whether it's a beautiful version of Comfortably Numb or the Bar Brawl Remeniscient Shipping Up To Boston. Also, as in all Scorscese movies, the violence is beautifully lifelike and, at times, disturbing.<br/><br/>Except for Jack Nicholson, this movie is fantastic and I hope that the Acadamy agrees with me!"

","Today, I was wandering in Paris and by chance I found a cinema that was still playing it. I took my chance and was not disappointed at all. Forget about ""Gangs of New-York"" or the Aviator, Scorcese is back. Even DiCarpaccio rules!!! For once, he is credible in his role of a sensible, fragile guy. Even if the movie is quite long, you never get bored. The plot is very good, quite complex but always very credible. Violence is also very present, reminding me of Casino. Even some (funny) references to Taxi driver (movie theater scene)... I Haven't seen the Japanese version but I think I will have a look to see how different it is. Especially at the end, I couldn't help thinking of some influence of the Japanese way of filming. Go for it!!!!!!"
"jbhousto","5","1","2","27 January 2007"," Almost great...
","So much has been reviewed and said about this movie. I had mixed expectations going in, which is usually good because I will be more easily impressed if it's a great movie. Without giving anything away, the first hour and 45 minutes of The Departed were excellent, but the ending was 20-30 minutes too long, the plot ran away with itself, and I just didn't find it fulfilling. I don't need a particularly happy or sad ending to truly enjoy a movie, but it should leave the viewer with a strong emotion one way or the other. The only emotion The Departed left me with was disappointment that it ended so poorly.<br/><br/>This film was impressive for everything larger-than-life about it: the roles, the backdrops, the actions taking place, the ensemble actors, etc. The problem was (as many have mentioned) there wasn't any character development. There weren't any stories told that really connected with the audience. Such an effort was put on making everything BIG that they forgot to tell a story. And even realizing this, I still feel that ""The Departed"" is one of Scorsese's best for the first hour forty-five. Everything else is really THAT good.<br/><br/>(Goodfellas, in comparison, was both BIG in all the reasons The Departed was, but _also_ told some great stories. Henry's growing up, the killing of Billy Batts and moving his body, Tommy getting made, the big heist, even the finale about Henry getting trapped by the FBI and regretting giving up his gangster days to be a normal citizen under federal protection... These were all STORIES within the movie that the audience could identify with. The Departed didn't really tell ANY story in this regard. As for Scorsese's other works, his fame helped make Casino, Gangs of New York, and The Aviator all larger than life like Goodfellas and The Departed, but none of them told stories as good as his previous works such as The Deer Hunter, Raging Bull, or even Taxi Driver.)<br/><br/>As for the acting, I was very impressed with Leo. He's come off as such a pretty boy in everything he's done in recent years. This performance hearkened back to his promising start with ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" and ""The Basketball Diaries"". It was a home run. Matt Damon was OK, but kind of wooden; nothing like ""Goodwill Hunting"", and even his Jason Bourne roles were better. Mark Wahlberg did well in a great role, but was not earth-shattering. That role was written for Denis Leary, and if Wahlberg could be nominated for an Oscar for his performance in it, Leary would win one. Can't help but think that Leary was just made for that role and really would've been dynamite in it. Alec Baldwin was great in a larger-than-life supporting role, as was Martin Sheen. Vera Farmiga was great as the love interest, but her character's story wasn't as developed. That is an example of how ""scattered"" the plot was.<br/><br/>And, of course, Jack was outstanding. One of his best performances ever. It is downright criminal that the Academy plays these games of ""who we owe, who doesn't need an Oscar anymore, etc."" and didn't nominate him. Jack was just incredible as the dark, sinister, and truly disturbed crime boss.<br/><br/>I am a fan of Scorsese's work, a big fan but I assume many people are too. It is too bad he hasn't won an Oscar before, but I think it was just bad luck for him given the competition at the time. That said, Goodfellas was unarguably his greatest work in my mind, and he's had many other greats as well (Deer Hunter, Raging Bull, I've always like Casino, etc.). I thought going in that ""The Departed"" would not crack that list, or at least would be at the lower end. To my surprise, after the first hour or so, I was ready to say this movie placed a close 2nd to Goodfellas. But in conclusion, it is at the lower end of Scorsese's greats. I think he'll get an ""I owe you"" Oscar from the Academy here, but I remain disappointed at how good this movie MIGHT have been...<br/><br/>7 out of 10 stars<br/><br/>*** Of course my expectations may be too low these days considering how great movies just don't seem to be made anymore. Maybe this _wasn't_ one of Scorsese's best... I mean, The Shawshank Redemption, Goodfellas, Field of Dreams, Dead Poets Society... None of these movies won Oscars, and who feels the winners of the past few years were any better than them? Much less the movies they lost to... ***"

It is a must-watch, but be warned that you may want to think twice about letting children see it due to its profanity and violence. The movie will literally keep you on the edge of your seat as you see how innovative some of the film's ideas are. I would definitely recommend it and watch it a second time.

","The Departed (2006) is an exact copy of the 2002 Hong Kong movie 'Mou Gaan Dou'(aka 'Infernal Affairs') and is definitely worse than Mou Gaan Dou (2002). In Mou Gann Dou the story is better told and the actors act deeper and better. On the other hand, things in The Departed are so on the surface. Remember a scene that Queenan was thrown out off the building? You know, you do not have to shoot the falling. In Mou Gann Dou, Chan Wing Yan (Costigan) stepped out of the building and there was a cab. And 'PENG', officer Wong (Queenan) hit the cab. That was so shocking as the only person who knew who Chan really was was dead. Cannot believe that The Departed is nominated by the Academy. Hollywood is so not aware of the outside world and is so superficial. It will be a shame if The Departed will actually win the best picture."
"charchuk","8","1","2","22 January 2007"," Superb film-making
","A fantastically bloody cops and robbers tale, with outstanding acting and superb direction. The profanity-ridden script ain't too bad either. Despite the over two hour running time, the film never drags or even lets up on the action and suspense. It builds up slowly throughout, amping up the tension until the shocking conclusion. The pace feels a bit off at the beginning, but it soon settles into form and doesn't falter again for the remainder of the film. All in all, just an excellent film.<br/><br/>The story is fairly straightforward, but it's exceptionally well-written with great dialogue and lots of memorable scenes. There are some elements that seem out of place - the therapist in particular - but they soon are woven into the fabric of the story and just add to the overall tale. Each character is fleshed out adequately, and there are no obvious weak spots among the ensemble cast. DiCaprio and Nicholson are the clear highlights, each playing their role to perfection. Wahlberg and Baldwin are great fun to watch, and Damon and Sheen provide solid work. Among the lesser-known actors, Vera Farmiga does a good job as the aforementioned therapist who deals with both of the moles. All around, a solid achievement.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese certainly pulled out all the stops in trying to nab his elusive Oscar, as the direction is simply outstanding. The chase through the back alleys of Chinatown, in particular, is so well-crafted that the suspense is relentless. But this is not an anomaly - the entire film is superbly shot and cut. The final elevator sequence also comes to mind. It is literally mind-blowing because of the amazing technical aspects. The production design, sound effects, and music are also a part of this. This is technically faultless film-making.<br/><br/>Despite some occasional faltering in regards to the story, this is a fantastic film all-around. Though the excessive violence and language may turn off some, for those of us who enjoy these types of films, this is a welcome achievement."

And it's a crying shame for every Irish man and woman.<br/><br/>No coincidence that this symbol should show up in a movie whose crew and cast have such strong associations with the Catholic Worker Movement. From an interview with Scorsese: ""The neighborhood priest, whom I liked a lot, always talked about Dorothy Day (founder of the Catholic Worker movement), and I saw her once working with the bums down on the Bowery. I was impressed by that and the fact that people like her had great conviction about their pacifist beliefs."" <br/><br/>I hope everybody in Boston is wearing a _black_ shamrock and drinking _black_ beer this Paddy's Day to mark our sorrow and shame. <br/><br/>Coilín."

His character was not just believable, but also gave a good impression of an undercover cop. He was the only thing left in the movie to keep the drama going. Other actors were mediocre and their characters were either very shallow or totally ludicrous.<br/><br/>The original movie took a very personal approach, the two cops develop a special relationship between each other and everyone else plays a secondary role (including the mafia boss). In Scorsese adaptation, the relationship is non-existent. The boss played by Jack Nicholson becomes a prominent character, but is strangely portrayed as a demented old fool who's losing all sense of reality and why anyone would want to make him a supportive role in the movie is beyond me. <br/><br/>In my opinion a lot of things were done really badly in The Departed and although Internal Affairs was no masterpiece either, it managed to deliver a much better crime thriller with a lot more attitude than Scorsese's adaptation.<br/><br/>I give this 5/10, mostly for Di Caprio's performance."

In order to show how hardboiled the men are, they constantly use obscenities.

"withgodasmywitness","3","1","2","17 December 2006"," I am a Canadian film student and this is my opinionated perspective on ""The Departed"" in comparison to ""Infernal Affairs""
","<ul><li>As a film student my opinion is biased and does not appeal to the majority - With all of the positive attention being reflected upon Scorsese's ""The Departed,"" I felt it was completely necessary to denounce this film and break it down from the high pillar it has been placed upon. ""The Departed"" plays no comparison to the original Hong Kong release, ""Infernal Affairs."" As an individual Hollywood film it is a grand achievement, but the true credit should be given to its predecessor. ""Infernal Affairs"" is greatly superior not only in the complexity of the storyline, but also in the film qualities that are presented. Paying close attention to the inner workings of the spectacle, ""The Departed"" is a trashy Hollywood rendition of something that was truly amazing. The screenplay omitted the creative use of Morse code and displayed previous subtleties in such a manner that is practically baby fed to the viewer. As well, changes to characters make things simpler to understand for North American dopes. Although the screenplay was very well received it basically just replaces any interesting dialog with a couple swear words. ""Infernal affairs"" is fairly clean cut in comparison because the swearing and violence is kept to a minimum. The final scene of this film is completely unnecessary in its violent nature and says more about American trash than any other remake I have seen. To fully understand this comment, you must first see the film. When looking at the directorial modifications between the original and the remake, ""The Departed"" is a pure disgrace. ""Infernal Affairs"" was visually appealing from beginning to end providing the viewer with a desire to be consumed by the film, whereas ""The Departed"" presents you with a basic production that plays more like a run-on sentence. I know I was personally just waiting for the film to end. By personal recommendation, I would suggest finding a copy of ""Infernal Affairs"" before watching ""The Departed."" It is by far one of the best Hong Kong films released to date. This is not to say that ""The Departed"" is a complete waste of time, but if you want to get your money's worth, take my advice. You will surely be impressed. P.S. Subtitles rarely bite.</li></ul>"

","Martin Scorsese is out on the streets again, and once again, we get to see, that this is a place that he knows. ""The Departed"", screenplay written by William Monahan, is Scorsese's best film since 1995's ""Casino"". It's primarily a great acted movie. Jack Nicholson plays his usual crazy guy (""She fell funny!""), Matt Damon is great as Nicholson's rat in the police and Mark Wahlberg's character Dignum is not exactly one of the pleasant kind. Special mention also for Vera Farmiga as the only woman, who has one of the most interesting parts in this male-dominated gangster film. But it's Leonardo DiCaprio who steals the show. His character is the best written in Monahan's script, we get to know things about his past and his motivation, so we can understand much better why he gets trapped inside this deadly game. He also is present in my favourite part of the movie, the scene where Martin Sheen dies. The tension that this scene is filled with and the surprising way it ends is extraordinary."

It is fast paced, exciting and a thrill a minute. Wonderful performances from a superb cast - Leonardo Di Caprio, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg to name but a few. Scorsese has another fabulous movie to add to his repertoire. Apparently, Nicholson insisted on making his character more evil than Scorsese had in mind, and it was his (Nicholson's) idea to bring in the drug usage, the porn movie theater and the rubber penis. The man's a genius - and deserves an Oscar nomination just for his facial impression of a rat. The entire audience laughed at that."

I was impressed by both Di Caprio and Damon - if one of them doesn't get an Oscar - then I would be very surprised.<br/><br/>It has been a long time since a movie moved me in the way this one did.

","In the war between the police and the local underworld, the cops have their mole with the crooks, and the crooks their insider within the police. So far, so Hong Kong hit Infernal Affairs. The Departed"" broadens its focus by giving a lot of attention to the chief of police and underworld crime boss, but remains very close similarities to its model.<br/><br/>If you really had to remake this, you might as well throw some serious star power and skill at it, so enter director Martin Scorsese, finally winning the Oscar for one of his lesser films, but one that shows considerable confidence, ease and skill. Where this really shines though, is in the characters.<br/><br/>In th central roles, Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio pretty much play the parts as Lau and Lueng did in the original: Damon is all confident surface with a fragile foundation, while DiCaprio is an incredibly tortured soul. DiCaprio has more to work with but Damon creeps under your skin with surprising efficiency. Martin Sheen as chief of police offers a sensitive character far removed from the usual cop drama's loud supervisor, a template relegated instead to the crazed double act of Baldwin's obnoxious fed and Wallberg's foul-mouthed cop.<br/><br/>For all this classy work though, the turn that what will have crowds reeling with horror and laughter will be Jack Nicholson's mob boss Frank Costello! He oozes perversion and violence and his improvisational riff on screenwriter Monahan's already repulsive character makes for the most spellbinding individual you will see on screen this year! That touch alone warrants this whole remake exercise. Credit a director who knows when to tweak things and when to get out of the way.<br/><br/>It's always a huge comfort to see Scorsese work his magic, even on second-hand material. Ina year where old pros have tried to reinvent themselves with varying degrees of success (such as Ridley Scott with rom-com A Good Year and Oliver Stone with the dismal World Trade Center...), Scorsese's star shines brighter than ever.<br/><br/>What will he do next?"

"abum190","9","1","2","5 December 2006"," Best movie of the year
","The very beginning of The Departed struck me as very similar to GoodFellas. It begins with a boy telling of his first experiences with the mob. The locale even seemed the same. There are other instances in the movie where Scorsese seems to allude back to GoodFellas, a movie many consider to be one of his masterpieces, but in my opinion I think The Departed is all its own and even exceeds GoodFellas in quality and profundity. And besides that, it's also incredibly entertaining.<br/><br/>The movie has been advertised as a thriller, and it succeeds at that very well. Leonardo Dicaprio plays Billy Costigan, a cop assigned to not be a cop ever again; instead, he will be a plant in Frank Costello's (Jack Nicholson) outfit. Matt Damon is Colin Sullivan, a cop who works on the side for Costello who entrusts him with the job of finding the mole in his gang. Scorsese weaves an intricate tapestry of deceit and mistrust with bloody and jarring violence mixed with intense scenes where the various disguises are on the verge of being uncovered. It's a very entertaining tapestry; nothing is for sure, and while that could have been frustrating, Scorsese involves you so much in the characters that you understand that when you're wondering if Billy or Colin is lying, they're wondering the same thing.<br/><br/>Exploring themes like family and identity and loyalty is not new hat for Scorsese. He contemplated the same ideas in GoodFellas with his depiction of the life of a mafia man. But in The Departed he takes it a step farther and asks the question of what happens when you lose that identity and pretend to be someone you're not. This opens up opportunities to discover what happens to the characters' relationships in these circumstances. Scorsese was blessed with an amazing cast to help him in this task. Leonardo Dicaprio gave an amazing performance two years ago in The Aviator, and while I think that may be his better performance, there's no denying the power and truth in his desperately soul-searching undercover cop. He deserves another Oscar nomination for this, but he probably won't get it because Jack Nicholson is getting most of the notice (not all of it good) for his performance. Some critics are complaining that Nicholson went over the top; I don't think so at all. Everything he did was appropriate as the ultimate kingpin of the Boston mob because his character can get away with anything and knows it. Matt Damon has the least to do of the three of them, but Damon is a good actor and is no less than that here. Vera Farmiga has a good stint as Damon's love interest and Dicaprio's shrink; the lack of identity for both Damon's and Dicaprio's characters has a tasking effect on her and she holds her own against the two men.<br/><br/>There's no doubt in my mind that this is the best movie of the year. It has by far the best ending to a Scorsese movie out of the three I've seen. The profundity and inevitability of the last few scenes is perfect. If only the Academy would agree. The only true contenders against it so far for the Oscar are Babel (not as complete as this one) and The Queen (which isn't as big or brawny as The Departed). Besides, Scorsese has been ignored for far too long. This would be a very appropriate time for him to win, and with this movie he would deserve it.<br/><br/>But Oscars aside, I would recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates thrilling stories with meaning behind them. Those kinds of movies are few and far between, so grab onto this one and keep hold of it while it lasts."

","Don't get me wrong. This movie is OK, but it wasn't what I was expecting with all the hype the movie was preceded by. For one, I thought that the acting was somewhat formulaic and overdone. Neither Damon, Sheen, Nicholson, Di Caprio, Wahlberg or Baldwyn's performances were up to par. They were just phoning it in. There was no background on the plot for those of us who don't know much about Boston, Southie or the Irish mob. What was the motivation for the characters to do what they did? There was not much conflict of character, no near misses or suspense. Everythinbg was so predictable. What is the deal with an Irish mobster with a name like Frank Costello? Wasn't Frank Costello a REAL LIFE Italian mobster from the 1930's and 40's? I thought the movie was going to be about him. While the movie is entertaining, it is no Celtic version of the Godfather. The thing I liked the best was the ending, because it was unexpected. But there is too much violence, to much coarse language. Does anyone really talk like that? Mr. Scorcese has disappointed me. 6 stars out of 10."

Why Damon didn't kill her girlfriend, as she knew his secrets?

Apparently it's a less-faithful remake of a revered Hong Kong film, ""Infernal Affairs,"" but true to the Scorsese canon, and one of dedicated storytelling and character development.Leonardo Di Caprio and Matt Damon play opposite infiltrators in the Costello(Nicholson) gang and city police department, and they both are terrific! It is a Brad Pitt production, (who originally had the Matt Damon role), but it's a wonder that he withdrew and placed two actors, (who resemble each other)! Alec Baldwin shines as the police chief, (and is hilarious in a couple of scenes). Martin Sheen lends suitable gravitas as chief of undercover detectives, and Jack Nicholson is over-the-top in emoting and promoting his trademark leers, sneers, and swaggers. There is a lot of double-dealing and shocking set-ups, but it is a good film overall. However, it may not win Martin Scorsese his coveted Director's Oscar, due to strong competition from other more family-friendly films."

The idea of combining most parts I and II from Infernal Affairs into one movie is also well chosen.

","From the beginning, the departed looks like it's going to be a great film. It has a star studded cast, great director, and is well filmed.

Throughout the film you want to scream ""its him"" with regards to Matt Damon. The number of clues ignored by the rest of the department seem to point to a pink panther film rather than a Scorsese classic. On the other side of the plot Jack Nicholsons character and henchmen seem to be similarly dense. ""Hmm we're being betrayed by someone wonder who it could be? Surely not that recently enrolled ex-cop""<br/><br/>You feel for Leonardo di Caprio's predicament, but wonder if he is in so much trouble why he can't just skip town. There are so many better written films around nowadays, particularly by the likes of Scorsese that you wonder why more money couldn't have been spent on the storyline of this film. If you're looking for a hammy Scorsese film why not try the Godfather Part 3 instead."

","Martin Scorcese has had a virtuosic and triumphant career in film making. With Scorcese's trademark being social and political overtones, uncompromising visions of violence and complex characters, it is palpable to see that The Departed is no exception to his rules. Underneath this vicious facade of guns and profanity beats the heart of a jaded beast that contradicts morality and identity. At first sight The Departed may feel clichéd and formulaic ,however, it is often expressed with an indefinable depth and nuance that causes the film to transcend. The Departed also retains a unique status in cinema, for it's ambiguity and denouement. Conformity certainly isn't in Scorcese's repertoire, the viewer is consistently subjected to graphic violence and explicit coarse language however, this is not a criticism it is in fact a complement that immortalizes my admiration for this masterpiece."

But again, this is meant for another audience, so I can understand some of the changes, but when they replace a perfectly good point with nothing I don't see the point of removing it in the first place... but thats me:) But for the record, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jack Nicholson did a phenomenal job in their roles.

"pyrocitor","10","1","2","15 November 2006"," A heartfelt modern masterpiece
","Throughout the ages, a single question has been troubling film viewers worldwide: ""How is it possible that such a visionary and immensely talented director as Martin Scorsese has yet to win an Oscar?"". This question is provoked anew, with new heat and fervor, with the release of Scorsese's new love child, The Departed. Will The Departed finally be the film for the bushy eyebrowed maestro to take home his much deserved golden statuette? It's hard to determine, since the Academy has shown itself to be considerably impartial to his past masterpieces, such as Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. But does Scorsese deserve to take home an Oscar along with the inevitable critical acclaim this time round? The answer of course, is nothing less than a resounding yes.<br/><br/>In his latest heartfelt masterpiece, Scorsese lights up with storytelling flair and passion unseen for decades, unleashing one of his most powerful and affecting films yet. After a period of trying new things and exploring new vicinities, Scorsese seems to have returned to what he knows best - the streets, this time incarnated in a contemporary Boston mob setting (which makes for a slightly amusing update from Scorsese's usual mobster flicks with the addition of frequent cell phones and text messaging in the mix). The trademark musing Catholic overtones and brutal violence are both on display as usual here; in fact as well as his strongest, this may well be Scorsese's bloodiest picture for years. But rather than sinking to the lengths of most typical gorefests, the violence serves only to amplify the edgy and intense mood of the film, driving home its emotional points in a way which has seemed lost to Hollywood of late. Expect to cringe frequently, not just because of the pain inflicted, but due to the emotional resonance which ensues. <br/><br/>The storyline may seem a bit convoluted at times, detailing the lives of a policeman who infiltrates his way into the mob in order to act as a mole for the police force, and a fellow officer who is bought out by the mob, acting as a mole for them. However, the simply astonishing screenplay by William Monahan handles the tricky material with ease, as well as working in humour, emotional resonance, and a slew of quotable lines the likes of which have not been seen for years. Backing up this incredible script is a terrific score from the always reliable Howard Shore, as well as Scorsese's usual excellent taste in classic rock numbers, including the film's reoccurring theme, a strangely catchy mix of Irish shanty style music with heavy metal. <br/><br/>While known for extracting extraordinary performances from his actors, once again, Scorsese has truly outdone his reputation here, as the star-studded ensemble cast delivers a combined effort which will truly knock any viewer flat, with simply superb performances from Matt Damon, a surprisingly feisty and memorable Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, Alec Baldwin and newcomer Vera Farminga. Special acclaim should be given to the iconic Jack Nicholson giving his most engaging and charismatic performance in years as a ruthless mob head, and surprise standout Leonardo DiCaprio, blowing away any past work with a stunningly affecting and emotional performance. Though awards could easily and justifiably be awarded to any cast member, DiCaprio manages to stand out not from his star status but from his simmering performance in a cast of outstanding performers - an impressive feat indeed. <br/><br/>All in all, for those not deterred by brutal violence and frequent profanity, The Departed should be considered something of a must-see. Don't skip out, for fear of passing by one of the most remarkable screenplays in years, a stunning cast of flooring performances, and a veteran filmmaker re-igniting his past fervor with a simply marvelous film. The Departed is down, dirty, brutal, intense, heartfelt and hits home with an unforeseeable emotional impact - don't miss it. <br/><br/>-10/10"

","Why Martin Scorsese never gets an Oscar for such monumental efforts of his? Let's try to find the answer from his latest blockbuster, THE DEPARTED. People keep comparing this movie with Infernal Affairs. I say, it's pointless. If it was meant to be a 100% loyal adaptation of another movie of lower budget and higher fame, why do we need Mr. Scorsese at all? Simple game.<br/><br/>4 players. The police, the boss, the police's rat, the boss's rat. The star cast puts some of the most successful movies of all time to identity crisis. But, what do stars do really? They follow the rules set by the director. Some stars have such a charisma of their own that it shines above the director's rule. But, Oscar or no Oscar, Mr. Scorsese is damn good at that! Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen... what are they doing in the movie? Martin Sheen says ""you mugs got a light?"". Alec Baldwin is even better ""He's usually a nice guy!"" and the usual nice guy has no scope of acting apart from saying FU** so many times that the scriptwriter himself lost count. Leonardo DiCaprio is pretty good, and so is Matt Damon. But there is no charm in their roles. They're like machines. Acting and acting like there is no tomorrow. The people of good old days didn't do so good because they simply were better actors. But because they enjoyed the atmosphere, tasted the character, felt the charm. This ""charm"" is missing in here. But, Mr. Scorsese says, when a loaded gun is pointed at you, what's the difference?<br/><br/>I have seen innumerable love scenes, both suggestive and explicit, in movies made in a dozen languages. Some were good, some not so good. But comfortably numb was never a good choice for the scene in this movie. Moreover, the scene is baseless. First, a successful detective knocks you and hits on you and you end up with a ""very serious relationship"" with him. Before the relation sees the completion of its 4th month, a police academy dropout asks you for coffee and eventually you end up with an apparently equally serious relationship with him too! Was the lady a psychiatrist? How could she come this far in her profession like that? Later, in the same movie, she finds out one of the dirtiest truths in town and gets furious in anger why? Because she realizes she's not that good with fooling people! In a family/psychological drama, this might have gone without consequence. But here? Are you kidding me?!<br/><br/>There are, however, good moments in the movie. Most of the scenes involving Jack Nicholson are very enjoyable always. He was kind of obvious choice for the role because after such a career, and such acting excellence, he is capable of playing this role even without taking a look at the script! But then again, just like gorgeous heroes, gorgeous villains should also be offered an end worthy of remembrance. The only deterministic character in the movie was denied that even.<br/><br/>Apart from the fact that murder of such a high ranking police official who controls all the undercover agents in town could not go uninquired, the movie is full of situations that fail to convince. Still such movies make a load of fortune quite often. But, there is nothing in this movie worthy of an award for the director's charisma."

","i watched it yesterday. yea, it's totally internal affairs. He only changed the ending. I'm a big fan of internal affairs, i've watched it a long time ago. i remember every scene of it. When i watched the departed,i can say that all the actors were great!. Leonardo Dicaprio and jack Nicholson are the best i thought.i prefer the ending of the departed than internal affairs. but there's something missing in the departed,it's the emotions. internal affairs have more emotions than the departed (Tony Leung -the Billy Costigan in the Departed- played his role so damn great!). If u haven't watched the internal affairs, i recommends u to watch, great movie!"
"LoneWolfAndCub","10","1","2","11 November 2006"," Absolutely brilliant!
","The Departed, based on the Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs, is a great return for Scorcese. Everything about this is just outstanding. The acting was good from all, DiCaprio giving a career best in my opinion. Matt Damon gave a surprisingly good performance. Mark Whalberg, although having a minor role, was very good and some great comic relief. Jack Nicholson was superb, he truly was the best actor giving a startling performance as the vicious mafia boss. Martin Sheen was also superb.<br/><br/>The Departed is well written, with the twists smart and the action intense. Martin Scorcese directs with a passion, he really knows what he's doing with this and makes this as good as can be. This really is his movie. It has the brutal violence which is prominent in his films, the smart humour, the language, the dialogue and the brilliant ending. This is my second favourite film of the year and is a must see from Scorcese fans. This is a sure to get a few nominations and hopefully a Best Picture for Scorcese.<br/><br/>5/5."
"EddieVilliers","10","1","2","11 November 2006"," Best of Martin Scorsese
","The best movie of the year by far... The Departed has a great script, great cast and is an excellently executed picture. In fact, I am looking forward to see the original Hong Kong version of the film.<br/><br/>Unlike the theme of the last few Martin Scorsese films - Gangs of New York and Aviator - the cops and robbers theme of this picture was by far the most universal. Every large city in the world has its own version of Frank Costello. Without revealing anything more than the film's trailers and other user's comments already have regarding this picture I shall say that the script is excellent. It keeps the underworld-cop as well as the underworld-common man tensions realistic. My only complaint regarding the script is the the love triangle between Costigan, Sullivan and Madolyn. I found it a little ham handed. It wasn't completely unnecessary especially as far as Costigan (DiCaprio) was concerned but all the same it could be handled in a different perspective. Though the personality and drive of Castigan, Constello and Sullivan have been well developed, the same cannot be said of the other support cast. <br/><br/>As far as the cast is concerned I am a big fan of Jack Nicholson and Matt Damon. Jack Nicholson as Frank Costello is cold blooded and crazy as a fox, while Matt Damon as Colin Sullivan and Costello's agent in the police depaartment finds himself between the rock and the hard place time and again and comes out of these situations with a charm befitting the classic double agent. I am not a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio but I was pleasantly surprised with his turn on the screen. Like Damon's character he finds himself in between the good (his instincts) and bad (Costello's instincts aided with Sillivan's information) and he too portrays a double agent very believably. The support cast of Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg was executed well too, though their character's especially Wahlberg's caustic portrayal of Digman was not well developed. <br/><br/>I must say that I have been nit-picking regarding the faults and I shall still say it get 10/10 from me. All in an all it is a great movie... definite must watch for this year..."
"faisal_al","9","1","2","11 November 2006"," Excellent remake
","In a nutshell; a remake of an already superb movie Infernal Affairs, with Scorsese at the helm, and one hell of a cast. It's no surprise that this movie had extremely high expectations, and guess what - it's no surprise that this movie is so highly acclaimed too.<br/><br/>I went to the movie feeling very skeptical - I was a big fan of Infernal Affairs, and was worried if the enjoyment of the movie would be ruined by the fact that I already knew what was going to happen. Surprisingly this movie exceeded my expectations! The casting was spot on - Wahlberg and Baldwin provide memorable (and sometimes hilarious) performances even despite their supporting roles; Nicholson delivers an expectedly sinister and gritty performance; but more importantly, Leonardo DiCaprio completely blew me off my socks - I've always somehow always doubted this guy, but in The Departed, he pulled off the role of Billy Costigan extremely well.<br/><br/>Although the film is a remake, Scorsese added a few minor details that really set it aside from its remake. The film did lack some of the 'cool edges' that the original Infernal Affairs had, but makes up with a much more believable, humanistic character progression through and through. The characters and their actions are much more believable this time around. To top it off, some of the witty dialogue by the supporting cast provide a nice touch to the overall feel of the film with its dark humor and interesting personalities. The feel is also much darker and grittier than the original.<br/><br/>Some may complain that this movie is a little long. I admit, it did feel so at some places, but after I finished watching it, i thought back, and realized that all the scenes really strengthened the drama and explored the characters really well, and in the end.. it makes the plot more believable, and explores the theme of trust, loyalty, identity, and ambition even better than the original Hong Kong flick. The intensity of the final 20 minutes of the film will keep anyone at the edge of their seat. I highly recommend this to anyone, whether you've seen the original Infernal Affairs or not."
"jemps918","9","1","2","11 November 2006"," This movie should finally get them both their ever elusive Oscars
","Finally, a movie with a great cast, great director and great script that lives up to all the hype! This remake of the Hong Kong gangster flick series Infernal Affairs was beautifully executed by Martin Scorsese, along with his muse-of-the-moment Leonardo Di Caprio. This movie should finally get them both their ever elusive Oscars; Di Caprio and Scorsese have been nominated several times but neither ever won.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg, who plays Martin Sheen's partner, adds comic relief with his bulldog character Dignam. Jack Nicholson chillingly plays the villainous Frank Costello perfectly, and yet he manages to get the audience to laugh with him and be enamored by his evil. Nicholson was the only one who didn't take a chance on a character change (having played a similar role in Witches of Eastwick and other flicks). Matt Damon successfully pulls off his first turn as a villain, and Di Caprio develops the physical features to truthfully play a mature role. Di Caprio has consistently been a good actor, but even in The Aviator, his baby-faced features just couldn't dissolve well into the character, no matter how intensely he emotes. In The Departed, he finally looks gritty enough, and, as clinical psychiatrist Madolyn (played by newcomer Vera Farmiga) very correctly puts it, irresistibly vulnerable.<br/><br/>The movie is almost three hours long but you don't feel it; it is tightly edited and composed, which isn't very Scorsese. Definitely one of the best movies of the year."
"PortugalOle7","10","1","2","10 November 2006"," Scorsese gets back on track
","As good as I expected. I think its Scorsese's best since Goodfellas. Scorsese returns to his unfiltered best to make this entertaining crime film.<br/><br/>The film revolves around an undercover cop, played by DiCaprio, who is sent to infiltrate Nicholson's mob organization. On the flip side Nicholson sends his ""son"", played by Damon, into the police force as his spy. The tension grows as both men reveal the inner workings on the organizations they have infiltrated. The plot reveals plenty of twists and turns.<br/><br/>Scorsese always seems to bring together a talented cast and he does it again here. I always find DiCaprio to be very ""hit or miss"" in his roles. He does well here, very well in fact. He's never overmatched in the scenes with Nicholson and it proves to be what makes him very effective in this role. While Nicholson gets to show his creepy nefarious side, he tends to go a little overboard with the character. Damon has gotten to a point where he can take any role and play it well. He's great at playing the two-faced cop here. One thing that is very apparent is that he gets to bring on his native Boston accent ala Good Will Hunting. Nice supporting roles from Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen as high-rankers in the department. However an actor that I cannot, as hard as I try, take seriously is Mark Wahlberg. He's so over the top in every role and he is here in my opinion.<br/><br/>Scorsese's use of music weaving in and out of scenes at different volumes, something he did well in Goodfellas, comes back in this film. What shines through though is his knack for shooting chaos or violence. All of Scorsese's trademark storytelling techniques come into this one with a vengeance and make very a smooth and entertaining film."

Meanwhile in the department, there's a top-ranking cop by the name of Colin Sullivan who is so successful because he works for Frank Costello and gets all his leads from him.

I remember Robert De Niro using it in casino and thinking the same thing to be honest this is just an observation there's plenty of reasons other than the dialogue why i didn't enjoy this film, one of them is that because of team America puppet of Matt Damon with his immortal line of ""Matt Damon Matt Damon"" every time i see him now i find it hard to take him seriously.."

"bobcolganrac","10","1","2","30 October 2006"," An excellent work
","""The Departed"" may have roots elsewhere but it translates very well to American cinema.<br/><br/>The acting is top rate. The action well paced, and well edited. The characters realistically drawn, well cast and artfully placed in the sets. The suspense is non-stop. A more gripping movie I cannot remember. What's not to like?<br/><br/>This is a powerful piece of cinema by a director who has created some of America's most memorable films. I agree with some others that this addition to his portfolio ought finally win Scorcese the Oscar for Best Film, unless between now and Jan 1 there is a blockbuster I don't know about. If nothing else it assures him a placesetting at the table for Best American Movie Directors . . .<br/><br/>I loved the intensity of the character studies. The individual actors live their roles and the entire cast is experienced enough to submerge their egos. Nicholson's maniacal sociopathic Costello straddles the line between normalcy, fatherhood and family, and serial killer as if the only difference is the viewing angle. The boss lord, the heavy, he never allows you to relax when he is on screen, and creates tension with every look, every gesture. He menaces like a pit viper. I thought his best performance ever was in the movie ""Ironweed"" but comparing his role there and this one is apples and oranges. Great acting.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is absolutely marvelous. I hope he is nominated, and wins the Academy award for Best Actor for this. His previous collaboration with Scorcese in ""The Aviator"" didn't receive the acclaim for his portrayal of Howard Hughes I thought it merited. He has become a polished and versatile actor and his role as Costigan allows him to show what it must feel like to be caught up in a maze of unknown but constant danger. At the same time he is trying to navigate with whatever garbled clues he can find. Matt Damon is very good. Mark Wahlberg is excellent---another actor who has grown significantly in his ability to credibly convey a character. His in-the-face detective could be a caricature in the wrong hands, but in his there's a realism. It's the realism that underpins the effectiveness of ""The Departed""---nothing seems that staged, and we're aware that the movie could possibly be cinema verite had the cameras been positioned just so. Scorcese's directoral strength may be his ability to bring that realism alive. In ""Casino"" it sometimes seemed we were behind the closed doors of the action, seeing what 99.9% of the public can't. ""The Departed"" looks, feels real. Scarily so. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast is good, not quite as effective as the principles perhaps. I thought the henchmen for Costella were excellent. One of my favorite actors, Alex Baldwin, was not up to his usual excellence--more the role and what it asked of him maybe, than his acting in the role. He might've been written a little heavier, less good-natured, more serious and angry, less somewhere in the middle. Overall, the movie rates a 9.5 from me. There are a few weaknesses, such as the relationship between Costigan and Madolyn which could've been fleshed out a little more, given a little more time together on screen to deepen our sense of what they share ---this is a case where a few more minutes might've helped and the movies is such a fun ride no one would notice the time anyway. I was literally glued to the screen in a way few movies ever have captured me. Do not make the mistake of drinking a lot of water before going to this movie---you don't want to miss a minute. Definitely a classic."
"nadineronan","10","1","2","30 October 2006"," The best film I have ever seen....
","There are not many films that can hold my full attention throughout the whole duration of the movie... however The Departed had me totally gripped from the beginning to the end!!! Generally I want to get out of the cinema an hour or so after I've sat down (my bum gets very numb!!?!) But with this flick, I did not want it to end. I would highly recommend that everyone goes to see it... the cast and plot line are truly fantastic, The all star cast works a treat, the humour is second to none and the eye candy is not half bad either with Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio. Nicholson plays a brilliant role as always and his witty lines will have you doubled over with laughter!! <br/><br/>Role on the day The Departed is released on DVD! (ps - does anyone know the release date for the DVD??) The best film I have ever seen... well maybe apart from Forest Gump!!!"
"KUAlum26","9","1","2","30 October 2006"," Unrelenting!
","I'm aware of the fact that the concept and basic storyline for Martin Scorcese's Departed actually came from a Hong Kong/Chinese crime drama epic from a few years back. I cannot attest to what the original was,but after seeing this film,I'd be curious to see it.<br/><br/>This movie is arguably one of--if not THE strongest film out this fall. I'm always a little reluctant to go crazy lauding directors like Scorcese,Coppola,Spielberg and so forth because they are iconic and seem to have praise larded on them by the truckloads,but suffice it to say that there's a reason Mr.Scorcese gets the kind of laudation he gets,and this movie is one example of why.<br/><br/>Set in working class Boston,this film tracks the lives of two principal characters:Colin""Sully""Sullivan(Matt Damon,who's chiseled,straight,expressionless face and easy demeanor is perfect here),a model citizen from the neighborhoods who excels his way from academy into heading his own vice unit in record time,and William ""Billy""Costigan(Leonardo DiCaprio,who seems to work well off Scorcese's calls,as per The Aviator from a few years before), another working class Irish Bostonian whose road to the Boston PD is much rougher and is recruited to do undercover work. Early on,you know who's who here:Sullivan is in the deep pockets of simmering,sleazy mob boss Frank Costello(Jack Nicholson,whose only flaw in this film was his wavering Boston accent)and is a link to the law enforcers who are trying to tag him,while Costigan steadily builds his links and confidence into Mr.Costello's outfit. All the while,both Sully and Billy build relationships with the police psychologist(Vera Farmiga,whom I also enjoyed in 2002's Dummy),and meanwhile work around each other. As both sides start to sense that there is a rat in their ranks,the two find themselves pushing harder to simultaneously do their jobs,cover their tracks and root the other out. The race is on,so to speak. <br/><br/>With quality support from Mark Wahlberg(as an incorruptible and temperamental bureau sub-chief),Martin Sheen(as Wahlberg's boss,a patient precinct veteran),Anthony Anderson(as the honest cop who works for Damon's corrupt chief),Ray Winstone(as Nicholson's brutal top henchman)and Alec Baldwin(as the charismatic paper-pusher whose investigative unit backs Damon's squad),this movie is a strong shock to the system,with violence often and yet used as a sort of gut-check to the viewer. In a war between cops and gangland criminals,the results are unrelenting and brutal,and seldom romantic.<br/><br/>The pacing of this film takes on more of a thriller mode towards the end,and there are a few twists thrown in to make the ending not as ""neat"" as some might suspect it's heading towards. The screenplay by William Monahan and Siu Fui Mak(adapting from the original)is a seamless fit to Scocese's vision. I don't like throwing phrases like ""must see"" or ""instant classic"",so instead I'll say this about it:if you're serious about your movies,catch this film any way you can."
"mosaicinvain","10","1","2","30 October 2006"," Proud to have seen it in theaters
","Jack Nicholson. Leonardo DiCaprio. Matt Damon. Mark Wahlberg. Martin Sheen. These are just a few of the massive, all-star, ensemble cast in this film. And with Martin Scorsese behind the wheel, this movie, for the most part, is flawless. Now for those of you not familiar with Scorsese's work, I suggest you try either Goodfellas (1990), or his earlier classic, Mean Streets (1973). Many will try to argue that Goodfellas is Scorsese's undisputed best picture, but with the release of this film, I beg to differ. I won't go into the plot much, so as to keep its twists and turns secret, but I will say this; never in my life have I seen a film quite like this. This is, by far, the best movie to be released this year. Also, in my own opinion, it is the best crime/action film to be released in my lifetime.<br/><br/>For starters, the acting in this movie is beyond phenomenal. If analyzed, one can conclude that DiCaprio, playing Billy Costigan, is our main character and protagonist. Though everyone in the film ends up unintentionally cowering in the shadow and talent of Mr. Jack Nicholson, as Frank Costello, the all-knowing, hard-hitting mob boss. So, this film is obviously wonderful for fans of Nicholson, but don't get me wrong, everyone has their own moments. Matt Damon, as Colin Sullivan, plays our anti-hero to DiCaprio, and let me tell you, when those two are put against each other, watch out! I have never seen such brilliant acting from either of those two men.<br/><br/>The overall plot of the movie concerns DiCaprio, a failed Boston policeman, becoming an inside man, infiltrating Nicholson's Irish mafia world of crime. What DiCaprio doesn't know is that Matt Damon is a mobster, sent by Nicholson to infiltrate the Boston Police Department. When the two men discover that there is a mole on either side, bloodshed and violence ensue. They set out to find who is infiltrating their own side, while they themselves must be moles within their enemy's world. The plot becomes thick, and sub-plots build, but it remains friendly, and not overly intelligent to the audience. So it doesn't leave us scratching our heads at the end of the film, but it rather leaves our jaws dropped to the floor.<br/><br/>I give this film a perfect rating of 10 out of 10. The directing is stunning, I truly think it is Scorsese's best film to date. The writing is wonderful. Though the movie is partly based upon a Hong-Kong action film, and some true happenings in Boston concerning the Irish mafia, the dialog and structure of the plot is very well written. The editing is beautiful. Most people never take editing into consideration, but it is an extremely important part of the pacing and flow of the movie. It also plays a large role in the film's style. And as I said earlier, the acting is mind blowing. Everyone in the movie was at the top of their game. But perhaps the main reason I enjoyed this film so much was it's ""stick-it-to-the-man"" attitude. It was a slap in the face to Hollywood. Yes, this movie was a blockbuster. Yes, the actors are all out of Hollywood. But for someone to suggest that this film does not prove the existence of true art in Hollywood, well they're just lying to themselves. This is a return to the Hollywood we always think of in our dreams. Back to the days of Scarface (1983), The Godfather (1972), and Chinatown (1974). This film is a shining star in the argument ""Does art still exist in Hollywood?"". I can proudly say now ""Yes it does""."

","I just came back from the cinema, and I can really say that I've seen one of the best and finest gangster/mafia movie of all times. After a small hiatus with the Aviator, Martin Scorsese is back in the genre and surely back in winning ways (has it ever been otherwise?).<br/><br/>The movie is inspired/based on its Asian counter-part Internal Affairs, but having seen both, I honestly think that Scorsese brilliantly makes the Departed look like an original and genuine chef-d'oeuvre, one he only has the secret.<br/><br/>The story in itself is fantastic; right from the beginning and the first lines you know you're in for a classic and the long introduction sets the tone nicely for the rest of the movie. Not a single second will make you regret entering the theatre, the action and the crescendo built up nicely and keeps you entertained until the very last shot. The direction is accurate and precise, the music pin-points key elements in the movie and the scenery is perfect for this film.<br/><br/>The acting is brilliant, the main actors play superbly well and the supporting cast provides much more than just a support; they are an integral part of the film's success.<br/><br/>I highly recommend The Departed.

"wylie_coyote91","10","1","2","29 October 2006"," THE best film I've EVER seen
","I'd never even heard of this film before I saw it in the papers this morning and decided to give it a shot...this was no bad move, I guarantee you. This is without a doubt the best, most entertaining, most twisted and most engaging movie since Snatch (well...that's my theory). It is so incredibly detailed that you have to follow the plot every single nanosecond, but at the end you won't be confused or disillusioned in any way. My vocabulary cannot cope with the pure brilliance of this movie. I could try to explain it, but I'd just stand there wide-eyed and stutter, and you'd all think I'm on drugs. One of the great things about the film is that there are loads of 'sub-stories', and you can ponder on these stories while you're connecting the dots of the main plot. Then there is, of course, the spectacular cast, kicking off with one of my personal favourites, the demonic Jack Nicholson. He did a brilliant job here, as always playing the bad guy, the sick, twisted mastermind. I never seem to get tired of this guy, and with this entry, I doubt I ever will get tired of him. I always thought of Leo DiCaprio as a bit of a softie, even after seeing Gangs of NY. I just couldn't help it, knowing he played in R&J and Titanic. After The Departed, I completely changed my mind about him. Excellent actor...nothing else needs to be said. I was quite surprised seeing some of the other characters who appeared along the way, amongst these were Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin. I didn't see them on the cast list, so I was naturally pleased to see some more talents. Wahlberg and Baldwin did very well here and seriously suited their given roles as the heads of the Boston State Police Department. All in all, this utterly incre-specta-brilliant movie deserves a 20 out of 10 rating just for being the best movie I have ever seen. Mind-boggling plot, jaw-dropping cast and a stunning finale makes it an outstanding achievement. Thank you Scorsese...thank you very much."
"vatsak","6","1","2","28 October 2006"," Letdown
","Even in my wildest nightmares i did not expect Scorsese to remake a movie. And as remakes usually go, The Departed does not match up to Infernal Affairs. The only good thing about The Departed is the screenplay, apart from brilliant performances from Leo DiCaprio and Jack Nicholson. I thought Infernal Affairs was much more slicker and the pace of the movie is faster. Also the performances by Tony Leung and Andy Lau were scintillating. Although Leo DiCaprio and Matt Damon gave their best performances to date, The Departed is still a disappointment especially because of the dull pace of the movie.<br/><br/>I probably would have liked The Departed if i had seen it first. But after watching Infernal Affairs it is a sad letdown. Also the background score for Infernal Affairs was better and it was better made."

"dforrest121","10","1","2","27 October 2006"," Why can't people appreciate the movie for what it is?
","I've been reading a lot about The Departed and how it compares with Infernal Affairs,the original screenplay. I have seen Infernal Affairs I but not the other 2,and I saw The Departed this past weekend. People need to understand that although the idea for The Departed was taken from Infernal Affairs, it's a movie all it's own. I can understand fans of the original not liking The Departed AS MUCH, but too many people are saying The Departed is a bad movie,which I find absurd. The movie was made to fit our culture, Americanized if you will, and did a damn good job at doing so. I know people are going to tear me apart because I'm an American male along with being a huge Scores fan,but I personally liked The Departed better(and yes I saw Infernal Affairs before The Departed). It hard to use the word ""better"" when talking about the remake/remodeling of a movie but I''ll dare say it. The way Monacan took the original script and tuned it to our culture and way of life was brilliant, along with Scorsese's direction and music selection. I wrote this in response to original fans,many Asian,telling me that The Departed was garbage and couldn't compare to Infernal Affairs. Maybe they don't like it as much as the original,but there's no denying that this film is one of the most powerful and moving films to come out in a long time. A lot of people are taking credit away from Monacan and Scores because it's a ""remake"" but they did a lot more than remake and Americanize this movie,they immortalized it and turned it into an instant classic. They didn't simply take the screenplay and script from Infernal Affairs,they took the idea and changed,expanded and tuned it into a brilliant film OF IT'S OWN...You can't take anything away from The Departed because of Infernal Affairs, so stop being ignorant because you prefer Infernal Affairs and give credit where credit is due."
"derik187","9","1","2","25 October 2006"," one of the best films i have seen in a very long time
","What can I say, this movie has me smitten. The Departed contains action, suspense, drama, and at the same time retains a strong comedic overtone. Great acting all around. Nicholson finally plays someone other than Jack Nicholson in a movie and does a fantastic job. This is the first movie I've ever like DeCaprio in, although I hear he was good in Catch Me If You Can. Just look at the cast and you know you're in for a quality movie. Mark Wahlberg gives a very strong performance and Alec Baldwin is absolutely hilarious. The story is great, the acting is great, and I for one liked the ending. Do yourself a favor and be sure to catch The Departed."

","I was really disappointed with this movie. There were so many holes in the plot, and it was such an obvious story as well with so many unbelievable scenarios.<br/><br/>DiCaprio was overacting the whole way through the movie, no light and shade in his performance. His acting was just full on over the top, the whole way through. I think he was overcompensating for the fact that he is a pretty boy and small framed. Wrong choice for that part.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson was great as usual.<br/><br/>The direction was great despite its lack of story, but someone really fell short of scrutinizing the storyline and scripting. Scorcese should have gotton the writers of the Sopranos to write it for him. Trying to suspend disbelief was impossible. The added love story of a shrink falling for her bad boy patient was just too predictable as well. I actually became bored during this movie and unfortunately regretted paying for it.<br/><br/>Maybe thats why Scorcese was promoting this movie personally, because it needed all the help it could get. I'm sure people will go to see it just because of its director, but I will be wary of attending another of his movies unless I see many reviews prior. I love Scorcese films, but I have to say ""What happened??"""

"aramgutang","9","1","2","24 October 2006"," Almost flawless
","The Departed is truly a film that could be called flawless. The story is engaging, the character development is superb, the acting is Academy Award worthy, and production-wise, the film is polished to a mirror shine. There is only one thing I can find to hold against it: there is nothing new or original in the film. You'll find things you've seen in other movies brought to perfection in this one, but the only aspect in which it could be called groundbreaking is the amount of blood droplets you'll see suspended in air.<br/><br/>The story is a complex tale of betrayal in the crime and law enforcement scene of modern-day Boston. It is told very effectively, never losing the viewer in all of its numerous plot turns and revelations. In true Scorcese style, it is also bluntly violent, but every death on screen is strongly tied to a particular plot aspect or intended audience reaction, and never seems gratuitous. Even the romance subplot does not seem forced, as is the case with many Hollywood productions of this type, and is integral to the picture as a whole. As with many action movies, there is plenty of quality comic relief in the form of witty remarks, and even those remarks never seem forced.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, given the extensively star-studded cast, the acting is top-notch, perhaps at least in part due to material the actors had to work with. What was surprising though, was that you'll never find a particular actor stealing the scene. Scorcese has managed to bring out the best in every person on screen, and that best was being true to their character, making the audience forget that these people are actors despite their recognisability.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, however, there is little about the film that will leave a lasting impression on the viewer. It is a great ride while you're in the theatre, but upon leaving, you'll find very few details that are truly memorable, or plot points that warrant further pondering. You'll know you just saw a great movie, but it just failed to extend beyond that screen. Perhaps the only exception to this is the visual feel of the movie. The sepia-like tones that help emphasise just the right aspects of the movie's action are what really make the film feel unique, and are a prime example of cinematography being used to enhance the story, rather than detract from it. One can only wish that more movies were as flawlessly executed as this one."
"cardboredboy","9","1","2","24 October 2006"," When American remakes of Asian cinema go RIGHT for a change.
","It's not pretty, it's not cheery, but it's gritty, intense, and provocative. It's more than just another crime film. It's tightly wound characters fit perfectly into the tightly wound story about a Massachusetts State Trooper(or a statey if you will) with family ties to crime gone undercover gangster and a clean-cut gangster who has excelled in infiltrating the state police as a mole. As they both become aware of each other, they start a race for control of a situation that tests their wits, endurance, and their very souls. I was very pleased with Scorese's adaptation of Mou Gaan Dou (US: Infernal Affairs) overall. William Monahan did a fantastic job, not only in rewriting the story but in fully revising the tone of things to localize the story in Boston. The original played heavily on the relationship of Chinese organized crime and the police. That dynamic would have been largely lost in a literal translation of Infernal Affairs. Instead, Boston native Monahan adeptly instilled the essence of various elements of Massachusetts into the script. This is especially exciting for those of us who are from Massachusetts, but for everyone else it should create a very stable and detailed sense of setting. Scorsese did well to cast several Massachusetts-based actors as well. Not just because of their connection to the area though, don't be confused about the performance of Matt Damon, and brothers Mark and Robert Wahlberg, because they're phenomenal. Several Asian films have been remade for America in recent years, and while they've kept the exciting stories, they've often eschewed the style and depth of the originals. By setting the film in a specific American locale and then embracing the setting and drawing from it for inspiration, Scorsese and Monahan have taken a great story and remade it into a truly worthy American remake. I'm more content to watch the Asian films that these remakes are created from for the most part, but when it's done this well I can't complain. Instead of one film with a fantastic concept, we have two. I can watch Infernal Affairs and The Departed and, despite their similarity, view both as fantastic, original works."

The writing of the movie was fluent- the movie kept you the whole time. I walked out of the theater completely blown away. I am VERY picky about movies- not many would earn a perfect ten from me, and I am usually a comedy lover anyway; but this was really worth seeing. It definitely earns the ""R"" rating though.

"billyray331","10","1","2","24 October 2006"," The Masterpiece of this decade
","Every decade since the 1970's, American cinema has been blessed with a distinct masterpiece from a master director. This director is of course Martin Scorsese and his films are ""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"", and ""Goodfellas."" Since the dawn of this new millennium, fans of the screen have awaited the Marty film that would define the decade and join these three masterpieces as the crown jewels of his career.<br/><br/>In 2002 ""Gangs of New York"" represented a director who tried to gain the wind back in his sails. The result was a satisfyingly uneven, but undeniably good film, headlined by great performances and a beautiful look. Two years later, he swung for the fence with ""The Aviator"" and it almost made it out of the park. This wonderfully entertaining film represented Marty's latest futile attempt to win the O. At the time, it seemed like a safe bet, but the Academy didn't agree. It wasn't in the league of ""Raging Bull"" or his other masterpieces, but it seemed that if he didn't get it for ""The Aviator"" he was going to have to wait for the lifetime achievement award.<br/><br/>It almost seems like the Academy had incredible foresight, for Martin Scorsese has done the impossible. He has added a forth film to his masterpiece collection, and that film is ""The Departed."" It is not only Martin's finest film in sixteen years; it's also the BEST American FILM OF THE DECADE! Like a genius politician Scorsese surrounds himself with the best. The cast doesn't have a weak spot with DiCaprio giving his finest performance to date , the writing is the finest ever for a Scorsese picture, and Schoomaker's editing continues to demonstrate her pure ecstatic control over the medium. Though, it is still Martin's show and after decades of producing the finest films in the world, he has still not lost his touch. Excitement was felt last year when Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" represented the finest remake in the history of Hollywood, but less than a year later, Scorsese owns that title again. If it weren't for his other three films (which are amongst the greatest of all time) this would be Scorsese's masterpiece. But with time, this film will surly join their company."

Leonardo DiCaprio (why does everybody hate his guts?) was top notch as well as Matt Damon. The Departed was extremely violent and extremely profane yet you hardly noticed either of these things because of how fast the pace of the movie was. The 150 minutes, in my opinion, went by extremely fast. I never once looked at my watch to see when the movie would end. It was lovely to see Scorsese back to his gangster movie making. Note: No gangster movie will ever be better than GoodFellas. However, The Departed came pretty darn close. I do not remember the last action movie where I laughed so much. I will not give anything away but there is a scene where Matt Damon is meeting Jack Nicholson in a theater and let's just say Damon almost had a heart attack. I found myself laughing for a couple of minutes after that scene. Absolutely wonderful film that is deserving of Best Actor (Nihcolson) and Best Director (Scorsese) at the next Academy Awards."

I won't kill it for you but I think you'll know what I mean. Unless you can't take this particular violent crime story genre, this should not be missed on the big screen. It's the best film that's been around in a long, long time. The high power cast is in top form and I think that you'll be hard pressed to remember any film where Matt Damon, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin have been better. Leo DiCaprio, who is already one of America's great actors, hit's a new level of excellence. I've been a huge fan since ""This Boy's Life"". Jack Nicholson...I'm at a loss for words, he's so good in this film. In thinking of his entire body of work, from ""Easy Rider"" through to ""The Departed' he's like a fine wine, getting better and better as he ages, his range of successful roles is just astounding....""heeeer's Johnny..."". I was hugely surprised by Mark Whalberg who, in my opinion, turns in the best performance of his career. I look forward to seeing more of him in the future. Anthony Anderson was a surprise addition, and he really contributes a lot in his supporting role. Super directing, stellar cast well utilized, decent storyline, excellent sound track, great editing and continuity.......this is the one to spend $8. on."

","The Spoilers herein will pretty much give away the entire movie. Most of it can be inferred from the previews, but I will indeed wreck the ending for you.<br/><br/>This is a movie that is very good, but is not one that I am not sure how well I liked it, which essentially means that its probably not one I would watch a second time.<br/><br/>On the plus side, its has great acting, dialog, and very memorable characters. Damon and DiCaprio are both put in a very strong performance. And Jack Nicholson is very entertaining in his role, as is Mark Whalberg. The plot is interesting too. You have a mole in the police department trying to identify the under cover agent in the crime lords gang, while the agent in the gang tries to find the mole.<br/><br/>But the story in and of its self is not that interesting to me, mostly because it feels like it does not really resolve its story line. By the end of the movie, all the principle characters end up dead, but there is not climactic gun fight. The undercover agent is very suddenly shot in the head, and then those who were in a position to expose the Mole are also shot dead. And then finally the Mole is in turn shot by one of the officers who quit the force when the Mole demanded access to the undercover agents in the wake of the death of the head of the under cover department. While the ending does fit the circumstances quite nicely, the is just not that satisfying and ending. Rather then resolving the character plot lines, everyone is just shot, and the truth is never really revealed. I would have preferred to see either the Mole or the Agent survive.<br/><br/>Its hard to have a worthwhile ending, I think, when both the hero and the villain of the story end up dead and no one around them ends up knowing exactly why. I don't mind that the Mole gets killed at the end, but the ending would have been so much better if there were some on screen element explaining exactly why the ex-cop who killed him did so. For all the audience knows, he was murdered in cold blood out of a grudge having nothing to do with the central conflict of the story.<br/><br/>END COMMUNICATION"

Especially Mark Walberg's character introduction, which is memorable and you will agree with me when you see it. The right movie has finally found Mark Walberg, and this will definitely open bigger doors for his future career. The best thing about this movie is how close all the characters become related as the story goes on.

The Academy might as well not even hold Oscars this year, and just mail them to DiCaprio, Damon, Nicholson, and Scorcese."

","Just been to see The Departed, excellent movie. The direction, action sequences and the acting, all come together to make for a high quality movie. The cast is stellar, and who knew Leo DiCaprio could act! took me half way through the movie to work out it was actually him. Jack Nickleson also brilliant. Excellent supporting cast too. I love the gangster genre and I love Marty Scohrese's movies and this is him on top form. I've watched the original Hong Kong crime thriller Infernal Affairs, on which this is based on and its a great adaption. So go see a movie which has depth and emotion amidst all the bloodshed. Definly in my top 10, I love this movie! 10/10"
"annoman","10","1","2","22 October 2006"," As Frank Costello says so humorously, ""No tickey, no laundry!"" To that I say bring all the loads you can muster, 'cause this movie can't fail to wash you to the core.
","Martin Scorcese is among the most influential, masterfully-gifted film directors of all time. He's contributed countless movie classics from his under-the-radar classic Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore to his beautifully violent Taxi Driver; his graceful docu-masterpiece The Last Waltz to the unprecedented bio-pic Raging Bull; The King of Comedy, The Last Temptation of Christ, The Color of Money, GoodFellas, his daunting and haunting re-make Cape Fear, Casino, Bringing Out the Dead, Gangs of New York, The Aviator. All of these timeless trend-setting genre spectacles amass to a resume in American cinema outdone only by Hitchcock, Ford and Huston. Despite his triumphs in moving pictures, Scorcese has yet to attain his due recognition as Best Director and none of his Academy Award-nominated films have won the prestigious Oscar for Best Picture of the Year. Well, this year's chances are as good as any for his drought to catch some rain. The Departed, an Americanized adaptation of Japan's hugely successful crime-drama, Infernal Affairs, is already being considered a crime-classic for time to come and is Leonardo DiCaprio's most concrete Oscar-prone vessel to date. Each and every performance is teeth-shatteringly good with strong leads from Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, Ray Winstone and eight-time nominee, three-time Academy Award-winner, Jack Nicholson. However, outshined are all of these phenomenal actors; and by one I figured least likely to do the deed. Leonardo DiCaprio truly delves into Billy Costigan's persona, becoming the young lad from South Boston. Along with Costigan, Colin Sullivan (Damon) is leading an excessively dangerous double-life. While Colin is moving up the hierarchy at the city's law enforcement branch, Billy's mischievous past and family reputation keep him from staying on the task force. The careers of these two young gentlemen, and their addressing captains (Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen) each amount to the reign of South Boston's organized-crime leader, Frank Costello (Nicholson). Scorcese's expert knowledge on the industry's does and don'ts, leave The Departed the crafty modern masterpiece that it is, and without any splotches. As Frank Costello says so humorously, ""No tickey, no laundry!"" To that I say bring all the loads you can muster, 'cause this movie can't fail to wash you to the core."

I have always been a fan of Matt Damon and I still think that The Bourne series is his best work, but this one is close to it. I feel that Jack Nicholson will be getting an Emmy for this one! Do not get me wrong, every actor/actress did a 10+ job as well. I did not understand the ending, however. Without a doubt, a guys movie! Maybe someone can help me understand the ending.

","This film is the remake of the Hong Kong film 'Infernal Affairs'. It is about the situation when evil and the good can no longer be distinguished.<br/><br/>This film does not feel like 2.5 hours along at all. There is not a moment of slack. Crucial things happen in every scene, and they happen for a reason.<br/><br/>Apart from the suitable pacing, the story is also great. Though it is a remake, I can see quite a lot of difference from the original. I like the way that only the concept from the original is used, and all the details are original.<br/><br/>Acting is great by all parties. There is romance, there is a lot of blood, there is portrayal of trust and betrayal. There is something for everybody.<br/><br/>One minor complaint though, is that the ending (outside the lift) is a bit artificial. I can't say more, but if you watched the film, you will know what I mean."

Plenty of funny moments and great lines and of course top notch acting. Leonardo DiCaprio was really showing his skills in this one. I think Leo might be the next protégé of Scorsese. Jack was great like always and I really enjoyed Mark Wahlberg's character. I can't say enough good things about this movie, it really doesn't have any flaws. It keeps you interested from start to finish (like all Scorsese's movie) and it was cool to see an Irish Mafia movie, rather than a typical Italian one.

Scorsese has once again done a very tasteful and beautifully violent film. <br/><br/>Every big name actor in this movie has really put it up in the open for everyone to see...Marty Sheen?? Wow!!

","After walking out of the theater today I realized why movies are made. Movies aren't just made for money, but for our entertainment. This so far happens to be one of the better mob movies. Superb acting, and an excellent story.<br/><br/>Leonardo Dicaprio plays Billy Costigan, an undercover cop known only to Cpt. Queenan and Dignam (played by Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg) who is investigating Frank Costello who is played by your truly Jack Nicholson. Unfortunately for Boston Police, they have a rat in their department too. Colin Sullivan played by Matt Damon who has been with Costellob since he was a young boy is a detective in the police department and tips Costello when every raid will take place. When both the Mob and the Cops find out they have rats, it becomes a game of trust.<br/><br/>With smart-mouth comments and excellent storytelling the movie goes from normal and smartly told to suspenseful and an excellent storyline. I highly recommend this movie. Mr. Scorsese, WELCOME BACK!"

","I'm going to be quite honest with you, Martin Scorseses latest masterpiece is one of the best movies i have seen for years. Jack Nicholson, Leo DiCaprio, Martin Sheen and Matt Damon all deliver stunning performances. But Mark Whalberg stole every scene he was participating in. His staff sergeant Dignam is one of the most brilliant characters i have ever seen on screen. Just that is a reason to see this wonderful movie...<br/><br/>Best movie of the year isn't enough to describe the departed. Best movie of the centaury, then we are getting close.

We both felt the strong suspense and we loved the powerful performances, especially Leonardo DiCaprio's. We literally felt his fear and anxiety mounting until the shocking finale. DiCaprio really deserves an Oscar nomination. Damon is brilliant as the cold-blooded villain. Everybody else in the cast was brilliant. We strongly recommend The Departed, so much so that my daughter wants to see it again. It is the best movie out there right now!!"
"britnborn","9","1","2","21 October 2006"," Thoroughly enjoyed this movie
","With all the great actors in this movie I expected it to be pretty good. I was not disappointed. It had a neat thought-provoking plot which took quite a slow build-up, but once all the pieces came together the story took tons of twists and turns and was always keeping you wondering if the bad guys were gonna get theirs in the end. The extended use of bad language (there weren't very many lines in the script that did not include some variation of the F-Word} is probably too much for many people (my wife included)but was very realistic for people in this line of work, so to speak. If you liked Scarface and Wise Guys you will probably like this as well. The plot certainly has more to offer and is not an easy one to predict. Well worth seeing if the language and gore (there are many bloody scenes) does not bother you."
"MrBiddle","10","1","2","21 October 2006"," Rats.
","It starts out rather slow and methodically. But the plot rivets attention unto itself because of how we know WHO everyone is in the story... Great performances all around. I loved the scene when the 2 men joke about a dog-walking girl being the Commissioner of the police department.<br/><br/>I think in storytelling, the irony of having the audience know more than the characters makes for BETTER suspense and anticipation. Yet THE DEPARTED still has it's unexpected U-Turns. I like the last and final shot. A visual cue and the ultimate representation to something of a recurring element or role in what the movie is about."
"Eyke87","9","1","2","21 October 2006"," Scorsese back where he belongs
","It's refreshing to see three of American cinema's biggest names return to something like top form. Since Goodfellas, Scorsese, Hollywood's crime lord, has seen switches in genre proved unsuccessful at the box office and amongst critics: period pieces, Kundun, Gangs of New York and The Aviator. Damon and Di Caprio also make searing returns to form, the former finally coming out of the shadow of that infernal puppet in Team America (remember he wrote Good Will Hunting) in this thrilling Boston crime epic from the master of the genre.<br/><br/>A remake of the Hong-Kong 2002 thriller, Infernal Affairs, The Departed sees the divide between both sides of the law blur as an all-star Hollywood cast swear, kill and even butcher their way through the complexities of life in the Boston-Irish mafia. There are rats on both sides and no one can be sure who has the sharpest teeth until Scorsese pulls back the curtain for his tense, seat-gripping finale.<br/><br/>This is an 18 certificate movie so: vulgar profanity. Check. Lots of blood. Check. And Jack Nicholson's sublime gangland boss hitting on an underage girl asking if she'd got her period yet. Check. It sounds wrong but trust me; this is comedy but damn is it dark.<br/><br/>The movie has is problems: it's a 'bum-number' i.e. a little long for some tastes and female character who becomes involves with Di Caprio and Damon feels at times somewhat inconsequential but these are very small needles in a gloriously entertaining haystack.<br/><br/>In a nutshell: Awesome! The most entertaining picture this year. Not for the faint hearted but if you loved Goodfellas, if you love Scorsese you will not be disappointed."
"boothbyeric","10","1","2","21 October 2006"," Better than Hyped
","Wow...I just finished watching and I have to say it was even better than I expected. I was pretty much the last one to see it out of my group of friends and I wasn't given a bad review by any of them. Going in I was a bit apprehensive, with the movie being pumped up the way it was I was sure a letdown was inevitable. All I can say is, boy was I wrong. Not only was the movie well written and directed, but the acting was out of this world. Nicholson as usual was phenomenal, Damon as the villain was tremendous and DiCaprio blew me away. I really expected great acting out of everyone, but I think Leo has finally come into his own and possibly stole the movie. I have never really been a big fan of his, granted he is a talented actor, but I thought in previous movies he was more of a pretty boy than a show stopper. In the Departed DiCaprio plays one hell of a bad-ass. <br/><br/>Visually this movie was gripping. I am a bit biased and find Boston to be a great city with many sites, but in this movie they were able to find every possible dirty, sleazy and just plain rough area they could find and made Boston look like a city to avoid.<br/><br/>In all I think this is by far the best movie 2006 has offered to date, and I personally feel this is actually one of the greatest action/thriller movies ever. Scorsese has outdone himself by far, and that is saying a lot. This movie might only be topped by Taxi Driver or Raging Bull on Scosese' impressive resume. In general I would recommend this movie to all, though I would suggest leaving the kids and anyone that can't handle the sight of blood(there is definitely LOTS of it) at home."
"vinzzo","10","1","2","20 October 2006"," A New Classic!
","So much depth in the characters. This flick sucked me in right away. DeCaprio does one of his best performances in this one and i felt he out-shined Nicholson. Keeping in mind that Jack was his usual fun self. Never really being a Matt Damon fan, he certainly gained my respect by his believable and extremely uptight performance. Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg were a great team as well. Mark's part was hilarious. Overall the cast was 5 star and well chosen and I found that this was practically the perfect Scorsese film.(Hence my 10 rating) Especially for a big Scorsese fan like myself.

"leswatterson35","10","1","2","20 October 2006"," The Departed (2006)
","Maybe you've heard the Internet buzz about The Departed being an old-school cop flick, unburdened by profundity. Maybe you'll think so too if you don't pay a lick of attention to what's on screen. Or maybe you'll recognize The Departed for what it is: a new American crime classic from the legendary Martin Scorsese, whose talent shines here on its highest beams.<br/><br/>A title card sets the scene: boston. some years ago. And we're off, watching Leonardo DiCaprio as a cop pretending to be a hood and Matt Damon as his opposite. Both are trapped in circumstances where you can't tell the good from the bad.<br/><br/>All the actors bring their A games to this triumphant bruiser of a film, its darkly wanton wit the only defense against complete chaos. DiCaprio and Damon give explosive, emotionally complex performances, but it must be said that Jack Nicholson reaches undreamed-of heights of decadent devilment as Irish mob kingpin Frank Costello. Whether he's wielding a gun or a dildo, buying off cops, dissing Catholic priests as pederasts, seducing children into a life of crime, letting it snow cocaine on favored hookers or chatting while elbow-deep in blood, Nicholson is electrifying. Dispassionately executing a woman on a beach, Costello notes to his henchman Mr. French (a terrific Ray Winstone), ""She fell funny."" But Costello is no campy Joker. Channeling James Cagney in White Heat and Paul Muni in Scarface, Nicholson leeches out the glamour to create a landmark portrait of evil."
"trratut","10","1","2","20 October 2006"," Absolutely the best movie ever filmed
","This movie is a go for everyone but the faint hearted. This movie is a testament to movie quality. Martin Scorcese deserves that directors Oscar for this movie alone. The way he was able to turn a Hong Kong thriller into a blockbuster hit with some of the best stars around. The DiCaprio -Matt Damon combo provides this movie with the key character relationships that define key acting. If I had any influence over those in Hollywood, I would definitely give this movie 7+ Oscars. (especially in male, lead and supporting actor, and director categories) Therefore, I strongly recommend everyone to watch the best movie ever put out of Hollywood."

The characterizations were perfect, with each actor playing roles that seemed tailor made just for them. The story is such an immersive and masterfully interweaving tale that I actually had to catch my breath a few times due to the intensity.

The writing (apparently it is based on another film called Internal Affairs) was amazing making us strain to understand every little nuance that is occurring (but in a good way). Spectacular everything. I will be very upset (and surprised) if this doesn't win best picture and director this year.

"oneloveall","7","1","2","19 October 2006"," Extremely entertaining- nothing more
","One of the America's sharpest action films of the year? Yes. A masterpiece? No. A return to form for one of America's most celebrated directors? Yes. An evolution of style and substance? No. Martin Scorsese certainly gives the finger to critics citing his recent geriatric tendencies with his most visceral work in at least a decade, but in turn somehow manages to imitate, not emulate some of his finer styling's, at peak form during the ""Goodfellas"" era. While stepping away from his traditional mobster and New York flavorings to tell this story about Boston police corruption, some of the more violent scenes, and even some of the environment panning clearly parallels, if not directly imitates classic moments from that prototypical masterpiece. What's worse is Scorsese's inability to change his musical palette when scoring these types of films, as half of the soundtrack also feels like a retread of the scenes he was trying to direct years before. Despite all of the noticeable unoriginality, The Departed still evolves into one of the most engaging guessing games in recent action memory, tightening the rungs around the paranoid plot line until we are all feeling the pressure. While some of the acting might not be academy-worthy, even the likes of Stiff Damon rose to the occasion to contribute to this classy thriller. Dicaprio provides a much needed boost to his sagging relevance as one of our finest young leads with his tense performance, while Nicholson once again shows that he has been done ""trying"" for some time now, and just gives the camera whatever it is he feels like giving it, which sadly is still way more engaging then most actors, despite his characters becoming way to silly. Ignoring desperate, idealistic preconceptions and bitter Scorsese fanboys who vow to get a genius his directing Oscar, The Departed is a very enjoyable, engaging, and fluid action thriller that will leave anyone with the slightest bit of testosterone feeling very satisfied."

"desire_turner","10","1","2","16 October 2006"," Scorsese's invasive camera sets the tone for...
","VERA FAMIGIA and LEO DICAPRIO in a bedroom scene that keeps us feeling as though we are invading their space. Scorsese accomplishes this effect with an invasive camera and the actors speaking quietly with low voices and closing in on LEO's psychological awakening degenerating into a sexual encounter with his therapist. I still feel that LEO's the protagonist in this film when asking for a cranberry juice, he seems as though he's trying to cut the female form for us and using his masculinity to pull it off at the same time. This created the dramatic need for VERA's character. I also feel favor towards the defense of his name being used only to explain himself to others, was a rejection to labels in society. Only MATT DAMON doesn't seem the type to need a label. I did not like that MATT had to play such an ordinary part. I think he deserves best supporting actor. It was so exciting to see the plot unravel to the Rolling STones soundtrack ""Your'e just a shot away"". It made an otherwise boring stupid scenario, seem envious and vengeful. I thought the the Director's intention with the cast showed that Scorsese deserves his reputation in cinema in that respect. Definitely an impressive film. Classic cinematography too! No, i'm not a homicidal ex only a paranoid fan. Here's to the auteur we all know and love."

The original and it's sequel (more accurately, the prequel) were two of the best Asian movies ever made.<br/><br/>Without making any comparisons to the original cast, I think Leonardo DiCaprio did a good job in this movie. Everyone else was their usual - Matt Damon's performance was a tad too Talented Mr Ripley for me, Mark Wahlberg was just his usual Four Brothers self. There was nothing notable about Alec Baldwin or Martin Sheen's characters.<br/><br/>Oh and Jack Nicholson can't be taken seriously acting that way. Really. <br/><br/>I did expect that changes would be made to the original, after all, Infernal Affairs contained too many Asian nuances to be universal, but I liked that what really happened was implied rather than shown. I feel that script was just too literal, and everything had to be played out. You hardly have the chance to feel the anguish anyone goes through, because they're yelling it all the time.<br/><br/>I guess the biggest problem I have with the The Departed is that everyone was a one-sided character. Besides maybe Leo Dicaprio's Billy. And that's just not how life is. The original movie really took the trouble to show that part of the characters. No one was truly honest, and no one was truly evil. And that's where The Departed failed.<br/><br/>Honestly I did expect a lot more from The Departed. Lots of big names were attached to it, and with a director like Martin Scorsese, you really expect to have your socks knocked off. I expected Cape Fear, or Goodfellas.<br/><br/>But alas. It was just an OK movie for me. I'll watch the original versions over this any day."

I left the theater thinking of The Bourne Supremacy, with it's twists and turns, and superlative ending and comparing this mish-mash I had just seen, leaving me feeling confused, and wondering why such an intriguing first half was totally debased, hacked up, and ruined by Tarantino theatrics, which are best done by him anyway.

It didn't explore the psyche of these people in the way that Goodfellas did, but as a popcorn thriller, it worked.<br/><br/>I didn't really like how the sound and picture were cut though.

After spending 2 hours in a edge-of-your-seat gripping thriller with magnificent performances by Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio (yes, him too! who would've thought that he could turn out such a powerful and gritty performance?), Matt Daemon (his usual performance, not unlike his performance in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"") and Mark Wahlberg, I expected the movie top live up to its potential right to the very end. It lived up to most of its potential through most of the movie except for the last 10-15 minutes.<br/><br/>Different movies treat violence and murder in different ways. Training Day (with Denzel Washington) does an incredible job of turning violence and murder into a powerful tool. In Departed, Martin Scorcese turns it into combination of gratuitous violence and otiose murder.<br/><br/>Martn Sheen and Alec Baldwin gave standard performances that did little to enrich the movie. They're extremely good actors who were horrendously underutilized.<br/><br/>What was Martin Scorcese thinking when he populated the film with a plethora of stars and when he filmed the ending? He either ran out of time or ran out of interest or ran out of thoughts. Or maybe he fell ill while filming the last part and designated an intern or a studio executive to finish it. In any case, at the end of the movie, you are left wondering ""Huh? Why? What was the point?"""
"alwonesm","6","1","2","13 October 2006"," Disappointed
","I expected more from this movie but after watching it yesterday now I know how great was the original ""internal affairs"". When I learned that Martin Scorsese was the director for this remake of Hong Kong's best selling detective movie I was so excited but was disappointed in the end . The ending was horrible does not make any sense. They try to make a drama into a comedy what a joke! The casting and acting was horrible too. Only Matt was pretty good in the movie the rest are ridiculous. In addition the tempo of the movie was so slow it seem like it was never going to end. The departed is one of the worse remake of all time. If you want to see a masterpiece watch ""internal affairs"" if you want to watch a comedy with sub par acting watch ""the departed"". I can not believe how they can mess up an excellent plot and come up with this rubbish."
"shermanchee","7","1","2","13 October 2006"," it is not as good as the original
","Frankly, speaking from a Chinese point of view, the departed is a pale comparison of the original. Even as many have pointed out, the entire movie is too long and draggy. What i think maintains its attractiveness, i.e. excites many people, is that they have not watched Infernal Affairs at all.<br/><br/>And indeed, plots like these are really refreshing, exciting and thus captures its audience. Those who have seen the original no doubt will be very much be less entertained by it.<br/><br/>I think the best thing about Infernal Affairs is that it really sets people thinking about the bad and the good, and how often the line drawn between them can be so vague. I don't think the departed succeeded in doing so though."
"lee_magee","7","1","2","12 October 2006"," Great film but some ""what the hell?"" moments
","I saw this with my best friend and have just read over 3 pages of comments. All praising or dissing the film based upon comparing it to Infernal Affairs.<br/><br/>For me none of that mattered, what I did find jarring was how uncomfortable most of the actors seem to be with expletives. Being half Irish and growing up in working class England, I just couldn't believe the dialogue. Whenever a character swore it sounded forced and unnatural - if you want to see what natural swearing sounds like rent Billy Elliot.<br/><br/>Also what the hell was Scorcese (an Italian) thinking, putting the song Scotland the Brave in a film about Irish mobsters? Does he know who the Irish and the Scots are? An Irishman is more likely to have Oh Danny Boy as his cellphone ringer than a protestant Scottish bagpipe song.<br/><br/>BTW Irish bagpipes just have a bladder you don't blow into them and Irish kilts are one colour beige not Tartan. Maybe these inconsistencies in Irish-American culture are to blame for Scorcese's blindness when picking out the music."
"jessg1020","10","1","2","11 October 2006"," my new favorite movie... seriously, it's that good
","Wow. Just wow.. and a good wow. Last night I finally went to see The Departed. I say ""finally"" because I've been dying to see it for weeks now. Typically when I get my hopes up this high for a movie, I end up being disappointed. Last night was different. As I sat in a run-down movie theater with about 80 other college students (on what is typically a HUGE bar night) I saw what is perhaps one of the best movies i have ever seen.<br/><br/>Let's start with the acting... it was incredible. I honestly had low expectations for Leonardo DiCaprio because, in my mind, after Romeo & Juliet and Titanic, I could never get the pretty boy image out of my head... until last night. He was incredible. From his depressed eyes to his witty comments, Leo stole the movie. But that's not to take anything away from Matt Damon who was an amazing counterpart and the brilliant Jack Nicholson in what was truly a great performance of a Irish mafia leader, one that even DiNero couldn't have done better...<br/><br/>i think what shocked me most about this film was that it was funny, i mean sure i expected some amusing lines, but The Departed was actually FUNNY... like laugh out loud funny... to make a film that has you on the edge of your seat yet also has you laughing out loud... now thats impressive... the story line was great, it didn't bore me for a second and for a 149 minute movie thats says something about the movie... basically I'm telling you to go see the movie... now. The Departed will absolutely blow your mind it's so good... i would recommend it to anyone... guys and girls of all ages and even people who typically don't like bloody movies (like me!) because it's THAT good...<br/><br/>If The Departed doesn't win an Oscar, I'm boycotting the show."

","This movie ROCKS!!!! It is the best film I have seen this year. All the performances were amazing. Mark Walberg stood out, and that is tough to do with this flawless group of actors, that did extraordinary jobs.This movie experience reminded me of how much I love going to the movies, but movies this high quality are rare now. The dialog was witty, funny and powerful. The story was suspenseful and intense. Not ONE dull moment, it took me an hour to calm down after. I was riveted by every performance, the actors blew me away....Every one of them. Martin Scoresse has done one of his best here. It is very violent, almost to much for me, but I squealed and looked the other way now and then, and i was able to hold on."
"sxylxyxx0","10","1","2","11 October 2006"," The best in a while...
","The last time I remember being this satisfied sitting in a movie theater was when I saw Mystic River. This great cast definitely lived up to my expectations. DiCaprio was stellar in every aspect of his performance, which was most likely not very easy when you are next to Nicholson. Walberg has once again separated himself from his previous years of underwear modeling, he is not just a pretty face. Damon was an unexpected choice for the rat but he pulled it off beautifully. Sheen was absolutely excellent, he played a great father character to DiCaprio. Even Baldwin who wasn't a huge role but made sure that you left remembering his performance. Of course Jack was off the charts oozing with sleaziness, but you can't help but still like the guy, he's that bad guy that everyone feared and loved in school. The dialogue was great and the nearly two and a half hours flew by and left me wanting more."

"gt-24","7","1","2","11 October 2006"," Goodfellas Hunting
","I walked in with mixed expectations. From friends, I heard it was awesome, ""up there with 'Heat' in my all-time top 5."" The trailer looked awesome. ""Goodfellas"" is obviously a masterpiece. But then I remember the bloated mess that ""Gangs of New York"" became.<br/><br/>The good: I'm not a Leo fan by any stretch, but I thought his performance was for the most part engaging and believable... Except there's no answer to the question of why he does what he does. Is it to clear the family name? Rid himself of his father and uncle's ghosts? Why go through all that? Matt Damon seemed like he was playing ""Will Hunting becomes a cop."" For the most part, believable. Alec Baldwin and Marky-Mark were solid as well.<br/><br/>Cinematography was great. I've always loved Scorsese's use of steadicam and dolly shots. Editing was good, sound was good.<br/><br/>The bad: Not for one minute did I believe the romantic relationship between Leo and the shrink. First, it wasn't set up, he was just sitting in her office, screaming about how he needed pills. Give me a line where he was ordered to see a psychologist, something... But out of the blue, there he is in her office. Next, he was asking her for coffee, and apparently she said yes. Would that ever happen?! I just didn't buy it. And gee, it sure is convenient that she's in a love triangle between the two main characters. Vera Farminga is beautiful, no doubt, and she sold the chemistry between her and Matt Damon. But her and Leo, I just didn't buy it. And the scenes with those two was so randomly interspersed. Their relationship was a crucial point to the film, and with it being non-credible like that, really a major hang up for me.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson has become a caricature. It was like an amalgam of the Joker and Melvin Udall. Is it acting? Or is he really crazy? Just a little too over-the-top.<br/><br/>And finally, Martin Sheen's Boston accent was Atrocious! One cut it's there, the next (even in the same scene) it's gone. Dropping a few R's does not a Boston accent make.<br/><br/>All that said the twist at the end was great and shocking, and while I could've done without the rat on the rail (just to make sure that we got the point), I liked the mildly ambiguous ending. Did Marky Mark get the information from the shrink and was avenging his police brethren? Was he another part of Costello's outfit? I prefer to think the former...<br/><br/>Overall, it's worth a look for some great performances. Just more suspension of disbelief is required than is the norm for films of this type."
"jeremydarnell","7","1","2","10 October 2006"," Flirts with 'classic' status, but comes up short
","Quick appraisal: Beginning is slow, middle is meaty and contains well-crafted scenes and performances, ending seems forced and intellectually lazy. Just seemed like Marty didn't no how to end this thing. Still worth seeing. I feel like Leo inhabits his role, Jack plays himself with deviant character wrinkles, Damon does a good job of being one of those conflicted, ethical dilemmas that have always been a hallmark of Marty's best work and Alec Baldwin continues to impress me. He is at his best when he is used as comic relief. Marky Mark is not great, but he, like Damon, gets points for being from Boston. Wahlberg is a damn good actor, even surprisingly so at times, but this character is largely one-dimensional. I know that's part of the plan, but I felt that it was an avoidable pitfall."
"azn_sky2001","8","1","2","10 October 2006"," Good Movie but a bit too much
","I happened to watch the movie on opening day. It's a very good movie since it was a remake of one of my favourite movies actually called ""Infernal Affairs"", which stars 1/4 of HK's heavenly kings (top idol) entertainer Andy Lau (Matt Damon's character) and Tony Leung (Leo's role). I loved the setting and the plot and how their facial expressions were dead on when they act out certain scenes. The cons? I did not however liked the fact that they only had 1 female lead since there are supposed to be 2 like the original but this had the 2 characters merged one person. I like how the actress portrayed herself but it didn't feel right. Another thing is that it felt too long as if they tried to combine all three of the movies into one."
"ALEXLOW72","8","1","2","10 October 2006"," The World Is Full Of Rats.
","BEFORE READING AHEAD PLEASE NOTE THIS COMMENT CONTAINS Spoilers !!! As a huge fan of the original Hong Kong Infernal Affairs I had my critic's eye firmly on place during The Departed. Frankly, I did not expect much from Scorsese who - with the exception of the wonderful The Aviator - has been on a downward spiral for many films. Imagine my surprise when The Departed impressed me, impressed me a lot. The story is very similar to the original film and despite my general hatred of Hollywood making a living remaking Asian films (PLEASE tell me no one is redoing the best film of the 21st Century Oldboy???) these days, The Departed is impressive on all counts. Scorsese's direction is masterful, DiCarpio just gets better and better with every film (Scorsese DeNiro of the Noughties?), the editing is Oscar winning and even Damon is bearable for this two and half hour gangster fest. Plus, who cares DeNiro could not do the part of Frank Costello, Nicholson is outstanding.<br/><br/>My only problem with the film is the ending. If you can get passed the very rushed last 20 minutes and even beyond the speedy demise of Damon who can forgive Scorsese for the final ""rat"" we see on screen? The final shot does not diminish a very good film but why oh why did he do that? I mean as if the audience didn't get the message that the world is full of rats by then! Come on Marty, tell us why?"
"parkblvd","8","1","2","10 October 2006"," well...
","The ending of this movie was so neat, Marky Mark was wearing booties.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Honestly. Amazing potential, a golden cast, incredible acting, a perfectly executed story, each scene so crafted, and then the ending wrapped it all up in such a contrived way. You could actually predict the last five minutes.<br/><br/>I am all about movies ending - no loose ends - but this ending was so planned... It just ruined the movie for me. The movie is an 8, but with a different finish, it would easily have been a 9.5. There is no bad acting in this movie at all. The overall culture is represented almost flawlessly, and each person plays a necessary role (save perhaps Alec Baldwin, but I like him a lot, so it was all good).<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese also seems to be stuck in a little bit of a genre rut. I can't blame him - he does movies like these very well - but you almost wish he would strike out and do something a bit less mob-oriented."
"bruddah_man_matt","10","1","2","9 October 2006"," Scorsese's Touches Give Us A Very Different Take On Infernal Affairs
","The first thing people need to realize about The Departed is that it is in fact a remake of a Hong Kong film called Infernal Affairs. Specifically the first film of a trilogy. The basic plot involves a mole in the police department and a mole in a gang. Both guys end up discovering that the other exists and that his job is now to flush him out before getting caught himself. An interesting premise that both films bring to the big screen in their own way. With that out of the way, let's look at Scorsese's latest.<br/><br/>Wow. Just wow. This film was simply incredible. I watched Infernal Affairs a few days before The premier of The Departed just to refresh my memory and all I can say is that the naysayers really have nothing bad to say about Scorsese's latest film IMO. He adds so many of his typical yet effective touches that The Departed in essence becomes it's own film. It really is Scorsese's if you ignore the fact that the basic plot elements were ripped from a Hong Kong film. This is a remake I am very glad Hollywood decided to do because it differs from the original so much that it effectively keeps the great elements of the original and mixes in more than a few new colors to give audiences an effectively brand new take on a 4 year old plot.<br/><br/>The original Infernal Affairs had a sort of dark crime/noir Michael Mann feel. Scorsese was smart and changed things up quite a bit by adding a lot of Boston flavor to the story. The A-list cast doesn't hurt either. The humorous one liners in The Departed really make this an American film. It differs so much from the original that it stands well on it's own two feet and the scenes that were shot for shot recreations from the original (like Damon pretending to be a lawyer or DiCaprio showing one of his buddies how to correctly spell a word) end up feeling more like homages rather than plagiarism.<br/><br/>Moving off of comparing these two films lets look at that A-list cast. This is the first time in a long time that ALL of the A-list actors signed here live up to their reputations. Jack Nicholson was terrific in this film. It's been a long time since he's played a bad guy but The Departed is proof that he still has it. Leonardo DiCaprio proves that he is a great actor in this film and if you still think he's nothing more than a pretty face after his performance here I don't know what movie you went to. Mark Whalberg reprises his bad mouthed, slick talking persona he introduced to us in The Italian Job and polished to perfection in Four Brothers. I also also impressed with Vera Farmiga who I was introduced to in Running Scared. Matt Damon, Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen also do very well in their respective roles. Then again it'd be hard for them to mess up with such great lines written for them.<br/><br/>I don't know who wrote these one liners but please promote the man or woman responsible for the dialogue in this film. The best way to describe the exchanges between characters here is ""honest."" The dialogue sounded genuine and real in that you know they'd be making fun of each other's Mamas in real life.<br/><br/>Scorsese hit the nail on the head with the score and the direction. He utilized his freeze frame action shots during a shootout that I really like and did a great job of making New York look like Boston. However certain scenes did feel a bit campy at times. When Sheen's character is killed I thought the manner in which he dropped in front of DiCaprio and the way the blood splattered was a bit cartoonish and campy. I think everyone kind of wanted to laugh but was too shocked from the scene preceding it which depicted Sheen falling through the air.<br/><br/>Aside from a few confusing (as in I didn't understand if Scorsese wanted me to be shocked or laugh) moments I was impressed. THIS is how to properly do a remake. Scorsese did alter the ending but I didn't mind too much. With the large differences in culture between America and China I felt that the ending to The Departed fit just as well to this version of the story as the original ending to Infernal Affairs fit the Hong Kong version. An excellent film and by far the best film I've seen this year. 10/10. I'd give it a 9.5/10 for being a remake but because it differs from the original so much and IMDb don't give out half points I'm rounding up here. Go watch this film as you will not be disappointed and then go rent the original and see how similar yet different the two are. Kudos to Scorsese for teaching Hollywood a thing or two about remakes and for making The Departed his own."
"hlmtvkid","10","1","2","9 October 2006"," A wonderful movie
","The Departed was by far one of the greatest movies I have seen in a very long time. This movie was just as good if not better than Goodfellas and Casino. Im not a huge fan of Leonardo Dicaprio but his part was excellent. The full cast was great. This is a must see for anyone who is a Scorsese fan. The movie packs constant action, and does not let you rest for a minute. Also from the beginning to the end Jack Nicholson plays one of the greatest villains I have seen for a while. The man plays the part perfectly and it goes completely with the movie. If I get the chance I will most likely see this future cult classic again."
"itsonlymehelen","9","1","2","9 October 2006"," Scorcese On Form
","The new offering from martin Scorcese sees him leave behind the historical sets of Gangs of New York and return to his roots with gangster flick The Departed. Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) has always wanted to be a cop and he's sent undercover by Massechutesses State Police to infiltrate Irish - American gangster Frank Costello's (Nicholson) mob. Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) has been groomed by Costello to be a mole from a young age and is now Costello's informant in the Special Investigations Department. The two contrasting moles while keeping their real agenda a secret go in search of each other.<br/><br/>The picture is unapologetically violent and depicts murder merely as a way of life, but in the midst of the guts an gore the film explores particularly in the case of Billy Cosigan living a life with an identity that isn't yours. Scorsese's latest muse Leonardo DiCaprio excels as the troubled cop horrified by the release he feels from indulging in the violent lifestyle he's being forced to lead. Despite a stellar cast of DiCaprio and Damon supported by Martin Sheen, Alec Bladwin and Mark Whalberg they are all overshadowed by Jack Nicholson as the seasoned actor goes from charming to one step short of the nut house in the toss of a coin. The one draw back to this film is it doesn't break any new ground in the gangster movie genre. Put that aside and this movie is intelligent, fast paced and unpredictable with Scorcese unquestionably at his best and with great turns from DiCaprio who off the back of The Aviator has left behind his pretty boy Titanic days and Matt Damon who's acting career is going from strength to strength. But this is without a doubt Jack Nicholson's movie."
"trogers-8","10","1","2","9 October 2006"," the real departed
","First of all everybody that is comparing this movie to Internal Affairs. This movie is based on true events in Boston during the last 30 years. These people actually existed and were even more violent than in the movie. The main character does not get kill and is still out there on the run somewhere. Matt Damon character get caught and goes to prison. Leonard character is still alive and well. And no police get throw from any buildings. So let just say that this is not based on any other movies. The movie was very well done the acting first rate. Jack character was the best i seen in a movie in a very long time. So see you around Whitey where ever you are."
"kellbone","7","1","2","9 October 2006"," Better than Goodfellas? What a bunch of B.S.
","This film is good but it's not great like earlier Scorsese, i.e.. Goodfellas, Mean Streets, TLTOC, or Taxi Driver. The characters are not fleshed out like Goodfellas. When I walked out of the theatre after seeing Goodfellas I actually felt like I knew Henry Hill, and Jimmy the Gent. If they finally give Marty his Oscar he should hand it back to them. This film was long, and not as well edited as Thelma's better work. The scene with the two priests and the nun was awkward, and the much anticipated ""Threesome Scene"" was cut to shreds, which ended up being Jack Nicholson throwing piles of cocaine into the air. It should have been cut completely. The scene where Colin Sullivan kills Frank Costello was spaced and paced all wrong. How far away from the police activity did these two wander? It didn't really matter because at that point of the film the Costello character was acting like a moron instead of a savvy mob boss. That scene was so contrived it was insulting to anybody with a lick of street sense. Did Costello really have to taste the drugs? So much of the dialog was redundant... There's a rat, are you the rat? No are you the rat? No are you the rat? Maybe he's the rat...<br/><br/>There were some great performances from all of the actors and some surprises, like the killing of Queenan and the protagonist Costigan. There should be best supporting nods for Ray Winstone and Martin Sheen and Best acting nods for Decaprio and Damon. It will get Best Director and Best Picture nom's and if it wins Best Picture, Brad Pitt will get an Oscar. How cool is that! It will get a best editing nom which it does not deserve.<br/><br/>Better than Goodfellas? Nope!"

","I've waited for 2 yrs to finally see this movie & it didn't disappoint. Being from the Boston area & also being a huge fan of Scorcese & his all-star cast for this movie, yeah I was a little excited.<br/><br/>The cast & acting was top-notch. The 1st hour & a half was sort of predictable, but still very interesting. Then everything changed. The characters I expected to face-off in the end started dying one by one. I never expected Leo to meet his fate so early. Leo's death was comparable to Joe Pesci's demise in Goodfellas. It was shocking & I wished both of them triumphed in the end. The killing didn't stop there. It continued right through the final scene which was perfect.<br/><br/>Looking back at this film a day later, all I can say is WoW !!! Great movie, it's about time a film lived up to the hype."
"jackmutz-1","8","1","2","9 October 2006"," The Lady Shrink
","Did I miss something?? Why was Billy seeing the police department shrink when he was so deep undercover. His appointments were in her office, out in the open. I had a hard time getting around this. I know they needed to provide a connection between Colin and Billy but this was weak. Undercover officers normally have no connection, however marginal, to the police force. Maybe Colin needed to be dating Billy's estranged sister? Or she could have been a bartender who befriended both of these guys? This was the only part of the film that I thought could have used changing. Nice to see DeCaprio finally maturing enough to play believable adult roles."
"TheQuietStorm","9","1","2","8 October 2006"," Scorsese's Best Directing Oscar... Finally...
","This was an intense, off the edge of your seat, runaway train of pure excitement about two police officers; one molded by the Irish mob (Damon) to be an inside probe in the police department and the other was molded by the police department (DiCaprio) to be an undercover in the same Irish mob.<br/><br/>The Irish mob was led by the extraordinary Jack Nicholson in one of his best performances since ""As Good As It Gets."" Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon both give great performances, as the stressed out, under appreciated police officers, playing opposite sides of the law and trying to do their jobs to satisfy the powers that be.<br/><br/>However, it was Scorcese's directing that brought this complex piece about the philosophies behind modern crime, the law and police corruption, that takes this piece to the next level. This has to be his best work since ""Goodfellas"" and I'm hoping that he receives a long, overdue Academy Award for Best Director.<br/><br/>The only reason why the film doesn't get a ten from me is because I had issues with the ending. I won't give it away. However, in my humble opinion, it was too easy for the characters played by Damon, DiCaprio and Mark Wahlberg, and it's contrivance eerily reflects the assumed angst by the writers to end a screenplay to a magnificently crafted, complex story. I'm sure the original film was the same way, so I'm critiquing the filmmakers behind ""Infernal Affairs"" for this as well.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it's still the best film I had seen all year thus far."
"hawki70","8","1","2","8 October 2006"," Overall an excellent movie ruined by the ending.
","This is one of the best movies I've seen in some time. I thought that the performance of Leonard DiCaprio was phenomenal, really exceptional. Matt Damon was, Matt Damon. Jack Nicholson was a perfect choice for this character. He played it with the right amount of malice and psychopathology. The dialog was witty, real, and engrossing,; the use of the Whitey Bulger background, etc. was a nice touch, and were it not for the final 30 seconds, this could be a 9 or 10. However, the departure from a comparable ending to ""Infernal Affairs"" for a non-ambiguous, ""righteous"" finality ruined this for me. It seems that American audiences require that justice be served or something. The ambiguity of the original is what made it such a great story."
"joestank15","8","1","2","8 October 2006"," Same problem as with ""The Aviator"". Scorcese won't take home the Oscar.
","The Departed - The Departed is set in South Boston, where the state police force is waging war on Irish-American organized crime. Young undercover cop Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) is assigned to infiltrate the mob syndicate run by gangland chief Frank Costello (Nicholson). While Billy quickly gains Costello's confidence, Colin Sullivan (Damon), a hardened young criminal who has infiltrated the police department as an informer for the syndicate, is rising to a position of power in the Special Investigation Unit.<br/><br/>First off, this movie has the usual strengths of a Scorcese film. Firstly, a strong performance from Dicaprio and downright brilliant performances from the supporters .In The Aviator it was Cate Blanchett, in The Departed it is Jack Nicholson. My god, the man has created such a chilling and funny villain that somehow avoids being over-the top. Believe it or not, I didn't loath him half as much as I hated Matt Damon's character Colin Sullivan. The man was such a weasely runt of a social climber that one couldn't help but hate him. The film also has strong support from Mark Wahlberg as a trash-talking sergeant, Martin Sheen as Captain Queenan, and Alec Baldwin in a serious movie for once (in the last few years) it seems.<br/><br/>The film also has a strong script and great camera work. The violence is sparingly used but effective. The film's drawback is Scorcese's continual mistake: He doesn't know when enough is enough. He gets too leisurely with the pace of his films, and doesn't know how to make me sit through them either. It wasn't as weary long as The Aviator, but I was still looking at my imaginary watch far too many times. The movie's two and a half hours long, but it felt even longer. People always lament that Scorzese never takes home The Best Film Award, and this is the reason: He continually turns in the A- film, but different people keep on turning in the A film each year.<br/><br/>A very good film, but I was happiest when The Departed finally departed. It gets an A-"
"dm-clark","9","1","2","8 October 2006"," Wahlberg Rocks
","Nicholson, Damon, DiCaprio, Baldwin, Sheen--all do their thing great, but not since Glengarry Glen Ross has an actor stepped into a scene and commanded everyone's full attention. Walhberg steals every scene he's in...how ironic he does it with Alec Baldwin standing there. Definitely best supporting actor this year! I was so happy to see that with such a large cast, everyone's screen time was meaningful to the story. Sometimes directors do not know how to do that well. With this film, Scorcese takes us to school and it is a great lesson I really appreciated.<br/><br/>Some of the editing was too abrupt, sometimes the quick music changes were too distracting.<br/><br/>Overall, a great cop and criminal story that should not be missed."

But many HKers find it disappointing as Departed did not bring out the marrow of the original -- both moles living in ""wo jin dao"" (the Chinese name of the original, meaning the lowest level of the hell) -- and lost the tension between the FOUR leading roles -- Ming (Billy in Departed), Yan (Colin), Sam (Costello) and Wong (missing character, the role is functionally shared by Martin Sheen and Mark Walhberg). Without these two elements, Departed, from my point of view, is only a good, entertaining, well performed movie.<br/><br/>The Departed has shortened the time that Billy was put in the gang (nine years in the original to one), weakening the complexity of Billy's situation that he may not be able to turn back to be a good guy. And it makes Colin's fast lifting career less logical.<br/><br/>After erasing Wong's role, the film just losses the ""cat"" in the ""cat catching mice"" game, leaving Costello an ordinary but crazy gang boss, while in the original, the interaction between Sam (Costello's role) and Wong is a very interesting line.<br/><br/>One more thing, about the micro chip scene, it just doesn't make sense that the Chinese speak Cantonese for such a deal by PRC agency. They should speak Mandarin!!! Cantonese is only used in Hong Kong, and part of the Guangdong Province!!! And if they really want to use Cantonese, please find somebodies that speak REAL Cantonese!!! What they are speaking is like English-accent Cantonese and every people in the cinema just cannot stop laughing at their tone. And the script is wrong in meaning too, such that ""fong de cheong"" (meaning put down the guns) was read as ""fong cheong"" (don't have such phase in Cantonese, but somewhat implies the meaning of ""to fire"")."

","Okay. The fact that this movie is a remake, and an AMAZING film is already well covered territory here by the time I'm writing this. I'm going to address the film's realism in relation to it's setting. I grew up in Boston. I love Boston, it will always be home, no matter where I live. I came up in a neighborhood pretty similar to the one depicted in the movie, and spent some time in that neighborhood (S. Boston). I've seen comments here (by others from the Boston area) implying that Boston isn't like the one depicted in the film. Well, maybe out in Wellesley, where you grew up, it isn't. I have NEVER seen a more accurate depiction of actual Bostonians in my life. The dialog between these guys is absolutely on the money, and never before have I ever seen it quite captured. Bostonians have a seemingly magical ability to express both love and hate in the same hilarious sentence in a way that I have never witnessed elsewhere. Aside from enjoying the film for it's MANY other virtues, it was like a three hour trip home. For that I am quite grateful.<br/><br/>Oh, I almost forgot. Dicaprio was BRILLIANT. I had serious doubts going in as to whether he could pull this off. Walking out of the theater, I was speechless. I absolutely, 100% bought him as a kid from Southie trying to do the right thing. I'll never doubt him as an actor again."

","Everything was perfect about this film except for the girl. I can't decide if it was poor casting, horrible acting or she just wasn't ready for this caliber film. Although her presence wasn't irritating enough for me not to enjoy this movie, it really made me question the professional opinion of who looked at her and thought... ""yes, she's perfect."" DiCaprio, Wahlberg, Damon, Nicholson & Baldwin gave masterful performances...even the supporting cast (with the exception of the girl) gave applause-worthy performance. Visually stunning. I expected nothing less from Scorscese. This film is the epitome of what film-making should be and it was long overdue from Hollywood. A film that makes you recall that film-making is an art-form. Although there were parts that made me cringe, I could respect their necessity and move on because I was thoroughly engaged in the rest of the film. I recommend that every true fan of films, film student, and respecter of fine art go see this movie and if you know Scorscese you know its not for the faint of heart think more Casino/Goodfellas/Raging Bull/Gangs of New York rather than Aviator or anything else he's done."
"Silver_Dollar","9","1","2","8 October 2006"," Scorsese is simply at the top of his game!
","When I heard Scorsese was remaking Internal Afairs, I thought he was reworking the 1990 Andy Garcia/Richard gere film which displays ho much I know ignorance of Hong Kong cinema. I must admit I have still not seen the original Hong Kong version, not because of any conscious decision but only because I was determined not to know anything the plot before I see Scorsese's film. The end result is simply explosive, and exhilarating cinema. Scorsese expertly handles the narrative, inter cutting between the two protagonists, one sent to infiltrate a vicious mob, and the other planted in the police force as an asset for syphoning information for the eccentric mob leader. The first half of the film builds slowly, as with Scorsese's films, taking it't time to unravel slowly and setting out the intricacies of the story and the character's various backgrounds. Nicholson is in eccentric mode as the boisterous gang leader Costello, but the hour belongs to Damon as Sullivan, the deceptively charming career orientated mole in the police department. Having said that, Di Caprio, perhaps shunning the weightier and more complex role of Sllivan, does a competent job at keeping a low profile as Costigan, the undercover police agent living on the edge.<br/><br/>The film, however, really comes alive in the second half, when Sullivan reaches the pinnacle of power in the police department and Costigan is on the verge of being revealed as the rat in Costello's gang. The film bears all the whole marks of the Scorsese's earlier work. Scorsese masters the camera like no other, and the editing is wizardry. However, one of the least talked about Scorsese talent, is the ability to select the right type of music track to set the tone of the film. I bet his record collection at home is to die for!"
"gaopeng0","7","1","2","7 October 2006"," good movie
","but not original. Scorsese simply adapted the plot of ""Mou gaan dou"", a Hong Kong Gangster movie of 2002. Down to the detail of the two guys hang out by the street joking about spotting cops. At the very beginning of the movie they gave a bit of credit to Media Asia. Overall a great adaption, I think most people went to see Jack Nicholson. Leonardo DeCaprio's best act so far. As it doesn't make sense for most people to seek out the original movie, go watch this one. Personally I think the original one has a more developed plot. This one was rushed a bit at the end. Farmiga's role was somehow confusing. But well, didn't go in to see Analyze that."

","Although it was a bit long, I found the movie extremely entertaining. Amazing directing, writing, casting and acting !! And there were some great comedy lines...in fact, from a comedy standpoint, Alec Baldwin stole the show. I laughed my ass off at some of his lines. Of course a close second was Nicolson. Highly recommended, but you better be ready for some true Scorcese-style violence !! Nicolson was excellent. DiCaprio was excellent. Baldwin was excellent. Walberg was good. Damen was not annoying. The music was very good, but I prefer the original version of Dark Side of the Moon (Floyd). I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves Nicolson, Baldwin, or DiCaprio."
"grrybear","10","1","2","7 October 2006"," Yay! Another Leo Movie to See!
","I am surprised I liked this movie as much as I did. Well, I thought it was very well written, and funny--badly funny, like why am I laughing at jokes like this kind of funny, because it's such a dark movie.<br/><br/>When I found out that Leonardo DiCaprio was going to be working with Jack Nicholson I was so happy for him. I figured he would be excited at the chance, so I was excited for him. He held his own and he has a lot to be proud of, but why wouldn't he do well? He's one of the few talented actors out there worth paying $9.75 to see.<br/><br/>When I saw that Mark Wahlberg was in this movie, with Leonardo DiCaprio, all I was thinking of was the movie Basketball Diaries. They haven't worked together since then. I was pleasantly surprised to see the two working together again.<br/><br/>If you can call this a spoiler to the movie, here it is: The movie is very violent and bloody, but that's Martin Scorsese for you--it's not like I went in expecting Mary Had a Little Lamb or anything. If you see this movie, just remember, it's not for the faint of heart. At nearly the end of the movie, I gasped and put my hand up to my face, but there were a lot of times I could have done the same thing."
"Anthonysbignob","10","1","2","7 October 2006"," Irish GoodFellas?
","I've heard a lot of people say that this movie is like an Irish Goodfellas, but thats only because of the level of violence, which is comparable. I would say that The Departed is a better story. The juxtaposition between the two main characters, Damon and Dicaprio,is something that I've never seen done as well before. To top it off Jack Nicholson plays a great psychotic villain (for want of a better term). The cast is rounded out by Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin, who play their characters amazingly. The big surprise was Whalberg for me. I can never really buy his acting when he's trying to be a tough guy but in this case he knocks it out of the park. Like all Scorsese the sound track is excellent and the violence is jarring, in a real good way. I highly recommend it. I think it is a better movie than goodfellas, but I doubt The Departed will get the classic praise which GoodFellas did."
"gardsmith","10","1","2","7 October 2006"," Incredible Movie
","This movie has Oscar written all over it. I had to go to the restroom so bad but was afraid to leave my seat for fear of missing something. This was the most thought provoking, intriguing film that I've seen in years. It's a movie you can't quite figure out, there are so many twist and turns. One minute you think you go it and boom you are dead wrong. Top notch actors are in the film and what can you say about Nicholson, his performance is outstanding. I usually don't care that much about DiCaprio, but he even impressed me with his performance. Scorsese has outdone himself with this one. I have told everybody I know that love movies to go see Departed. I plan to go see it again, its just that good!"
"beatnik_92","9","1","2","6 October 2006"," Fantastic film
","This movie is spectacular, in almost everything it does. The script is solid, the acting is good, action and suspense is tense. This movie is packed with scenes that will make you go WTF! Everything from Nicholson's over the top psycho mob boss, to Mark Walhberg excessive use of expletives to further his point in the movie.<br/><br/>Previous to this movie I regard Dicaprio as an over actor whose career wouldn't go farther then it has already. He was okay in Gangs of New York, but he was horrid in Titanic and Romeo & Juliet. In this film he plays his part just right. He offers the right amount of tense anxiety, mixed with despair, to puncture a hole in your senses and make you feel for the character, constantly fearing that he will be discovered. Matt Damon plays his part well to, but not as well as Dicaprio. He plays his paranoid undercover mobster role with a sense of panic that fills the viewer with a sense of despise for his character. Nicholson, the main villain plays it just how you would imagine, trust me when I say that is a good thing. He brings his acting to such a point that you think that he is insane. You despise him through the movie but you cannot truly hate him because he brings a charm and sophisticated insanity to his roll others would be hard pressed to do. Wahlberg, Sheen, Baldwin, and Farmiga also do a great job to support the leading cast with each character bringing the right amount of emotion to the screen. But special nods go to Anthony Anderson, who may have just broken out of his lame phase with bad action films (Exit Wounds anyone).<br/><br/>Frankly this film is bound for the Oscars with at least three possible nominations for supporting actor.<br/><br/>Definitely go check this out, you will thank your self for doing this."

","Can you say ""piss poor"" in a review?
Here we have an infiltrator into a gang organisation on one side and the plant in the police department on the other.
Not a bad premise, but so ineptly put together that neither side could discover the villain without the help of audience.
Phony Boston accents, ham acting, very poor plot line and too much reliance on expletives. I usually like swearing in a movie but in this one it was just used to cover script deficiencies.
To say that it is a mediocre film is being too free with compliments.<br/><br/>Put up a few big names and you've got a hit right?<br/><br/>Wrong.<br/><br/>This was a bummer right from the getgo ; Nicholson mailed in his performance, Winstone completely miscast, DeCaprio OK and what'sisface Damon only marginally better.
The trouble with Mr Wahlberg is that you can't tell whether or not it's actually him, a cardboard cutout or a CGI. It doesn't really matter because none of the three do anything to improve the project.<br/><br/>
Sheen was pathetic and his Boston accent was like a cinder caught under a door.(the other attempts at Boston accents weren't much better, only Matt Damon's was real .. and even though he grew up there it was exaggerated to match the other speech-coached ""Siri"" effect)<br/><br/>As for the plot, gimme a freakin' break will ya. If either side couldn't find the rat in the first five minutes, then neither the police nor the gangsters deserved to hold down their jobs.<br/><br/>A waste of time and money, you could make a better movie with your iphone<br/><br/>At least it's a new genre... crime mush"

"dead47548","9","2","7","15 December 2007"," Phenomenal.
","Even through about ten viewings, The Departed manages to be a highly engaging, suspenseful and thrilling film that's easily one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen. Scorsese creates an entire ensemble of interesting (some more so than others) characters that make every second just as fun and enthralling as the rest. When we switch from Costigan to Sullivan it never loses or gains entertainment value and its steady level is higher than practically any other film around. There's a wonderful mix of humor involved as well, coming primarily from Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin and Jack Nicholson (more in the character's reactions to Nicholson than the man himself). Everyone in the cast is brilliant from DiCaprio and Damon all the way down to Alec Baldwin and Ray Winstone (though I've never been too big on Vera Farmiga and thought she was a thousand times better in that year's Running Scared).<br/><br/>In my first viewings of The Departed, I knew it was wildly entertaining but I always thought it was a little shallow and the characters lacked depth. But this viewing helped me see that what I originally thought was a thrilling story of undercover deception is really an intricate study of the loneliness and mental breakdown that occurs when you decide to live a lie. As William Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) delve further into their life of being an undercover criminal and an undercover cop, respectively, they become so much more lonely and their psyche continually falls apart. While these two character's lives are polar opposites, they are quite similar at their center. They are both morally decent men who live a life of crime for unfortunate reasons; Costigan obviously because he is an undercover cop but Sullivan seems to be a good man at his heart but lives his life of deception out of loyalty to Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) who was always a surrogate father to him after he lost his own. Of course they do have their contrasts which I thought came primarily in their way of making decisions. Costigan is indecisive, paranoid and is never confident in his decisions but Sullivan has snap reflexes and can make an insanely tough decision in a second with no hesitation. But in the end they are more similar than they are different; they even have romantic interest in the same woman. Ultimately it's their loneliness that links these two men; which Scorsese beautifully shows in the shots of Sullivan sitting in his office alone in the dark having to live with the horrific decisions he's made in his life (further proof that he's a morally decent man unlike the purely evil Frank who shoots a woman dead and his only remark is that she fell funny).<br/><br/>So while the film is still probably the most entertaining I've ever seen and is stylish, fun and completely enthralling my original belief that it was hollow was quite incorrect. It's a remarkable study of the toll that a life of lies can take on a person and is highlighted by two phenomenal performances that perfectly immerse into these characters. In fact every actor fits perfectly into his character. It never feels like you're watching Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin but you're watching the characters unfold this story. Even in ten viewings it still manages to be completely suspenseful (Damon and DiCaprio sitting silently on the phone with each other, both knowing that the person on the other side is the rat, still had me holding my breath) and wildly entertaining. There's never a dull moment in this magnificent picture that I love more and more every time I see it, and that love was significantly increased in this viewing. I don't think any words can do the story justice, but there is so much depth and intricacy in there that I never saw before. And of course William Monahan does a perfect job of adapting the originally Asian story into the streets and people of Boston. Amazing in every way."

","This film is not in any way up the standards of him magnum opus ""Goodfellas"" or even that early gem ""Mean Streets"". What we got here is a very nasty, vicious and gruesome film with a musical-chairs killing ending that rivals the final scenes of ""Taxi Driver"". The only bit of authenticity, aside from the Boston location, and I live West of Boston, is the accent of Costello's mistress: all of the other principles are too polished in their speech and mannerisms to give much credibility to the film, which was not the case with ""Mean Streets"", but then again the director comes from NYC and was cognizant of the subtle characteristics that lend credence to the work. I could go on like this but will end my comment by saying that my opinion is that the Academy felt compelled to reward this piece of dreck because they felt guilty at not bestowing awards on ""Goodfellas"", a justly-deserved masterpiece."
"sullibrandon","9","2","7","27 February 2007"," Brilliant, Gripping Crime Drama
","The Godfather. Goodfellas. LA Confidential. Pulp Fiction. Scarface. These movies stand tall among the greatest gangster dramas ever made. Each of them features a gripping story, complex characters, and a memorable tale of intricate passion and power. The Departed will take its place among these greats and stands tall as Martin Scorcese's greatest achievement yet.<br/><br/>There is a rather large cast in The Departed, but if it were to be boiled down to three main protagonists, they would be Billy Costigan, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, Colin Sullivan, played by Matt Damon, and Frank Costello, played by Jack Nicholson. Costello is a rich, powerful, Irish mob boss. Costigan is an undercover cop who wheedles his way into Costello's inner circle, which includes an undercover gangster working in the police department, Sullivan. The Departed follows the investigation into Costello's mob work, Sullivan's interplay with Costello, and Costigan's growing guilt and inner torture over the things he must do and see as an undercover cop.<br/><br/>One the The Departed finest aspects is the stellar acting from virtually every member of the all-star cast. Leonardo DiCaprio turns in one of the most impressive performances of his already impressive career. He portrays the tortured Billy Costigan to perfection. Matt Damon continues his unbroken string of masterful performances as Costello's mole in the police. Unfortunately, Jack Nicholson turns in one of the most disgustingly over-the-top performances I had seen in awhile. It looks like he's begging for an Oscar with the way he tries to come across, but all that I kept on seeing was Jack Nicholson playing himself. What could have been a deep and complex character turns into nothing more than showboating at its worst. The character he plays is complex enough, but Nicholson does not give it nearly enough justice. Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen all turn in their own noteworthy performances, most of all Wahlberg, and though he doesn't get much screen time, still manages to portray his character to its full depth and potential. Alec Baldwin's role is almost funny in how close it comes to self-parody, and Martin Sheen plays the head investigator Queenan with a serious fun Character is another impressive aspect of The Departed. Every last character is fleshed out, full, complex, and detailed. The closest thing that any character comes to one-dimensional is the cop psychologist, Matt Damon's love interest. She is supposed to be this amazingly brilliant woman, but she just comes across as irrational and careless as she eagerly dives into dangerous relationships and situations right and left. Aside from her, though, the other characters are sketched out perfectly. Ellerby, Dignam, and Queenan (Baldwin, Wahlberg, and Sheen), though secondary characters, still feel like completely real people. Damon's character of Sullivan is wonderfully drawn. Costello, as I already mentioned, is almost ruined by Jack Nicholson, but he still manages to shine a bit of his complexity through the ruinous vehicle of Nicholson. Most interesting is Dicaprio's multi-dimensional Costigan, who is the most interesting and multi-faceted character I have seen in a film in a long time. He's not the typical cop who's feeling guilty over coming dangerously close to becoming a criminal. He is this and so much more and the huge complexity of his character could easily have been fumbled by a lesser actor than DiCaprio. It's beautifully pulled off, though.<br/><br/>The intricate interplay of characters and the complex twists and turns in the film are another hallmark of its greatness. This is not some straightforward crime drama. There will be surprises. There will be twists. But more than this, everything, all these aspects, all work together to grab us in at the outset and to never let go. The storyline is positively riveting in its intensity and uncompromising vision of the dark underworld of crime. We have seen this before in films, portrayed especially wonderfully in the films mentioned above, and The Departed is no less great or capable than those others. At two hours and twenty minutes, it doesn't even stretch its waistline or overstay its welcome. It's just the right length. Usually any movie that goes over two hours overstays its welcome plenty, but The Departed is a notable exception. It is a very clean, streamlined movie. This being said, though, it is not a perfect one.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson's performance drags the whole show down more than any one aspect. If it hadn't been for him, the film could have been so much better. The character of Madolyn comes across as two clear and one-dimensional in comparison to the rest of the cast. Besides this, though, Scorcese seems preoccupied with all the horror and evil that goes on in this world, while never really focusing in on the good. He touches on it in brief tender moments between Costigan and Madolyn and Sullivan and Madolyn, but he never focuses there. Scorcese obviously prefers to show us the brutality and debauchery of this world, which is fine if that is his vision for the film. A more clean and hopeful view, though, could have helped the bleakness a little.<br/><br/>Fine performances have always been the hallmark of greatness in films. The cast of the Departed is one of the best to come along in a long while. (If it weren't for that darn Jack!!) Its storyline is not simplistic or overly violent for the sake of violence. Everything, every line, every action, every moment serves a purpose and serves to drive the vehicle of the film forward. The gripping, dark score does its part well in this as well. The complex and multi-faceted characters interacting and clashing on screen have been some of the most real and fleshed-out characters that I have ever seen on celluloid. True, it has its flaws, but as a gangster crime drama thriller, these days, it really has no equal."

","I enjoyed this movie for all the reasons everyone else did, so I won't list all that was good about it. However, I did feel the plot had one major flaw, which made the film less enjoyable: If the cops had been following Jack Nicholson and his crew for years, how is it that they had no idea who Matt Damon was? How could they have not known of his existence way before he even ever joined the police force? Since the whole premise of the film was for Leo and Matt Damon to find each other, it seemed a bit ludicrous that they wouldn't know who Matt Damon was to begin with. If anyone has a good explanation for this, I would be happy to hear it. Other than this one thing, it's still a great movie."

I wants't even too impressed with ""Infernal Affairs"", but I thought it was a lot better than ""the Departed"". Personally, I think ""Infernal Affairs 2"" was the best of the 3 ""Infernal Affairs"" series. I recommend people to the 3 ""Infernal Affairs"" movie before judging how ""good"" this movie is. Unlike ""Good Fellas"" this movie isn't original nor is it based on a true story. Peronally I would give this movie a 3/10 if it wasn't for the fact a awful remake of ""Infernal Affair"".

"dwood-4","6","2","7","9 October 2006"," Not that significant
","Being out of the country at the moment I hadn't been inundated with the hype of this movie (which I think is a good thing). It was a Martin Scorsese movie following the irish mob and corrupt police: my probable expectation was a focus on extreme depravity and violence.<br/><br/>Boy was I right. The violence was extremely graphic and I believe distracted from the story which I thought was of a semi first rate b movie quality. It was entertaining, don't get me wrong. The acting was exceptional, including the (usually ridiculously over done) late age Jack Nicholson, the (usually adolescent) Leonardo Dicaprio and the rapper turned ""actor"" Mark Wahlberg. Even Alec Baldwin showed up to make some wise cracks which I thought lent the movie it's b quality qualities (are b movies worthless ? I don't really think so). The movie crackled with an energy and I have to admit I did not look at my watch until about the second hour of the movie (which usually for me means I have been thoroughly entertained).<br/><br/>The bad part of it is of course the violence, which I feel Scorsese must love to portray, because his movies are sadistically concentrated on graphic acts of violence. Why this is and why he loves violence so much is probably more for his psychiatrist to figure out (if he is seeing one, which I think he should be). The fact that so many people are lavishing praise on this movie and ranking this as the 161st best movie EVER MADE is probably a sign that the apocalypse is upon us. I do not think a society desensitized to violence is really that great of a sign. The head shots to the various unlucky people were out in the open and not disguised at all, nothing was cut away. Was he hoping to make a statement about how disgusting violence is ? Didn't translate to me if he was.<br/><br/>Anyhow, the movie was silly and there were many unintentional laughs, one being the secret dealing with Chinese terrorists. The movie was completely over the top and wholly, insignificant. I know Scorsese has rarely deals with deep issues in his movies (other than alienation in Taxi Driver), but I think he is a great film director and should probably try dealing with more ""internal"" issues (and I don't mean internal organs of people blowing against the wall)."

"zesty109","6","2","8","21 March 2008"," Simply put, a Hollywood rip-off of Infernal Affairs
","I must admit, I saw this movie before I saw the original - 'Infernal Affairs' - and thought it was good. Mainly, I thought that the plot was very interesting and unique. I never really thought that this film needed so much swearing and gore to make it good, but in Hollywood, those two things are the only reasons why people watch films. However,once I watched the original version - 'Infernal Affairs' - I was really turned off to The Departed for a number of reasons.<br/><br/>1. The Departed literally took the script from Infernal Affairs and stuck a bunch of big-name Hollywood actors in it, but kept everything else the exact same. I would say about 80% of the movie was simply regurgitated from the original (including some of the actual lines), and I thought that was d tacky and disrespectful on the part of Scorsese. I would expect more from a film maker of his caliber.<br/><br/>2. The script here is so rushed and unrealistic. Unlike in Infernal Affairs (were the movie is stretched out over 10 years), The Departed takes place over what appears to be a few months to a year. What is so stupid about this is that we are lead to believe that a mole was able to work his way from a nobody newbie in a mafia gang, to the Boss's second hand man in that short of a time. All I have to say about that is 'bull sh*t'. That would NEVER happen, and everyone knows that.<br/><br/>3. I didn't buy into all the over-the-top characters in the Departed. It is like all of the actors thought they were the lead role, and nobody was willing to take a supporting cast. This leads to constant theatrical rants and over acting by most of the cast.<br/><br/>4. The characters were too white and black. The good guys were cliché good guys, and the bad guys were cliché bad guys. In Infernal Affairs, the moles from either side show their good and bad sides, and struggle to figure out who they really are.<br/><br/>5. The cinematography is nothing special, and compared to some of the scenes from Infernal Affairs, it sucks. The scene from IF on the rooftop at the end is amazing.<br/><br/>6. Again, I am just going to say how disgusted I am at how unoriginal this movie is, and ask people to watch Infernal Affairs instead.<br/><br/>On a positive note, the one thing I did prefer in The Departed over the original was the amount of character development that was done (however at times, that was even too much). Personally, I would have liked to see a bit more of that in Infernal Affairs.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, just watch Infernal Affairs. You may not know the actors, there may not be the amount of character development and a couple of the lines may seem slightly cheesy (only the ones between the moles and their lovers), but at least you will be watching the original film and not some Hollywood knock-off."
"jse126","4","2","8","1 March 2007"," Scorcese gets his Oscar - for this?
","The Departed not a horrible film and that's the best thing that I can say about it. It was instantly forgettable. As soon as it ended, I felt about the same as if I had just watched a rerun of ""Family Ties."" It was a sterile, by the numbers film that featured phoned-in performances from everyone. DiCaprio was probably the best but there was not much there with him either. Jack was just unshaven, ugly old Jack being Jack the mobster. I didn't get much depth from the character, at the most I felt that he had been doing what he was doing for so long that he was locked into it and didn't much care anymore. But the whole plot line of the two kids from Costello's neighborhood and the paths that they took - and the initial uncertainty of which was which - was very much underplayed and subtle to the point of not being the strong plot device that it should have been. As far as Matt Damon, I can only say that he sucked. Sorry but that's all that I can think of to say. Bland, boring, a true flatliner. He and Affleck made their names on one overrated film and now they are in my opinion a major factor for the dullness of Hollywood these days. I wish that ""Good Will Hunting"" had been mistakenly put into the shredder before anyone ever saw it, but what are you gonna do...<br/><br/>This is a by the numbers Scorcese film without the fire. It's no ""Goodfellas"" - it's nowhere near being in the same conversation otherwise. Where Goodfellas was chock full of memorable lines, and left a dramatic impression on you after the film ended that lasted and lasted, this film has not one line that I can recall, hardly a scene, and left no impression - in fact it was overlong in its dullness and I was glad when it was over. And unlike the riveting Goodfellas, it took me three separate viewings to get through this.<br/><br/>I think that Hollywood felt that it owed the guy his gold piece - it did - and wanted to get it to him before he had to get an Irving Thalberg. Feel free to skip this one, secure in the knowledge that you are not missing anything."

I usually can tolerate vulgar language if it serves to advance the plot or to add to a characters portrayal. But this movie was excessive in everything it did. I hope that isn't considered a 'spoiler'. But what is even more annoying is that the plot could have been quite good - if it had been handled differently. Actors like Nicholsen, De Capprio and Damon should be ashamed to be associated with it. Trust me, the next time I see Martin Scorcese's name as director, then that will be the film I WILL NOT SEE."

Not since Casino have we seen crafty camera-work and not since Goodfellas have we seen the twists and turns of a great gangster movie. What Shakespeare did for the theater, Scorses does for the movies. If they snub him again at the Oscars, it is truly a crime against movie society. Jack Nicholson is back in ""Jack"" form. He has abandoned the feel good roles and makes the moviegoer actually feel good about their lives. Matt Damon returns to his Boston roots and once again captivates audiences as he did in Good Will Hunting.

And now we know as we see him back in his comfort zone with ""The Departed"". The Departed is an intricate tale that is edited to perfection and directed beyond belief. And lets not forget the unbelievable cast. Leo has taken the step from pop pretty boy, to stone cold bad ass. Matt Damon also rose to the occasion bringing an angry, urbane, presence to the screen. And of course, the showstopper, Jack Nicholson giving a performance worth of the Best Supporting Actor nomination. Will it finally be Martin's year, unfortunately i don't think so, but when you can make a movie that gets critical acclaim, makes you want even more, and destined to be a crime classic, the Oscar doesn't seem to be that big a deal. All hail the return of martin Scorsese."

","Not horrible, but certainly overrated. The acting was over the top. Like caricatures.<br/><br/>They didn't need the love story. Totally unnecessary and slowed down the movie and they could have cut 45 minutes and made it better. Not every movie needs a love story.<br/><br/>Their behavior was dead giveaway. I mean, seriously, when Leonardo was supposed to pretend he wasn't bother but his face said the total opposite. I hate when actors are supposed to make other characters believe them but they play the opposite, with guilty faces.<br/><br/>And maybe it's just me but the editing was way too jarring and sometimes I don't mind too much in Scorsese's movies, but this one was just too obvious.<br/><br/>You don't have to be a genius to figure out some of these people are playing both sides. Unless the cops and crooks are so dumb here, which they wouldn't be in real life. How did they not figure out it was Leonardo sooner? The fact they wanted to bring him in at first was not believable. It was like everyone knew each other but they were all so dumb they couldn't figure out what each other did.<br/><br/>They KNEW Leonardo was a cop before they took him in. They knew there was an informant, but they were too dumb to suspect him, but rather others who have been with them for decades. Really? This was like dumb and dumber cops.<br/><br/>Cops see all the gangsters go in the building but they don't follow. It was ridiculous. They are looking for rats and everyone seem to act so suspiciously. Matt Damon is just a bad actor. Leonardo acted suspiciously the whole time. It was one blunder after the other. Irish guy who got shot KNEW it was Leonardo and yet he didn't tell anyone, except Leonardo.<br/><br/>It was painful to watch. Nothing made any sense."

My father was a career sailor who could use expletives with the best of them, yet I never heard such a barrage of gratuitous cussing when his Navy pals gathered at the house. I once told my students in New Jersey that people who use explicits are simply revealing that they are limited in their grasp of the English language.<br/><br/>In summary: good storyline, good acting (probably Academy Award nomination for Jack), and the excessive brutality and crude language (I assume to supply realism) detracted from the movie (too much; distracting, almost tiring)."
"MovieAddict2016","9","2","9","1 December 2006"," One of the year's best films, and Scorsese's best work in over a decade.
","Not just one of the year's best films, but also Martin Scorsese's best work in over a decade, The Departed is a vintage slice of the director's style infused with a modern edge.<br/><br/>A loose remake of the Hong Kong three-part thriller Internal Affairs, The Departed is hardly an inferior Hollywood copy; Scorsese takes the material and makes it entirely his own. Opening with a classy flashback and then leaping forward with a ferocious act of violence on-screen, this is as well paced and energetic as anything Scorsese has done in well over a decade; not since Casino has he made something so fresh and riveting.<br/><br/>The movie, which takes place in Boston, features an interweaving story headlined by a stellar cast. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a troubled cop who goes deep undercover to bring down notorious mobster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), who has control of the police force through several moles; one of whom (played by Matt Damon) begins to suspect someone in Frank's operation is a rat. As he races to expose Billy, he loses the affection of his girlfriend, who begins to  oddly enough  embark on an affair with Billy (she's a police psychiatrist). Supporting castmembers include Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg in his best performance since Boogie Nights.<br/><br/>The plot twists and turns so many times yet never becomes pretentious or overly deliberate; it all seems to connect very naturally, and perhaps the only portion of the film that I didn't quite buy was the romantic subplot, which would have worked if it had focused solely on Damon's tensions with his girlfriend, but became fairly unbelievable once she begins cheating on him with DiCaprio's character.<br/><br/>The performances are extraordinary  Jack Nicholson has a lot of fun with his role and comes across as a psychopathic comedian trapped in a mob boss' body. DiCaprio is riveting and delivers the most convincing performance of them all  evoking a young De Niro towards the end of the picture in both mannerisms and physicality.<br/><br/>Directorially this is Scorsese's strongest effort in years, and it shows in every frame of the picture. It may not be groundbreaking and it may not be as socially relevant as some of the director's best works, but as pure entertainment this ranks as some of his finest to date."

","The Departed is a U.S. cop policeman film. The film tells the story of the lives and choices of two police officers with different positions. In the two main lines, they also intertwined the two protagonists' pre character history and development context. They also discussed the internal relations of the U.S. police agencies and corruption issues, Gangster Castro's criminal problems and gang members and many other sub-lines. The director boldly expanded the film's space-time structure, staggered, pulled away, and then stitched it to create a multi-line ""three-dimensional clip"" structure that uses a combination of parallel, The narrative style of the perfect combination of each, firmly in control of the narrative rhythm of the film, and to sort it out in an orderly manner, without affecting the natural smoothness of the screen, so that the audience easy to accept and understand.<br/><br/>    Throughout the narrative process, through the use of post- editing, parallel montage, montage processing is very natural and smooth, making the relationship between the characters in the story seems to have become more direct and simple, showing the effect of a very place, is a technology Very skilled example.<br/><br/>    The film began with the theme of Colin's autobiographical narrative, the lens leads to the number one American gangster Castro, as Colin accepted gangster favor and baptism, became gangster Castro's The use of tools, admitted to school, become Costello in the police force undercover. Bill, another protagonist, has a rather complicated background. His uncle is a well-known gangster. His father is more honest. As a result of being killed by triads, he wants to become a police officer to avenge himself and therefore enters the police academy. The film narrates the two people's learning process in the police academy in the form of parallel montages. In the police academy, both of them are assigned to a like- minded supporting police school classmates, Colin is equipped with a beginning to ask him to eat classmates, Bill is accompanied by a black fat students. The appearance of these shots, but also for the final outcome of the movie paved the way. That is, the two classmates buried the two protagonists in a group-like manner.<br/><br/>    After graduating from the police school, both Colin and Bill almost passed the different fate of the last police officer. Colin accepted the first shot assigned to the police, a vision, account of the characters in the room. Followed by several sets of close-range dialogue lens, which is some of the boss to Colin asked and placed. Then use a Bill's subjective lens to transition the screen. That is to say during the Colin interview, Bill looked down at the entrance to the interview looking at his own foot. When Colin smugly out of the sheriff's office and greet the secretary, Bill looked upstairs to greet him in the front desk. There was an ups and downs here first in Bill, and then the camera swung to Colin and came out of the open door, then the camera moved along with Colin and put Bill in the picture to make a contrast. When Bill went in, it was also a panoramic shot, followed by several sets of conversation shots. The entire clip is smooth and smooth, without much rendering and decoration, but more by the lens and the montage way to show the difference between the two fates, that is, just a few minutes before and after the difference between the two people led to a different future .<br/><br/>     Then, Colin stepped into his newly allocated apartment, in front of the church was once baptized, he slowly whispering in his own language across the quiet Colin vacant balcony on the balcony, and Bill now accept the new police officer Open salaries and accounts, to drink with his relatives to the pub, to discuss the violence in the neighborhood, to accept the blockbuster defiance of the street, in the hope of approaching Castro in order to get his trust. Since then, the film's clips are almost always used to compare montage approach to describe the whereabouts of two people, but also by comparing montage performance techniques to describe how the two step by step, to their respective superiors to promote and trust. In addition, the comparison lens also tells the dark contest between two people for the same thing. In the film, for the simplicity of narration, the heroine becomes a psychiatrist and becomes Colin and Bill from beginning to end they have no real understanding until the last confrontation between life and death. This narrative style emphasizes the fate of the two men Wrong and chance.<br/><br/>     The film has created a rich character image. Colin is a careful, suspicious, hand-ruthless character. Through some details of the lens to reflect his cautious work. He can become FBI informant in his own right, which is why he can go unpunished. Therefore, this role more than a domineering and brutal. And Bill's heart is kind and honest. Two people's personality just complementary, one publicity, a calm. Therefore, when the calm was killed, publicity finally killed. In addition, the film on the handling of violence is also straightforward and bloody, without any hiding, without any sensationalism. What it presents to us is a black and white, jungle world. Gangsters ruthless, the police are cruel, everything is subject to the law of survival of the strong king. Whether it is light color, or scheduling clips, are deliberately low-key, low-key to the level of unobtrusiveness. Clips are also used in parallel contrast, contrast with parallel shadow, with the most flat view and recording, neither deliberately exaggerated, nor deliberate to create elegant."

","By far one of the greatest movies of all time. If you like mob/dirty cop movies you'll love this. I remember watching it for the first time when I was 18 and I've probably watched it 20 times since then. I'd probably watch it 20 more times too! This movie is a defiant vision of a society rotting from the inside. It's dark, violent, suspenseful, and even mind bending at times trying to figure out who is corrupt and who isn't. Not to mention the cast is amazing. Leonardo Dicaprio (should have won an Oscar for this), Matt Damon, MarkWahlberg, Jack Nicholson, Vera Farminga, and Alec Baldwin? Where are you going to find a movie with more A-List celebs than this? If you haven't seen it yet you're missing out. I promise you won't see the ending coming!"
"Tweekums","9","1","3","6 July 2016"," An impressive remake of the Hong Kong film trilogy 'Infernal Affairs'
","Set in Boston this film follows two men who go deep undercover; a rookie Massachusetts State Trooper, Billy Costigan, who is placed within Francis ""Frank"" Costello's Irish mob and Colin Sullivan, a member of Costello's organisation who entered the State Police so he could feed information back to Costello. Neither man knows the other's identity but they both know that there are moles and that they could be exposed at any time. As time passes Costello gets more and more paranoid about the identity of the mole in his organisation.<br/><br/>The basic plot of this film isn't that complicated but the story is still gripping. There is a constant threat that Costigan could be exposed and killed which keeps the tension high. This is emphasised by the fact that we are shown what happens to anybody who crosses Costigan. The cast is full of well-known stars but doesn't feel like a typical 'all-star' production; we get good solid characters. Most notable amongst the cast are Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon who play Costigan and Sullivan respectively. There is also an impressive performance as Costello as well as fine performances from the likes of Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, Vera Farmiga and Alec Baldwin. As one would expect from a Martin Scorsese gangster film there is a fair amount of violence but it isn't gratuitous, not is it dwelt on excessively. The only real weak spot of the story was the romance between Sullivan and police psychiatrist Dr. Madolyn Madden who goes on to have an affair with Costigan; a little unlikely given that the latter was her patient. Overall though I thought this was an impressive film; fans of gangster and police films should enjoy it."
"Rickting","7","1","3","1 April 2016"," One of Scorsese's worst films, but still good
","The Departed, a crime thriller about a mole in the police and undercover cop trying to identify each other while the police try to infiltrate a gang in Boston, finally won Martin Scorsese the Oscar. A brilliant filmmaker like Martin Scorsese doesn't need an Oscar to prove his genius, but at least he finally got the credit from the Academy he deserves. It wasn't for the right film, but TD is a noble, thoroughly competent effort that is probably the weakest of the Scorsese films I've seen but certainly not bad. As a thriller, TD works well. Although the film feels somewhat restless at times and can't seem to keep still, it is undeniably entertaining. The set-pieces are tense, the visuals are as excellent as you'd expect from Scorsese, the plot is tense and twisty and it remains exciting much of the time. The film also benefits from a good soundtrack (Although they play the weaker version of Pink Floyd's 'Comfortably Numb') and a terrific lead performance from Leonardo DiCaprio. Mark Wahlberg is a scene-stealer as a foul mouthed police sergeant, while Martin Sheen also does a good job. Unfortunately, the criminally overrated Matt Damon is as boring as ever and Jack Nicholson overacts. This leads into the main problem with the movie: on a dramatic level, it isn't particularly compelling. It doesn't meditate on morals or any deeper themes except for a brief line spoken by Jack Nicholson during the opening, and ultimately the movie is quite superficial. Various things don't make a lot of sense and it's also too long. Despite the excessive length, as previously mentioned the film does feel rather hyperkinetic and restless, meaning much of it is told through montage. Still, as a thriller and a showcase of strong filmmaking, TD delivers.<br/><br/>7/10"
"nmholland","10","1","3","11 February 2016"," One of the Best Films of the 00's.
","The Departed is directed by the one and only Martin Scorsese, and stars Leonardo Dicaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, and Alec Baldwin. Huge star cast. It's plot is very interesting, as it's about an undercover cop, and a rat in the police office, that try to figure out who each other is. The rat is fathered by a drug lord (Jack Nicholson) and the undercover cop is somewhat mentored by the police chief (Martin Sheen). As you already should know, Martin Scorsese is one of the best directors of all time. He's directed Goodfellas, Casino, The Wolf of Wall Street (also with Dicaprio), and Taxi Driver. Another thing you should know is that this film won best picture in 2006.<br/><br/>To start, the acting is truly amazing. Some of my favorite actors are in this film, but even the actors that aren't mentioned above do really well. Dicaprio does so well as Billy Costigan, I forgot I was watching a movie at a couple points. Matt Damon also does truly amazing in his role, along with everyone else. The directing is also great. Martin Scorsese continues to amaze me, even with the great films he had done before this movie was released. Some of the camera angles he decided to provide are interestingly risky, but work really well.<br/><br/>There was also a scene in this movie that surprised more than I've been surprised in a movie in a long time. It is a spoiler, so I won't tell what happens, but prepare yourself. That's all I'll say.<br/><br/>Another good thing about the film is the cinematography. Some of the shots of Boston are amazing, especially from a recurring rooftop that we see a few times in the film. The sound quality is spot on, the Blu Ray looks great, even the no-name actors in this film do well. Everything about this movie is truly great. However, like all films, this movie does have a problem. More like a plot hole, but I'll call it a problem, to be fair to other movies.<br/><br/>It's problem begins with the smarts of Jack Nicholson's character, Castello. Castello is a smart guy. He's a drug lord that always gets what he wants. However, he can't figure out who the undercover cop is, even though all signs point to Dicaprio's character, Billy Costigan. Castello is portrayed as very smart, which he is, yet he struggles to read signs leading to Billy. That was my only problem with the film.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is great. I recommend it to anyone who can handle cursing and extreme violence. I think this movie deserves an A+, or 10 out of 10 stars."

","Directed by Martin Scorcese, this gritty, violent gangster tale of murky morality and questionable loyalties features a string of powerful performances from a great cast. <br/><br/>Of course, Scorcese is in familiar territory, but his cast give the film an unexpected freshness and vitality. Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio are the two leads playing a game of cat and mouse, and both are convincing. Jack Nicholson is devilishness personified as the films central gangster and he chews up every piece of scenery in sight with great relish. Mark Wahlberg also has great fun with his excessively obscene dialogue. However, for this viewer, it was Damon's performance, his quiet scheming and increasing panic as his plans unravelled that took the film to a level higher than that of simply being a good gangster yarn.<br/><br/>It's not a film to brighten your day, but it's well made and convincing. Cope with the language and violence associated with a typical Scorcese gangster tale, and it's whopping 151 minutes will pass by in a relative flash."

I think that Mark Wahlberg gave one of the best performances of his career even though he had limited screen time. In those scenes he completely dominated them! Another great thing about this movie was the sense of realism. From actors Dicaprio and Damon giving spectacular performances to the gritty violence it was flawless. I usually don't write reviews but I had to on this one after seeing a bunch of absurd negative comments saying it was overrated. Anyone who says that is full of crap. This was a masterpiece and definitely deserved all the awards and hype it got."

","Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed"" is a terrific entertaining film despite the violence, profanity and some sexuality. Jack Nicholson gave one of his best performances as Frank Costello, a Boston mobster. Instead of Italian mobsters in New York City, it is Boston and Irish mafia. Leonardo DiCaprio plays an undercover cop in Costello's mob. Matt Damon plays cop and his mole. The two men don't know who is playing who. The film features great supporting performances by Ray Winstone, Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlburg, Vera Farmiga. The film storyline is gripping to watch and can't help to see how it ends. Martin Scorsese did a fabulous job in recreating the Boston mob. The film was shot on location in Boston. Scorsese and his brilliant film editor did a terrific job.

"Rawal_Afzal","10","1","3","23 September 2015"," A masterpiece full of brilliant twists!
","Firstly of course, it has to be added that any of what I would write in this film's praise should apply to the 2002 Hong Kong film which this one is a remake of.<br/><br/>It is, as the summary of my review mentions, a masterpiece full of brilliant twists. It is a case of some amazing tricks played by a policeman who acts like nothing short of a politician - he is bad, corrupt, a mole, kills people for his gains, makes partnerships with bad people, yet still earns praise and is clapped for and gets promotions. It was amazing to see the way it ended considering how the good cop entered the scene as someone with a bad family reputation, and the mole as someone who impressed them with merely his presence.<br/><br/>The ending however, as every other man is killed except for two or three, reminded me so much of a Bollywood masterpiece, 'Johnny Gaddaar' (2008), which though was completely different but had a similar kind of ending.<br/><br/>The cast was perfect for the film and each and every actor put in a great performance. Jack Nicholson resembled so much to the Undertaker in this film. Mind-blowing resemblance in some scenes!"

","Two South Boston cops from the same graduating class take very different career paths. Billy Costigan, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, goes undercover to infiltrate a ruthless gang that not only terrorizes the neighborhood businesses, but also deals in trading U.S. military technology to foreign enemies. While his classmate, Colin Sullivan, played by Matt Damon, serves as a mole in the police department for the same gang Billy is infiltrating. The leader of this gang, Frank Costello, played by Jack Nicholson, is a ruthless killer and has a very disturbed mind; he will stop at nothing to protect his enterprise. Captain Queenan and Detective Sergeant Dignam, played by Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg respectively, are Billy's handlers and do everything they can to bring Frank down.<br/><br/>This film focuses on the plot; all events leading up to the final scene have everything to do with the story being told. If one looks deeper into the individual characters, struggle for human dignity can be found in both Costigan and Sullivan. Costigan wants nothing more than to do the right thing, but that becomes more and more difficult for him as the story unfolds and he becomes more entrenched in the gang and further separated from his handlers. Sullivan starts out doing what is best for him and Costello, but in certain scenes, such as when he finds out his girlfriend is pregnant, he mentions moving away and getting a fresh start; there is just a hint of him wanting to start over and stop being the bad guy.<br/><br/>There is a lot of arguing, fighting, shooting, and noise in the film. This seems to represent the chaos and struggle between the good guys and the bad guys. The music, at times, is so loud you find yourself getting tense in anticipation of what is going to happen next. The lighting in the film enhances the mood of the scenes. When Costigan is with the gang, they are usually in a bar or under cover of night, so the lighting is dark; a perfect example of this is the cranberry juice scene. On the flip side, when Costigan is with Queenan and Dignam or his therapist, Madolyn, played by Vera Farmiga, the lighting is much brighter and the scenes much more clear. Interestingly enough, it is in the brighter scenes that Costigan seems to struggle most with doing the right thing.<br/><br/>This film is reminiscent of ""Donnie Brasco"" in theme. An undercover agent struggling to keep his identity and his humanity; starring Johnny Depp as Donnie Brasco, and Al Pacino as the mobster, Benjamin 'Lefty' Ruggiero, this film also focuses on story with a splash of the struggle for humanity. And, much like the Departed, the lighting, along with the music, enhances the scenes and the viewer's mood. As both of these movies were box office hits, one can only imagine that there will be many more mob versus undercover cop films in our future.<br/><br/>References<br/><br/>Newell, M. (Director).

","Crime has been a powerhouse genre for film for decades. These stories have intense plots and interesting characters that make us see the world of crime in shockingly new ways. Director Martin Scorsese is the king of making crime films that are not only good but influential and classic. In his film 'The Departed' we have an intense story with genius characters and superb acting. Leonardo Dicaprio gives his best performance as Billy Costigan, a low-life Boston citizen who plans on finding a job in the police force. When he gets a job from the Boston State Police as an undercover investigator to take down brutal mobster Frank Costello (a brilliant Jack Nicholson) and get his works pay. Big shot Massachusetts state police detective Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is working on taking Costello down the old fashion way, but is secretly working with him and is a rat in the police force. As the gravity of the crime increases and secrets and lies are revealed, you'll get Martin Scorsese crime like you have never seen before and it will leave you shocked and speechless. Scorsese deals with the themes of power, corruption of authority and lying more than ever in this picture. He has interesting characters that are both similar and different to each other at the same time. Each actor, especially Leonardo Dicaprio give strong performances that are believable and not forced like in most crime films at all. William Monahan's screenplay is a reflection on the criminal system in America, and how crime is in everyone in relation to the law and in relation to crime cases in general. He portrays how big messages or clues can be right under our nose and how unpredictable the world of crime is. The film editing is superbly superior, adding intense violence and great directorial shots to complete this masterpiece. Not a single thing is wrong with this new crime classic, and Martin Scorsese adds on his legacy to crime films in cinema, adding different and similar aspects to his original style of film making to make this pure cinematic beauty entertaining and eye-opening at the same time."
"doug_park2001","9","1","3","18 May 2014"," ""Honesty is not synonymous with truth""
","THE DEPARTED makes fine use of its high heavens stellar cast. The way that Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Sullivan (Matt Damon) resemble each other can be confusing but still invokes a sort of alter-ego effect. Jack Nicholson also gives a commendable performance as aging Boston Irish Mafia boss Costello, as does Martin Sheen as SIU Chief Detective Queenan. One of the most memorable characters of all is Mark Wahlberg as abrasive meanie SIU detective Dignam.<br/><br/>A super-violent film without true heroes, THE DEPARTED views like a sort of mini-epic video novel. Although there's no shortage of surprises and turnabouts, it doesn't have the sharp thrills and twists that many cop films do and doesn't need them. Everything develops at a natural but very compelling pace. The loud, profane, wise-cracking Boston dialogue is also something else: Though I wouldn't want to use many of them against my worst enemy, there are some outstanding insults here.<br/><br/>As intense as it is, THE DEPARTED goes way beyond the level of a standard good guy cops versus bad guy criminals shoot-'em-up fest. This film tackles some big themes and is very revealing of what a maddening head-muck detective work can be and how easily destructible everyone is in the end."

There is so much danger out there and it could be around any corner. The performances are great, particular by Jack Nicholson and Mark Walberg. These are a couple of crazies who seem to enjoy the most insane, continuous process of interaction among crooks and police. They are suspicious and ruthless and absolutely great.

","Martin Scorsese's The Departed is a new American crime classic brought to life by an all star cast including Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, Vera Farminga, and Alec Baldwin. The movie is about Billy Costigan (played perfectly with intensity and vulnerability by DiCaprio) a rookie cop who goes undercover to help his detective handlers (played by Sheen and Wahlberg in great supporting roles) bring down mob boss Frank Costello (played to a tee with menace by Nicholson). His character provides some of the comic relief which balances well between the drama, suspense, and action. Meanwhile, SIU officer Colin Sullivan (played effectively by Damon in a rare villain role) has everyone trusts who is actually Costello's mole. Vera Farminga also does a good job with the supporting role of Sullivan's girlfriend and Costigan's secret lover Madolyn and Ray Winstone is fantastic as Mr. French who is Costello's right hand man. From the great actors who all brought their A game, to the story, to the Boston setting, and Scorsese's direction of where he wanted to take this film is masterfully done. The film did feel a bit long at the end with a running time of 151 minutes but it's a minor flaw in what is a great crime film brought to the big screen. The film does have some strong brutal violence, strong language, and sexual content so adults may want to think about watching this movie with their children. Other then that The Departed is a terrific film with some twists, turns, and surprises that make for an enjoyable film to watch. So if you're a fan of crime films, Scorsese, or any of the actors in it then chances are you'll really like this film. Go see it. You won't be disappointed."

"Astral_the_dragon","9","1","3","21 August 2008"," One of the best gangster movies
","Personally I consider ""The Departed"" as one of the most satisfying movies I've seen. It has everything from great cast, through thrilling plot, to great filming. Story of mutual infiltration between the police department and mafia really intrigues the viewer. Not mentioning the psychological layer of the movie - an eager cop (DiCaprio) who has to become a gangster to fulfill his duty, and a gangster (Damon) raised by mafia boss becomes a rat in the police department. All that leads to increasing tension, both sides are aware of the rat, but only few know who they are. Psychological pressure leaves mark on everybody, resulting in conspiracy that's getting deeper and deeper, until you can no longer trust anyone. What also makes this movie outstanding is brilliant acting, but having a cast full of stars you can expect nothing less.Jack Nicholson as a mafia boss is really convincing, but it is the acting of Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio that earns this movie a standing applause. They both proved once again that they are among the best actors of Hollywood. And last but not least the man who assembled all those pieces in a wonderful motion picture - the director Martin Scorsese whose touch and experience in such movies can be seen throughout the picture. I recommend this movie for everyone who loves action."
"SunstreakedGirl","8","1","3","19 August 2008"," An ""Un-Informed"" Review
","I don't necessarily consider myself a lucky person, but when it comes to movies I seem to have an ability that a lot of other people lack  the ability to get lost inside the movie world, the characters, the settings, the dialogue, the STORY and just enjoy it. I get scared, laugh, cry, my stomach gets tight, I gasp, I even yell at the characters if I'm at home (people tend to look at you weird if you do that in the theater!), but most of all I get involved.<br/><br/>While other reviews you might read here compare this film to the original, or talk about Scorsese's ""style"", or discuss plot holes, or dissect this film in other ways, this one is how I felt watching it. Please read the other reviews for that.<br/><br/>As for me, I just got lost in this movie. I felt the desperation of Billy, hiding who he was and living every single day with an overwhelming fear of discovery from people who would kill him in an instant without a single thought or regret. Colin (Matt Damon) was a true psychopathic personality to me, in that he never seemed to have any regret for what he was doing and he never considered the outcome of his actions with regard to others. I felt his feelings for Madolyn (Vera Farmiga) were ""an act"", another way his disregard of the feelings of others showed itself, i.e., when he takes her box of pictures and puts them away, out of sight, in essence denying her a past.<br/><br/>I found myself wondering if police were really like this in the confines of a ""safe"" environment, one with no civilians around. Are they at each other's throats? Do they not trust even their fellow officers? Do the divisions keep such deep secrets from one another? How prevalent are ""moles""? Costello (Jack Nicholson) was truly frightening to me. He was smart and ruthless and utterly without morals, but fascinating in that he had to trust  at least those that worked for him, yet he was completely untrustworthy  he ""ratted"" to the FBI.<br/><br/>I was completely shocked at the ending and glad to be so. Knowing what's coming isn't that much fun and I was glad that I was into this movie enough to just go with it.<br/><br/>The Departed is bloody, sometimes shockingly so, and the language only makes it more violent. Coarseness and disregard for life is the theme and when the movie lets you go at the end you are still stained with the splatter.<br/><br/>This movie was one heck of a ride and I'm glad I went."
"Edward_fowler3","10","1","3","7 August 2008"," Fiercely entertaining! Scorsese's best of them all.
","This is probably Martin Scorsese's best movie of them all. Not his best since Goodfellas. The film is fiercely entertaining and features superb acting. I really like how Leonardo Dicaprio has gone from being just another ""pretty boy"" to a truly decent actor. I remember after Titanic, there was that whole Leo mania thing and I became convinced that the guy was just an idiot but after seeing his performance in this movie I think he has now completely shed that whole ""pretty boy"" image. I also thought that Scorsese was well overdue for his Oscar win and to direct a film that won best picture. The only downside to the film was that Robert Deniro and Joe Pesci were not in it. I think they both could have added a lot but Jack Nicholson was certainly a good choice for Costello. This is probably one of the best films ever made and certainly the best film Scorsese has directed."
"tangoafterdark","8","1","3","5 August 2008"," Another Scorsese Masterpiece.
","This is another addition in Scorsese's long line of brilliant movies. I don't think Scorsese has ever made a bad film, but this one stands out as one of his best, in the league of Taxi Driver, The Last Waltz, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas. Although it is not an original storyline, it is very well written and scripted. It is a very personal experience, and I found myself relating to the characters in a much more personal level than in Goodfellas or the other Scorsese movies. Identity themes can make for beautiful movies if it is done right, because it is so universal. Leonardo DiCaprio's character mentions that he does not want money, or a job, or a medal; all he wants is his identity. This was the part that really won me over for this movie.<br/><br/>Speaking of DiCaprio, he has grown so much as an actor since the days of Titanic. In his films with Scorsese, starting with Gangs of New York, he progressed from an actor that ""had his moments"" to a true star. Gangs of New York and The Aviator were good, but The Departed is so fantastic that it cannot really be compared on the same level as these two films, both in terms of acting and writing/production.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays a great ""bad guy"". His role is so much the polar opposite of DiCaprio, and their performances match their intended roles. What a novel idea to have the good guy in a gangster's skin and the bad guy in cop's skin. The pair of them are like a pair of gears, they move in the exact opposite direction, but it is perfectly smooth. The other actors were also great in their performances. After seeing him flirt with comedies for the past few years, it is nice to see Jack Nicholson back in a ""darker"" role, and is probably the best acting performance of his career. Mark Wahlberg was also in his prime, and got into the personality of his character. At times, I was left feeling that he was almost an antagonist, but he later became the only hope for justice.<br/><br/>All of these actors are in the best performances of their careers, in what is arguably the best film of the 21st century. It is a little bit long, but it captured my attention very quickly, and hung on to it. It was a deeply personal film-watching experience for me, and there is very little that could have been done to make this a better movie than it already is. The rat on the balcony at the end brings it all home, in a bit of a black comedy moment, a powerful ending that I would compare with Breakfast at Tiffany's or The Graduate. Some people say a picture is worth a thousand words. Maybe not, but it's certainly worth at least a few very good words."
"basildave","9","1","3","22 April 2008"," Wrong time period
","I've seen a lot of comments regarding the authenticity of this movie. I have to agree that it's not realistic given the state of the city today. If the movie had been set back in the early to mid eighties (as the main part of the action) it would have been much more realistic. At that time, Boston was a grittier city. There were many parts of the city that were dangerous after dark (like Chinatown or what used to be the ""combat zone""). All these areas have been gentrified and it's kind of funny to see see them portrayed as dark and dangerous (about the only danger you face now is running into a drunken tourist).<br/><br/>Despite what I said above, the movie is excellent. Going down as one of my favorites, not because of the realism (lets face it, nearly all modern movies require you to suspend a whole lot of disbelief) but because of the tremendous performances of the cast and the overall story. If you can find fault in a movie based on the plot, acting, or some other attribute of the movie which causes it damage, that's fine. However, try to take the ""realism"" of the movie in relation to its setting, time period, or geographic authenticity with a grain of salt."
"dajemitchell","8","1","3","8 March 2008"," The greatest remake of all time
","this is the greatest remake of all time by far. this is also one of my favourite films.<br/><br/>The cast gives great in depth performances - especially Di Caprio and Damon as the two leads.<br/><br/>Nicholson returns to his vintage form and the supporting cast of Sheen Sr and Alec BAldwin were perfectly cast. Ray Winstone is also good and should have a good career ahead. Mark Wahlberg is also a main talking point in his role as the foul mouthed Dignam. he takes the movie by its neck and shows the rest how it is done whilst spurring them on to make great performances all round.<br/><br/>a great film 8/10."
"emperor_bender","10","1","3","7 March 2008"," I retract my previous statement
","I had previously said this movie was a modernized version of Goodfellas but upon viewing it again, I realize I was mistaken. This movie is completely original from Goodfellas except for the fact that its a street film like Goodfellas. This movie was very well written and every little detail comes into play one way or another. Leonardo DiCaprio is actually pretty low on my ""Actors"" list but he actually pulled this movie off quite well. Matt Damon showed us a different character than the Jason Bourne we are all used to seeing him as. They make a very good pair of characters; very similar but different as well. Jack Nicholson proves to us he is still a great actor after all these years. He was very good as Costello and was able to be convincing, insane, and memorable all at the same time, much like he was as McMurphy in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest 31 years before. Mark Wahlberg was great as the sarcastic, aggressive, angry, smart-mouthed Sgt. Dignam, the part seems to fit his acting skills perfectly. Martin Sheen also proves he can still play great parts as the smart, peace-keeper Capt. Queenan. With a great cast, they need a great story to work with, which is just what they get here. A great story. Add a great sound mix and camera work and you have the best movie of 2006. I recommend this movie to action and gang movie fans, you will not be disappointed in any way. 10/10."
"arieliondotcom","9","1","3","2 January 2008"," A Wild Ride
","Like the wildest roller coaster ride you've ever imagined, this movie will have you exhilerated one moment, nauseous the next, laughing, gasping and waiting breathlessly for the next twist and turn, as frightening as it might be. And that is the only reason I didn't give it a 10 because the twists come so fast and furious that you're disoriented at the beginning of the film and it takes you a while to orient yourself (which is probably why it is longer than 2 hours).<br/><br/>Fantastic acting all the way around, especially from Nicholson, DiCaprio and Damon. Only actors with their skill could pull off the twists and turns of this enthralling plot. It's not for the faint-hearted with a lot of the F word, graphic violence with long camera pans, and some nasty sexual stuff. Ordinarily that would have me saying to keep away from this. But it is all so true to life to the characters and the plot that you can't really fault it. Even the BIble has a lot of graphic violence that would shock people if it were portrayed on the screen. But in context, it makes sense.<br/><br/>Comparisons will be made to Scarface and the Sopranos and that's all here. But it is a great movie in its own right, due again to some terrific acting.<br/><br/>Be sure to see it, but be sure no children are around when you do, and be prepared for some violent scenes but some terrific acting to make it worth while, as sad as that is to say."
"Vilelmdekyper","8","1","3","20 December 2007"," Questions
","Isn't it a somewhat depressing thought that Martin Scorsese, one of the brightest and most original minds to grace the movies should receive his first and as yet only Academy Award for the Americanization of a magnificent Hongkong thriller - the magnificent that remake, namely ""The Departed"", in itself might be? Isn't it even more depressing that ""The Departed"" is indeed the best Scorsese picture in years - notably since 1991, when he brought ""Cape Fear"" to the screen, again a remake, this time of that remarkable 1962 J. Lee-Thompson thriller of the same title? Should the helmer of ""Mean Streets"" (1973), ""Taxi Driver"" (1976, ""Raging Bull (1980) or ""GoodFellas"" (1990) have lost his touch or is he terribly in need of a Paul Schrader?"
"aventaria","6","1","3","3 November 2007"," Creativity Blackout
","When I saw what people were actually playing in this movie, my hopes were high. The acting indeed was splendid. The story was also quite well. Matt Damon is working for the bad guys and is undercover with the good guys, while Leonardo Di Caprio is working for the good guys and undercover with the bad guys. They both try to look for the moles - each other.<br/><br/>So, after a very exciting movie, they both almost unmask each other a few times. And when eventually both the bad guys and the good guys die, the question remains what both people will do with their lives. Who will get punished and who will live happily ever after? And that's the moment where the authors of the script got a major creativity blackout. Unable to think of anything fun, they just decided to something that happens way too often in movies lately. They just let everyone die. Suddenly all the persons start shooting people in their head, as if it's the most normal thing in the world. Within 5 persons everyone with any role is dead and the movie has ended.... Some ending. That cost this movie at least 2 stars in its rating.<br/><br/>So my advice: If you're looking for a thrilling movie with good acting, you definitely need to watch this one, but don't expect too much of the ending."
"floydfm","6","1","3","31 October 2007"," Entertaining, But not the Best Scorsese film
","Martin Scorsese is at it again with his ""Gangster-Mafia-Shoot-em up"" style movie plots. The departed is no different; the location is a mirror image of everyday Boston MA. Two recently graduated officers of the State Police are sent in two totally different sides of the police force: Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) was instantly promoted as an investigator and William Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) was sent undercover to work for and Irish Mob boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Both Costigan and Sullivan try to reveal the identity of the other ""rat"". The feel in the beginning of the movie started off slow and it felt as if some of the scenes should have been deleted because it didn't tie into the real plot of the movie. For example, the triangle between Sullivan,Costigan, and the Psychologist: Madolyn Madden (Vera Farmiga), it really had nothing to do with the plot other than adding the Hollywood effect using sex, lies, and betrayal. There were constant subplots until the story seemed like it could have went in many different directions. However what was significant about this movie is how all the characters tied to each other. For example, SSgt. Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) is pretty much a static character throughout the whole movie however at the end of the movie is the last one standing to get revenge for his partner Capt. Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) who had been killed all because Sullivan wanted to save his identity. On another good note the acting from Walhberg, Nicholson, DiCaprio, and Damon was to say the least, superior the characters they conveyed were on point and I really felt the intensity of their personalities. Martin Scorsese older films like Gangs of New York, Goodfellas, and taxi driver, I would have to say, are much better than The Departed mainly because they aren't made up with a bunch of Hollywood effects, they are just downright Drama Filled Crime movies. I would also say The departed isn't the best remake of Internal Affairs although it keeps the basic structure of the movie. Overall the movie was good and I enjoyed many parts of it and it really displays Martin Scorsese's interest in gangster-like films."

Just for time alone, it was too bloated and way too much Jack going nuts.<br/><br/>Leo & Matt's performances were top-notch and each were perfect for the part, but thought their absolutes were annoying. I felt, however, that Johnny Depp was better in the same type of role as Costigan as Donny Brasco. I never got the whole reason why Wahlberg's character hated Sullivan so much.<br/><br/>Vera Famiglia was lame as the shared love interest. I never felt any of her attraction for Sullivan. She also just didn't strike me that she would jeopardize her relationship with Sullivan for a roll in the hay with Costigan.<br/><br/>I am glad that Scorcese won an Oscar, but he was still robbed for not getting it for a better movie.<br/><br/>If you're going to a Scorcese movie be ready for lots of swearing and blood.

","When you combine A-List Hollywood draw, a proved storyline, and an Academy Award winning director? Normally the answer would be an instant classic. Unfortunately Martin Scorsese's latest venture The Departed seems to only be departing with his reputation. The premise was impressive, put Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen and other top stars together with a dramatic and thrilling plot. Somewhere though the film departed with it's dignity.<br/><br/>Based on the Hong Kong movie 'WuJianDao', the story follows two men from opposite sides of the law who are undercover within both the Massachusetts State Police and the Irish mafia, but violence and bloodshed boil when discoveries are made, and the moles are dispatched to find out their enemy's identities. Scorsese fans will adore the cinematography; Nicholson and DiCaprio give stellar performances. The actors perform exceptionally well despite the often-stereotypical race and locality jokes, and Scorsese's strange insistence on emphasizing the distinct dialect of the Boston area. Viewers in the northeast will feel appeased by the dialect; however, it is more likely that the typical viewer will simply find the trait comedic. The film begins with a crawl, intertwining the stories of Frances Costello (Nicholson), the Irish mafia kingpin; Billy Costigan, an undercover mole for the State Police; and Collin Sullivan (Damon), also a State trooper, but with a decidedly more checkered lifestyle. As the three cross paths, at first unknowingly, then finding themselves more and more deeply involved with each other's lives, the suspense and drama builds to explosive levels. The films promise seeks to force its way out despite its drawbacks.<br/><br/>Scorsese delivers to his fans the expected cinematic artistry, but somewhere between production and presentation, things went horribly wrong. The films soundtrack is choppy, though utilizing his trademark rock score; the songs lack the appropriate fade in and out of the scenes that they are supposed to solidify. The drastic changes break the bond between the film and the audience, a decidedly non-Scorsese trait. Thelma Shoomaker, Scorsese's film editor for most of his career, seems to be losing her touch. Not only were the score cuts distracting, but shoddy editing also encumbered what should have been incredible action scenes. Explosions were improperly cut, once freezing mid-shot and completely ruining the effect.<br/><br/>What do you get when you combine a proved storyline, Academy Award winning Directing and a stellar cast? You get the potential for a mega-hit along the lines of Aviator, but like the Spruce Goose, The Departed just couldn't take flight. See you in 2008, Mr. Scorsese."

","It is sad that some filmmakers are forgotten in their prime when it comes the time to give out awards. If they are lucky as Robert Altman, they receive a lifetime achievement award, but it is embarrassing when they get one prize as a kind of consolation reward, after being ignored for their best works. This is the case with Martin Scorsese who finally won the Best Director Academy Award for this boring and sanitized re-telling of ""Infernal Affairs"", a 2002 Chinese violence film. One person though is outstanding, and was ignored at prize time: Leonardo DiCaprio as the young man trapped inside the bad guys' playground. I give it five stars because Scorsese has not lost his know-how, but the great stories of yesteryear, the innovative techniques of the past are not here. This is unfortunately mainstream cinema by a once-unconventional director. Editor Thelma Schoonmaker tries hard, but even she cannot equal her work in ""Raging Bull."" What we have is a re-cycling of Scorsese's aptitudes, in function of a tiresome and mean story for the macho man who ask his macho woman for a beer while he watches a football game (or this movie.) I at least do not need this kind of stories today (unless they have a sense of humor, as the Chinese do, or the characters are treated as children, as in Hawks' ""Scarface"".) Do yourself a favor and plan a retrospective of Scorsese's best at home, renting ""Mean Streets"", ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"", ""After Hours"", ""The King of Comedy"", ""Goodfellas"", ""The Age of Innocence"" and ""Bringing Out the Dead."""

The allover acting is top-notch... Leo DiCaprio does a very convincing job while Matt Damon's performance is somehow a bit flat. Jack Nicholson is damn charismatic as usual. Among the supporting roles by Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg, it's Mark who steals the show with his impulsive and ever-sarcastic persona.<br/><br/>Then why is the film so far from being perfect? The storycrafting and the screenplay of course. The characters are, well, pretty one-dimensional, shown in black or white... especially Colin Sullivan. Even Dicaprio's character just whines about his job, but that's all. The supporting characters, except Dignam in the end, fail to add enough substantiality to the story. The story itself moves unrealistically fast... thereby leaving the audience completely fooled by its occasional flashes of action sequences. The dialogues, oh god, what can I say? Using the word 'fuck' in every line more than once neither makes the screenplay a classic, nor makes it realistic.<br/><br/>To summarise, ""The Departed"" is violent, smart, well-acted and also a well-directed thriller. But it's definitely not more Oscar-worthy than Scorsese's other classic works for one simple reason - it's not quite original. It offers nothing new.<br/><br/>And that's that."

","The name of the movie says it all  departed. Now who departs? The dead depart from the face of the earth. The dead die because someone wants them dead. And someone wants them dead because they want money.<br/><br/>The movie storyline? Trivial matter, but anyway here it goes  two men from opposite sides  cops and criminals work as spies. Leo is a good guy on the bad side and Matt is a bad guy on the good side (I didn't make any sense of that, did you?). Leo finds out what the bad guys are doing, and Matt finds out what the good guys are doing to prevent the bad guys from doing. In the end they all find out that they are something that they lost track of, and end up killing each other. Picture this scenario and make a movie out of it and win an Oscar  hats off to Mr.Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>Violence through guns makes life easier for many to die. Death is made to look so simple in this movie that there is no gory, no pain. Just plain kiss of death! Who dies? Well everyone does the movie portrays the emotions of betrayal, hatred, greed and above all, the killer attitude. Among all these is the noble virtue, almost omnipresent yet unseen  sacrifice! A funny word in a gangster's world, yet it is not uncommon to find old loyalty amongst the dirty rats.<br/><br/>The movie totally belongs to Leonardo di Caprio and Matt Damon. I mean, you got to give to Damon  he plays the negative role well. You love to hate him throughout the movie. And you find comic relief actually in the end to see him dead..<br/><br/>While on the other side, Leo looks the perfect part  totally disgusted with himself, vulnerable to the ""glory"" that is bestowed upon him being one of the youngest gang members and having to put up with the terror in his eyes. You can see Leo give his best shot in this movie  I think he is getting outstanding with every movie that I see him in.<br/><br/>Yet again, Leo dies in a movie! Oh boy, I think he could teach a thing or two to the feline community (cats which supposedly have nine lives).<br/><br/>The script-writer of this movie (William Monahan) had it all so easy (oscar worthy script??)  all he had to do is write up a few four letter swear words and voila! The movie dialogues are ready for delivery.. There is only one dialogue that stands out and its at the beginning of the movie  ""when I was your age they used to say you could become cops or criminals. What I'm saying to you is this... When you're facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?"" If you look to spend quality time for a quality flick (that you won't come to terms with, anyway), you can consider this movie. But it is pure cinema, the typical gangster flick with modern facilities thrown in. but if you aren't the type who can handle gunshots at will and cant stop sweating at swearing without a pause  you better send out the SOS  Save Our Souls. Because when you have departed from the movie hall, you won't have a soul left. Start your prayers already Action is thy name death? Then, this movie is thy address for two hours full of it. Martin Scorsese scores with ease in the gangster brand of movies; his cup pa tea for a while now  Goodfellas was perhaps the best of his creations.<br/><br/>All said and done - as they say, the departed go to heaven. And truly, ""The departed"" did go to Oscar heaven"
"somegravity","10","1","3","19 May 2007"," A mob film at its best
","Hollywood has welcomed several great directors. And,out of all those great directors,one of them happens to be,by far,Martin Scorsese. Despite the fact that Martin Scorsese does not have the versatility of Ron Howard and has not won Oscars the way that Steven Spielberg has,Scorsese's intelligence with crime drama films has brought Hollywood several great films of that genre. So,how does the most recent Martin Scorsese film,""The Departed"",measure up? Read on for my review of this: <br/><br/>Based in Boston,""The Departed"" is based around several different characters. It is best to begin my review of ""The Departed"" with a depiction of Leonardo DiCaprio's character in the film,Billy Costigan. Billy Costigan,a young man who has had a rough life,decides to make a change. That change is by Billy Costigan re-entering the Boston Police Department,and being given a good job as a police officer. That job? Posing as a criminal and going undercover into a Boston mob that is run by a dangerous mob boss by the name of Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). While Billy Costigan is able to do well with the job that he has been assigned,will Costigan be able to successfully bring Frank Costello down,with Costello being so hard to catch and a deadly secret existing within the Boston Police Department? The only things that will tell are time,decisions,and intelligence.<br/><br/>Let's talk about ""The Departed"". Not only does it work excellent as a crime drama film,it successfully blends two stories (the story of the good characters in ""The Departed"",and the story of the bad characters in ""The Departed"")into one entire film. Yes,this may be hard to do,but Martin Scorsese makes it appear to be a piece of cake and does a richly executed job with it. The script for ""The Departed"" is very well-written,and brings this film's plot to life with twists,turns,and surprises along the way. Sure,""The Departed"" is hard to follow throughout some of it,while it is a very long film (close to the amount of time that ""JFK"" and ""The Good Shepherd"" were). Yet,""The Departed"" being hard to follow and being as long as it is is not the film's script losing itself. It is the film being headed in the right direction that it needs to be headed in,and being well understood by its director. And,with all of that,alongside the powerful performances that are to be found in ""The Departed"" and the great cast that ""The Departed"" holds (DiCaprio,Nicholson,Matt Damon,Mark Wahlberg,Martin Sheen,and Alec Baldwin),""The Departed"" comes together as one of the most brilliant films ever made. Whether you are a fan of crime drama films or happen to be just a film buff,""The Departed"" is one film that you do not want to miss out on.<br/><br/>10/10"

I'm a bit surprised that Mark Wahlburg was the only actor that received an Oscar nod (Jack and Leo should had joined him). Too bad Martin had to go Irish to get his Oscar. Anyway, this will be a classic for years to come. I also heard rumors of a sequel. I personally hope it doesn't happen because there's been plenty of great movies that have become less appealing due to their sequels. Just Mark Wahlburg w/o Jack, Leo, and Matt wouldn't be the Departed. Now that I said that, this will be a classic for years to come and I recommend it to everyone."
"maiwol","9","1","3","14 May 2007"," Police versus mafia in Boston
","For me, The Departed is one of the best movies in the last years. It combines action, suspense, mafia, and traitors. Brilliant performances and directing, along with an original script makes this movie a great continuance of The Godfather and Goodfellas (this time with Irish mafia). Billy Costigan is an poor Irish from Boston, victim from mafia aggression. He decides to become a cop to fight crime, and his first and most important assignment is to pretend he is a criminal. To make the story believable, he even spends time in jail. Back in the city he is sent to get in Costello's (Boston biggest mob boss) crew to finally arrest him. Billy ends getting inside their plans, and some people begin to suspect from him. Exactly the opposite happened to Colin (delinquent departed in the police department). Colin and Billy will finally coincide in one of the best endings in this type of movie"
"the_stiff_meister","10","1","3","12 May 2007"," Another Superb Film from the Maestro of the Mob Movie
","Family is at the center of any Scorsese mob film, and it is no different here. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCarprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) are two young men with little family remaining except for the father figure who serves as the center of each of their worlds; Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), the head of the Irish Mafia in Boston. But they have gotten to their mutual destination via different routes. Colin was orphaned and living with his grandparents when Costello took the young man under his wings. Morally ambiguous, but with a lust for power of his own, Colin graduates with honors from the Massachusetts State Police Academy, and is soon a detective in the Special Investigations Unit, a perfect place for him to tip off his benefactor Costello on all police activity.<br/><br/>Billy is sent to prison for three months for assault to establish his credentials, then sets up operations back in South Boston, soon attracting the attention of Costello via his main henchman, the sadistic Mr. French (Ray Winstone). Having no sons of his own, Costello seems to always be on the lookout for another protégé, and after an extremely violent confrontation with Billy to ensure his motives; he befriends the young man, and puts him to work for his crew.<br/><br/>Eventually, both sides become aware of a mole in their midst, and the race is on to see who will be first to eliminate their problem. Betrayals and other twists further complicate issues until the inevitable series of final gut-wrenching, ultra-violent confrontations take this movie to an even higher level.<br/><br/>But unlike a good caper film, the soul of the movie is not in the events themselves, but in the reactions of the characters to them. In this case, Scorsese gets Oscar worthy performances from all five of his lead actors. In smaller roles, Sheen and Wahlberg are a terrific tandem as the only men who know of Billy's identity. Sheen is much different from his elitist Jed Bartlett character on ""The West Wing""; paternal and kind with a strong lower middle-class work ethic and understated resolve. Wahlberg is his emotional polar opposite; a firebrand who takes no prisoners in dealing with anyone else and is wound so tightly that he might explode at any minute.<br/><br/>Although Nicholson is the most prominent star, the movie is carried by virtuoso performances from Damon and DiCaprio. Damon has leveraged his charms, good looks, and boy-next-door appeal into a very nice career as a leading man and Action Hero. So it takes an actor with a great deal of confidence in himself and his director to skewer those traits into a character that is not at all sympathetic. He has done it before with his performance in ""Syriana"", but he takes it to a much higher level here. You do not ever really feel for Colin, and you want him to get caught. But at the same time, he is not a typical two-dimensional villain, and Damon does a fantastic job showing you the insides of a man who has lost his moral compass, but is still conflicted about his dual identities nonetheless, and is uncomfortable with that conflict. He is a compulsive, natural liar, but is genuinely hurt when his lies cause emotional pain to his girlfriend.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio, like Damon, is evolving into one of the best young actors on screen today. Reviled by many for his boyish appearance and his turn in ""Titanic"", Leo's recent path has become the complete opposite of Ben Affleck's career over the last several years. While Affleck parlayed his good looks into weak ""star vehicle"" bombs like ""Paycheck"", ""Daredevil"", and ""Gigli"", DiCaprio has sought out complex, untraditional roles not normally associated with ""pretty boys"". Perhaps his biggest stroke of luck was in landing the lead role in Scorsese's ""Gangs of New York"", as his performance in that underrated film impressed Scorsese so much that he has cast him in the lead for ""The Aviator"" and ""The Departed"".<br/><br/>In this case, DiCaprio far exceeds the impressive performance he gave as the reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes, and creates a character that will be remembered for generations, much like Ray Liotta's Henry Hill in ""Goodfellas"". He is simply gripping as Billy Costigan, and any time he is on screen, you are concerned for his well being, and empathetic towards the mental and physical price Billy is paying for his duplicity. Billy has two disadvantages in his charade when compared to Colin. The first being that the danger he faces is far greater as the people he is spying on are much more ruthless than the police. The other is that Billy truly does have a conscience, in contrast to the ethically challenged Colin, and the guilt and stress are slowly tearing him apart, a fact that is evident in every frame featuring DiCaprio.<br/><br/>10/10 good film"

","This absolutely has to be the best film of 2006. I can't find any other that even comes close. Finally, after two rather disappointing Scorsese epics, we get this that rivals his masterpiece, Goodfellas.<br/><br/>DiCaprio, possibly Scorseses favorite after De Niro is superb, although his accent goes in and out. The same with Jack Nicholson but other than that you can't find any faults with them. Matt Damon has the difficult task of being a villain without the flash that Nicholsons character allows, but he manages to be a smarmy little backstabber without straining too hard.<br/><br/>Could we just see some more of this from one of the greatest filmmaker ever. Scorsese has been around for some 40 years now and with each of his films we see something a little bit different than the last time. Even though the undercover cop drama and the gangster film dates way back, you think you are seeing something totally new and innovative in ""The Departed"". And to praise Nicholson one more time (it can't hurt) he is absolutely terrifying and damned funny at the same time. De Niro, eat your heart out."
"DKosty123","8","1","3","6 May 2007"," Solid Film - Rare Best Picture
","This is not the first time the Best Picture has been won by a remake although several plot changes were made between this film & prequel Internal Affairs. What is interesting is how the performers & performances work out. While Leonardo Di'Caprio & Matt Damon are considered the stars, this film is literally stolen by veteran Jack Nicolson. Alec Balwin's role is almost non-existent in this one.<br/><br/>Without Jack, none of the other actors performances would be as meaningful. Jack is the center of the plot. Even with the re-writing of the script, there is still a bit of a hole in why his crime boss trusts the undercover man in his operation. Never the less, because of Jack's over the top performance, you buy it. If you didn't, this movie falls apart.<br/><br/>Another key performance in this is by newcomer Kristen Dalten. She plays a key role in the triangle between the 2 main characters well. I am not sure what she will be in next, but her role in this was really over-looked & she plays it perfectly. Whose baby she is carrying is never fully explained at the end.<br/><br/>The original film was set on the west coast, this one moves to Boston. There are some too rare good touches by the script & a lot is left to the imagination. That part is good. The over the top reliance on 4 letter word language is good for shock value & humor, but almost detracts from the film, though it is noticeable that as the action starts to dominate, the language is not there as often.<br/><br/>As often happens with a re-write, how the ending is handled does not make perfect sense, but the crowning touch to me - spoiler- is the symbolic use of a rat on the balcony in the final scene. This is well set up. I have to agree, this is Martin Scorchese best film in years, heads & tails above Gangs Of New York for example.<br/><br/>The ending is one-ups-man-ship at it's finest as it is all about reaching back from the grave."

","I share a lot of the same frustration with this film that others have expressed. A little too much gore, a little spare on the plot, and too abrupt an ending.<br/><br/>Deeper still are a few things that bother me. Would love others to weigh in on these.<br/><br/>1) Am I to believe that modern day, 2006 Boston is still ruled by cheap thugs extorting money from the neighborhood little shop keepers? Is this 1940? You mean you can't open a motorcycle shop without paying ""protection""? If this still happens, why does anyone open up a shop? It's not like they are naive people just off the boat in New York trying to make a living! The shakedown scenes seemed like they belonged in another decade. Maybe I am wrong, but does that still go on? <br/><br/>2) Who would work for Nicholson? He doesn't possess any even slimy charm and I can't imagine the young Damon character staying involved with him for years. The guy is like someone's perverted grandad and inspires 0 confidence as a leader.<br/><br/>3) No police department anywhere would tolerate wide open disrespect and constant F-word. I mean, in the middle of a briefing! Come on. A little f here and there sure. But PDs are highly political animals, and the Marky Mark character would have been off the force quicker than anyone, despite how well he supposedly does his job. The rapport may have been humorous, but it made the film like a comic book.<br/><br/>4) Was every single officer either on the take, a mole, profane or all of the above? There didn't seem like one balanced officer was in the department.<br/><br/>5) After the captain was thrown from the roof, it's hard to believe that the guys in the van got away. In downtown Boston, in a van with broken out windows, in daylight, after shooting up a bunch of cops--and no one pursues. No how no way.<br/><br/>6) Do cell phones survive a 6 story drop? Heck, I dropped mine from 3 feet and it broke.<br/><br/>I can't say I didn't enjoy the movie, but it was pretty much a formula thing. I saw the Marky Mark thing coming, I know others did too. This is quite a fall from the likes of Casino and especially Goodfellas as far as crime films from this great director.<br/><br/>For a Scorcese film, a disappointment. In a land of filled with the likes of Sin City, Devil's Rejects, and Quentin Tarentino, this is a jewel!"
"Doc-134","10","1","3","21 March 2007"," Scorsese Proves That a Remake Should Never Automatically be Dismissed
","""I don't wanna be a product of my environment; I want my environment to be a product of me.""  Frank Costello <br/><br/>Memorable quotes are abundant in Martin Scorsese's new thriller, ""The Departed"", but none of them describe the theme of the film quite as elegantly as the one above. Frank Costello, portrayed with devilish glee by the great Jack Nicholson is a man who demands absolute control over everything around him and will stop at nothing to exude his will in obtaining it. What's interesting about this film is that this sort of machismo persona is evident in many of the male characters we meet, no matter which side of the law they reside. These guys are almost over the top to the point of being comical, but it helps to create characters that blur the line between the good/bad dichotomy. Take for instance the character of Dignam (Mark Wahlberg), a police officer who is every bit as nasty and belligerent as Costello - maybe worse. Ellerby (Alec Baldwin), is also an example of this. All of these guys think they can control themselves, each other and their environment, but of course nothing is further from the truth.<br/><br/>""The Departed"" stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan, a young cop who is sent undercover to infiltrate the Boston Irish mob led by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Meanwhile, Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon) who has been nurtured from the point of childhood by Costello now works for the police department's Special Investigation Unit (the unit ultimately responsible for taking Costello down) allowing him to provide inside information. Tension builds at an expeditious rate when both the police and the mob realize that there is a traitor among them and that both Costigan and Sullivan are in danger of losing their cover. Parallels between cops and criminals are again drawn when both men are called on to test their loyalty to the other side under intense life or death situations. As Costello himself says ""When you're facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?"" The character foils depicted in ""The Departed"" remind me a lot of what Michael Mann has previously done in films such as ""Heat"" and ""Collateral"", but they also further Scorsese's own canon of work, building on the greatness of films such as ""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"", ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"". Scorsese is very interested in the psyche of alienated loners on the edge and he also likes to explore the notion of 'betrayal'. These motifs are evident in much of his work. In ""The Departed"" Costigan and Sullivan are both loners and are each guilty of at least one betrayal. Ultimately, the real question becomes; whom have they betrayed? This question is not easily answered.<br/><br/>A review of ""The Departed"" would not be complete without a discussion of the film's technical marvels. Thelma Schoonmaker, who has edited every Scorsese film since ""Raging Bull"", creates a desperate energy, which reflects very well the emotional states of Costigan and Sullivan, while also keeping us eager to see what happens next. Schoonmaker has an ability to create cohesion out of chaos. In the hands of a lesser talent, this type of editing would overshadow characterization and plot drastically, but like all great film editors, she is able to reflect a film's themes, mood and emotional states through choice of style.<br/><br/>Michael Ballhaus, who has been Scorsese's cinematographer several times in the past, also deserves much praise. He should especially be commended for bringing Boston to life like no one has ever done. I am fascinated by cities in film and when they are photographed so well that they become a character in themselves, it is truly a delight. ""The Departed"" is all Boston, and while a few scenes were filmed in New York, you would never know.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that ""The Departed"" has by enlarge been hailed a masterpiece by the critical community, some have criticized Scorsese for being a ""sell-out"" or ""going too mainstream"". Others just feel the film is completely unoriginal. It must be said that ""The Departed"" is in fact a remake of a 2002 Hong Kong film called ""Infernal Affairs"". I have not seen this film and therefore cannot comment on its quality, but I will say that to automatically dismiss ""The Departed"" because it's a remake is very unfair. Normally, I am skeptical of remakes myself, but it is quite obvious that Scorsese and his screenwriter William Monohan have crafted their own vision of this material and as a result, it easily stands on its own. Those who have seen other Scorsese pictures know what I mean.<br/><br/>There are many reasons to like ""The Departed"", as I've discussed, but I think the most important thing is that ultimately this film is just a purely enjoyable crime/gangster drama. In fact, I will go so far as to say that this is one of the four or five best gangster films of all time with the likes of ""Goodfellas"", ""Scarface"" and ""The Godfather""."

All characters are more caricatures who spout clichéd dialog than real people. And no: Its not only Nicholson, who goes way over the top. The screenplay is the main offender, though: There is no real character development (a bit whining by DeCaprio and a mumbled, half-hearted desire for ""a clean slate"" by Damon are no more than lip-service). And the end of the film - everything after Costello's death - is a complete mess, with plot holes as big as Nicholson's ""marital aid"" in the movie theater scene (why goes Costigan on the run, after he discovers who Sullivan is. Wouldn't it be easier to just tell Dignam or the Baldwin character?), and sloppy story-telling (for instant: what about the letter, Costigan gives the shrink?). Then there is the pace of the thing: I'm by no means a fan of MTV-Style editing and I hate most of Tony Scott's movies, but this thing is not only slooooow moving - it is without a real rhythm. Some things are terribly rushed and others are explained in painstakingly, boring detail.Very strange for a seasoned pro like Scorsese.

Then if your f***ing family doesn't f***ing pay it I'll f***ing kill them too."" its unrealistic. Then the violence is disgusting. WHen one of the main characters gets capped blood splats all over the windows and same goes for everyone else. <br/><br/>Pros: Somewhat decent story. Good cast. DiCaprio and Walhberg were particularly good.<br/><br/>Cons: see above.<br/><br/>Content: A 5 out of 5 on the disgusto meter. There is a crap load of sex references, violence and language.

"Xex-Arachnid","10","1","3","7 March 2007"," God damn! This was the best movie of the year.
","Martin Scorcese by now, has left enough of an imprint of his work that we the audience can recognize his work by things such as extreme violence, 70's rock music, racism and the building and destruction of his characters. The Aviator was a good movie and despite his years in the game, I feel that he's more renown for 'GoodFellas' but I must say that this movie shows that he's honed his craft and being that it contains all of the base elements of his signifying work (as mentioned in the first paragraph) it seems that it's the same stuff and I don't know what the hell I am talking about but by watching it, I don't know, you can just tell. I guess he felt that it's time for him to get a couple of Oscars and if that's the case, this man has hit a home run! No spoilers here but I will say that this movie has to do with the Irish mafia and how they deal with things amidst the corruption and the suffering of trying to stay on the right track amidst loosing your life by slipping up or forgetting who you are. And all the actors (you do have an excellent cast of ACTORS in this) have done an excellent job but Jack Nicholson stole the show with his character. You have close to four hours of pure entertainment and it's good from the beginning to the end!"

","In my opinion, no doubt this is one of the best suspense/thriller movies ever produced in the history of cinematography. I really like the way the plot unfolds excepting one particular scene where Colin Sullivan kills Frank Costello after having a lengthy private conversation, where the cops hunting high and low for Costello in the same place - hard to believe that they had enough time to have a exchange of words privately in such a situation. But if you have watched The Godfather trilogy, ""Goodfellas"", ""Untouchables"",""L.A. Confidential"", ""Casino"", ""scarface"" and liked those - guys this is a movie you should never miss."
"DonutLover","8","1","3","6 March 2007"," Great Lover
","***This comment does have spoilers!!!****<br/><br/>This movie was like a fine dinner, real enjoyable, parts of it delicious and just long enough. I honestly thought that Leo DiCaprio is an excellent actor, and even though I'm sure that that's been obvious to many people before, I really just saw it for the first time in this movie, how complex, and realistic his acting is. His expressions in so many scenes are just straight on. There's one thing about the movie that I really liked, and something that I found a little hard to swallow.<br/><br/>First of all, I loved the contrast of the guy you hate, versus the guy you love. Leo is of course the one we love and root for. I wasn't really sure if Matt Damon's character (Sullivan) was despicable, until it was shown in the light of his relationship with Madolyn. Because both guys had a relationship with her, it enabled the writer or director to show their differences. Sullivan (Damon) doesn't want her picture hung in his house, so he makes some lame excuse and puts it away in the bedroom. Apparently she brings it home, probably feeling quite rejected (should be a huge red flag for her, but she ignores it) but then when Castigan (DiCaprio) shows up, unannounced, it's the first thing he notices. He picks the picture up gently, and tells her that he knows that it's her. Then, instead of putting it back on the table, he spots a little nail in the wall, and hangs it there. He does the complete opposite of Sullivan.<br/><br/>Also, in the conversation that Sullivan is having with Costello (Nicholson's character), the (particular) pleasure that Sullivan gets from Madolyn is referenced to, whereas when DiCaprio finally shows up at Madolyn's house, and they make love, it looks like it's going to be (or start out, at least) with him, lovingly making HER happy. He's giving, grateful and attentive, as opposed to the cold Sullivan. The camera cuts away just in time, and I think that love scene was very well done. Having ""comfortably numb"" playing in the background, also made it very emotional, and sweet. I don't know who that vocalist was, but I didn't mind that it wasn't Pink Floyd. It's a great song, any which way you slice it. Also, the fact that a real life looking actress was utilized, without obviously enhanced breasts and lips, is movie making at it's best. I just loved those contrasts, and also the way DiCaprio was so ""vulnerable"", as she put it.<br/><br/>I was, however, just the tiniest bit uncomfortable with the question of Sullivan's sexual orientation. Whether he was straight, but had (what they call now)ED, or whether he was gay, and using her as a cover to look straight, was a little unfair in my opinion. He is our ""bad guy"", so I guess I felt like especially in our day of political correctness, to make the bad guy impotent on top of everything, or gay, was a little risky. But then again, the movie's about tough bad guys back east, so I guess that being gay wouldn't be too welcome with that group of thugs. I think it took some balls for Scorsese to do that. Couldn't he be criticized for that? I have not seen the other movie which this story is based on, so I can't compare the two. But, I also felt that the rise of Sullivan in the dept. was a bit rushed, and unrealistic. He wouldn't be the only guy with a spic and span record, yet he was promoted to this elite unit. That didn't set too well with me. Other than that, I thought it was really great. The lame DVD I had gave out at one point, and I had to fast forward to get past the blip, so maybe I missed why Madolyn decided to stay with Sullivan, instead of the very sexy Castigan. Also, Alec Baldwin had a few funny lines, delivered well. And Mark Walburg's character was unchanging, but satisfying, in the end. I recommend this movie for adult viewing, if you like good cops and robbers stories, and don't mind a bunch of blood, and 4 letter words."
"kt3234-1","3","1","3","5 March 2007"," Not Scorsese's Best
","The Departed did not deserve Best Picture, I'm sorry to say. In my opinion, it was Little Miss Sunshine. Anyway, The Departed is just Scorsese being forced into a movie that he was required to make. While the movie did have Scorsese's direction, it didn't have the Scorsese feel.<br/><br/>First, the casting. Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't give his best. His over the top hysterical kid-at-Toy's-R-Us attitude didn't help me get sucked into the movie. I was very aware that I was watching some actor read his lines. I had no idea what Matt Damon was doing in there either. Matt Damon is just like his character; he's been slipped in. Jack Nicholson is perfect in anything you give him. I really enjoyed his energy. Mark Wahlberg also. His years of strong work give him the perfect attitude when it came to being a cop.<br/><br/>Second, the way it was put together. Scorsese doesn't use all of his God-given traits. There is violence, but not realistic violence. The fight that occurred in the market seemed stylized, and didn't even flow. There isn't any of the classic Scorsese music. None of the soundtrack in the film even compares to the mood or setting. Scorsese had it in Goodfellas and in Casino and among many others, but he doesn't use it in The Departed.<br/><br/>Last, the hype. The Departed didn't deserve any of the awards except for Best Adapted Screenplay. I felt the Best Director Oscar was just a gimme, because Scorsese hadn't received one. It was as if they were saying 'Well, there's nobody good in the competition, so let's just give it to Scorsese.' The Departed didn't deserve Best Picture because it wasn't a Best Picture. In my opinion, it was Scorsese's worst. He didn't have his usual edge, and that's what we expect from a Scorsese picture."
"Boinie57","6","1","3","5 March 2007"," Good story but very hard to follow
","Not Scorcese's best. A long, hard to follow movie comes to a satisfying conclusion but overall it was the least of my favorites of the 2006 Oscar nominated movies. The acting was superb but the direction was choppy. Scorcese is a master of his game but this is not the movie that should have provided him with his 1st Oscar. Raging Bull and Taxi Driver were superior films. Jack Nicholson should have been nominated again for another Oscar. What was Oscar thinking this year? They have not been on the top of their game when it comes to best picture lately. If you want to see a great film, rent or buy Babel. In my opinion it was the best of 2006."
"specter_3","6","1","3","4 March 2007"," The irony
","This movie is a perfect copy of an Asian movie 'Mou gaan dou' (Infernal Affairs) which was by far much better. Everybody is saying that this movie is very good, but the only thing that Scorsese did was to put the actors in the movie to do exactly like in the Asian movie, so I don't see why is he getting all the credit. After seeing Infernal Affairs this movie didn't impressed me at all, but made me feel sad that they can't come with an original idea like the Asian movies are made. Hollywood should learn from them. Just watch the original movie and see what I mean. I just can't understand why only the movies that are made at Hollywood win Oscars, and many of them are remake of so much better movies (Asian movies in general) which don't get such awards. It's just unfair."

","The Departed is without a shadow of a doubt the best movie the past few years have to offer. Everything adds up in a way movie fans never even dreamed of imagining before. Scorsese's style and panache start at an incredibly high standard and never waver, the script is absolutely genius and calling the acting top-notch is the worst understatement ever written. The story has so many possibilities, and chooses exactly those paths that give the spectators what they want, without turning the whole thing into a clichÃ©. Scorsese more than deserved the Oscar for this magnificent piece of film history. I needed two days to recover from this absolute work of art."
"hosolo","7","1","3","1 March 2007"," Good not great action movie
","The Departed is a cops and mobsters movie which garnered critical acclaim and a Best Picture award but after seeing it, I began to wonder why the other nominated films didn't win. Even though IMDb score is high, the public reaction seems divided. As an action flick, it's satisfies with lots of foul language, bloodshed, gunfire and enough violence to keep you awake. The plot centers around an Boston detective (Damon), an undercover cop (DiCaprio) and a mobster named Frank Costello (Nicholson). Each character is trying to sniff a ""rat"" out of their operation. That's what makes this movie so interesting. Damon starts out to be the good guy be he isn't. DiCaprio isn't really the bad guy either. Nicholson is the villain throughout, but he's also an FBI informant, which did not make sense to me, since his character murders people. Mark Wahlberg, plays a foul-mouthed wise-ass detective and he got a supporting actor nomination for this movie in which he has much less screen time than his other big co-stars. I stuck with this movie because I wanted to know who was going to get who first, and how they would do it, but sometimes the dialogue just stretched too long, and the movie itself seemed like it should have ended 20 minutes earlier. It's hard to sit through a movie and not have anyone to root for (I wanted Leo to get the rat at the police dept.), and it's really hard when the audience knows who the rat is but the characters on-screen are celebrating the rat's deceptive achievements. Now I kind of wished Little Miss Sunshine had won, but at least The Departed had an action movie's version of a happy ending,"

"jackjack-2","6","1","3","1 March 2007"," OverRated Piece of Bad Fiction
","Ironically, this was the only Best Picture nomination that I not viewed so I rented the day of the Acedamy Awards and played it after it had received the Best Picture Award. I was quite disappointed. If this was the best movie of 2006 then 2006 was really a down year for the movies, which it was. This movie is a piece of very distorted fiction like all of Scorsese movies Perhaps I lost my respect for the movie because the story began so badly. It was unreal as was much of the movie and hence it had no credibility which is often a characteristic of Martin Scorsese directed movies. It begins when Colin Sullivan who is fresh out of the police academy is immediately assigned as a detective. That doesn't happen in real life, no matter how good a cadet is. Police officers routinely spend at least one year and in most cases two years on probation as patrol officers so that they can learn the ropes. They are rookies. Making it worse, Sullivan is promoted to sergeant shortly after becoming a detective. Again, never happens.<br/><br/>The same is true of Billy Costigan, who graduates from the Police Academy at the same time as Sullivan. He is immediately assigned as an undercover cop. Never happen. Until he learns the ropes as a patrol officer, he is not going to find himself undercover. And while undercover, he shows an exceptional amount of sophistication that only an experienced police officer would show.<br/><br/>Next dumb thing, is the Police Captain in charge of Costigan goes to meet him alone, without any backup. If he was that stupid, he never would have made captain.<br/><br/>And Mob Chief Frank Costello executes two people on the edge of major airport runway in broad daylight where everyone on airplanes landing or taking off can see him. Yeah! Since when do Mob Chiefs do the executions? But it is a typical Scorsese scene and there are several such unreal scenes in the film.<br/><br/>I think that if anyone but Scorsese had directed this film it would have been a better film. My thought is that for sentimental reasons, the Academy wanted to give Scorsese an Oscar as director and that the voters had to give the movie an Oscar to justify the director's Oscar."

","Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, and Mark Whalberg are among an all-star in one of the best gangster flicks in years. The preview is at times confusing, especially because in the quick shots Damon and Dicaprio almost look like the same person. Dicaprio is Billy Costigan, a trainee cop who is approached by two cops (Martin Sheen and Mark Whalberg in his first Oscar nominated performance) with an offer. He will go undercover in the gang of Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) to infiltrate and bring him down once and for all. At the same, one of Frank Costello's men, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is infiltrating the police and has just become a detective.<br/><br/>Each scene is as entertaining, thorough, and well-written as the next, and you can tell Scorsese really pushed himself here to really engage the viewer. There is a good balance of dialogue and violence, and when the violent scenes come they are truly eye-popping. The language is rough at times, but needed and welcome.<br/><br/>The only reason why I do not give this movie a straight A is the ending. Without giving anything the way, it is quite abrupt and almost cartoonish.<br/><br/>Overall, this is worth at least two viewings, and possibly worth being in your DVD collection. It is also worthy of multiple Oscars."
"maurice_84","Null","1","3","22 February 2007"," Why isolate Scorsese on the mean streets?
","There is, indeed, a lot of hype around the film, some unjustified. I agree with reviewers who found Nicholson's performance overwrought--a hambone variation on the Down-and-Dirty bit he's been doing for over thirty years. DiCaprio, Sheen, Baldwin, and particularly Wahlberg and Winstone are fine. But Vera Farmiga, however much she's hyped as portraying a ""stong"" character, doesn't do much for me. She's a psychiatrist who becomes involved with *two* patients, moves in with one (after only four months??) and gets pregnant, apparently on purpose (one might assume a medical professional would know where babies come from). She's an over-dressed substitute for a character. Frankly, Cameron Diaz' turn in ""Gangs of New York"" was much stronger.<br/><br/>But what really bothers me is that critics are *raving* over this slickly vapid variation on Scorsese's admittedly brilliant ""Mean Streets."" Why force him to repeat this formula until he's finally awarded an Oscar? I suspect it's because many in the industry don't believe a working-class Italian-American is worthy of making films of literary classics (""Age of Innocence"") or historic films (""The Aviator,"" ""Gangs of New York""). I once heard a scholar remark in a presentation that Scorsese must have been ""intimidated"" by the setting and characters of Wharton's novel *because* he was just a working class guy. By extension, Hollywood seems unable to believe Scorsese deserves credit for being able to ""stretch"" beyond his ethnic and class origins with any authenticity. Why isolate Scorsese on the mean streets? Because it's easier to typecast--even with directors."

The only ones that got the accent right were Wahlberg and Damon, both from the area, although Baldwin almost nailed it. Sheen and Nicholson failed miserably with the accent, though. DiCaprio was the best of the lot as far as his overall performance, and Nicholson the worst, only because he still felt compelled to do his ""Jack"" thing.

","Just saw The Departed this afternoon and have to say that after all the hype--billed as a return to form for Scorsese--I am very disappointed. Gangs of New York is far superior as far as his recent outings go.<br/><br/>Scorsese's recent transference of old familiar themes (religion, sex, racism, violent pursuit of ""success"") from Italian Americans to Irish Americans is an admirable pursuit, but somehow not as meditatively treated as in the old days. At 2 1/2 hours, he may as well have given us a 3-hour movie with more heart and introspection. Somehow I felt that I could've sympathized with either or both of the main characters, if only I was given more background--not words, but actions. It felt like, OK, here's Matt Damon and here's Leonardo DiCaprio, you've seen them before, so why go into their backgrounds or histories. Too bad, because it could've been so rich, especially for the Damon character--as the ""traitor"" he was also capable of moments of real warmth and ambivalence.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson did a good job, as always, but sometimes I felt like it was a joke for him--are we watching the character or the actor? He did not bring the weight to the movie that he is capable of, or that a more serious actor such as Daniel Day-Lewis did to his comparably evil Bill the Butcher in Gangs of New York.<br/><br/>And are you kidding me? How could Frank not know who the traitor in his midst was? Why not kill the main suspect just to be safe? His bond with DiCaprio was very weak.<br/><br/>Sorry. I like Matt Damon; he's capable of real depth. Too bad his skills weren't used to their fullest potential. The supporting cast, especially Mark Wahlberg, was solid. I just found myself wondering how much of the movie was contrived to either adhere to or deviate from the original Japanese movie.

Is it a timeless classic like Means Streets, Raging Bull or Goodfellas? No no no...<br/><br/>We all know the story by now, so I wont bore you with details regarding that. I will tell you about the ""components"" of the movie and why we are not witnessing whats supposed to be the movie of 2006: Acting: Most of the actors are doing a fine job. Am I the only one thinking Jack is over-acting most of the time? I don't know, the only actor who surprised me was Mark Wahlberg. Very good performance from him.<br/><br/>Directing: Run-of-the-mill style. Very professional of course and he (Scorsese) keeps things exciting but it certainly lacks passion and humour. Not very Scorsese-ish.<br/><br/>Story: Unbelievable and a bit silly for 2006, the story is easily the movies weakest link. Has kind of an 80s feel to it (and yes, in a bad way. the 80s sucked). Source material is VERY overrated.<br/><br/>Music: Sub-par. The Stones are being re-used (this is a Scorsese movie after all) to no good effect. Goodfellas, it ain't.<br/><br/>Perhaps I had too high hopes, its been a while since we had a classic Scorsese flick (Casino, although flawed, is the last one I can think of) and this is not it.

Billy and Costigan are the same person... Take my notice... The film than turns out to be a very very interesting one. Watch it again with those eyes. You will find interesting points.<br/><br/>The scenes of Martin Scorsese sometimes are very enthusiastic in meaning. The best scene was Vedolyn and Costigan's love scene. Not the scene but one of the song I do love most. ""Comfortably Numb"" was playing at the background. Which is a perfect match. Whom did it remind me ? Kubrick Of course. The philosopher king. Anyway Departed is a good, enough, philosophical film."

","OK, so I am a die hard Godfather fan. As well as Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas, Casino & Gangs of New York. But this film is by far Scorsese's greatest work. This film is a work of art in all aspects, from Nicholson's eccentric character to Wahlberg and DiCaprios feuding characters, to the immersive plot and character depth, The Departed has it all. <br/><br/>SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

My jaw was floored, I loved it. I loved this movie, it kicks ass!!! I can't wait to see it again this weekend, and buy it February 13!!! its going at the front of my mom film collection. 10/10, 4 stars, and the Oscars suck because this movie should be nominated for ever award possible!!! Martin Scorsese, you are a genius!!!"
"BumbleBoo","10","1","3","23 January 2007"," Excellent a must see movie
","Both my wife and I were wrecked from nervous tension, the movie held you from beginning to end and can't say enough for di Caprio's acting, it is certainly his best yet as he moves into heavy weight roles and shows that he can handle them. The whole cast were really excellent and of course the director Martin Scorcesse scored an absolute triumph...can he ever top this one! The realism was gripping and you forgot that there was a camera crew filming because you were drawn into the action. No question a great movie and well deserves any awards going. One can really imagine the great stress of being an under-cover policeman and di Caprio drew us into his great torment by his psychiatrist sessions and pill taking. Ray Winstone was another classy piece of acting. I left Jack Nicolson until last because his acting is just head and shoulders above just about everybody in the business. This was a portrayal of a gangster supreme and did he love blood, he was so scary and someone you just don't want to meet because you never know which way he will turn!"

But Damon, he is just playing the same character as always, same mimic, etc...Marky Mark with that hair, he was hilarious.The good old Nicholson, well he wanted to play an evil character, I think he was anything but evil, the truth is that he was quite funny, while i was watching the film i haven't felt for even a minute that he is a dangerous person at all. The movie was really boring, i am just REALLY don' t get it why the people think this is a great film. I tell you guys. THIS IS NOT A GOOD MOVIE.

"fongniur","5","1","3","18 January 2007"," Pathetic Plagiarism
","This movie simply doesn't compare with its original Hong Kong version ""Infernal Affairs"" (IA).<br/><br/>The plot line of this movie always reminds me of a Chinese proverb which goes:""Hua she tian zu."" literally meaning ""to add some feet to the drawing of a snake"". That's the way the script goes and it creates a MONSTER. In the original trilogy, the Buddhist philosophy of suffering is well-depicted through the story of the mole and informant. The cop's informant didn't die in the end, but he definitely suffers more than the departed mole. He lives a life in a deep state of remorse. However, the newly adapted ending of this movie doesn't seem to be any clever to me. In fact, it looks more like the feet added to a snake, which ruin the whole picture.<br/><br/>The cinematography of IA far surpasses that of The Departed. The tone of the picture is in grey and blue which arouses the feeling of depression and helplessness. While in this ""plagiarized"" version, the scene is much less impressive, less organized and difficult to relate to.<br/><br/>One more thing I'd like to point out is that I value the pacing and suspense more than anything else in a thriller. However, The Departed fail to inherit the flawless and breathtaking style of IA and what I've seen is a bunch of whiny and ill-tempered guys throwing swear words to each other all the time. What a shame! In a thriller, the editing and music generally speak louder than words. and Scorses obviously has failed to understand that. <br/><br/>My rating: 5/10"
"charette-3","4","1","3","15 January 2007"," What's with the ending? first gory, then unexplainable
","I kind of enjoyed the steady buildup, the decent acting (Nicholson overdoes it as usual, Vera is surprisingly good, lots of subtlety and complexity to her play, would love to see her again in something else, Damon and diCaprio are as usual, Baldwin is the most solid of them all), before it fell apart like a bad re-enactment of Reservoir Dogs. There are just no clues that would enable you to see this ending coming. Plus, I am completely puzzled by Dignam's (Walhberg) motivation: is it just revenge for the killing of his boss? or was he also a rat? With a movie this long, you could have stretched the ending to show an ending where Damon's self-destructs and never recovers from the whole thing, even if he survives. Basically, the ending ruined it for me, turned a solid movie into an insult to moviegoers' intelligence, I will scream if it wins an Oscar...<br/><br/>Go see The Last King of Scotland for an Oscar-winning performance by Forest Whitaker and a moving and troubling movie."

"tnrcooper","10","1","3","11 January 2007"," Fantastic tense, complicated, well-acted, dark mob movie
","Great movie. Scorsese back on familiar footing. We are definitely seeing him from his good side here. He even uses ""Gimme Shelter"" in the soundtrack as he did in ""Goodfellas"". If it ain't broke right? And he elicits Leo DiCaprio's best performance since.....well, from what I've heard though I haven't seen it, The Basketball Diaries ('95). Anyway, the movie is a re-make of a Hong Kong flick named Wu jian dao (2002), English title ""Infernal Affairs"" and one of the screenwriters in the original, Siu Fai Mak, gets a writing credit in this one too.<br/><br/>The story is about two moles, both undercover, one in the mob (DiCaprio), and one in the police force (Damon). They come to learn about one another, not their specific identities, but at least of the existence of one another, and they become gradually more intent on exposing the identity of the other knowing that their identity might soon be revealed. It is a fantastic movie, nicely nuanced and appropriately complex without losing the thrill of the chase. Scorsese paces the movie energetically and with enough regard for fleshing out his characters as well. Jack Nicholson is fantastic, revealing all of the characteristics that have made him so vulnerable to parody in recent years but simultaneously offering those very features which have made him a legend. This is a fine performance and he deserves an Oscar nomination, as does DiCaprio, who, playing the young man from the wrong side of the tracks, ultimately shows himself to be more upright than Damon (excellent as usual)'s widely respected, but ultimately treacherous cop. Fantastic supporting turns from Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, and Vera Farmiga as the woman caught between the two moles.<br/><br/>This film was deservedly placed on many Top Ten lists of the best of the year pictures. It is a fantastic movie and stands up to repeated viewings which you will most likely desire in order, possibly, to trace the machinations of the movie. The movie is not that complicated though, so you may just want to go to recognize some of the best movie-making around."

","What people see in this film, I don't. I first watched this movie in poor quality, and therefore didn't think much of it. But I watched it again in DVD quality, and still I am little impressed. The original Infernal Affairs was a psychological genius that bided its time to give a slow moving yet well balanced suspense. *Spoilers* The relationship and friendship the lead characters had were touching, and with Tony Leung's character, you could feel his emotion and pain. But the Departed didn't give me such feeling. None of the characters were memorable, none of them likable, the female lead bedding both guys like they really both were her husband and both guys didn't mind, and of course, neither did she. The most ironic and hated part was the usage of Chinese triads - who can't even speak Chinese properly! Why do Hollywood filmmakers do this? They should know that other Cantonese spoken people will watch this? And being racially spoken to by Frank - this ironic in a sense that... the original film is Chinese! There's a lot more to complain about this film. The beginning, the middle and especially the end! I'm just thoroughly annoyed by watching this movie. Better than Goodfellas? You've got to be kidding me!"
"MrSharma","9","1","3","9 January 2007"," Scorsese's best in years...
","America's greatest living director crafts an ingenious story of deception, lies, violence, crime, sex; all while simultaneously painting a picture of a post 9/11 world of despair and eliciting brilliant performances from an incredible cast of actors, exploring characters of depth and vitality in this cop-crime thriller.<br/><br/>From the very first shot of the film, you will be hooked and drawn into this precarious world of aggression and uncertainty, as both Scorsese and the characters take you on a ride of crime. Structurally, the film is Scorsese's best since Goodfellas, as once more he shows his affinity for innovating conventional genres and creating something quite new and breathtaking in the world of cinema. His ability to use editing, cinematography and various other modes of cinematic technique to consolidate the thematic intentions of the film is nothing short of genius, and in itself enough to garner Marty a best Director Oscar at this year's Golden Globes.<br/><br/>Performance-wise, Scorsese demonstrates his profound ability to truly expose character's frailties, doing so suggestively and eliciting brilliant performances from all cast members involved -- whilst many are quick to recognise DiCaprio for his brilliant performance as the pressured cop-fake-criminal, Matt Damon presents a more subtle and suggestive character of complexity; a task more difficult than given credit for. Nicholson is darkly humorous in his flawless portrayal of Irish Mob Boss Frank Costello, offering a character of unlimited vitality and violent charm (if such exists). Mark Wahlberg makes his best performance yet as the cocky Detective Dignam, oozing cinematic charisma as he takes charge in each scene and grips the audience. Even the smaller performances of Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen are extremely competent, and establish a degree of credibility virtually unprecedented within modern cinema. Vera Farmiga is a little inconsistent with her Boston accent, but is subtle as her character brings out the softer and harder sides of her two main counterparts. She does her job well, and does not (contrary to conventional opinion) bring the film down.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this film just needs to be watched; in every facet, the film is brilliant. Scorsese's direction is clear throughout, as he pulls all the strings and jerks the audience this way and that in this crime thriller of lies and deception. The cast is brilliant, all tapping into their characters and doing as much to bring the audience into this cat and mouse game of cops and robbers. Most importantly, as is usual with Scorsese's best and most challenging films, we are thrust into a world devoid of conventional morality. What is good? What is bad? In this world of 'The Departed', perhaps those distinctions aren't that clear. Sit back, and enjoy being entertained and challenged at the same time.<br/><br/>Marty, it's Oscar TIME!"
"tjbb3113","9","1","3","27 December 2006"," Best Mob Movie since the Godfather Trilogy
","""The Departed"" is a scintillating crime drama that centers around Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio. Matt Damon is a crooked cop who infiltrates the Boston Police Department. He finds out all the inside information for his mentor Jack Nicholson who plays Frank Costello, a crime boss. Leo plays cop with a rough passed who is selected by Martin Sheen to infiltrate the Boston crime syndicate. In the midst of all this, Matt Damon falls in love with a psychiatrist and they get married. They become somewhat alienated, and Leonardo and the woman have an affair. Matt Damon is spot on as usual in his best role since ""Good Will Hunting"". As a member of the audience, you grow to hate him as the movie goes on. On the other hand, Leo does just as well and gains the sympathy of the audience. Jack Nicholson, not to be overshadowed, gives another good performance as a big sleaze bag. The ending is so outrageous and original that the audience is left with their jaws dropped as the credits roll. ""The Departed"" may be the best film of the year, and maybe Martin Scorcese will finally win that Oscar that has been long overdue."
"jonathan-577","6","1","3","27 December 2006"," Frustratingly enjoyable
","A frustratingly enjoyable movie, it ALMOST gets there. It's got more emotional guts/nakedness than Scorsese usually allows these days, but those guts are isolated in DiCaprio and Vera Farmiga's performances. Nicholson isn't out of control, exactly, he's just a symptom of Scorsese's tonal problems: he's playing vaudeville, while DiCaprio plays psychodrama and Farmiga and Matt Damon are playing repression. Except unlike Farmiga, Damon can't (or doesn't) suggest the complexity of what's going on under that repression. I liked how the excitement techniques were embedded in a relatively intimate, character-based approach where Goodfellas, say, is ALL direction. But as a result, when things blow up at the end, it feels pretty cheap, and I say fooey on the jokey final shot.<br/><br/>One more thing: the street-language is almost as automatic a mannerism as the Rolling-Stones-over-tracking-shot business. The homophobic stuff is put to use in terms of the themes of masculinity and role-playing, but the racist s*** is really getting old."

Boy, is he EVER! With by far the best lines of the movie and he delivers them with such relish. But it's by no means Jack's movie, Departed is strictly an ensemble piece. Leonardo Di Caprio is captivating, putting in an anguished, haunted performance of a tragic figure. Matt Damon puts in his best performance since ""Talented Mr Ripley"", with a character that is completely immoral and self-serving it is easy to loathe him. Even Jack Nicholson, the villain of the piece, is more sympathetic than Matt Damon's character. Mark Wahlberg has a ball with his character delivering his lines with aplomb and even Martin Sheen puts in a stellar performance. Vera Farmiga, easily recognisable from ""The Manchurian Candidate"", puts in a good performance of the female lead. (Lucky girl, getting to kiss both Matt and Leo!!!) The Script is excellent, the accents impeccable and the soundtrack, Oh man, the SOUNDTRACK!! Brilliant! The Dropkick Murphys are a perfect accompaniment to all the Irish gangsters.

I, for my self really liked the movie, but i wanted to share my opinion of some parts of it, especially the END, well, as you should watched everyone kills everyone and we do not know how the survivors finish?. thats the baddest part of the movie, We know Costigan gets shot by the FBI agent once the elevator door open than Brown gets shot also, once there both shot Sulivan shots the FBI agent on the head :/. i have to admit i wasn't expecting Costigan to die. When ever Sulivan comes home, he gets shot in the head by the police officer. My questions are why Sulivan gets killed? i do not think it was necessary for the movie, plus, he gets killed by the police officer, why him ? and why was he in those white socks? why not killing him as a police officer ? and show the proves ? and how did he knew ?. The story ends pretty baldy, in the end no one is happy ? Sulivan Costigan, Brown Hannan, FBI agent are all dead, police officer quit. Plus this beautiful women get to raise a child on her own. (i have to admit she is OMG wonderful). So no one is happy in the end. Well Drama is showed here! and i just wished costigan or Sullivan was alive to stay with this girl. Also, what was on that letter ? i think the one who made the movie should of shown the letter (show the girl reading it with Costigan's voice :)) so we know what he was thinking. Also an other thing iv notice : Why everyone gets shot in the head ? Anyway, the movie was great, i just came from the movie theater and I'm still thinking of it.<br/><br/>Thank You MrTouz if anyone wants to answer me about what was on the letter... or give an answer to this comment..

"niezone","9","1","3","10 December 2006"," Breath-taking, the return of the original Scorcesse.
","It has been a long time, a very long time since we last saw a powerful movie by the revered Martin Scorcesse. Many of us movie goers had been missing the director that made the streets of New York part of Hollywood's history. Amazingly enough, Martin doesn't have Robert de Niro to make him another incredible movie but instead he chose another living legend: Jack Nicholson. After he made sure he had the experienced multiple Oscar winning actor, he managed to secure an all-star cast also composed by Alec Baldwin who apparently has improved his craft with the years. However, it would be unfair not to include Leonardo DiCaprio as the one character that pulls everything together, making the movie worthy of an Academy Award Nomination for Best Picture of the Year. Di Caprio's lands his best role yet and takes it to another dimension. This is a breakthrough performance of a young Hollywood talent that many people doubted after his innocent and naive role in the very popular Titanic movie. Scorcesse goes back to basics, displaying raw characters with clear ambitions in an underground world filled with violence, greed and politics. This is a movie about deception, about loyalty and how it can be broken when you feel surrounded and with no escape. The many twists and turns makes for a unpredictable movie that delivers surprises left and right. The tension of a particular scene where Leo Di Caprio and Matt Damon face each other through a cell phone is the climax of a great movie. <br/><br/>Maybe the only flaw is that the movie lacks a message people could relate to, violence is plentiful and sometimes too much. <br/><br/>Still a great movie. A 9 out of 10."

","'The Departed', the newest Martin Scorsese picture, is his best since 'Goodfellas'. It's the classic Marty fusion of character, music and lots and lots of blood. It's possibly the year's most engaging and entertaining film.<br/><br/>Billy Costigan is a new Boston police cadet. Once passing training he goes undercover to infiltrate the operations of Mob kingpin, Frank Costello. Costigan utilizes his past familial connections through his crook of an uncle.<br/><br/>Collin Sullivan is also a rising cop. He had a rough childhood, until Frank Costello buys the family some groceries. This brings him into a world much like the one of the young Henry Hill in 'Goodfellas'. When the boss finds that the Sullivan kid's in with the cops, he knows where to get his information and get it regularly. When each group finds that the other has a mole in on their operation, they all try to decipher who's the rat. It's the highest order of the game of Cat and Mouse.<br/><br/>The performances are stellar all around, with Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Vera Farmgia and Mark Whalberg giving able support to the three principals: DiCaprio, Damon and Nicholson. Baldwin and Whalberg provide many laughs with the latter giving his best performance. Nicholson, in his scenery chewing glory, shouldn't be forgotten come Oscar night. DiCaprio creates a fully developed character with great success. Damon is at his best and Vera Farmiga is a wonderful as Damon's lover and DiCaprio's therapist.<br/><br/>The Direction is crisp and hopefully will capture Martin Scorsese his (long) overdue Oscar. <br/><br/>Nothing I can say can do service to the wonder that is 'The Departed', possibly the year's best film!"
"vostf","5","1","3","9 December 2006"," Nice build-up and terrible let-down
","The post-Casino Scorsese is a director who has nothing more to prove and seems to be content with shooting big budgets that fall into line with big concessions.<br/><br/>The Departed feels much like an impersonal movie and the most Scorsese-like feature in it are the sudden bursts of violence. Violence clearly has an important status in Scorsese's filmography, were it only because it is not gratuitous violence but the cathartic display of the animal part in male characters. But at some point in the storytelling violence hurls the rest of The Departed to hit the rail. Too much, no longer meaning anything.<br/><br/>For me the big flaw in The Departed that makes it yet another over-bloated Scorsese flick is the fact he was compelled to deal with two intertwined story lines. Yet obviously the Scorsese hero is not the clean bland Sullivan (Matt Damon) but the grim edgy Costigan (DiCaprio). The Sullivan part has nothing to do in a Scorsese movie, it's a stereotypical part which only hijacks half the runtime from the real guy. Star egos? Matt Damon's agent negotiating to have equal time with DiCaprio? Anyway it's a sorry result.<br/><br/>What makes the great Scorsese's movies so great is the flow, the fact we have a voice-over that rushes us into the action, into the heart and soul of the characters. Here Sullivan is so uninteresting they had to put a prologue to set his character, and the screen time he gets only distracts the story-telling from gaining momentum with Costigan's inner struggle.<br/><br/>On the whole The Departed would be a good thriller (and a minor Scorsese stint) but the ending makes it a very disappointing one with its deus ex machina conclusion. Never thought Scorsese could be able to deliver such a pitiful executive-like busted mess of an ending. I felt it coming as the storyline was screeching with four-reels not to take the path of fatality, not making it to convert a nice ensemble piece to stay more with Costigan, our genuine tragic hero, the only one we truly care for.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I have now seen Infernal Affairs, the original Chinese movie, and the only points where the Americans have improved on the original material are 1/a better characterization for DiCaprio and Nicholson's parts 2/a slower rhythm more suitable to this story yet 50 min in excess (150' vs. 100') are twice too much. Infernal Affairs looks a bit rushed to fit in the 90-100' format and I have to admit the error of not insisting enough to flesh up the undercover cop was already the main problem in the original (we have very little time to feel the cop spent 10 years under cover) so The Departed has very little to be praised for. Even more so pumping up the Godfather part with the Nicholson impersonation proves detrimental, in the end, to the whole movie."

I do agree with other reviewers that ""Infernal Affairs"" is as good a film as ""The Departed"" if not a tad better. The only thing that bothered me was the ending shot of the rat crawling across the scene. I thought of it as a slight against the film-watchers intelligence. Hitting us over the head with the ""rat"" reference as if we already did not ""get"" the point of the film....I was ticked at that last shot...I thought he ""dumbed-down"" the ending.

"CarsonTrent","8","1","3","20 November 2006"," It's tough to live up to the name
","The movie takes off a bit slow and leaves certain question marks regarding the ""face-off""(by John Woo) kind of premise, which doesn't only appear far-fetched but also a bit childish, and even if it were true somehow has a comic-book feel about it. When one comes to terms with this there still remain some other plot-points insufficiently explained, like how come both of them are so successfully quick in infiltrating the structure. We are barely shown an interview both undergo which subsequently sets the premise for the cat & mouse game, but therein would have been the chance to transcend the action-genre. Comparison to, let's say Donnie Brasco, for example, would be unfair to the latter. In stead we suddenly find out that 30 minutes into the movie Di Caprio's character has already been one year undercover, and vice-versa. Character development is insufficient by Scorsese standards, and dialog is a bit wooden, proving that the Irish mafia is not quite up Scorsese's alley.This is not a usual Scorsese movie. It's an action movie with some scars moments reminding of Scorsese trade-marks, like music, violence and camera movement. Attention to detail, and that is what sets Scorsese apart from others, is shallow, in stead numerous close-ups are being used to distract. <br/><br/>This movie is NOT Scorsese's masterpiece, and I'm sure time will bury it somewhere underneath the likes of Goofellas, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Gangs of New York, Casino, The King of Comedy or Mean Streets, and this for a simple reason, the standard is set extremely high for S., and honestly this one is a bit self-indulgent and shallow.<br/><br/>However, taken by action-movie standards, it's above average, and there are some small treats for the fans of all the great cast involved, especially Di Caprio, who has studied De Niro's facial expressions lately, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg. Also I was pleased to see that S. didn't sell out on the ending, which scores some big points with me. It's not a must see for Scorsese fans, but it doesn't disappoint either."

","Well,having watched the Infernal Affairs trilogy just one day before going to The Departed,I entered the cinema,only to find out why this movie is so better compared to its predecessor. So let me start from the Chinese trilogy first... (What follows is just my opinion)<br/><br/>~Infernal Affairs was the movie that started everything...great story and....I have to admit....nice music in the moments with suspense(I liked more the music they played in IA when Yan was chasing Ming in the Cinema than the one in TD....also the ringtone of Ming's mobile when Sam called him in the end was better)...another great thing were the flashbacks which showed us how the characters grew up,from ""kids"" to adults(while in TD were just the same actors). But that's it....it was a nice story,but I think it was not complete...something was missing....perhaps some action in order to make it more interesting(just a bit,I was not asking for The Matrix) <br/><br/>~Infernal Affairs II was a bit more confusing as a story compared to IA and less original,but it had what IA lacked:Action Scenes...and I must admit that the action scenes(I mean the executions) were comparable to the Godfather...simply great...except from those,it also featured some good lines(""Evil Things Live On and Only the Good Die Young.The World Shouldn't Be Like This.It's Not a Way to Be.""-forgive me for the mistakes),but moreover(the lines) were the same as those in IA(Both the story with the two cards and the line:""Have You Ever Seen Anyone Shaking His Hand With The Dead"" were great-again sorry for the mistakes) <br/><br/>~Infernal Affairs III confused my opinion:Up to the end I hated it,but it was the ending that changed everything...that very twisted ending...I must admit that I'm a fan of twisted endings....and until the end I hated the Inspector with the Glasses,I thought he was a horrible arrogant person...but for one more time things are not what they appear to be and Andy Lau failed again on trying to be a good guy(as Sam said:""I Have Passed the Point of No Return"")...except from this whole (Great) idea of Ming's double personality,the very ending was also awesome...finishing were IA beginned(we even saw how Yan broke his hand)...<br/><br/>So,those 3 movies gave us exactly what a good cop thriller needs:Good Story,Suspense,Action,Nice Lines and a Twisted Ending... The 1st one was the present,the 2nd one the past and the 3rd one was both the future and the connection between IA and IA 2....and the story was complete<br/><br/>Now we've got the Departed; <br/><br/>Was it better that IA?Of course it was(except some small points I stated before):The whole movie is longer,deeper,has a great soundtrack and it is far more realistic than IA;everything is done more accurately and with no rush,always thanks to the bigger budget... <br/><br/>Was it Better than IA 2?Of course it was:The story is less confusing,smarter and the action scenes comparable... <br/><br/>Was it better than IA 3?(Again)Of Course it was:TD kept u on the edge of your seat from beginning to end,while IA 3 only in the end...<br/><br/>What I'm trying to say here is that The Departed succeeds where every Infernal Affairs movie(alone) fails;That's why there will be no sequel to the Departed(I don't know about a prequel)...it's already complete and doesn't lack anything...<br/><br/>And so we arrive to the final battle:The Departed against The Whole Internal Affairs trilogy:<br/><br/>Is TD better?Of Course No(although I believe that the whole trilogy slightly beats TD,because TD is always more realistic and has better acting-->Nicholson was much better that the actor playing Sam and Vera Farmiga was way hotter than the psychiatrist in IA)...The IA trilogy has more lines,more scenes,more twists,more jokes(crazy Keung was great),more action...more everything....but we must also notice that what The Departed does in 2 1/2 hours,the Infernal Affairs Trilogy does in 5 1/2 hours (moreover)...end of comment<br/><br/>I know that lots of people will find a (logic)reason to disagree with my comment,so I would like to state that everyone is free to agree&disagree with me as much as he/she likes; <br/><br/>Because this is what makes us human...Differences"
"crackheadbob007","3","1","3","15 November 2006"," Disappointing ending
","Part of the film were brilliant, and the acting for the most part was very good. Scenes, like the 'i smell a rat' scene, that could have been very corny were acted in a way that built suspense with the undercurrents and true intentions being seen in the faces. The character development seemed real-ish (particularly Di-Caprios fall from grace) but all of this good work was undone in the ending.<br/><br/>Damon and Di-Caprio, throughout the film are cutting and thrusting to expose the other and I was waiting with anticipation for some kind of showdown. There was none. Instead 3 new characters be are introduced, and then killed in the closing 5 minutes of the movie including the two leads, albeit not by each other and they do not confront.<br/><br/>Why would a showdown between the two leads be central to the entire film but never realized. Why is Mark Whalberg coming back into the film to completely destroy the symbolism of the rat in the final shot. There are no rats climbing into the police academy if the have all already been killed. So thats were I'm left, with all of the build up to conflict in the film thrown away in a few suspense-less gunshots. If the aim was to show that nothing is resolved then so be it, i still left the film disappointed that the characters could not get resolution along the lines of their motivation."

","I like Marty a lot, love his works, but that's not enough for me to hide my true opinion on this film, maybe that is the very reason why I feel the need to express my thoughts.<br/><br/>First of all, it's a remake of Infernal Affairs, no originality there. Fair enough, not every English speaking person has seen it, especially in the states, considering 80% of them don't even have a passport, it's hard enough just to imagine how they would react to anything without a white face in it.<br/><br/>Secondly, Marty should check his eye sights, or his memory. There were many obvious continuity mistakes, fight scenes, office scenes, you name it, they got it.<br/><br/>The next thing is lighting, I was actually quite surprised to see Marty allowed somebody this lousy to be in charge of lighting this film, imbalanced mixed lighting, the most obvious one was the end of the scene when Matt lies in his blood, the sunlight hits the roof front lit, at the same time, it back lits the balcony window! From a filmmaker point of view, a film with an old storyline, inadequate lighting, you will need some big names and serious attention to details to cover up the fundamental flaws in the making, still, there just wasn't enough effort to hide it.<br/><br/>Sorry Marty, you just gonna have to try harder if you want to get your hands on an Oscar, maybe, just maybe, look out for fresh new Asia market and direct an original piece there would make it easier to land yourself a golden statue.<br/><br/>Some times you just have to step away from the box to see what's really going on in the box."

","This was a pretty bad movie in my opinion. It went on for about an hour to long and was very violent. A lot of violence is not always a bad thing but when it is too serious, I think it can screw things up, and it did. The language choices, while very eloquent, were, not offensive, but offputting - although this may accurately portray life in Boston, I don't know. I was having doubts when I walked in, due to the presence of two of my least favourite actors - Leonardo Dicaprio and Matt Damon - and I was right to be worried, they were pretty bad. I gave this movie a 3 because Jack Nicholson and especially Mark Wahlberg were very good, the psychiatrist love interest was quite good, and they played Comfortably Numb in one scene."
"akira-rae","5","1","3","3 November 2006"," I don't mean to by cynical, but....
","i went for The Departed yesterday and i think Hollywood is just trying to cash in on us, ripping off a great Hong Kong triad story but not doing it any justice.<br/><br/>being a huge fan of Infernal Affairs (i've seen the trilogy tons of times), i've been looking forward to seeing the Western take on the story. The Departed is a combination of Infernal Affairs I and II, with some minor tweaks here and there to make the film gel together as one. so, a good plot, good story directed by Academy Award-winning director Martin Scorsese and starring talented actors like Leornardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson; i was somewhat hopeful that it would be a great movie. i was, of course, disappointed. it's nowhere near the Hong Kong version. nowhere near. okay, the plot was close enough (though not quite), but that's not what i'm talking about. you can say that i am bias, and i probably am, but...<br/><br/>okay, first let me tell you what i like about the movie.<br/><br/>1) it stars Leornardo DiCaprio, and he has finally stepped away from the pretty boy category; he's now very much a man, and a very dishy one at that. i've been a fan since Catch Me If You Can. well, all his movies are good, actually. save Titanic, of course. Titanic... *upchucks*.<br/><br/>2) there's Jack Nicholson, who is amusing, as usual.<br/><br/>3) Overall, it's not really all that bad. I wouldn't say that it has completely wasted my 2 and 1/2 hours. Perhaps, if you combine all the good bits together, only about 1 was wasted.<br/><br/>err, right. that's it.<br/><br/>now let me tell you what i don't like about the movie.<br/><br/>1) even though i like him, let's face it, Leornardo DiCaprio is NO Tony Leung. his performance was nowhere as intense, nowhere as electrifying.<br/><br/>2) Matt Damon is even worse than Andy Lau. i've never liked Andy Lau's acting, he's rather like deadwood. so i think it is saying a lot when i say that Matt Damon is worse. not much expression. i say, stick to The Bourne Trilogy. Jason Bourne's supposed to be rather expressionless, so he's doing very well in that.<br/><br/>3) Jack Nicholson... okay, i've got to give him some credit. he fares the nearest to the original. but when i say nearest... there's still miles apart from Eric Tsang.<br/><br/>4) Martin Sheen. Now, this is where i'm really, really upset. He plays Anthony Wong's character, but did he do it any justice? a big N.O. in Infernal Affairs, i love Anthony Wong. he is just so cool. i burst into tears when Anthony Wong died; he crashed onto the taxi and it was cut to a close-up of his face, and then even closer as the focused on his eyes and they were still open, they seem to pierce into yours, filled with regret... they tell you a story.<br/><br/>But not only was Martin Sheen a bore (his character was stolen by Mark Warlberg, who shouldn't even be in the movie, you cannot divide Anthony Wong's character into two~!), i felt no connection with him, and his death was also very insignificant. he landed with a dull thud, there were no heart-wrenching close ups (heck, you can barely see his face) , and i went, ""riiiiiiiiiiiiight. so he died. do i care? phffft. NEXT~!!"" 5) the cinematography sucks. no stylish takes from top, no zooming ins, NO SUPER COOL ALL AROUND DOLLY SHOTS, PULL-FOCUS, PANS, CUT AWAYS OR DOLLY ZOOMS (AAARGH~! DOLLY SHOOTS AND PULL-FOCUS ARE VERY IMPORTANT!!!), nothing. one of the reasons why Infernal Affairs is so engaging is because of the cinematography. a lot of emphasizing on the intensity of the moments and its characters, Infernal Affairs is the epitome of coolness personified and mega movie magic moments. The Departed? Just.Not.Cool.Enough.<br/><br/>6) the Chinese people in the story. they are SUPPOSEDLY FROM MAINLAND CHINA, but THEY DON'T SPEAK MANDARIN, they speak CANTONESE??? okay, so maybe they are from Guangdong or something, but THEIR CANTONESE S**K either way. those actors are obviously Americans, they have VERY HEAVY American ACCENTS. and it was mixed up with a bit of mandarin, they actors themselves were obviously confused with their own language. I CAN SPEAK CANTONESE A LOT BETTER, and that's saying something. seriously, they should either:- a) find non-American Chinese actors who speaks Cantonese properly; or b) DON'T say that they are from mainland China. say they are from the local Chinatown or something.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese definitely did not do enough homework. really, in those 10 minutes (which seemed like eternity) i didn't know whether to laugh or cry. as a Chinese, i felt insulted and violated. also, this has spurred me to start speaking more in Cantonese from now on.<br/><br/>the verdict? i would say that The Departed is a good movie if Infernal Affairs had not been made. this is one example where, there are just some things that us Asians know better. but do watch the movie, just so that you can have a great time comparing it to the original, like what i just did. after that, have an Infernal Affairs Trilogy marathon back home and say, ""see? this is better."" every now and then. it gives you a great sense of well-being."

","I'm sorry but I cannot just sit here and allow this to happen. What Iam wondering is when Martin is going to make a movie that doesn't resemble the work of a recently enrolled film school student. Leaving pieces of the plot unexplained and using plot that is not even germaine. I was not surprised or shocked by the elevator scene nor was the ending something totally out of the blue. Is Martin trying to become Hollywood's best cliché director? I will say that Leonardo finally gave a performance worth watching. How long has it been since Gilbert Grape anyway? This movie had potential and then the credits started and Ileft the theatre wondering to myself how I could get my money back. Martin, your boring me to tears and you owe me $5.25."

","I haven't watched the Asian original - though the 3-pack of the entire series has been available for rental forever at my local DVD outlet! - and, frankly, now that I've seen Scorsese's 'version' of them I don't really need to either!! <br/><br/>For one thing, he manages to make the subject matter all his own: it's a veritable companion piece to MEAN STREETS (1973), GOODFELLAS (1990) and CASINO (1995). Still, I don't see this as an Oscar picture: much as I loved GANGS OF NEW YORK (2002) and THE AVIATOR (2004), I'm glad Scorsese has returned to more typical (and familiar) territory - and his stamp is all over this film, from the dynamic editing to the terrific soundtrack to the multi-layered violent-yet-likable characters (this has to be one of the most foul-mouthed mainstream films ever!).<br/><br/>The cast is top-notch and, while I've never been enthralled before with the baby-faced trio of Leonardo Di Caprio, Matt Damon and Mark Walhberg, they're all extremely convincing here (with DiCaprio delivering his most De Niroesque performance yet); as for the veterans, they add authenticity to the material which could never happen by watching the originals, because the actors would be unfamiliar to us - Jack Nicholson (his best role in years) and Ray Winstone (though he seems to be stuck with this type of character!) are effortlessly menacing, while Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin are the image of integrity itself; lovely Vera Farmiga makes the most of her difficult role (the only female character of any consequence).<br/><br/>There are flaws, however: the plot is quite convoluted and the film rather too long for its purpose (hell, it goes on for another half-hour after the Nicholson character is bumped off!) - culminating in an over-the-top, body-strewn climax (though the unexpected death of one of the leads is as shocking and powerful as Kevin Spacey's demise in L.A. CONFIDENTIAL [1997]).<br/><br/>I haven't watched that many films this year, but this is easily the best so far."

With The Departed/Internal Affairs (2006) there's an extra action spin on it.<br/><br/>I did however really enjoy the humor. Jack Nicholson as usual plays an excellent role as crazy/funny guy.

","somewhat entertaining, mainly because of the sheer star-power. But even these performances fall short - like Jack Nicholson's overwrought version of that now too familiar smarmy diabolical thing he does. And all the characters were flat - Sheen the professorly good cop; Wahlberg the unabashed, loud-mouthed crime-hating hard-ass cop; Damon, the overly Boston-ized bad cop; and poor Alex Baldwin, stuck in a SNL-like caricature of a good-natured simpleton. Otherwise, no change, no growth, no depth to any of the characters, so, therefore, thus, no compelling character driven-story. A meandering plot that takes wayyyyyy too long to climax, loaded with unnecessary, and often unresolved, and often very foreseeable sub-plots - like the hot psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga)who bangs both protagonists, then becomes pregnant, and then, walks out of the story, having contributed nothing to the plot or to our understanding of the main characters.<br/><br/>too long, and very so-so. very poor writing..."
"munrod13","Null","1","3","15 October 2006"," Yes, this movie was totally awesome.
","While this movie was quite awesome, I do not think it was as good as other Scorcese classics or by any means the best American film in ten years. Mostly for two reasons: one, character and backdrop development could have occurred earlier on and been more thorough, respectively; and two(not to give too much away), the ending was so disturbing, different, and nonchalant that it almost seemed unsuitable for a movie of this caliber, yet on the other hand it might just be what made this movie so great. It's been hard for me to decide if it was good or bad.<br/><br/>The reason I say that character development could have occurred earlier on is because the chance was there, and it might have made the difference between an Oscar caliber film and a non-Oscar caliber film. Maybe it was forfeited on Scorcese's own volition for the purpose of a building effect in the plot line, but I believe that effect could still have been achieved with some added character development early on.<br/><br/>As for the ending, I'm still on the fence about it. Something about it made me feel cheated, not just in the way that I was cheated out of a Hollywood ending (which never bothered me), but in the way that I was cheated out of an explanation of some of the characters emotions. An element to a film which to me seems important, but to other's may not. To me it is a way of providing closure with out being Hollywood and sappy, as well as telling a complete story. However, it might just be that even the kind of closure that I'm talking about is too close to Hollywood endings for comfort for some people, they have to take the risk of not telling a complete story just to squeeze the kind of movie they want out of your emotional responses. If this is the case for Scorcese in this picture then I think he did this in a way that doesn't force the emotions out of the viewer, but finesses them, much like the rest of the film, which all in all makes the ending in addition to the movie as a whole, a very fine film. Maybe it was ONE of the best American films of the past ten years after all. That's for you to judge.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading my review!"
"arthurclay","10","1","3","15 October 2006"," Saw it and absolutely loved it
","Will buy it as soon as it hits the shelves at my local video retailer. Now for the movie. It became obvious very quickly why they chose Jack Nicholson (good choice by the way), it was not only because he is a huge name first rate actor (and he is) but because he gave the film the humor and antics that it so desperately needed to break up the drama, tension, and non stop killings. Wise move Mr. Scorsese. I am the first to admit, I am not a DiCaprio fan. But it's the best performance a director has ever gotten out of him thus far. Matt Damon is terrific, Ray Winstone was solid as a rock, Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen both good picks, but I have to say I was a little disappointed in Mark Walberg as he struck me as being way too crass and obtuse even for a cop. His character was the only guy I was hoping was gonna get wasted and shoved down a drainpipe far more than Damon's or even Nicholson's character. That having been said, I look for ""The Departed"" to rake several nominations, and saints willing, some wins as well come Oscar time. Crime fans and drama lovers, flock to this film. I will most likely see it again before it leaves the big screen."
"gradyharp","10","1","3","14 October 2006"," Moles and the insidious tunnels they dig
","Martin Scorsese has another major hit on his hands with the release of the intelligent, chilling, violent, puzzling, and completely fascinating THE DEPARTED. This viewer has not seen the INFERNAL AFFAIRS on which this film is based so comparisons are not possible. But taking this film solely on its own merits this is one gripping piece of cinematic art. Beginning with a very smart script by William Monahan (apparently based on the original screenplay by Siu Fai Mak) and employing one of the best ensemble casts of the year, Scorsese does what he does best in giving us a film that holds our attention, our breath, and our applause throughout.<br/><br/>The story involves two young recently graduated from police academy, men from opposite sides of the law and backgrounds, who are made moles within the Boston State Police department and the Irish mafia: Leonardo DiCaprio is one and Matt Damon is the other and both young actors turn in committed and convincing performances. On the polar aspects of the battleground are Jack Nicholson as the crime king Costello (his finest work since 'A Few Good Men') together with Ray Winstone as Mr French and on the other end are DiCaprio's mentors Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg and Damon's mentors Alec Baldwin et al. The very beautifully written female lead is played to perfection by Vera Farmiga who finally has a role (a conflicted psychiatrist for the moles) hat takes full advantage of her prodigious gifts as an actress.<br/><br/>Some may find the violence obsessively graphic, but then this is Scorcese's style and for this viewer it is necessary for the drive of the story. It is impossible to stop concentrating for a moment during this rapid fire drama, spiced with just the right amount of wry humor, making its running time (in excess of two and a half hours) speed by as fast as the many bullets in the atmosphere. This is one of Scorsese's best films and one that begs to be seen again. Grady Harp"

","24 hours after seeing 'The Departed' I still can't stop thinking about it. In a long lifetime of movie-going, I have seldom been as exhilarated, as excited, as palm- sweatingly gripped as I was by this film. Every scene contributes to our understanding of the complex plot which drives inexorably towards its electrifying conclusion.This must be Martin Scorses's masterpiece. Maybe at last he will get his Best Director and Best Film Oscars; since there are no gay cowboys in the story, there's a chance. I would similarly award William Monaghan for his cracking script and among the acting contenders who would have thought that in a film of magnificent performances di Caprio would be up there in front? At last the bum-numbingly boring 'Titanic' can be quietly forgotten. Jack Nicholson does his familiar mad psycho shtick, but nobody does it better and at his age it's probably his last (grand)stand. He has most of the smart lines, but Mark Wahlberg is a close second. Go and see the movie of the decade."

This is certainly his best since Goodfellas, with as much violence to boot. Great acting from the main characters, as well as the supporting ones makes this film a must-see for all film lovers! The movie's length is deceiving, at 2 and a half hours it seems more like a 90 minute film. Perhaps this is due to the varied plot development of the main and supporting characters. Time, of course, will alone tell if this film is to stand on it's own in relation to Scorsese's big three - Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas. I frankly have no doubt it will."

Each of what seems to be a logical closure point sets up for something that just adds to the experience that Scorsese is trying to fabricate. And it works, good Lord does it work.

It may not be original but it's a lot more interesting than Interal Affairs. Like many other people, nobody thought much of Leonardo DiCaprio's acting when he made Titanic and The Beach, (I was one of the few males who though Titanic was a great film), but DiCaprio has turned out to be a class A actor, not like he wasn't before. He's not Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, or Marlon Brando of his generation, he's Leonardo DiCaprio, a stand alone actor and if he continues getting great roles in great films, he'll be an Academy Award winner, if not, then he'll get an Honorary Oscar. Matt Damon does a fantastic job of playing a villain for once. Jack Nicholson is veteran actor in The Departed. Some veteran actors can't match up their Academy Award winning roles over and over again. However Nicholson does. His performance as criminal Frank Costello equals up to his performance in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, Terms Of Endearment, & As Good As It Gets, which he all won an Oscar for. He may not have won the Oscar for About Schmidt, but he might win it for this performance.<br/><br/>Thats all I'm going to say. Just watch the movie and enjoy."
"bmcmahon40","6","1","3","10 October 2006"," And so the decline continues
","A new Scorcese picture and everyone is thrilled. However, the emperor has no clothes. The parallels with the great Walter Hill are uncanny. Hill's first half dozen movies were sharp, bare pictures with crackling dialogue but he somehow got lost along the way. Turning out rubbish like Brewster's Millions before returning to the well and churning out garbage like Another 48 Hours or attempting to reprise his finest hours with rubbish like Johhny Handsome and Last Man Standing. So it is with Scorcese, who after early success has turned out consistent sub-standard fare like The Departed or the execrable Gangs of New York. Possibly the reason you haven't won the Oscar Marty, is because you haven't made a decent movie since Goodfellas. Go the way of Walter and become a Producer. Leave the film-making to those who show a bit of originality."

","This movie is, to be succinct, an excellent blend of story and character development, backed up by an all-star cast who collectively deliver the best acting you will see in a film, period. Of course, from Scorcese what would you expect but a masterpiece, and here he delivers in spades. The characters are intricate, the story well developed, the violence brutal and non-gratuitous. Above all this, there are many, many twists, more than most Scorcese pictures, that will keep the viewer guessing and at times, even jumping in their seats.<br/><br/>The cast is outstanding; Nicholson (with perhaps his best performance in decades), Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, Matt Damon (I'm Matt Damon!!), Leonardo DiCaprio...among an excellent collection of more minor characters - all superb. If I had to make one critical comment, it would be that one character (I won't say who) does not pay off at the end, which could have cut maybe 20-30 minutes from the film. But who cares - even among the GREAT movies this stands out - among the Deck served up 99% of the time nowadays, this is the Apex of Film-making.<br/><br/>You will NOT want to miss viewing this on the big screen!"

","Martin Scorsese has directed a modern classic, with a well written script which recounts an enthralling police/crime drama. The actors gave stellar performances, including a quirky, demonic, at times humorous, and consistently brilliant character study by Jack Nicholson, who can add this role to his many classic portrayals. Both Matt Damon and Leonardo Di Caprio gave complex and riveting performances. I have admired Di Caprio ever since he played the developmentally disabled young man in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"". He brings a depth and sensitivity to his roles, and in this film, surrounded by great actors, he is the focal point. He gets across volumes in a facial expression, and his complex hero is fed by many hidden springs. He deserves many awards for this extraordinary piece of work, including an Academy Award. Hopefully, Martin Scorsese will finally receive that much deserved Academy Award for his magnificent work as director. I highly recommend this film."
"gws-2","10","1","3","9 October 2006"," Scorsese at the Top of His Game
","Martin Scorsese has returned to the top of his game with ""The Departed,"" which is his best work since ""Goodfellas."" I wondered going in whether the 149 minute running time of the film might be excessive but it is not. It is a sophisticated, complex tale, which, because it takes its time is clearly understandable. Nevertheless, it moves without a lag.<br/><br/>The cast are uniformly wonderful. Leonardo DiCaprio, as Billy Costigan an emotionally crippled undercover cop, gives the finest performance of his career. Matt Damon, who just seems to get better and better, is also outstanding as Colin Sullivan, a state police sergeant who is also a mole for a big time mobster, Frank Costello, played by the always terrific, Jack Nicholson. Nicholson is alternately funny and creepy, in a way I can't imagine any other actor being able to pull off. <br/><br/>I had not seem Vera Farmiga, who plays Madolyn a state health professional who treats both police officers and paroled convicts. Hers is a very important role because she treats and develops a personal relationship with both Costigan and Sullivan, with fascinating consequences. Madolyn is both vulnerable and a risk taker. Farmiga made me care about her.<br/><br/>""The Departed"" is the best movie I have seen this year, and maybe in the last two years. I hope that Scorsese ends his Oscar shutout with this one. If he does it will have been a well deserved victory."
"emailmarcl","7","1","3","9 October 2006"," Very Good Remake
","Some people from the production said ""this movie is not a remake, it's inspired by Infernal Affairs"". But i can assure you, this movie is a remake of a great Asian movie ""Infernal Affair"". A lot of the scene are taken from the original movie. I assumed that Hollywood ran out of original ideas. But as a Director, Mr. Scorcese did a very good job on remaking this movie. He suceededly transform the world of cop and triad into the world of cop and mafia. But the real show of this movie comes from jack Nicholson and DiCaprio. Nicholson back to his root where he was good at, being a bad, crazy, yet charismatic guy. and for DiCaprio he's been very good acting in every character since he join and become Scorcese's golden boy. I wish that the academy committee will finally give the Oscar to DiCaprio. and for Nicholson, he could get his fourth Oscar. And for this movie despite of this is an Infernal Affairs remake, is a very good movie. ""You could become original or a copycat. What iam saying is this, when you're facing a real moviegoers what's the difference"".<br/><br/>PS : Watch the original after you watch the Departed."
"matthewjhumphreys","10","1","3","9 October 2006"," Martin Scorsese's best work since Goodfellas...
","We all hoped, prayed and wished that someday, Martin Scorsese would wonder around familiar territory again with his previous works like Mean Streets, Goodfellas and Casino. Well, it has taken a little while, but he is back on that familiar territory and that its territory that he knows best and loves.<br/><br/>""The Departed"" is set in South Boston, where the state police force is declaring war on organised crime. Young undercover cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is assigned to infiltrate the mob run by gangland chief Costello (Jack Nicholson). While Billy is quickly gaining Costello's confidence, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), a hardened young criminal who has infiltrated the police department as an informer for the mob, is rising to a position of power in the Special Investigation Unit. Each man becomes deeply consumed by his double life, gathering information about the plans and counter-plans of the operations he has penetrated. But when it becomes clear to both the mob and the police that there's a mole in their midst, Billy and Colin are suddenly in danger of being caught and exposed to the enemy and each must race to uncover the identity of the other man in order to save himself.<br/><br/>Scorsese has constructed a work of pure brilliance. Some of his trademarks are all still present here with the at times dizzying camera work and the sharp quick fire editing, which come courtesy from his stalwarts Michael Ballhaus and Thelma Schoonmaker respectfully. William Monahan's script is sharp, quite witty and beautifully paced, but it is the actors who have a field day with his script. You get the feeling at times that the three main leads are all vying for contention. Its extremely difficult to single out an outstanding performance, in fact it would be unfair to do so, as Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon are all on fine form.<br/><br/>It would be unfair also to pick out flaws with this film, but there are two and they are albeit minor. Ray Winstone's (Mr. French) accent is extremely dodgy. I don't care what is said, it is hard for an Englishman to master any type of American accent. Also The Departed is not what you would call Oscar friendly. The Academy does have a tendency to shy away from work of this nature. I sincerely hope they don't. I hope the Academy will have the courage to finally bestow the ultimate accolade to a director who is as diverse as they come. After the body of work Martin Scorsese has made, it is very much overdue.<br/><br/>With those two minor flaws aside, it doesn't affect the outcome of my rating for this gleaming piece of cinema. Quite simply, outstanding. *****"

In fact, there wasn't a single member of the cast who didn't give an amazing performance from start to finish. I highly recommend you see this film.

","I had watched Infernal Affairs I and II a while ago and I couldn't wait to watch ""The Departed"" when I became aware that Martin Scorcese (MS) based his film on IA. Well, I like the movie, though I feel MS could have done a much better job had he also stretched the story over 2 or 3 parts. Like IA, ""The Departed"" is a good movie and must certainly be watched at least once. Very good performances by Jack Nicholson and Leonardo Di Caprio. Matt Damon was OK and I liked Mark Wahlberg's small role and good delivery of his snappy dialogues. And the movie's got a fair share of F*$#&* language. Most of the movie is ditto to the original Infernal Affairs series....but an English version and some good performances by Hollywood folks warrant a viewing."

","""The Departed"" is outstanding. Leonardo DiCaprio sets the screen on fire, along with Matt Damon, Mark Whalberg, and, of course, the legend Jack Nicholson. The sold out audience I saw it with laughed hysterically at the funny parts (which there is a surprising number of) and became dead silent at the intense parts (which there is, unsurprisingly, a lot of). Mr. Scorsese once again raises the bar that he set years ago, and proves to us that when it comes to smart, ultra-violent films, there is no equal.

","Whoa...I read the reviews on Ain't It Cool News and I have to say, despite their hyper-active vocabularies, they nail it.<br/><br/>More appropriately, Scorcese nails it, as does Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, Leo DiCaprio, Anthony Anderson, Alec Baldwin and pretty much everyone else in the movie.<br/><br/>This movie rocks and rolls and it kicks ass so completely I was shocked. I mean, I went to see a Scorses gangster flick. I didn't expect a gangster flick the sits up there with The Godfather.<br/><br/>In a lot of way, Boston is getting a lot of attention from gangster cinema. I mean, I just got done watching Brotherhood (really good TV) and this is like that but a much bigger picture. Departed is the ultimate cop/rat movie and I hope Scorcese has a dozen more in him just like it.<br/><br/>I won't go into details but Baldwin, Sheen and Wahlberg are amazing.

This film is a no-holds-barred mystery/cop/thriller/drama that had my full attention the entire 2+ hours length of the film. There is not one boring moment in this picture; every detail had good reason to be there.

I myself thought that it was a great film. In movies past when you have seen such star power the film has come off clunky and disorganized. Not this one. The director using his experience and discipline pulled this movie off flawlessly. Only Jack could play such a lowlife scumbag with such conviction his performance is really tour DE force. Of all the performances of the new breed I feel De Caprio was the best in the film with Damon a close second. Damon's performance stood out in my mind because of the fact he has played good guys his past several films he makes the transition of going to baddie flawlessly. De Caprio portraying an undercover cop especially a rookie was very real. My sister in law was a undercover cop. The only casting flaw was Balwin. I feel that Affleck could have done better. Anyway, this movie is the best of the year by far. I highly recommend it but KEEP THE KIDS AT HOME(HIRE A BABY SITTER)"

","I folk can remember the impact of Scorceses (spellink?) Goodfellas and a fine (if violent) film it is. The Departed will probably be hailed as a return to that fine form, but I hope folk are paying carefull attention, because apart from a few notable one liners, it really is too much the remake and not an individual film.<br/><br/>The story is complelling enough, but not enough twist potential is made of the rich characters created in this version - which has always been the directors strength. Jack Nicholson, however, seems a bit reigned in, leaving acting credits to Leonardo for the main cast, but the supporting cast pulls some surprising irons out of the fire. Alec Baldwin as the furious sweaty police captain and Martin Sheen as the proverbial good cop show there is more to casting than who is popular at the time.<br/><br/>Good but not fab."

I've lived in Boston for my whole life, and Southie for a few years and i can tell you that they really captured the city in this film. The accents were thick, but not exaggerated (Matt Damon's has improved since Good Will Hunting). And the scenery was perfect. If you're a fan of mob movies, see it. Fan of scorcese? see it.

","First of all, ""The Departed"" is not as good as the film it was based on, ""Infernal Affairs,"" which is one of the best Asian films of all time. Still, ""The Departed"" is good entertainment in it's own rite.<br/><br/>The first 2/3 of ""The Departed"" does not follow the original very much. It is mostly background information about the characters and while at times it is amusing, it is also sometimes boring. This film is about an hour too long. But once you get to the last hour, it is one of the most entertaining films of the year.<br/><br/>The last part of the film follows the original pretty faithfully and turns a mediocre film into a very good one.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio gives the best performance of his career. Matt Damon is the weakest link in the film. He is okay, but does not convey the complexity of the same character in the original film. Jack Nicholson gives a grizzled version of the character that he played in ""Witches of Eastwick."" The supporting cast is full of actors that are used to being the stars and they are great! The acting is alone is worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>The biggest difference between ""The Departed"" and ""Infernal Affairs"" is that the remake is much more violent and has many obvious attempts at humor, while the original was fully serious and much more subtle.<br/><br/>While it doesn't fully live up to the original, ""The Departed"" is first rate entertainment if you can stomach the extreme violence and obscenity. If you are looking for a first rate adult popcorn flick, ""The Departed"" can be a good diversion."

As for the ending, well, all I have to say is that I absolutely loved the twists. The most important thing about this movie is that I cared for all of the characters.

","This movie is one of my favorite Scorsese films. Top 3, definitely. The violence is brutal as well as the language, the characters are intriguing and flawed (not a single ""good guy"" exists in the movie), the humor is deliciously dark, and the directing, as always, is simply phenomenal. But what I like even more than the directing is how multi-layered the film is. You'll have to see it twice to even begin to take everything in. There are simple lines of dialog that are vital pieces of information. That's what I love most. The movie contains so many different dimensions, that it simply blows away other mono-layered films. Scorsese doesn't hand feed you everything. You have to make the connections yourself, and that's why I think the majority of the youth either will not understand it or they won't be able to appreciate the brilliance and depth of the film because their standards have been trashed due to the commercial crap films Hollywood is spitting out drastically fast. Nevertheless, this film is amazingly good and don't let any schmuck convince you otherwise."

","Having seen The Departed, it simply shows us why Martin Scorsese is still one of the best directors working today. The pace, music, characters, action, dialogue, and casting are all perfect - you would not expect anything else from the director who has brought us some of the greatest films in modern film-making history. Following on from Gangs of New York and The Aviator, the Scorsese/DiCaprio relationship is at its strongest with this tour de force from both - anyone who may still doubt Dicaprio's acting ability need look no further than his first encounter with the police psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga)and his the 'Cranberry juice' scene - reminiscent of Joe Pesci at his uncontrollable best. The inspired choice of Jack Nicholson is something film lovers have been waiting to see for many years, and under the masterful eye of Scorsese, Nicholson is able to give a performance that is both menacing and dangerous with flashes of brutality which are utterly believable. Matt Damon gives, what I think, is his best performance since Goodwill Hunting. Perhaps overshadowed at times by DiCaprio, but any Damon fan will find him a delight to watch. The same must be said, too, of the supporting cast - Mark Wahlberg is excellent in his support role and has some of the films best lines which are delivered well. Alec Baldwin does the role of Police chief with ease, and Martin sheen is, as always, terrific. I urge any fan of great storytelling and character-driven cinema to see The Departed - Scorsese's best film since Casino. 10/10"

From the very get go he movie has you picking sides, and swings you around from all different sides of the story, as most if not all of the key characters are really well developed.

I rewatched ""Infernal Affairs"" last night as well and I have to say that the original is probably a little bit tighter in spots but they're both great representations of what is essentially the same story.</li></ul><br/><br/>Scorsese has returned to do what he does best.

And Matt Damon making affleck look bad doing good movies with bug good actors.honestly everyone in this movie is good it has funny parts as well as serious parts. its not big on action but its great on suspense, shockers and dialogue. this is a really great movie. GO SEE IT!!!!"

","The film was fantastic. 'Di Craprio' actually put in a performance worthy of recognition come awards season. This film works because it combines playful police office banter, coming from prominent actors such as Baldwin, Damon and 'Marky Mark' Wahlberg, with a more dark tale of disloyalty and corruption combining the Boston State Police department and their dealings with the Irish-American gang run by Frank Costello (Nicholson). The film gradually reveals the lengths that either side will go to infiltrate the opposition. As Costigan (Di Caprio), the mole within the Costello's gang, and Sullivan (Damon), within the Police department come closer to finding each others identity the film becomes tense, even to a point of being unbearable at times, leading to a somewhat surprising conclusion. <br/><br/>To some the ending might seem slightly quick, with too many shots and expirations, but as the film develops to a gritty and startling finale, this ending is the best and only one the film deserves.<br/><br/>Also it was great to see Ray Winstone in the mix as Mr French, he was also excellent....."
"at7000","8","1","3","6 October 2006"," Great movie (With an interesting plot hole)
","Great movie, no doubt about that. But wait a minute, did the Matt Damon character really believe he could ""delete Costigan's existence"" without Marky-Mark Wahlberg's character coming back to ream his butt? Tjis just did not make sense to me. <br/><br/>Spoiler warning****<br/><br/>The fact that Marky_Mark's character winds up wasting him in cold blood, just back up my thesis. <br/><br/>Usually I just see a film and go along for the ride, I can 'suspend disbelief' and all that other cool stuff. Just seemed to me this was a huge plot-hole and there were several other minor ones in the mix as well. Okay, some minor flaws in a very very good film."

It is a little realistic when it comes to violence. GO SEE IT!!! he starts off in his normal fashion of painting the perfect picture for you with great detail and precision. Then before you know it you 2 and half hours is gone, your on a roller-coaster of emotion and you are too caught up in the movie to even think what is going to happen next. The acting by Jack, Leonardo, Wahlberg, and the supporters was just awesome I had my doubts about Leonardo and Wahlberg but I would have to say this is one of their best works without question. I have been waiting for a good movie compared to all the nonsense that is out there now.

","Suspense and acting at its best. DiCaprio, Nicholson and Sheen, Wahlberg and Damon all superb roles well played and well cast. This is one of Scorsese's finest pieces since Casino and a nice change, stylistically speaking, from his latest period pieces. The subtle foreshadowing and symbolism along with knockout punch action keep you wrangling in your seat in this latest criminal thriller. Just as soon as you think you've got it all figured out, another 180 degrees. The somewhat humorous at times plot is a true paradox of virtues and I don't just mean in the dialogue or the cast! You've gotta see it to believe it, because it is really a very entertaining movie."

","Now, I could go on forever about this film, but I don't want to keep you because I'd rather you go out and see 'The Departed' First off I want to give a big 'up yours' to the trolls who are not going to even see this movie but give it a Vote of 1 just to keep it off the Top #250 list even though it should no question be on that list near the very top.<br/><br/>In Scorsese's latest venture he took a more close-up approach in my opinion, I noticed a lot of shots were not set back and drawn away from the scene like a lot of his typical shots are, I have always viewed him as more traditional in that sense. Also he used lots of fast-paced editing, lots of jumping from shot to shot from scene to scene with a voice-over from one of the scenes being chopped. Lots of recurring songs, but good songs, so it's not annoying. Lots of the songs abruptly end and go straight into dialogue. Scorsese also did 2 symbolic shots where Matt Damon looked as if he was in a dark room in a spotlight on him, the first time you just saw him at the bottom screen then the spotlight opened and showed the whole Boston State Police building, symbolizing that he is one man entering this whole new big world, the next time it is the used it closes in on him to represent his characters isolation. Anyway this movie was excellent tons of twists and turns, lots going on, lots of characters, its long but never boring, its definitive Scorsese, no one else could have made this film. If you can figure out exactly how everything is going to go down without seeing it or having someone who has tell you, I'll give you $1,000,000. Damn whoever made 'The Departed' commercials though because one of the distinct images from the commercial doesn't happen to till the very end of the film, so you are watching the movie going well I know he has to come back into the movie with a pistol because it hasn't happened yet. This movie had an ALL-STAR cast, amazing acting, I foresee numerous nominations, hopefully Scorsese finally goes home with the Oscar for Best Director he deserves it after all the years, especially since this is definitely his best work since 'Goodfellas' if not even better. It's good to know people still make real movies, not the same recycled bull crap that appeals to teenage minorities that is released ever Friday. You know the movie I'm talking about the one that is probably a sequel, has fast cars, hot woman, a car blowing up, where the good guy kills the bad guy, saves his wife has sex with her and lives happily ever after. God, I wanna punch who ever sees 'The Marine' next week in the face, there is a real genuine piece of cinema in the theater right now, a real movie, and its called 'The Departed.'"

","A cross between trying to be Quentin Tarentino and the Oil Terrorist film by George Clooney. The plot and trying to be the world's greatest director in everyway possible makes in convoluted and hurts the themes and feelings of the work. This is not Mean Streets, Taxi Driver or King of Comedy. It has moments and is good but it's trying to hard to be slick Hollywood and 90s/ 2000 cool at the same time. I would hope that Scorcese is above that. I have yet to see the Dylan work but the last masterpiece I have seen from my man is the BFI tribute to American Films. Albeit I will say that Aviator had great moments. Fortunately we have some repertory around my area so I can catch stuff like Nights of Calabari or Jaws where they are meant to be seen until something really great comes out for me. The Propisition, Broken Flowers and Desecent have been my favorite recent films. Marty he's hoping you stop trying to be trendy for the Oscars or whatever reason why and aim for Cainnes- the real award instead. Even the soundtrack was the same choices for pop songs and way in the back ground- not like Tell Me and that great dance scene from Mean Streets and real commercial film music. Not like the great soundtrack from Taxi Driver. This is good but overrated. If someone is living inside of Marty please give him back to us..."

Matt Damon plays a part I am not use to seeing him play. It was nice to see the change and he does a great job as well.

The whole audience, mostly senior citizens and crackheads in the middle of the afternoon in Times Square, was cheering and laughing all through it. The only reason I didn't actually cry was I kept telling myself that: A. I may not under any circumstances cry in a gangster movie; and B. as Mom always said, It's only a movie and Sounder/Flag/E.T./Johnny Boy didn't die in real life. When I walked out after 5+ hours I had a huge smile on my face and an urge to tell every single person I know to go see it.<br/><br/>This movie had everything: good guys, bad guys, chases, mad suspense, clever cussing, piles of cocaine, Patsy Cline, exploding cars, garroting, barfights, insectivores, literary quotations, brain spray, blood splatter, and Ray Freaking Winstone to boot! This movie rocked. If you don't like it you don't know how to enjoy movies. The only legitimate reason not to love this movie is if you are turned off by man's inhumanity to man, cuz there is mad violence.

I spoke with two groups of complete strangers, searching for reassurance that I just saw what I just saw.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese has one hell of a reputation, and he lives up to it in this outing. This is the first Scorsese picture that I have seen in the theatre and now I know fully the effect that ""Taxi Driver"" must have had on it's audience some thirty years ago.<br/><br/>TD is a 2.5 hour film, but never once feels long, drawn out or boring.

The tension will have you twitching in your plush seat.<br/><br/>I don't know what to say about the acting that the unfamiliar wouldn't be able to assume, and correctly so, from the cast lineup itself. Because of this I will just list the cast; Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, Matt Damon, and Leonardo DiCaprio. 'Nuff said!

"nobanenogain","8","1","3","6 October 2006"," Scorsese at his best!
","Mean Streets, Goodfellas and Casino are cherished by all:add The Departed to that list. It was so great watching a Scorsese gangster movie again. With all due respect to Gangs of New York and The Aviator, good as they may be, The Departed has all the hallmarks of the Scorsese that we all know. The film is made with such fine poise, blending humour, seriousness and violence into one fine blend: and it works. There's an electricity that accompanies Scorsese's narrative: a soundtrack pumping with classy Irish karaoke and the occasional bit of Pink Floyd and the Rolling Stones evoke fond memories of the contagious soundtrack of Goodfellas and Casino. As for the Scorsese-Nicholson pairing, it doesn't disappoint. Nicholson is evil in a charming way, we have to remind ourselves he is bad to the bone. But he's such a scene stealer that it's impossible not to like him. Unlike Batman though, he doesn't steal the movie. Every performance is captivating and Leo DiCaprio has come full circle since Titanic. Matt Damon is alarmingly well cast in the role of a pure rat. Jason Boure he may be, put he plays the part of Colin Sullivan with such disdain that he reaps rewards. Just go see this movie! If you're underage, get mum or dad to buy it when it's released on DVD. It's the finest film you'll see this year. Give Scorsese an Oscar! If he earned a nomination for The Aviator, he should be a shoe-in for this! And let him win!"

"TheLittleSongbird","5","3","21","9 January 2011"," For me, so far, this is my least favourite Martin Scorsese movie
","I really tried to like this film, but it didn't completely work for me. Granted it is very well made, with stylish shots and striking locations, the music is good, Scorsese's direction is excellent(though he has directed much better than here) and Jack Nicholson does do his best work in years here. However, I never did find the movie that compelling, the film does move in a somewhat mannered manner and there are parts that are either rushed, underdeveloped or even predictable- the sex scene was laughable. Also, I think The Departed is overlong, and the ending was very underwhelming. Then there is the script, while it has been lauded for its complexity, maybe I am being harsh but I found it too complex and needlessly convoluted too. In terms of acting, it was okay but nothing exceptional Nicholson excepted. Leonardo DaCaprio plays a different role but for me it is a role that does not suit him, while I didn't see anything special in Mark Wahlberg either. Out of the cameos, Ray Winstone's comes off best, while Matt Damon is the real weak link being very blank faced and monotone throughout. Overall, not terrible but a disappointment. As far as Scorsese movies go, I would put Goodfellas, Taxi Driver and Raging Bull over this any day. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
"Horst_In_Translation","8","1","4","4 January 2020"," A film that only gets better with each viewing
","""The Departed"" is an American 2.5-hour live action movie and one of the biggest hits from the unique career of director Martin Scorsese, also because it won (him) Best Director and Best Picture at the Oscars. This film is from 2006, so almost 15 years old now and another Oscar that it won was for Best Screenplay and that one went to William Monahan, although the original is of course a Korean movie from a few years earlier or actually several Korean movies as this one here is just an adaptation, but the kind where most people would say it is superior to the original or where most people do not even know there is an original. Anyway, the only Oscar it did not win from its nominations was for Best Supporting Actor, but that was no surprise at all because Wahlberg being nominated over Nicholson (and DiCaprio) surely came as a bit of a surprise, even if he was nominated for a Golden Globe too. I mean I don't mind Marky Mark, but he definitely was not the best supporting player from the bunch here. I guess he surely profited a lot from the fact that he was basically the only bigger character who survived the movie in the end. He may have lost his job, but he did not lose his life and actually the last scene is just really memorable when he shows up at the central character's home and kills him because otherwise the bad guy would have gotten away with it. So he makes somewhat sure we get a happy ending if you can say so. Speaking of lead actors, I am also not sure if you can really call DiCaprio's turn a supporting performance like the SAG Awards did (unlike the Globes and BAFTAs), but maybe it was this category confusion that cost him the Oscar nomination eventually. He would have deserved it, more than for ""Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood"". In my opinion, he may not have been a lead as big as Damon, but surely a lead nonetheless. Also it really surprises me that Damon received no awards recognition whatsoever from the big awards bodies. He would have deserved it as well. But yeah, Scorsese-DiCaprio is just something that has worked so well for so long, so no surprise this is maybe what is more on people's minds. And of course, Di Caprio and Marty deserved all the accolades they got for this film.<br/><br/>Now at its core, there are sub-plots that includes other genres (like romance), but at the very center this film is nothing but a crime drama / crime thriller. We follow two men who are in disguise. Damon's character is loyal to a local crime lord, but still has a successful career with the police force. DiCaprio's character struggles with his family background when trying to become a police officer, so he goes undercover to help bring justice to said crime lord. The result is a constant back and forth in terms of loyalty, life-threatening situations and graphic violence. But it works really well. Nothing feels for the sake of it and especially in the last half hour the film gains incredible steam. Of course this also has a lot to do with the marvellous cast. I already mentioned many names of actors you find in here and there are several others like Vera Farmiga and Martin Sheen for example. Also the rather young Anthony Anderson is one many will recognize thanks to his recent success and I personally was happy as always to see J. C. McKenzie in here, even if it was just one scene, because I love him on Dark Angel my favorite television show and he seems to work with Scorsese a lot. Anyway, speaking of Sheen, when his character dies, things get really steamy and everything escalates quickly. There are so many minor references that are really smart like the little letter with the background information about the criminals and how DiCaprio's character realizes towards the end that it is Damon's character he had been chasing that night. Or also the pregnancy reference: I still think it was not Damon's character's child, but yeah we will never find out. Still it's interesting how Farmiga makes on one occasion early on a statement about Damon's character's abilities in bed that also made me think so, but who knows. Another thing I liked about the film was the music. Not just the soundtrack, but there are also some really good songs used in here, one by The Rolling Stones, one by Pink Floyd and one by Badfinger. Also the music we hear at the very end when we see the rat at the window was the perfect way to close the film. Speaking of rats, this film is packed with references that are of course meant in a way where both sides are trying to figure out who is the one they can't trust in their team. I will not get into detail about all the rat references as you will recognize these yourself when you see them, so let me just say that my favorite is when we have Jack Nicholson giving us a face expression of a rat when he impersonates this animal. That was so funny.<br/><br/>Nicholson in general did great and even if apparently he is retired now in his 80s I am truly happy he left us so many awesome films like this one here. I mean it's not a perfect movie and not even his approach and character works all the time like with the scene when he randomly starts singing a song that did nothing for me, but apart from that he still gave a really memorable supporting turn here and I believe he would have deserved the Oscar nomination. Not sure about the win, but the nomination definitely. Oh well, it's alright. Not being nominated does not make his portrayal any worse. Also around the age of 70, he still could be extremely scary like that scene when he violently takes care of DiCaprio's character's injured hand was pretty tough to watch. And on another occasion we see him say something pretty sadistic when he just killed two people and later on we see how he leaves a room where he just took care really violently of an enemy it seems. By the way, speaking of Nicholson's character, it came to my mind during this movie immediately how Di Caprio played a character in Gangs of New York that was sucking up to his arch enemy and (even without personal revenge motivation) this is also true for this film. I mean acting next to Day-Lewis and Nicholson back then, not too shabby. Okay let me think what else can I say about this movie. Oh yeah Alec Baldwin is also in it and he survives the film too, but his character is not that major and I am not a big fan of him (anymore) either. Still he was somewhat fun in his scenes when he got physical towards a colleague who screwed up and also during his final scene with Wahlberg. It kinda felt to me that they just used some of the really exaggerated rage the actor keeps displaying in real life for his character here. And the ending wow I already mentioned it and that sure came unexpected to see Wahlberg's character like that and what Damon's character says exactly knowing he's done. Then again, a lot in this film came unexpected, also the way DiCaprio's character is killed from one second to the next and how Damon's character is really such a gifted schemer to put everything in place for him to look good and get out of this gigantic mess unharmed. He kills another undercover guy, he kills his mentor even (even if he hesitates). And the good thing is, maybe the best thing about the entire film, how well everything works and how realistic it feels nonetheless, even if it is unexpected. A prime example of awesome screenplay penning. I am glad it won many Oscars, but this one in particular. I would not say it is my favorite film from 2006, but certainly one of the best I have seen from that year and like I said in the title of my review: Even if you know all that is happening because you have seen this film already 2 or 3 or even 4 times, it is still worth seeing once more because it is that good that you maybe always discover something new and never get bored. These 150 minutes flew by so quickly. I could easily write another three paragraphs about this film if my memory was completely fresh and I watched it two hours ago and not two days, but I'll leave it at that. There is only one thing anyway that is crucial for you when reading this review and that is that I think you totally need to watch this film because it is absolutely sublime. Unless you haven't already, or well watch it once more then. Big thumbs-up."

"BrianKopycinski","7","1","4","2 October 2019"," The Disappointment
","After watching The Departed, I'm not expecting much from The Irishman.I should preface this by saying that I really like most of Scorsese's movies. Taxi Driver and Raging Bull are fantastic, and Goodfellas is one of my favorites. Throughout the summer, I've tried to watch a lot of movies from specific directors, like John Carpenter and Wes Anderson. Pretty basic, right? After looking over his filmography, The Departed seemed to be the one film that is universally praised that I have not seen.<br/><br/>Well, put simply, I didn't think it was that great. Of course, from a technical level, it looked fine. For the story, characters, and overall experience, I was underwhelmed and disappointed. I know that this point is more of a preference of mine, but I really don't like movies going over two and a half hours unless they're able to hold my attention (think of the LOTR Trilogy). I thought The Departed was really boring. That may be simplifying the problems I have with it, whatever. I'm getting really tired of seeing all of the same actors all of the time (Leo, Damon, Marky Mark, etc.) I'm sure many of you feel the same way.<br/><br/>After looking into the history of this movie, you'll find out that it was a remake of Infernal Affairs, a Hong Kong picture. So not only is this movie self indulgent of the tired ""mafioso gangsta"" genre, it's a mostly unoriginal concept as well. And I'm sure if you're from Boston, you have some fondness for The Departed, much like how I feel about Adventureland (Pittsburgh/Kennywood). Other things that bothered me were the lame soundtrack, and attempts to make ""the Irish experience"" something much deeper than it actually is. I get that directors like Scorsese are doing what they're doing because they like it, but at this point it's just too much.<br/><br/>The Irishman is coming out later this year, and I don't think I'll see it. With Once Upon A Time In Hollywood and Rocketman, I've had enough good experiences in theaters this year. A lot of people are excited that De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci are all together again. I don't see why you would be, when so many great movies with them already exist. Hopefully I'll be wrong, and this does everything right that The Departed did wrong (in my mind). I still ended up rating it at 7/10, because it's not that bad, but it's not something special."

I would much rather rewatch Goodfellas or The Wolf of Wall Street or one of his rawer films from the 1970s. This is Scorsese at his best, this is Leonardo Dicaprio at his best, this is everyone in the film at their best. Maybe not their career defining best, but their best nonetheless."

","First of, the editing in this movie is snappy and makes this 2,5 hour movie interesting at all times. Acting, also top notch, with very recognizable faces, which is okay. The story is pretty clear cut but at times hard to follow, which isn't a drawback per se. I also very much enjoyed the ending. Of course some things are unbelievable but that didn't take away from the immersion in this film.
Other than the editing and some parts of the storie, the movie doesn't really have an identity as it doesn't have a clear story to tell.

"classicalsteve","10","1","4","18 June 2018"," A Modern Film Noir: Scorsese's Best Film with the Most Intricate Plot
","Martin Scorsese has been on the cutting edge of filmmaking since the late 1960's. Prior to ""The Departed"", the legendary director's films had been recognized with 59 Oscar nominations and about 11 wins. He had been nominated five times for Best Director with an equal number nominated for Best Picture without winning prior to ""The Departed"", notable ""Raging Bull"" and ""Goodfellas"". His actors have faired better with wins for Robert De Niro (Best Actor, Raging Bull), Joe Pesci (Best Supporting Actor, ""Goodfellas""), and Paul Newman (Best Actor, ""The Color of Money""). He needed a film to hit it out of the ballpark, and ""The Departed"" was it. It is unquestionably Scorsese's best film and will go down as a masterpiece of crime cinema.<br/><br/>The plot, probably the most intricate in a crime-drama film since ""Pulp Fiction"" is based on a Hong Kong film called ""Infernal Affairs"", which references Hell in Buddhist theology. William Monahan adapted the original Chinese screenplay by Alan Mak and Felix Chong. The story concerns two young Bostonians who have infiltrated the opposing sides of the wars between the Massachusetts state police and a crime syndicate run by a godfather type, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson in an academy award-caliber performance). <br/><br/>The two infiltrators are in fact double agents. Matt Damon plays the clean-cut Colin Sullivan who elevates from lower eastside broken home to being an high-ranking detective in the state police. Unbeknownst to his colleagues, his real loyalty is with Costello, his ""dad"", the name he often uses when he's in contact with Costello. On the other side, also from humble beginnings is Billy (Leonardo DiCaprio) , son of an airport luggage handler who also had ties to the mob. He has tried with mixed reviews also to become a Boston cop. His superiors, played by Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg, don't believe he's police material but instead decide he's perfect as a mole to infiltrate Costello's mob. Interestingly, Sullivan easily works up the ranks with his steady demeanor while Billy is distrusted on all sides and must prove himself.<br/><br/>The authorities want information about a computer chip heist, not the kind of computer chips you purchase at Fry's, but one's which are not exactly publically available. These chips are mounted into computers aboard ICBM's. Another mob, a Chinese terrorist syndicate, desire to purchase the chips so they can blow up cities in the far east. The question becomes will diCaprio as a double-agent be able to tip off the authorities before the transaction can be completed? Or will Matt Damon tip off the mob in time to get away with the heist and sale.<br/><br/>A brilliant and compelling film from start-to-finish. Superb performances by all involved. Only Wahlberg was nominated for best supporting actor, although all the leads could have been easily been nominated for their performances. (Alan Arkin won best supporting actor for a far less interesting film, ""Little Miss Sunshine"".) In my opinion, DiCaprio's performance is one of the best of his career. Scorsese finally won Best Director and the film won Best Picture. These were not ""sympathy' awards for Scorsese, giving them to him for his career. He and his film won because it's one helluva a great film."

"Leofwine_draca","10","1","4","19 June 2016"," One of Scorsese's very best movies
","Martin Scorsese returns to familiar territory with this story of the lives of cops and gangsters living in America. However, a few things are different this time around – it's Irish gangsters rather than Italian, and for the first time in his life, Scorsese is shooting a remake, of the Hong Kong film INFERNAL AFFAIRS. I haven't yet watched the original film but I'm pleased to say that THE DEPARTED is an example of the director at the top of his game and I'm completely satisfied that he finally won his best director Oscar for his efforts here.<br/><br/>To say too much would be to spoil the experience. Cinematography is spot on and the ensemble cast fantastic – headlined by DiCaprio, playing it on the edge as the undercover cop, and Damon as the hateful cool cucumber, a con on the inside. Jack Nicholson plays it OVER the edge as a past-his-prime gangster; gradually losing his marbles in a world of violence, while Ray Winstone's heavy is another weighty performance from this underrated star. Kudos to newcomer Vera Farmiga for holding her own among the established talent and Martin Sheen for taking a small role and running away with it. Mark Wahlberg also deserves mention for his Oscar-nominated supporting role as a foul-mouthed cop, the best of his career.<br/><br/>The plot twists and turns and is chock-full of Scorsese's trademark violence, with bloody shootings and beatings taking place throughout. The story is complex, forcing the viewer to give the film their full attention, so the 2 ½ hours just fly by as you're watching it. Things culminate in what I think is a very effective, brutal, shocking, sudden climax, which some people have criticised as being too rushed and too violent, but which I think is perfectly realistic, an example of how a house of cards can come tumbling down so suddenly. A perfect ending to a perfect film – and a must for all fans of twisty thrillers and gangster flicks."

Nicholson is one terrific actor, he is always great in his movies. Damon is pretty good as well. But DiCaprio really surprised me. He turned into a great actor as well.

But that's just old news.<br/><br/>The plot was really well polished. I think it was smart enough to make this film a good title. And just like the story, the script helped a lot.

","Review: <br/><br/>The Departed is by far Martin Scorsese's greatest film to date and shows off the raw and authentic talent of a master. His direction is, in some ways, particularly in this film unmatchful. The forging of each scene is coated in such panache and style that you could easily say that Scorsese has outdone himself. The dialogue and realism of the characters is un-believably well done. To take huge Hollywood stars like Di Caprio, Damon, Nicholson and Wahlburg and combine them into one lasting film is brilliant on it's own ground. The acting is rock hard to the end, and doesn't slip up. No pauses or one-off's, just firm all the way.<br/><br/>Verdict:<br/><br/>A compromising and memorable picture that one could re-watch time after time. This is pure cinema."

","The Deaparted is a very good crime/drama movie. This would've gotten a 10 if it was not for one thing-it is hard to follow the plot. I was able to catch a grasp on what the story is about. It's about an undercover cop spying on the evil guy-Costello and feeding information back to his detective bosses. Meanwhile, there is a rat from Costello in the police unit. This movie is very good. There are brand name actors and they live up to all the hype. Leonardo, Jack, Mark, and Matt were amazing performing their parts. This is a great move to add on Jack Nicholson's resume. The music by Howard Shore is not what you would expect. It is not ""Lord of the Rings"" music, but I still liked the music. This film is full of violence and cursing. That is what I liked about this.

"wes-connors","7","1","4","1 September 2008"," Red Meat for Oscar
","Martin Scorsese's blood-splattering story of organized crime and cell-phones, in Boston, Massachusetts. Mainly, it involves two infiltrators: Leonardo DiCaprio (as Billy Costigan Jr.) is a police officer sent undercover into the camp of ""Godfather""-type Jack Nicholson (as Frank Costello). Matt Damon (as Colin Sullivan) is an active detective working undercover for Mr. Nicholson. It is an intriguing plot, directed with a abundance of flair.<br/><br/>Mr. Scorsese quite interestingly teams up Nicholson with Mr. DiCaprio; the two actors have often been compared. Nicholson clearly revels in his character; DiCaprio plays along, stroking his face as Nicholson seems to improvise. Mr. Damon is less showy, and more effective; he uses is natural accent well, and is the most consistent of the three leads. The supporting cast is solid. Mark Wahlberg (as Dignam) makes the best of the secondary roles. Pay attention to what Mr. Wahlberg says about haircuts; he's dead on.<br/><br/>I have the comic book Nicholson buys Damon's character when he's a kid: it's ""Wolverine #11"", dated early ""EARLY SEP"" 1989. Note that Scorsese reprises the ""bag of groceries"" scene at the end of the movie, without the comic. Rats! That, and the over reliance of cell-phones, place the setting as (roughly) around the film's year of release. I wonder, were the Boston police amused? <br/><br/>The soundtrack seems inappropriately laced with ""oldies""; probably, this is reflective of Nicholson's domineering character. It's odd to hear John Lennon's relatively obscure ""Well, Well, Well"" played; perversely, Lennon is mentioned as a ""Costello"" favorite. Scorsese should have considered using the Plastic Ono Band album's ""Working Class Hero""; the song's infamous use of what Lennon called the ""Fuh King"" word would have been appropriate.<br/><br/>Scorsese, with a dose of Nicholson, proved to be irresistible red meat for ""Oscar"" voters; but, this isn't the director's best work.<br/><br/>******* The Departed (2006) Martin Scorsese ~ Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson"

","WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>Summary:<br/><br/>Basically, a bunch of dudes double cross a bunch of other dudes and everybody dies. Except for Mark Whalberg. And then Martin Scorcese wins some Oscars in all the confusion.<br/><br/>Review:<br/><br/>As entertainment, this film excels. But what exactly was ""The Departed"" doing at the Oscars? I've seen the film twice now, and I still don't understand. This seems to be a case of style outweighing substance. The action is well paced, which probably helps conceal the thinly written characters and predictable plot. The only actor who is really given anything to work with is Leonardo DiCaprio, and he's done much better. Jack Nicholson plays his standard role: the really sketchy old guy with a disquieting leer and an insatiable lust for power (I apologize for the over-simplification, but it was just too darn fun to pass up). Matt Damon is basically... Matt Damon. Enough said.<br/><br/>I can't remember what else was up for Best Picture that year, but it was robbed of an Oscar. ""The Departed"" is an average crime drama. it lacks the cultural significance of ""The Godfather"" and the character development of films like ""Donnie Brasco."" It's worth watching on a Friday night with some friends and a large pizza (with extra cheese), just don't expect a masterpiece."
"Niv-1","8","1","4","26 August 2008"," Excellent movie.
","I think that The Departed is very funny. Baldwin and Wahlberg steal the movie with their humor. The script by William Monhan is one of the best of 2006.<br/><br/>DiCaprio and Damon were excellent. I don't think DiCaprio is very Irish looking but this his second Irish role for Scorsese and he gives a great performance. He is not as good as Damon who I thought could have been a successful lawyer and politician if not for his mafia ties.<br/><br/>I think the ending from the elevator scene to the final scene is tragic.<br/><br/>There seemed to be a lot of jump cuts in the editing and I didn't expect that.<br/><br/>The silent cell phone call and the street chase are well done. Scorsese did the suspense very well.<br/><br/>I think that Jack Nicholson gave a good performance though not one of his best."
"hardrock666","9","1","4","3 August 2008"," Scorsese has simply complimented the original.
","n a strange twist of irony, a Hollywood movie borrows from a Hong Kong film hugely inspired by American crime classics. Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed"" does seem to be influenced by ""Infernal Affairs"" - the Hong Kong film released in 2002.<br/><br/>Scorsese has simply complimented the original. The film's script retains the essence of the earlier film but also adds much more flesh to it.This is Leonardo Dicaprio's third film with Scorsese after ""Gangs of New York"" and ""The Aviator"".<br/><br/>The plot revolves around Billy Costigan (Dicaprio), a cop pretending to be a crook and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) doing just the opposite. They both soon find themselves embroiled in situations where it becomes increasingly difficult to tell the good from the bad, as the line gets more and more blurred.<br/><br/>Colin has been trained to be a mole by his gangster mentor Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy, on the other hand, realises that he will never be a good cop and so agrees to go undercover and join Costello's gang. As the story progresses, the pressure on the two becomes unbearable as they have to do things completely against their true nature ... and they fail.<br/><br/>The movie's thrill factor is served well by a series of coincidences like when Billy and Colin fall for Madolyn (Vera Farmiga), the psychiatrist who treats Billy but is already involved with Colin. With a story where the main characters have to lie their way out of every situation, there have to be enough twists and the plot's ends are not tied up till the very last frame of the film.<br/><br/>One of the strongest points of the movie is the acting. Both Dicaprio and Damon are excellent. They even begin to start looking like each other as they become more and more entrenched in their deception.Jack Nicholson, who is a legend in his own right, is brilliant in this role where he sinks his teeth with devilish charm and delight. His performance is electrifying in what is surprisingly the first time he has teamed up with Scorsese.<br/><br/>Farmiga convincingly portrays a great mix of sex appeal and intellect.<br/><br/>Alec Baldwin, playing the arrogant policeman, has some of the funniest moments with Wahlberg's Dignam. Martin Sheen plays the father figure Captain Queenan - the warmest character in the movie. He may not be ruthless but he is honest and dedicated.The violence in the film jarring at times but seems to be judiciously used for the right impact. It is not blood soaked as much as sprinkled. It fits in well with the gritty nature of the place, profession and people in the film.<br/><br/>Scorsese has always been a director who has tackled grandiose themes like sin, redemption and loyalty. But in ""The Departed"", he sticks to a more narrative framework but still tackles the themes albeit more subtly.The script is by William Monahan, which comes as a pleasant surprise considering his last script was for the bloated, flat and insipid ""Kingdom of Heaven"".<br/><br/>Howard Shore contributes to the score but is helped by Scorsese's brilliant use of pop music, which is a trait of all his movies. There is an interesting mix of The Rolling Stones, John Lennon, the rapper Nas, Van Morrison and the Beach Boys.<br/><br/>""The Departed"" is pure entertainment in the mould of an American crime classic, but is sure to please audiences the world over."

And Acting, those are probably the best Actors you can find, Jack Nicholson 3 times Oscar award winner, in this movie he is a mob boss but more like a small-time Shylock to me Leonard Dicaprio no doubt the most popular actor now in Hollywood and of course he can ACT, best known from Titanic, Aviator, in the movie he is a undercover police, but when he told Jack Nicholson that he is not a rat and i see the look on his face, looking into his eyes and i don't believe him, wonder why then didn't kill him. Matt Damon became popular from The Bourne series within this few years in this movie he is a gangster interfuse into the Police Department, his uneven perform can't really make the audience believe who he truly is. Mark Wahlberg is a smart one barely show his face but got nominated for best actor in supporting role. And in the end i just want to say, Martin What happened this is not you."
"j30bell","7","1","4","3 August 2007"," Not really a Scorsese film
","The title above is nonsense, of course, as it clearly is a Scorsese film, both in tone and style. The problem, though, is it ought not to be.<br/><br/>For those who haven't seen Infernal Affairs  the film on which The Departed is based - the plot revolves around two men. An undercover cop, infiltrating a mob gang in Boston (DiCaprio) and an undercover mobster (Damon), who has infiltrated the police force at the arrangement of the appallingly psychotic Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson).<br/><br/>Frenetic action ensues as the two warring tribes tear each other apart in order to find their respective moles. Meanwhile, both undercover men are struggling with their identity. But which one will crack first? Taking aside the remake issue for a moment, does the film work on its own terms? Partially. The story is excellent and involving, and while it is a long film at nearly 2hours 30min, it keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. The characters are very well drawn, and there is clear movement in both characters, which helps to engage the audience. Leonardo DiCaprio is truly excellent as Billy Costigan, the mole for the Boston Police Department; and a special mention must also go to Mark Wahlberg, who manages to steal just about every scene he's in.<br/><br/>However, despite these notable strengths, I completely failed to leave the cinema feeling wowed. Entertained, with out a doubt, but this is a long way from being Scorsese's best work.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is the juxtaposition of violence and humour. While being an excellent director in almost every respect, Scorsese is no Tarantino when it comes to violence and humour. The humour worked fine on its own terms (Wahlberg, in particular, was hilarious) but it was used in a clunky way, and disrupted the mood and the pace of the film.<br/><br/>Another problem was Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello. Jack is unleashed in The Departed  and not in a good way. He seems to think he's playing The Joker again. I'm not quite sure what either Nicholson or Scorsese though they were doing with all those rat imitations. In these circumstances, the insanity of the mobster would normally intimidate the other characters  and the audience (c.f. Mr Blonde in The Reservoir Dogs). Here, either the chemistry between Leo and Jack was wrong; or the scene was badly written or performed (I suspect the later). It just didn't work.<br/><br/>So to the remake issue. In many respects, The Departed is a photographic negative of Infernal Affairs, which suffered from poor characterisation, but had spectacularly slick plotting, and a coherent tone.<br/><br/>It would be wrong to expect a remake to mimic the style of the original. But in this case, where style and substance are so inextricably fused in the original, it can be dangerous to mess with it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Infernal Affairs had Michael Mann written all over it. It needed a highly stylised treatment and, dare I say it, California. Something just doesn't ring true in The Departed. It was a good film, but something was just wrong."
"gurlpower07","Null","1","4","20 July 2007"," Good movie for one that's just a REMAKE but far far from Scorcese's best...
","Scorcese is a legend as a filmmaker, anyone who is a true movie fan can agree with that. Movies like Mean streets, Taxidriver, Raging Bull and even the underrated After Hours know these are masterpieces of storytelling and film-making technique.<br/><br/>So after been disappointed by Bringing out the Dead, Gangs of New York and even The Aviator, it was nice to see The Departed come to life with such buzz and energy. It kept me on the edge of my seat, the performances were really good, even Jack was good at being Jack as we all know, the soundtrack pulsated with a couple of cool Oirish tunes (thank goodness no U2!). <br/><br/>The ending was also a punch in the gut. On the negative side, because one expects more with a Scorsese movie and one that cost 80 million dollars and is a remake, the script felt a little contrived, especially the romantic triangle, and also Matt Damon's character acts really stupid and was so dumb near the end. Won't spoil but you just think, if he had a brain, he would never do that (hint:the citizen's letter) <br/><br/>Overall a good movie but not a great movie, its edited fast and moves along briskly for its 140 minutes, so enjoy but don't expect it to be vintage Scorsese, I think those days are long gone."

I enjoyed it, didn't have any expectations when i saw it. The idea seemed genuine, quite a few good acting scenes, directing didn't stand out on the other hand, dramatic ending - somewhat emotional-wannabe in what seemed at the time a good blend of ideas put on tape. Fast forward to a week ago, browsing Asian cinema reviews i find a title i consider worth my time, that i just finished watching, turns out it's the original story this is based on with : minor slips, better acting, better script, better editing, i'd go so far as to say it even has a better soundtrack that builds a great atmosphere. The thing that really disturbed me is that it has a lower rating than this, The Departed being just a cheap knock-off benefiting from a Made in USA tag, having Scorsese for a director which was, as they put it, way overdue to getting an Oscar (not necessarily meritous for this picture), and worldwide publicity due to the Oscars. More originality please, don't just copy scripts and adapt with cheap jokes and well payed actors just to make a mediocre picture. Enough reasons to get my first under 5 rating.

","First gripe, Jack Nicholson, an American-Irish mobster?? give me a break. Nicholson is way passed his sell-by, a miscast one dimensional performance, Nicholson is always Nicholson in my opinion (The Crossing Guard was the last movie of his that I enjoyed) most definitely not convincing as a psycho mobster. The other badly miscast role in my opinion was that of Wahlberg as a hard-nut cop, lame, an Oscar for that??? I can not fault the casting of DiCaprio or Damon, both were feasible, same can be said for the supporting cast. For the most part I did not find the plot engaging, though I enjoyed the ending, I can't say I anticipated it resolving in that manner. I found the constant non-diegetic mood music not only unnecessary but irritating, I really do not see why it was there, it did nothing to enhance the movie, it was simply cheesy, was that the intention? I really can not fathom how this work was awarded an Oscar for best movie, Scorsese is out of touch, passed his sell-by, just like Nicholson - they should just have given him (Scorsese) the life time achievement award and given the Oscar for Direction and Best movie to Babel (which, in terms of the cinematic art, was leagues above The Departed). I know there are people who enjoy this type of movie, most likely the same ones who have religiously followed the Sopranos since it's inception, but I just found it stale. Scorseses' days as a ground breaking film maker have long since passed, but if he can do no wrong in your eyes, you'll love this."
"kosmasp","7","1","4","9 May 2007"," Scorsese did a good job remaking an awesome movie
","Most of the people who went to see the Departed, didn't know anything about the movie ""Infernal Affairs"". A great Chinese movie (part one of a trilogy), that left viewers yearning for more cop thrillers like these. Although no one actually thought of an US Remake. But if you make an American version, at least use a great director. Which they did, with Scorsese.<br/><br/>The story isn't exactly copied from the Chinese Original, but you get many high points from the Original. And some shock moments, might not shock you as much as they did with people, who haven't seen the Original. Some roles are also changed here. And here comes a funny fact (it might be written here on IMDb somewhere), that of one Jack Nicholson, who changed his role and the script as they went along with the filming. And even if his co-stars didn't mind (at least they didn't say otherwise), Ballhaus (cinematographer, DP) wasn't amused! And it seems as if this incident (like changing the whole set-up for a scene, just for Nicholson and lighting kind of everything, just to be sure to have Jack's spontaneous outbursts on film) causes Ballhaus considering, not working with Scorsese anymore.<br/><br/>But that's just behind the scenes. What matters is the result on screen. And that is good enough to watch. After reading the Oscar nominations, one could feel, that it might be Scorsese time. And although it's not his best film he ever made, Scorsese was overdue for an Academy Award!. I haven't said anything about the movie's plot, because I think you should watch the Original for the full impact ... but only if you're not afraid or have prejudices against Chinese movies!"
"Leopold2","10","1","4","28 April 2007"," Brilliant!
","The Departed is the first Martin Scorsese film I've seen and I have to say this was brilliant. This is a great adaption of the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs. This is well directed, well written and all of the actors were great in their roles. Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan (a rookie cop.) Matt Damon as Colin and Jack Nicholson as the evil mob boss Frank Costello. I also think it is really good how Scorsese included some clever humour. I'm not surprised that this won best picture, this is probably the best film of 2006.<br/><br/>This has a lot of language and violence in it, as do most of his movies.<br/><br/>I intend to watch more of Scorsese's films in the future. 5/5. A great return for him."
"hdulai1","6","1","4","25 April 2007"," Remake
","This was a great movie, I thought that it was an original screenplay and story that is until I found out that this is a remake of a Hong Kong movie called ""Infernal Affairs"" which was coincidentally the working title for ""The Departed"". The story is identical, it's about a story between a mole in the police department and an undercover cop. Their objectives are the same: to find out who is the mole, and who is the cop. It is for this reason that I gave the film "" The Departed"" a lower rating after initially giving it a high one. I am actually disappointed in Martin Scorcese, considering the track record he has with making great films, for ripping off the idea of another film. I guess he's run out of ideas. It used to be that foreign movies would copy Hollywood movies, it's now the other way around and actually one of the best director's of our time that is doing so."
"The Grand Master","10","1","4","3 April 2007"," Up there with Martin Scorsese's best movies. Legendary.
","Martin Scorsese has directed many legendary movies from Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Casino, and many more. The Departed is up there as one of Martin Scorsese's best movies. The cast and acting is top notch. It's a remake of a Hong Kong flick ""Infernal Affairs"", but I feel that ""The Departed"" is way superior. It's four academy awards were well earned.<br/><br/>Leonardo Di Caprio is an police officer who has been sent undercover to infiltrate Frank Costello's Mafia (Jack Nicholson) and inform the police of his actions. Little does anyone know, Frank Costello has sent a young criminal (Matt Damon) to become a police officer in the Massachusetts State Police Department as a mole and inform the mafia of when the police are going to strike. When discoveries are made of a mole in both sides of the law, both men have to survive to avoid being caught. There are many twists and turns in this 2 and a 1/2 hour long movie, but you will be hooked. The screenplay and soundtrack is top notch.<br/><br/>Leonardo Di Caprio buries his pretty boy image to turn in one of his best performances as conflicted undercover police officer Billy Costigan who is deep undercover in the mafia he may not make it out let alone lose his identity forever.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is known to play likable characters, but he is brilliantly cast against type as the highly ambitious and intelligent, yet deceptive and arrogant Colin Sullivan who has not forgotten what his main role is, as an informant to the mafia while rising up the ranks of the Massachusetts State Police and into the elite Special Investigation Unit.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson was legendary as the ultimately evil mafia boss Frank Costello who has ruled Boston for many years. Costello is up there with Nicholson's best characters such as Jack Torrence, Randall Mc Murphy, Col. Nathan Jessup, and The Joker. Frank Costello is unrestrained and is like a walking time bomb waiting to explode. It was an absolute shame that Jack Nicholson missed out on a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Jack nailed the role. No other actor could have done so.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg was excellent as Sergeant Dignam, an honest, but very belligerent and foul mouthed policeman. What you see is what you get and this man speaks his mind without a damn in the world. At first, I was surprised that he was up for Best Supporting Actor, but it was well deserved and he chews up every scene he is in.<br/><br/>The all-star supporting cast is dynamite. Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Ray Winstone, Anthony Anderson, and the lovely Vera Farmiga are an integral part of the movie.<br/><br/>Final comment, The Departed is legendary and one of the best movies I have seen in a long time and is way up there as Martin Scorsese's best movies.<br/><br/>10/10."

","I think that the best movies make you care about the characters in it. That way if they are in peril (or die) your emotions are stirred.<br/><br/>I didn't care about one single character in this movie! *****spoilers******** I liked Nicholson's performance, but if he is an FBI informer, who is he turning in? I thought HE was the big fish? Everybody else gets shot in the head, and we don't give a s***! We used to joke as kids when you don't know what to do for an ending, just say ""and everybody died"". Well in this movie, everybody gets shot in the head, except the Mark Wahlberg character (who you wish would get shot in the head!) The fact that this movie won the academy award makes me realize how useless those awards have become. How can swearing and gunshots to the head be the best picture? ...and the holes in the plot have already been described by others here. A terrible movie, that I will not watch again."

","When I heard that this flick won 4 Oscars, I got my hands on it and watched it.<br/><br/>It was quite entertaining experience, however nothing more.

The character development... Wait... What character development? I was hoping for a masterpiece like Casino. What I got was an entertaining flick you might wanna watch with a bunch of beer loving colleagues.<br/><br/>Compared to Mann's ""Heat"" which also is about good and bad guys, ""The Departed"" is thin and weak."
"tedleytee2003","4","1","4","4 March 2007"," An average mob movie that can't hold a candle to Goodfellas, The Godfather, Scarface and other true masterpieces.
","I was greatly disappointed in The Departed, which I feel was overrated and does not stand up to other Martin Scorsese masterpieces such as those mentioned in the summary as well as other classics such as Raging Bull, The Color of Money, Taxi Driver and Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore. Compared to those movie giants, The Departed meanders annoyingly, and the only reason I can see for awarding Mr. Scorsese an Oscar for direction is to acknowledge his ability to direct such actors of stature through a film with essentially no script; but, even so, someone of Martin Scorsese's talent should have been able to do a better job, or have the judgment to pass on the script, which was adapted by William Monahan from the 2002 Hong Kong crime thriller Infernal Affairs, written by by Felix Chong and Siu Fai Mak, and in the opinion of some was superior to Mr. Monahan's screenplay. While the plot had possibilities, they were not realized. Each of the performances delivered were in themselves excellent, but the the plot and progression of events just were not presented in a way that pulls the viewer in the way other Scorsese films have done. So, it is an ""ok"" film, but not, in my opinion close to being Oscar-worthy. Mr. Scorsese is a brilliant director and deserves an Academy Award for the aforementioned films, but in this viewer's opinion, not for this one."
"thiu","4","1","4","4 March 2007"," Ripoff of a classic Chinese movie
","**SPOILERS** I can't believe this movie won the best picture category and martin won as the director when he just copied the original infernal affairs. And an inferior remake at that. All the scenes are the same except for some of the over violent parts like when Mark Wahlberg kills Matt. When I watched Infernal Affairs, it was violent, real and really had heart. It's message was it was better to live your life righteously rather than live a long unrighteous life that was why Andy Lau (Matt in the Chinese version) lives. This was actually the only difference in the movie. Everything was the same! Even when the 2 criminals are discussing how they know who are the cops. This film winning the 2 categories means that American cinema has lost its creativity and needs to resort to copying the exact same movie except making it inferior."

","Yes this movie was good, but it was so over-hyped that I felt let down afterward. Great acting by the A list cast and the director did his usual work, but he deserved an Oscar for other better work. Ending did leave you scratching your head, but I believe that was an editor's cut which failed to explain what happens at end. Use you imagination to fill in cut of what was in the letter and box. I did gain new respect for Leonardo's acting. This guy did a bang up job and stole many scenes from his co-workers. Personally I have developed a dislike for Matt's work though. Sometimes I feel he tries too hard and not let his natural ability come through as in the first few years of his career. Wahlberg was so intense in his few scenes but he took the film to an all new level. Great work by all, just bad editing that made the movie jumbled at times."

"dwpeak","10","1","4","25 December 2006"," An American Masterpiece
","Martin Scorsese is undoubtedly one of the best directors who ever lived. From ""Mean Streets"" to ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Raging Bull,"" and ""GoodFellas,"" he has entertained audiences for years on end. Now, you can add the Academy Award-winning ""The Departed"" to that list of films. This is his best effort yet.<br/><br/>Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) grew up with his father in the South Boston projects. He did things in order to survive, and these things were not always legal. Later in life, he enters the Massachussetts State Police in order to rid the dirt off of his family's name. This catches the eye of Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Seargent Dignam (Mark Wahlberg), who are interested in his presence, due to Billy's history of assault, but they also realize how this could work to their advantage. Costigan's superiors bring him into Queenan's office. The cops want him to infiltrate the violent Irish Mob lead by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). With a healthy bonus involved, Billy agrees to do it. His job is to gain information and bring it back to either Dignam or Queenan. What the police don't know, however, is that the psychotic mob boss has planted a mole of his own in the state police force, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon). The fatherless Sullivan meets Costello when he is collecting money from a local proprietor. The gangster takes the young boy under his wing, and becomes the crazed father figure. Eventually, the hard-working Sullivan gets numerous promotions within the force, and once Costigan has infiltrated the crime syndicate, he gains the trust of Costello each day. Sooner than not, both moles find out about each other's existence, and it becomes a cat- and-mouse game. The movie is about how far humans can go living a lie, and whether or not a person deserves a chance at redemption.<br/><br/>""The Departed"" sounds like a cop/thriller, but it is the genre Scorsese knows best: crime/drama. This is a gangster film to the bone, and it works flawlessly. I have never been much of a Leonardo Dicaprio fan, but his performances of late, especially in this film, are making me think differently. He adds so much emotion and humanity to the role of Billy Costigan. He is amazing here. Matt Damon's Colin Sullivan is a deeply complex individual, who is caught in a world of trouble, and he does a great job. Jack Nicholson gives the best performance of his career as Frank Costello. His character is the ultimate idea of evil, and he does it so convincingly, that it almost becomes real. Mark Wahlberg is flawless as Dignam. He is the most profane, hilarious, and serious character. It's interpreted so perfectly that it becomes one of the movie's best performances. Great jobs from Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, Vera Farmiga, and Alec Baldwin as well.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese won an Academy Award for his directing here. Yes, he's deserved it before, and he deserves it now. This film is breathtaking. He works every scene like there's nothing to it, and the result is an American masterpiece.<br/><br/>The perfect screenplay from William Monahan (based on Infernal Affairs), takes so many chances, has great dialogue, and a wonderful plot structure. It was the ultimate guide for the master filmmaker.<br/><br/>In the end, there's nothing not to like. We weave in and out of the criminal underworld, and it was done by the movie-maker who knows that place best. The film is not without importance, and even dips into Biblical themes of how violence should be interpreted. It's a Scorsese film; it's also the most entertaining film of the year. Yes, it's dead-serious, and even tragic, but it's a blast to watch. In the hands of another director, would this have been possible? The Best Picture-winning movie is so good, that it ranks up with the best films ever made. It fits together like a puzzle, and the result is fascinating. This piece of Shakespeare is the greatest portrait of organized crime in film history."

","""The Departed"" is an excellently packaged film. It has great acting, with Nicholson chewing scenery as the villain and both DiCaprio and Damon turning in fine performances. Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin are standout as well. It had good production values, which you'd expect from a Scorsese vehicle. It had a generally fine script with an excellent premise, dealing with themes of fatherhood, loyalty, etc with lots of suspense and action thrown in. However, somehow all these ingredients didn't add up to a particularly satisfying cinematic experience for me. I felt like a voyeur watching the film unfold. I was never drawn into the story or felt any identification with the characters. I may have been interested in what happened next, but did not really care emotionally. As I was leaving the theater, I overheard someone commenting that the only way anyone could say this was a five star movie was because there were five stars in it. I would have to agree."

It's the best gangster movie ever made. + It's a lot funnier than any other film in it's genre.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson adds another great movie to his legend.

"Doylenf","8","1","4","17 November 2006"," All this and treachery too...gangsterism on a grand scale...
","Just as THE GANGS OF NEW YORK created a stir of Oscar talk, this time it looks like a sure bet that LEONARDO DiCAPRIO, JACK NICHOLSON and MARK WAHLBERG will at least be nominated for Oscars in whatever category (lead or support) the Academy decides. I didn't think MATT DAMON's performance was on the same level as the others, but there were also some fine supporting jobs by MARTIN SHEEN, ALEC BALDWIN and others in the large cast.<br/><br/>A story of the Irish Mafia vs. the Boston police force, it teems with violent episodes and each scene has a tense undercurrent where you know some kind of volatile payoff is about to happen. You can almost choke on the intensity in some of the vivid scenes between Nicholson and DiCaprio as they eyeball each other, exploring what's going on in the other's mind as they play out their dangerous cat-and-mouse assignments. DiCaprio is a mole assigned by Sheen and Wahlberg to do undercover work for the cops. Damon is Nicholson's top man, assigned to find out who the mole is.<br/><br/>All of the intensity is fully charged from the opening scenes with Nicholson visiting the local deli and lending his menacing presence to even the simplest scene. Every bit of suspense possible is wrung from a very effective screenplay that includes treachery and murder on a grand scale.<br/><br/>By the time we arrive at the point where Damon finds out who the mole is, the suspense is tripled and there's a final orgy of a shootout that brings the film to a bloody climax. Definitely not a film for the queasy or faint of heart.<br/><br/>A huskier looking LEONARDO DiCAPRIO proves he has much more than boyish charm and good looks. He's matured as an actor and delivers a tremendously moving performance, holding his own against such heavyweights as JACK NICHOLSON and MARTIN SHEEN.<br/><br/>Summing up: A masterpiece of its kind, thoroughly absorbing all the way through, destined to reap plenty of Oscar nominations and--who knows--maybe even a win or two. Absolutely ranks among the top American gangster films."

","sorry to ruin the movie but i didn't like that much i believe the story line was 95% completely the same as the Chinese action movie .. INFERNAL AFFAIRS and i prefer the Chinese version due to the fact that its not confusing and its straight to the point. The Deparated was too long and had too much characters for it to end clearly. Though it did have some nice action in it. But what i don't get is, whats with all the head shots in the movie? i can clearly pick up at least 10 of them within the film. But i do give credit to the actors, they did a great job as their characters. What i find a lot is that mat daemon is doing a lot of action movie nowadays, i'm not saying he not the right person for it but i'm finding it hard to imagine mat daemon as a action type of person. i can understand STUCK IN YOU, he did a perfect job in that one.

","I *really* enjoyed this movie. The first time I've been wowed at the cinema this year.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent, aided by a fantastic storyline. Each character is given substance and life, and you become aware of unspoken relationships between them. Special mention should go to Jack Nicholson, who really brings depth and life to the bad guy.<br/><br/>The backdrops are gritty and real, the language coarse and vulgar. The police offices are just as dark and sinister as the gang hangouts. If you stop paying attention for a moment, you'll miss the pithy dialogues. And the plot is deep and twisted, definitely not an after-work relaxation flick.<br/><br/>My only complaint (and I might be alone here) is that Leo DiCaprio and Matt Damon look too much like one another. I initially got very confused because I couldn't tell the two characters apart. Fortunately DiCaprio's tortured character quickly develops facial hair, and it was easy to follow after that.<br/><br/>The way the story ended was also a little disappointing, but it was faithful to the original film.<br/><br/>Thoroughly recommended."
"redsoxmb545-1","10","1","4","21 October 2006"," One Of The Best Films Of The Year
","The Departed is a superb film which takes place in an Irish neighborhood in South Boston. Matt Damon stars as Colin Sullivan, a young criminal working for Frank Costello, an Irish mafia figure played by Jack Nicholson. Costello assigns Sullivan to infiltrate the Boston police department. Leonardo DeCaprio plays a member of the Boston police department, who simultaneously is assigned to infiltrate the mob syndicate run by Costello. Both the mob syndicate and the police department soon realize there's a mole in their organization. Both mole's paths cross in a fantastic, interesting, and somewhat complicated and violent tale of deceit, murder, and mayhem. The Departed is filled with great lead actors as well as supporting actors such as Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, and Anthony Anderson. All of the actors are at the top of their game in this film, and Martin Scorsese deserves an Oscar as Best Director, which he will most likely win. This is one of the best films of the year. This is what going to the movies is all about."

","This is a big thumb in the eye from New York to Boston. The fact that Boston actors participated in such a cavalier, irresponsible glorification of violence that perpetuates negative stereotypes about the city and its people is surprising. The real story Scorcese should have brought to the screen is why there are more than 70 unsolved homicides in the city and why the police get so little cooperation from public. Why it took so long to finish this movie is the real mystery, not the intrigues going on in the bumbling police department. The one redeeming thing is Jack Nicholson's performance. No one else in the movie comes close to his genius. He owns the screen."

","This is a fun movie for about 2 hours, but unfortunately it goes on for another half hour. The ending is entirely unsatisfying. But let's talk about the acting--Nicholson is mesmerizing as always. I don't know that his character makes a whole lot of sense, but you can't take your eyes off him when he's on screen. Alec Baldwin shines in a small part as a captain. Matt Damon is serviceable enough, but then he doesn't really have much range as an actor anyway, does he? The mystery here is the praise being heaped on Mark Wahlberg who is not only out of control, screaming every line, but often indecipherable. Bad role, big ham.<br/><br/>But the movie belongs to Leonardo Dicaprio. He's just great, well-deserving of any awards he receives. The whole point of watching the entire film is to find out what happens to his character, thanks to his emotionally-wrenching performance.<br/><br/>A big bounceback for him from the nightmare that was ""Gangs of New York."" For Scorcese, at least this isn't a debacle like that one. Thankfully no sign of Daniel Day-Lewis's ridiculous mustache (I do believe it's now starring on ""My Name Is Earl,"" pasted on Jason Lee's face.)"

Jack Nicholson is brilliant and I believe that Scorsese has found his star for his big time movies in Leonardo Dicaprio (as Robert Deniro was for a bunch of his movies). Matt Damon plays a great role for the crooked cop. Leo is the typical cop who is an informant to the police in how he is always fearing for his life and always nervous. To me the movie is one of the top 30 movies of all time even though the accents of a Yankee are kind of not good at times. But the movie keeps you at the edge of your seat.

In the original Infernal Affairs the sound was its meal ticket every thing was Sharpe and clear bullets going everywhere,music playing and ring-tones echoing in your ear i am glad the American version this version live up to that standard because it was done to perfection.what else can I say the cast was brilliant what a combo of star actors and the good thing was they all got there fair share of input into making this film ingenious.individually Leonardo DI Caprio should be nominated for best actor at the Oscars hell they all should jack, mark, Matt ,martin and Alec they all were excellent in this film. Also i am making a personal recommendation for martin Scorsese for best director at the Oscars and if he loses it has got to be rigged against him.everything about this films was great the music,actors,action,story,directing,and of course the fact that they were Irish made it even cooler."
"flat6","8","1","4","7 October 2006"," a competent remake
","This is more of a original-vs.-remake review, so you may not get much out of my words if you haven't seen the original. Anyway, having already watched ""Infernal Affairs"", I was pleased to realize Hollywood didn't completely muck it up with ""The Daparted"" remake. Here's a brief comparison, bluntly delineated for brevity's sake.<br/><br/>Parts where ""Infernal Affairs"" is better:<br/><br/><ul><li>Shorter. Although ""The Departed"" doesn't noticeably lag, the difference in pacing and intensity between a 100 minute and a 150 minute movie is huge.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The two lead actors are better than DiCaprio and Damon. That's a big claim, since the two American actors put in excellent performances, but the original's portrayals are that much more powerful. DiCaprio's Hong Kong equivalent in particular (Tony Leung) does a far more nuanced fall into the hopelessness and depression of an endangered undercover agent.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Much more realistic about undercover communication. There's this wonderful Morse-code scene that's far more clever and believable than I'm-behind-a-corner-typing-text- messages.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Jack Nicholson is over-the-top-Jack, and while that's entertaining, it's noticeably inferior to the original's evil crime boss.</li></ul><br/><br/>Parts where ""The Departed"" is excellent:<br/><br/><ul><li>Marky Mark's cursing role that's so lovably a**holish.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Alec Baldwin's lightning-quick streaks of witty profanity. The script's dialogue really does have some brilliantly funny and clever lines, so you walk away from the movie feeling you've just seen an intelligent brand of violence.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The fact that people get beat when they need to; any time I thought 'that guy's acting like he deserves a beating', he promptly got a pummeling the movie really flows.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The great choice of music, played at the appropriate times. Rolling Stones, and 50's pop played to sardonic effect how can you go wrong?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The move to Boston adds a social commentary perspective that the original doesn't have. Granted, the original didn't suffer from its focus, but the remake's adding of a more complex setting adds an enjoyable layer. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The complex storyline isn't dumbed down, and that really impressed me, as I was left thinking 'the filmmakers must have some real confidence in the American public'. Sadly, having read some of the more negative reviews around here, it's apparent some people had some real problems following the movie's plot. Rest assured it's your own failure, not the movie's.</li></ul><br/><br/>Parts where ""The Departed"" plainly sucked:<br/><br/><ul><li>What's with the useless FBI side-plot? It contributes absolutely nothing.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The ending's final death. Cleaning up after itself like American movies tend to, it leaves none of the bitter complexity of the original. Having a guilty man walk around with his guilt, while a good man lays unavenged, is a more multifaceted than the tacky ""bad guy dies"" of the American remake.</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall, ""The Departed"" is still a wonderful movie, and different enough from ""Infernal Affairs"" to be its own movie worth watching."
"zakkdotcom","9","1","4","7 October 2006"," Best Two and a Half Hours you can spend at the Movies
","I had VERY high expectations going into this film, they were easily surpassed. First off, don't shy away from this film because it is two and a half hours long, it's so engrossing the time flies by. The plot is simple to follow but complex in nature. The acting is stellar, Nicholson is especially entertaining. The music is fitting and truly represents Boston. What makes this film truly special, though, is the editing and direction. Scenes are spliced and mixed in unique, yet, fitting order. It adds to the emotion and feeling of the piece. Now the only reason I am giving this a movie a 9 is the ending, (it's not a bad ending, just not what I was hoping for.) This film should easily reach the IMDb top 250 and should definitely be considered come Oscar season."
"the_Poppuns","9","1","4","7 October 2006"," If you are a movie fan at all you have to see this movie
","I am not a Martin Scorsese fan, not at all, so I'm surprised to be here telling you that I really liked this movie. Let's get a few things out of the way first. I can't stand Matt Damon. So I'm pretty much going to leave him out of this review. Leonardo DiCaprio, I've thought has been underrated for a long time even with the praise he's gotten recently. I thought he was one of the best actors out there going into this movie. Also, I didn't get to see 'Infernal Affairs'. I meant to and when I can get my hands on an undubbed copy I will.<br/><br/>DiCaprio definitely did not disappoint and acting-wise I think he basically wipes the floor with the rest of the cast. This is no diss on Jack, because Jack is Jack. He can walk on water basically but in the scenes with them together as a movie fan you think to yourself ""is Leo going to be able to handle it?"" and somewhere in the middle of the scene you realize he's the one commanding it. Really if you are a fan of movies at all you have to see this, for the performances alone. Some of the accents were a little iffy but that's to be expected. I mean everyone here does good work but you can sell repeat tickets on the scenes with Jack and Leo. Think Pacino/DeNiro in the movie 'Heat' but better and more often.<br/><br/>The movie is about Boston cops trying to take down a titan of the underworld. Nothing new here, but the story has, not twists but, double crosses and synchronistic incidents that baffle without being contrived or remotely ridiculous. I can't imagine any crime fan not enjoying this movie and wanting to see it again right away. I'm not going to go into the plot anymore because you need to see it. But with all that it's not confusing, or every critics' favorite word lately, incoherent. You know who's who and what's what the whole time. You are completely on the edge of your seat and some things are predictable but it's the stuff that you don't want to happen. So you sit there with your stomach in knots hoping it doesn't. Is it violent? Of course, but it's nothing we haven't seen especially from Scorsese. Actually the scene that for me was the most excruciating to watch involved no blood at all.<br/><br/>A few minor complaints. I don't understand Martin Scorsese's use of music. It seems like he likes to drown out his dialogue, and then using the same songs repeatedly, I mean, who does that? And I'm a hater of remakes so I have to take one point off for that. Some old ladies coming out of the theater complained that there was too much unnecessary swearing, but really, consider the source.<br/><br/>Now back to the guy I don't like. The reason I don't like him is the same reason that I thought this was perfect casting. I kept hoping and hoping for other actors to take a swing at him. And I can tell you that this was the most fulfilling thing about the movie for me. I felt vindicated because someone saw what I've seen in him all this time to cast him in this role. And I got to see people I like much better beat him up a little bit. I may just by the DVD for that reason alone.<br/><br/>So I'm thinking this will get nominated for Best Picture. I personally would like Leo to win a cumulative Oscar with this one. I'm thinking the Scorsese fans might finally get their win in the Best Director category. And if they do, I'm cool with it. This was his best in my opinion since Taxi Driver.<br/><br/>edit: I have seen Infernal Affairs now and I thought they were equally good and different enough that The Departed still deserves the praise it's received."
"cycling_2008","10","1","4","7 October 2006"," Best Picture For 2006
","After seeing The Departed and having seen many of the other great movies of 2006 thus far, I can safely say that this movie in my books is the best movie of 2006. In fact not only that, it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is certainly another great chapter in the career of a brilliant director.<br/><br/>The authentic Boston accents in this movie were perfect. They weren't non-existent like you see in some movies set in Boston and they weren't exaggerated either. The cast was so full of stars that it would rival pulp fiction and each and every actor in this movie brought their A game to this movie.<br/><br/>Probably what I enjoyed about this movie the most was the script writing and the character development. Each of the characters were so interesting and so obviously unique in their own ways and the script writer brilliantly captured that element.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a brilliant movie that keeps you at the edge of your seat the whole time and it had one spectacular ending."

"janet1109","8","1","4","6 October 2006"," First hour is quite violent, but plot pays-off in second half
","I was quite turned off by the close-contact violence in the first half of the film. In fact, at one point I considered walking out and waiting for my friend in the lobby. She was not bothered by the fistfights and other human cruelty, while I had to cover my eyes and hope the sounds weren't too disturbing! Having said that, as the plot developed in the middle third I began to enjoy the complexities of the plot. I would have preferred an ""edited for content"" version with most of the beatings cut out. It was difficult to keep the relationships and ""who knows what"" straight, and I was afraid at times that I was missing something, but all-in-all I kept up with the plot without any major missteps. Early in the film it was often difficult to keep Damon and DeCaprio straight, and I had to say, ""Oh, that's Matt"", or ""Oh, now that's Leo."" I'm not saying it wasn't possible to tell them apart, but thinking of the characters as the actor's names didn't really do much to help me become absorbed into the world of the Boston Irish mafia. Also, Jack Nicholson was always ""Jack"" to me in this film, never completely becoming Costello."
"LogicalmanUS","10","1","4","6 October 2006"," A 10 from 10 for Scorsese
","With a cast full of top class actors it would have been so easy to let the script just fade away and depend on the location - Modern day Boston and pirouetting actors, but no, Scorsese, yet again, proves he is still a force to be considered.<br/><br/>The Departed has the grittiness of Gangs of NY, a storyline to match Casino and a script that makes Goodfellas look like just another movie! Oh, and did I mention the location?<br/><br/>DiCaprio/Nicholson/Damon/Wahlberg all give excellent performances, but with a back-up crew of Baldwin/Sheen/Winstone(Henry VIII - Sweeney Todd)/Farmiga(The Manchurian Candidate - Touching Evil) all putting in performances that would, in any other movie, earn them top billing, the first line crew are pushed on to be amazing. There's no over-acting here, just the cream of Hollywood doing what they do best, better than before.<br/><br/>At 2 1/2 hours you might expect the script to run out of steam, but at the 120-minute mark I was still wanting more, and did Scorsese give it to us. The ending, though almost predictable, still contains that shock factor. You leave the theater wondering what message the film left you with? Who should you feel for? Who demands sympathy and who was the real villain?<br/><br/>I rarely give a film 10/10, only Crash has received that in the past year, but The Departed is a must-see, 10 from 10, Oscar-winning film in all departments.<br/><br/>See it and may not need to see another film until the next Holiday round appears. Miss it, and you will miss one great film."
"phsteele","8","1","4","6 October 2006"," Greating writing, great acting
","I haven't liked all of Scorsese's films (such as Gangs of New York), but The Departed is a clear winner. Great writing and great acting usually produces a good film, and the results are very evident here. DiCaprio gives an Oscar worthy performance as an undercover cop in a situation he desperately wants out of. Definitely the best male performance I've seen this year. Matt Damon is also very good as the bad cop, and Nicholson gives his normal over-the-top performance as a mob boss. The editing is very effective, cutting between DiCaprio's and Damon's intertwined situation. No doubt a finely crafted near-masterpiece..."
"CubsandCulture","5","1","5","17 February 2019"," Self-Parody, Empty Bluster
","It is frankly bizarre that after so many better films from Scorsese that the Oscars decided to reward this misfire. The film is entertaining enough but then again so are train wrecks. There are too many twists, too many spies. When everything is fused with duplicity there isn't anything to grasp onto. Meaninglessness follows. The film plot renders any meaning pointless to try to discern. Why bother? It is nonsense.<br/><br/>Maybe I would be kinder on this film if all the characters weren't such overblown Massholes all the time (through weirdly none of them seem to like the Red Sox). Filled with cheap machismo, insecurity and bloodletting this is the sort of film that is mistaken as ""serious"" when it fact it is just silly men not realizing they are wearing funny hats. And dear god the accents all seem put on. The characters are almost as overcooked as the writing.<br/><br/>Probably the saddest aspect of this is how Scorsese, who should know better, used forced mise-en-scene throughout this film. To name two quick examples: A woman is holding a banana when she is implying male impotence, The last image you see is a rat. It feels much more like someone trying to copy Scorsese than himself.<br/><br/>I guess the Oscars were afraid Scorsese was about to die given how much this film got away from him. That explains this career achievement this film got."

","This is an all around great film. It has the perfect cast, the perfect plot, the right amount of twists and action and it's perfectly written. An under cover cop and a mole in the police department working for the Irish Mob ends up searching for one another in this craftily written film. This film was directed by none other than Martin Scorsese, who brought us great films like ""Goodfellas"", ""Casino"", ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", and ""Shutter Island"". As I said before, this film has a great cast with Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Alec Baldwin, Anthony Anderson, and Martin Sheen, but to me the star of this film is obviously Jack Nicholson. He brought his characteristic touch to this film which made it even more better. You can't go wrong with this one."
"bneathanaprlmoon","2","1","5","1 January 2016"," Most overrated film in human history
","How ANYONE could enjoy this rubbish film is beyond me. They cast two actors who are 100% indistinguishable from one another, with the same hairstyle, wearing practically the same clothes through the whole thing. How ANYONE could follow the story with two identical actors playing (I assume) different characters just makes no sense. Honestly if they hadn't had scenes together I'd have assumed they were the same character. I suspect it's the emperor's new clothes syndrome writ large. Some rubbish crime film full of nails-on-chalkboard Boston white trash accents comes along and a few influential people proclaim it a work of genius, so every drooling yahoo of mediocre intellect is afraid to disagree.

","Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) is a Boston Irish mobster. He mentors Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) ever since as a little kid. Eventually Colin joins the Special Investigation Unit in the State Police headed by Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and the unpleasant Staff Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg). He works directly under Captain Ellerby (Alec Baldwin). He begins a relationship with police psychiatrist Madolyn Madden (Vera Farmiga). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a new police recruit from a family of lowlife criminals. Queenan and Dignam put him undercover. After serving some time in prison, he works with his petty criminal cousin Sean (Kevin Corrigan) and catches the eye of Sullivan's henchman Mr. French (Ray Winstone).<br/><br/>Director Martin Scorsese goes to Boston to film this gangster opera. The cast is second to none. There is great acting being done here. Leo is terrific holding up even against the peacock acting of Nicholson. Winstone is powerfully rough. Damon is twisting his sweet persona into something a bit more of a douche. There is a bit too much plot and sometimes, the movie tries to do too many things. For example, Scorsese doesn't need some of the camera moves or the back and forth editing which only distracts from staying with the plot. It may work even better with a simplified style. This movie is best at its bloody brutal core especially with Leo acting up a storm."

","The best picture winner in 2006 was The Departed. In my opinion, it didn't deserve best picture. My top three favorites of 2006 weren't even nominated for anything. Mt favorite film of that year, The Prestige, didn't win anything. My second favorite film of that year, Casino Royale, wasn't even nominated. My third favorite, V for Vendetta, wasn't nominated for anything either. But The Departed, won a lot of stuff.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsse's The Departed truly is a fantastic film with fantastic performances. There were some that shocked us all. Like Mark Whalberg. Leonardo Di Caprio was fantastic also. But to me, the best performance goes to Jack Nicholson. Nicholson plays Frank Costello, and he is an evil bastard. The ending to The Departed came as a bit of a surprise. <br/><br/>I know that the film deserved the Oscar buzz that it got. The Departed truly is an excellent film. But I think that The Prestige is better, and that deserved more nominations. I really did love The Departed because it is such a clever, bad ass film.

"dave_wlogan","10","1","5","17 July 2008"," Nothing but quality
","This film is one of the best films I have ever seen. It has made multiple top 10 list sand has won 4 Academy Awards, but this is not why I was drawn to this film. Scorsese directed it but thats not why I wanted 2 see it. I went to see this film because I wanted to see the cast. Di Caprio, Damon, M. Sheen, Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin and of course Jack Nicholson made me think that even a shoddy script that has been rendered from a Chinese classic would make for a decent and worthy film.<br/><br/>The film surprised me as it was more than decent. 20 minutes in and i was on the edge my seat. i was completely immersed in the film. The film was fantastic to watch. The cast was fantastic, the direction was stunning and the script was top drawer quality.<br/><br/>The film successfully shows the effect of being a mole in some sort of organization on different people. Billy Costigan, the undercover cop, is constantly in a battle of wits with a criminal genius. He respects his foe, this is shown by his multiple acknowledgments of his abilities. An example of this is the scene at the bar in which Costello tries to figure out whether Billy is the rat. Billy shows a sign of fear which gives the audience a sense that he knows that Costello is on to him. Colin is different he isn't battling peoples wits he is simply manipulating peoples actions and ideas on criminals, often he is following Costello's orders. Where these two show their biggest difference is their goals. Billy is all about bringing Costello down despite the bonds which seem to grow between them. However Colin gets agitated with Costello and changes his goal from aiding Costello to bringing him down. This is one of the reasons I fell in love with this film.<br/><br/>Another reason is the direction Scorsese uses slow motion, shadows and steady-cam sequences for dramatic effect brilliantly. The shot of Capt. Queenen (M. Sheen) being thrown off the building is heart stopping, this effect is achieved bu the slow motion. I don't think anyone in the cinema didn't say ""oh my God"" at that moment. much kudos to his director of photography for composing the shots so well.<br/><br/>Overall this is one of the best films ever made. A worthy remake of Infernal, in my opinion, despite what has been said on these boards. The film is as good as Goodfellas and Taxi Driver, what I consider to be Scorsese's best films."
"whiteboy1394","10","1","5","3 July 2008"," The Departed (2006)
","The Departed was a great movie that deserves it's title as the ""best picture of 2007."" The cast is first rate including Jack Nicholson, in an over the top performance as the villain, Jack Costello. Leonardo DiCaprio also turns in an Oscar worthy performance as undercover cop, William Costigan Jr. Matt Damon is also very good in his role. Mark Wahlberg who was (surprisingly) the only nominee out of all of these actors also does an excellent job in this film. Even the supporting actors are good, including film veteran Martin Sheen in a good performance, and Anthony Anderson in a rare break from his usual comedy routine that turns into an overall good performance. In other words the acting was great, one of the best casts in recent years. Martin Scorsese's direction is very good. Although this is not his best work, it is still proof that he is a film making legend and he always will be. Many people say that he ripped off the Chinese movie Infernal Affairs, but in many ways this movie is better. What Infernal Affairs does in 10 minutes, The Departed does it in 30 minutes. This allows a lot more room for the actors, and much more characterization. In conclusion, The Departed may not be Scorsese's best movie, but it is nevertheless a superb effort and perhaps his best effort since GoodFellas. The performances in the movie are great, and should have been recognized more commercially. It is the deserved winner of four Academy Awards, but in my opinion should have won more.<br/><br/>10/10 Rated R for Strong Brutal Violence, Pervasive Language, Some Strong Sexual Content, and Drug Content.

"Ibuk","9","1","5","5 February 2008"," The Departed- Mr Scorcese I am now your fan
","Before I watched this movie I had read mixed reviews about it, instead of putting me off it made me even more curious. I am glad that I took a chance on it. To be honest I can't understand why people didn't like it. It is a superb drama about undercover cops. Scorcese has managed to assemble a superb class of actors, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson and Martin Sheen amongst others. DiCaprio has finally got rid of his pretty boy looks by having a more rugged look in this movie. Add to that a twist in the tale and you have a absolutely compelling drama.<br/><br/>To be honest I have not watched any other Scorcese film apart from the Departed, after this movie I want to watch all his other classics. This was easily the best movie of 2006, Mr Scorcese you should be proud."
"TheUnseenMovieLover","10","1","5","29 January 2008"," An Exceptional Gangster Movie
","I am now a huge fan of Martin Scorsese. Before seeing this, the only other films of his which I had seen were Gangs of New York and The Aviator. After watching The Departed, most other films pale in comparison.<br/><br/>The Departed is a example of sharp, fearless and taut storytelling done right. Scorsese keeps the story moving with thunderous momentum and stylish realism which puts almost all of his competitors to shame. In other words, I doubt that anyone could have made this film half as well as Scorsese.<br/><br/>The cast is also perfect. Leonardo DiCaprio turns in what is potentially his best performance to date, thoroughly convincing the audience in his role as Billy Costigan, an undercover cop posing as a member of gangster Frank Costello's (Jack Nicholson) crew, as well as showing the character's eroding confidence and hard-boiled charisma with breath-taking realism and smart vulnerability. As he realises that he is close to being caught by Costello, DiCaprio uses cleverly restrained panic and anger to amplify the impact that he has on the audience. His character is satisfyingly complex, and DiCaprio breathes utterly gripping life into all of his scenes.<br/><br/>On the other side of the coin, Matt Damon is equally impressive as Colin Sullivan, Costello's mole in the Boston police department. He is an individual desperate not to be caught, which smartly parallels with Costigan's situation, yet he is nowhere near as close to that danger as Costigan is, meaning that he is under much less physical and emotional pressure. DiCaprio, Damon and Scorsese draw powerful and ironic comparisons between the two characters. However, in spite of the similarities between Sullivan and Costigan, Damon still manages to create an individual and human character, giving an incredibly confident yet intriguingly layered portrayal of a terrifically flawed character.<br/><br/>The only other real lead is Jack Nicholson, and he is typically brilliant. Striding through the film like an old pro, he naturally swipes the screen from under the other actors noses like a seasoned professional, and it is tremendously enjoyable to watch him apply great intelligence and unrivalled, bloody charm to his character.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is also outstanding. Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Vera Farminga all seize their screen time and run with it, creating thoroughly individual, compelling and entertaining characters. However, the biggest plaudits must go to Ray Winstone and Mark Wahlberg.<br/><br/>Winstone is a force to be reckoned with as Costello's right-hand man Mr. French, delivering a jagged, wild and superbly coloured performance. He is on top form here, and proves that he is more than just your average actor once and for all. Surprisingly, he, along with the rest of the cast, are truly eclipsed by Wahlberg, who delivers a phenomenal, career-defining performance. Swearing with unstoppable gusto almost every second that he is on screen, Wahlberg also shows gritty intelligence and a spectacularly street-wise attitude which dramatically enhance the impact of his character. His performance is unbelievably thrilling to watch, and cements his character as one of my favourite movie characters ever. If I had a say in the matter, he would have waltzed home with an Oscar.<br/><br/>The film's crew also knows how to entertain, and do so to the best of their abilities. Technically, the film is stylishly brilliant, with some pinpoint sharp editing and excellent cinematography highlighting some superbly suspenseful set-pieces. One great sequence shows Costigan tailing Sullivan on the streets after just seeing him meet with Costello, with several nail-biting moments of grand tension. There are moments like this scattered skilfully throughout the movie.<br/><br/>There is also a brilliant soundtrack. Combined with another fantastic score from Howard Shore, there is some terrific background music to get your teeth sunk into. I can't get Pink Floyd's ""Comfortably Numb"" out of my head.<br/><br/>The script is terrific. William Monahan's dialogue mixes incredible smarts, laugh-out-loud humour and gritty intellect all into one, to create a perfect mixture. The words coming out of the character's mouths never feel unrealistic or out of place in the character's situation. If the script hadn't been written with such knowledge and skill, then Wahlberg's Dignam wouldn't have had any near the number of classic one-liners which define his character. That is how perfect the script is.<br/><br/>Crafting the whole affair with unrestrained style and realism is Scorsese. His direction is superb, and ensures that the film's quality never slips. He also keeps a close eye on unwanted sentimentality, creating real characters in a superbly intense environment. He makes the audience feel for the characters, yet he doesn't manipulate them. He understands that the story is really an epic tragedy in the disguise of a gangster movie, and allows the audience to be helplessly drawn into the unstoppable catastrophe, along with the characters. Every decision that Scorsese makes enhances the visceral intensity of the movie. Here is a master at work, and Oscar rightfully awarded him.<br/><br/>This is a classic achievement, and a terrific example of how to create a modern masterpiece. Well done to the cast and crew, most notably Mark Wahlberg, William Monahan and Martin Scorsese. And, as one critic put it, ""Long live the rats!"""

Not the first time I'd done that and made a mistake and apparently not the last. I swear I'll never do it again. This movie is good, compared to other movies made nowadays. But, comparing it to fantastic movies of the 80's and early 90's is like comparing an alley cat to a jaguar. This movie was nothing special! Yes, the acting is solid, and that was a relief, but beyond that there was nothing in depth or fantastic about the story. It's all been done better before and the violence just seemed gratuitous, rather than well placed. I'm in the dark why anyone is raving about this movie. Watch Goodfellas or Casino for true character development and a story that actually holds your interest and hasn't already been done a thousand times."
"Darkest_Hopes","5","1","5","2 June 2007"," Overrated.
","This movie could have been so much better.<br/><br/>How to waste the talent of actors like DiCaprio and Damon? Load a movie with blood, vulgar language and ruin the two main characters.<br/><br/>This movie is based on Infernal Affairs, an excellent Asian movie with Andy Lau and Tony Cheung, two of the best Asian actors out there. The plot is essentially the same, aside from a couple details, but it's close enough.<br/><br/>The biggest difference is, the Asian version managed to be a lot better in many ways. They didn't feel the need to swear every five seconds, or use c*nt and f*ck every sentence. They didn't need so much violence or to feel forced to put sex in it. The result is a classy, thrilling suspense with actors who are incredibly better than in the American version. There is no morale in The Departed, while Infernal Affairs ends with a huge lesson and a character who actually regrets betraying. Unlike what most American can think, death is not only way to pay or crimes. Infernal Affairs clearly show that.<br/><br/>If you want a movie that is actually watchable with your family, with actors on par or better than those in The Departed and a story that is overall a LOT better, I recommend you watch Infernal Affairs first. The Departed is nothing but a cheap, bastardized version of Infernal Affairs and I still cant believe they gave an Academy Award to Scorcese for this sub-par movie. Nicholson's acting is top notch as expected and all the supporting actors are great. But Damon's character is hollow, and DiCaprio's character is lacking the strenght and mystery that made Tony Cheung's character so believable.<br/><br/>Another example of a bad remake of an excellent movie."
"writemeout","8","1","5","24 April 2007"," Great movie, bad ending.
","Simply, a very entertaining and intelligent crime movie, partly ruined by an unbelievable, almost ridiculous, shoot-out ending. It's as if they spent a year intricately and passionately working on the film, ran out of time and came up with and shot the ending in one final week under a rush. It left me disappointed that such a materpiece would end so cheesily.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon both perform excellently opposite each other and I found myself rooting for both of them equally to overcome each other, which is what really drove the movie for me. The Departed has a good balance between a likable ""good guy"" and a sympathetic ""bad guy,"" and that is what makes the movie entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>I won't buy this on DVD unless there is a director's cut with an alternate ending."
"djblanche","1","1","5","11 February 2007"," What a mess!
","While the acting was good, the direction and editing were purely awful. What a mess! Mark Wahlberg was irritatingly funny and Jack Nicholson simply does what Jack does best. Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon both did good acting jobs and the supporting cast was solid. The problem was not with their performances but with what Scorsese did with it after shooting ended... Vanity shots that served no purpose other than to look ""cool"" were thrown in. It was chock full of messy edits that weren't even remotely stylish, and it was a poor mish-mash of attempted styles.... not to mention a lack of imagination in the structure of the film. This movie could have been SO much better and I can't help wondering how much improved it could have been if someone like Quentin Tarantino or even Bryan Singer had been able to do it. Martin Scorsese has deserved an Oscar in the past but certainly not for this jumbled mess. The actors deserved better."

","This movie is a plagiarism of the Chinese film ""Infernal Affairs (Mou gaan dou)"" of the directors Wai Keung Lau and Alan Mak. I don't understand the nomination for the Oscars of Martin Scorsese for a non original film. Martin Scorsese don't have any merit. The only thing that it's original of Scorsese is the end of the film. And the end of is the worse thing of the movie. Martin Scorsese copies entire sequences of the Chinese film. I believe that if they give him the Oscar it will be the worst ridiculous one of the history of the American cinema. I believe that great people believe that Martin Scorsese has returned, but nothing has done more that to copy."

","Having seen INFERNAL AFFAIRS and how mesmerised I was by its telling, this is by far a definite disappointment. All this star power comes to zilch because Scorcese and the writer miss the basic of what IA was all about. Honor, integrity and loyalty was what IA was about and Scorcese goes and messes with the main storyline by having the gal be a shared meatpiece(sorry for the crass metaphor).<br/><br/>I wonder if Media Asia Films(who own IA) knew about this interpretation which in my opinion should absolutely have not been allowed !!!! Watch at your peril of a movie gone bad in Hollywood. Instead save your money and catch the original which is a fantastic film!"
"Matt_Layden","9","1","5","8 October 2006"," Scorsese Is Back To His Old Form & Gives Us The Best Film Of 2006.
","Billy Costigan is an undercover cop who gets thrown into the hands of a notorious gangster, Frank Costello. Colin Sullivan is a member of Costello's gang who is a mole in the Boston police department. Once word gets out that there is a mole in the police department and a rat in Costello's gang, things begin to heat up as they try and smoke out the other.<br/><br/>Infernal Affairs blew me away a couple years ago, then I heard that one of my favourite directors was doing a remake. I was a little hesitant at first, I didn't know if I was going to see old Scorsese (Goodfellas, Casino) or the recent Scorsese (Gangs Of New York, The Aviator). Granted the films under his belt as of late are not horrible, in fact they're great, they just don't have that old school touch that made Scorsese such a great director. With The Departed Scorsese is back to his old form and gives us the best film of 2006.<br/><br/>The Departed is full of old school tricks from Scorsese. From an Iris Out and that classic Goodfellas feel, it makes for an intense thrill ride that will have you on the edge of your seat. With the crop of films this year not being all that great (save for a select few), The Departed blows them all out of the water. It's brutal with it's violence and doesn't hold back on anything.<br/><br/>DiCaprio and Damon both shine in their roles, with DiCaprio having the more intense part and more screen time. I only favour DiCaprio a tad more because the scenes with Damon and Farmiga are a tad boring to watch. It was a joy to watch both of these characters slowly lose their minds being on both sides of the fence. Although they both shine in this film, they can't touch the great Nicholson. He is absolutely astonishing. He owns every scene he is in, even when he starts acting like a rat. He has this evil presence about him in this film, but he plays it with such a comedic tone, you can't hate the guy, but you can fear him. After seeing how great he is in this film I'm left wondering why Scorsese and Nicholson haven't worked together before now.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Vera Farmiga and even Anthony Anderson all blend well together to bring the cast of The Departed full circle. Wahlberg stands out in this list, he is just as mean and foul mouthed as Nicholson and can actually hold his own with such a prominent actor as Sheen sitting right beside him. Alec Baldwin is a joy to watch as he spits out his comedic lines left right and centre and Martin Sheen brings the missing piece that fits the thrilling puzzle that is The Departed.<br/><br/>There are numerous violent scenes that scream Goodfellas or Casino and it's nice to get that old feeling back. The film is gritty, brutal and violent and doesn't let you sit there and feel comfortable with any of it. People are getting shot left right and centre, beaten to death, hit numerous times with coat racks, beaten with shoes, stabbed, thrown out of buildings. The blood splashes all over the screen and with people getting shot in the face everywhere, you feel the uneasiness that Scorsese wanted. It's not as brutal as the one infamous baseball bat scene in Casino, but it ranks up there.<br/><br/>The film does tend to drag on in certain areas, but that's expected. With it's fast story telling pace, Scorsese slows it down a bit so we can get to know more about who these two characters are. He keeps us on the edge of our seats wondering if their cover is going to be blown cause it can be blown at any point in time. Even after watching Infernal Affairs I was still tense, wondering what was going to happen next. That is the work of a great director.<br/><br/>The Departed will get recognized by the Academy, but I doubt it will win anything. Scorsese is after 0/5 in that race. One can only hope though, cause he deserves it so much. This film, although definitely not his best (I don't think anything he does will surpass Goodfellas) packs one hell of a bloody punch. It has strong performances and a dark comedic tone that will have you laughing along with it. In the hands of any other director, it could have been a mess. Thank you Mr. Scorsese, for letting me have fun at the movies again."

","This is not the greatest movie ever made as some suggest. It has a story that could never happen - except in Hong Kong. Acting is top notch. Nicholson is as usual; should have been shot early in movie. Only one girl in show but since she sleeps with everyone, only one is needed. Lots of f*** to where it really doesn't mean anything (sounds like real life, doesn't it). You won't get tired and it is a great story to watch for action. It is a city Italian cowboy western. I do not think many women will enjoy it. I did but it isn't a really great movie. Peckenpaugh lives. I've finally accepted Damon as a tough, mean fighter but it has taken a long time. Where is Orlando Bloom to add to the violence?"

"misterlinder","9","1","6","4 March 2010"," Confusing yet thrilling plot
","This is one of the best gangster movies, I've ever seen. The story is quiet confusing but at the same time really conclusive.<br/><br/>In the beginning there's nothing really special, you see a young guy (Matt Damon) infiltrating the Massachusets States Police and delivering information to his friend and boss of the Irish Mafia Costello (Jack Nicholson). But not long after he is grouped into a new unit, an other young guy (Leonardo DiCaprio) begins to work for the Police and in turn infiltrates Costello's gang. That's when the story becomes exciting. As the two characters get used to their new environments, the viewer often doesn't really know anymore who is the good guy and who the bad guy. You might not know who is more sympathetic to you until the end which is very abrupt and, in my opinion, a little bit special.<br/><br/>Although the plot sounds really nice (and it is of course!), also this movie has its faults. The two main characters advance in their ranks really fast, which is not really realistic. Also both of them work straight for their side. I think good and bad can't be defined like black and white, but like tones of gray, and so the characters should act too.<br/><br/>There are negative points in this movie, nobody can deny it. But the positive side of the movie is clearly dominant. It's a must for fans of gangster movies and I totally recommend it to everyone who likes a thrilling plot and lots of action."

I can honestly say it's my favorite Scorsese film, which is saying something considering he is the director of movies such as Goodfellas, Gangs of New York, The Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and The Aviator.

","""The Departed"" is a 2006 Martin Scorcese film, based on a film out of Hong Kong, ""Infernal Affairs."" I haven't seen the latter, and from reading, I can see that some people liked that film more, some less. I only know that I loved this movie; the script, the performances, and the directing style were all excellent.<br/><br/>""The Departed"" is about two men who are leading parallel lives. One, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a graduate of the police academy, and, connected from the old neighborhood, is sent undercover to infiltrate the organization of Costello (Jack Nicholson). Another graduate, Colin (Matt Damon), working with the special investigations unit, is a mob informant. Their lives connect via the police psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga), who becomes involved with DiCaprio, though she's living with Damon. Nicholson is desperate to know who his mole is and puts pressure on Damon; Special Investigations knows they have an informant and want to catch him. The situation becomes more and more tense.<br/><br/>The cast is superb - besides di Caprio, Damon, and Nicholson, Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin play the top men in the special investigations unit.<br/><br/>Scorcese does a masterful job with this film, cutting back and forth between the two men - in the hands of a less expert director, this might be confusing, but in his hands, it's not. He also builds the suspense and tension very well.<br/><br/>Di Caprio is sensational as a hot-tempered, stressed out cop who more and more is in danger of being found out; Damon is excellent as the charming, collected Colin who, as he continues to move up in his department, comes closer to finding out the identity of Costello's mole.<br/><br/>Martin Scorcese is no stranger to violence, and there's plenty of it to be had in ""The Departed."" It's not everyone's cup of tea, but it's very strong. While I might argue with a few plot flaws, they didn't detract from me being totally absorbed in this film."
"tkuoti","10","1","6","14 April 2008"," Greatness by Scorsese
","Did not disappoint - if I may begin with a mother of all understatements. Now THIS is quality film-making, folks. Quite surely one of the best crime thrillers I have ever seen, along with for example Kurosawa's High and Low - and yeah, I actually wrote so. Both are that to me for different reasons: the latter for its realism plus subtle and brilliant portrayal of social divides, the former perhaps mostly for its awesome-beyond-words suspense. However, The Departed also manages to give a satisfactory account of organized crime, both in the larger social context and on the human mind especially. Unlike so many crime movies today, there is plausible realism found here, and that added substance clinches the film into masterpiece category.<br/><br/>In the real world, anyone can get unceremoniously killed in an instant if they surround themselves with these kinds of settings. It also doesn't matter squat whether you die deservedly or not, or whether you get a parade or get thrown in a dumpster afterwards. This is a fact one has to come to grips with as a mobster. Scorsese has been saying this through his films for years, he shows killing usually briefly and in an almost matter-of-fact way. There is zero glorification, and this applies to The Departed maybe more than to any other work of his. In addition, the excellent script (by William Monahan) also found room to display thought-provoking similarities between the very macho and homophobic cultures found not only on the wrong side of the law, but the police force as well. This is just one of the tools in blurring the classic good/bad dichotomy, which (among all other things) is done very well in the film.<br/><br/>Two points of caution if you plan to watch this, though. This movie is a nerve-wreck par excellance, and a duration well over two hours can get to you. Also, if you're into that particular field, try to look past the fact that there just might be a few times when the worn cliché Psychology=Freud surfaces... But yes, this is arguably the best or, at the very least, definitely one of the best pictures Martin Scorsese has ever made."

","Martin Scorsese has made an extremely intense and well made film since his Goodfellas epic and Casino. I love everything about this film that hurts. The acting, the screenplay, the direction and everything else. This is one those unique films that I can watch over and over again, and still can't get tired of it. It should be in the 20's up in IMDb's 250 top movies. The Departed is flawless, riveting, and has lots and lots of style to go with it. It really is the best picture of 2006. Exstravangtly professional gangster film. Leonardo DiCaprio has always been better, Matt Damon is spectacular, Jack Nicholson never fails, and Mark Walhberg knocks it right out of the park! It has a lot of twists and turns that will rev up the audience and shake em' to its core, with a mind-blowing ending that you will never, ever forget. I am most certainly glad it won its four Oscars because it completely deserved them. This is an absolute instant classic. Well Martin Scorsese, you've done it again!"

","The Departed<br/><br/>By Daniel Rosado <br/><br/>Directed: Martin Scorcese <br/><br/>Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Vera Farmiga, Ray Winstone, Alec Baldwin, Anthony Anderson, Kevin Corrigan <br/><br/>4out of 5 stars <br/><br/>The Departed is about two cops on opposite sides of a battle between the police and Irish Mafia. Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio star as cops in this star studded movie. Jack Nicholson puts on a memorable performance as Costello, and one of my more favorable performances by Mark Wahlberg.<br/><br/>In the film there are two cops, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) and William Costigan Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio). Sullivan is a cop that rose quickly through the ranks, but he's secretly working for Costello (Jack Nicholson), the head of the Irish mob. His job, as a cop, is to bring down Costello, and try to find Costello's ""rat"" in the police department. Sullivan is careful to make sure no one realizes his true alliance, and he also makes sure Costello is always one step ahead of the cops.<br/><br/>Costigan is sort of in a similar situation, but very different. Officers Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) and Queenan (Martin Sheen), think that Costigan is a thug, because of his father's past. In order to prove his allegiance with the police, he has to give up his identity, and go undercover, working for Costello, and getting whatever info he can get from him.<br/><br/>The Departed is a good movie that keeps you thinking, ""What's going to happen next?"" You know that eventually everyone's going to figure out whom Costigan and Sullivan are really working for, but you want to know how is it going to happen. You also wonder what it's going to be like when they encounter each other.<br/><br/>The Departed had so many great things going for it. Its cast full of great actors, from past movies or shows. They were considered some of the best actors throughout their careers. The score that was playing during The Departed was perfect. They couldn't have possibly had better music for the movie. Especially the Irish rock song, I'm shipping off to Boston, by: The Dropkick Murphys.<br/><br/>Overall The Departed was a good movie, at times I was a little bored waiting for something exciting to happen, but when there was action, it did more than make up for the boring parts."
"vdecaire","9","1","6","2 April 2008"," Scorsese scores yet again with his best to date.
","Martin Scorsese has finally won his Oscar for the brilliant, intense and powerfully, courageously acted film, ""The Departed"". Like the film ""Internal Affairs"" (the film prior this of which it is adapted) the viewers are, most likely, going to have a hard time following the plot, because there is so much constantly happening there is no time to catch their breath. <br/><br/>The plot is actually rather simple. Billy Costigan Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio-in a role that he got snubbed by at the Oscars, if anyone in the cast, even a dynamic Mark Walberg, he deserved it the most) is a temperamental kid with aspirations to be a police officer for the Staties, the Massachusetts State police department. But he is assigned a job as an undercover who will be sent to jail again, and then released to get inside of the Irish mob led by the feared and yet aging Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). However, on the other side of the universe, Colin Sullivan is a seemingly normal, hardworking citizen (Matt Damon) who is a shoe-in for the rank of Detective. But this man is not who he seems. Costello corrupted him as a kid, intelligently using quotes from political people and pop culture references-a theme often used in the sub-text of the film- and now, the detective for the Boston Police Department is the mole inside the special investigations unit. This is when the plot begins to spiral out of control. Sullivan is assigned to find the mole in Costello's crew, and at the same time trying to find himself, the rat in the Special Investigations Unit. The real nightmare, is the horrors that Billy Costigan faces as he is tortured by the subtle messages and disregard to him by the mob. And as Costello begins to act more sinister, Costigan then realizes everything is not as it seems within the grainy and dark depths that is the Irish mob. <br/><br/>Dicaprio plays a role that easily should have granted him an Oscar nomination. Being the kid that could never murder, but is surrounded by an environment that calls for him to require the stomach to handle such regression, and only able to spill his guts to a police shrink, played very well by new comer Vera Farmega. All he wants is to get pills so he can sleep, to be out of his situation and to finally be in the position of Sullivan. Costigan had a rough childhood, and faced with this conundrum, he resorts to using his intelligence to gain Costello's trust before it is too late. Many scenes are brilliant and truly say something about what fear, danger and intimidation can do to us. There are times where Colin Sullivan sits in his office with the lights off, and silently ponders the thought about quiting his position. Billy at his lonely and grainy home, looking at old photographs of his departed family. Frank Costello, talking to his men with the pride and bleak intellect that he brandishes within his wealth. <br/><br/>Martin Sheen, (Especially) Mark Walberg and Alec Baldwin play great roles as two men who work in different positions at the Boston Police Department. Sheen and Walberg are the captains who are in charge of the undercovers, Sheen being the mentor of Billy, and Walberg giving him the 'tough love' a rookie like Billy needs to get ahead. And Baldwin is the head of the Special Investigations Unit, and the boss of Sullivan. The two sides of this brilliant film is one rough exploration of the Irish Mob and the other more smooth, discrete look at the pain and suffering that rats, moles, leaks and snitches experiences on both sides of the law. And after all, cops or criminals, when facing a loaded gun, what is the difference?<br/><br/>Winner of Best Picture, Director, Film Editing and Adapted Screenplay. Also in my opinion Scorsese's best mob film ever. Just viewing the emotion, fantastic acting (fitting the bill for a genuine look at the depraved forces driving our cities into epochal chaos) and brilliant acting. A great sigh of relief for fans of Scorsese, when he finally got his well deserved Oscar. Funny."

This one did well though.<br/><br/>All the actors were fantastic except for Matt Damon, not that he's a bad actor, he just always seems like the exact same person no matter what character he's playing.

Leonardo DiCaprio gives an amazing performance as Billy Costigan who's struggle to keep his true identity hidden from his crazed boss Frank Costello(Nicholson), and Agent Sullivan(Damon) produces a edge-of-your-seat experience leading to an explosive conclusion. This movie most certainly deserves the recognition it received and Martin Scorsese never looked better with his return to the crime genre. The Departed could very well be Scorsese's best film and deserves a spot next to other great crime classics such as The Godfather and Goodfellas."

","Here is a cast of heavy hitters that was good to see in one film. Jack Nicholson's body of work is as thick as a New York City phone book and he has the hardware to back it up. Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon are two of the finest young talent we have today. Martin Sheen and Mark Walberg also have proof in their pudding when it comes to their great careers. Alec Baldwin seems to show up everywhere these days. I was glad to see that Scorsese cast Vera Farminga as Damon love interest. I liked her in the short lived TV cop series ""Touching Evil."" This complex detective show lasted only one season, I wish USA would have given it more time. Apparently it was too complicated for today's TV audience whose brains have been turned to mush by the onslaught of imbecilic reality television. She is beautiful and sexy and I look forward to seeing more of Vera Farminga.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese finally won the Oscar he so richly deserved although there were so many other films he should have one for.

","I would rate this movie a 10/10 but there are some things that don't really seem to show superb acting/directing/writing. First of all the plot really is a very intense plot that the viewer really needs to think about. Movies are suppose to be captivating and complex to a perfect medium. The Departed did that for me. I don't feel that the writing was particularly incredible because I don't think saying ""F***"" every other word shows realism. Plus, the last scene where Leo, and Matt's loyal troopers are killed the scene is way to rushed. And when Mark kills Damon I thought what motive does he have to kill him. Nothing was even mentioned about Mark knowing that Damon was the mole. He just held a grudge. As for those few things that bothered my about The Departed I am a fan of classic, organized crime movies, and this one with a delightful twist on it, one men lost between his two supposed loyalties and almost destroying himself over it and Damon trying to cover his own ass (sorry for the language). Still i like the genre, and I like violence. So if you agree with what I said, this is definitely the movie for you!"
"redeagle717","1","1","6","12 March 2007"," terrible- and i'm not joking
","Throughout Scorsese's film career, his films have been so over rated. Let's tear this film down. Jack Nicholson- same old performance, different guy. The problem with Jack is that he acts because he wants Oscars, not because he is great, or even cares for acting. Secondly, how many times have I heard him talk the same way- pulling a joker on us. Leonardo DiCraprio, as usual, crappy, over rated performance. I swear that Scorsese has something going on with DiCaprio. He just is not a great actor and I must admit his performances make me laugh. He has a Bostonian accent, then an American, Bostonian, American- give me a break. I remember how Titanic was nominated for 14 Oscars, NEARLY EVERYTHING, except Dicaprio's performance. Hmmm, I wonder. Mark Wahlberg and Matt Damon- crappy acting again, only saying the ""f"" word every other word to get a ridiculously stupid point across. Many people failed to see how this film robbed another movie- Infernal Affairs- which is much better than this film. <br/><br/>Why was the film met with so much praise? Because of the casting and direction. Believe me, if Scorsese hadn't directed this and/or if this film didn't have an all-star cast but still had the same look- it would have been seen as a ""B"" movie that would go nowhere. And that is what it is. Completely over rated, just like Goodfellas, but only ten times worse. The story was crappy, and the ending was very stupid and ridiculous. Scorsese needs to pack up his stuff and go home. He is in a desperate search for Oscars, which resulted this time in pity for him. The only reason Scorsese won was because of POOR MARTY, NEVER WON AN Oscar. LET'S GIVE ONE TO HIM SO HE DOESN'T FEEL BAD AND REALLY KNOW THAT HIS WORK SUCKS. As for Best Picture, I am really disappointed with the Academy. Another sympathy award for the years of crappy films of Scorsese- and to illustrate this further, JACK NICHOLSON PRESENTED THE AWARD WITH DIANE KEATON! Again, sympathy for mediocre actors just so we could see their faces light up- so Jack Nicholson may wrongly think inside that he is the main reason the film was great and should've been nominated instead of Wahlberg. BS! We must admit that Clint Eastwood is the master but was pushed aside this year all because of a sympathetic academy and many other as well.

","The original (Hong Kong movie) is much better than ""the departed""... there are just too many Fxxx words and too much unnecessary violence in this movie...<br/><br/>The Departed comes by its puzzle pieces honestly  the movie, with an outstanding script by Kingdom of Heaven screenwriter William Monahan, is a relatively direct adaptation of Infernal Affairs, a great 2002 Hong Kong crime thriller steeped in Chinese conundrum and Hong Kong aesthetics. But where Infernal Affairs is less interested in psychological nuance than in Eastern-style elegance of action, Scorsese and Monahan showcase Western-style, actorly character building at its most enjoyable. DiCaprio's adult intensity as a young man agonizing over the disappearance of his real identity under the weight of playing someone he isn't is matched by Damon's thoughtful restraint. Wahlberg  a charismatic, always underrated natural  digs into his own Mean Beantown Streets background and comes up with surprising fury. Sheen, freed from West Wing presidential responsibilities, imbues his cop captain with a surprising pathos. As the one woman in an all-male saga, Farmiga's Madolyn hints at female secrets and personal sadnesses probably not necessary to the film but welcome nonetheless. The learned (or, in the case of Wahlberg, resumed) Boston accents sound ripe but right, with Baldwin adding his own audience-pleasing oomph to the exercise.<br/><br/>That said, however, as I said at the beginning, just too much unnecessary violence, and the cast is not really ""believable""... I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. :("
"Julian_Lie","9","1","6","19 February 2007"," The Departed has the worst cast in history
","The Departed is one of the best films of Scorsese since Goodfellas but if the cast wasn't so bad it could be one of the best movies of all time, no bull. I'm not writing this to say who would be a better option, I'm doing it because most of these guys are very poor actors: Leonardo DiCaprio: I think is time for Scorsese to stop trading ""special favors"" for gigs in his flicks, here he's a tough guy, the only movie in where DiCaprio was alright is Catch me if yo can. He did Titanic which is the biggest piece of .... I've seen, The beach that was a ruin, Gangs of New York that was awful, The Aviator that was a torture to watch it until the end, and... oh yeah and the Man in the Iron Mask where he did OK because the character is a push over.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson: He was tolerable but nothing special, I'm tired of him doing the same role of a psycho, he's done.<br/><br/>Marky Mark: This rapper/actor/joke is better known by his album called ... well who knows, I think he has like a third nipple and a brother in New Kids on the Block, yeah a real success. How does this guy can be on serious movies? Is like Vanilla Ice making the part of Sonny Corleone in the Godfather. This guy is awful.<br/><br/>Anthony Anderson: You know him, the black dude from Scary Movie, the boring one. Who I'm kidding they all were bad, that flick was terrible. Anyway, what was Scorsese thinking, why did he put a bad comic in the move, a rapper and a psycho weren't enough, he just had to put the comedian? This guy can't act to save his life.<br/><br/>Alec Baldwin: I have to be honest, this guy actually makes me laugh in the Saturday Night Live rejects show, 30 Rock, good show. But in this movie, oh man. How does this guy get so far in his career with just one character? He's useless in a drama because he has been in too many comic shows now and is not like he has diversity in which he transforms himself, no, he's the same guy every time. Or maybe is the haircut, who knows.<br/><br/>The rest were great: Martin Sheen, Matt Damon, Vera Farmiga and Ray Winstone. Man Scorsese ruin it with the terrible casting, just awful. The movie storyline, music, script is all great, is a great story. But what happened to Harvey Keitel, Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta, Juliette Lewis, James Woods and Daniel Day-Lewis? He used to cast great actors.<br/><br/>Too bad that the movie is a rip off from an Asiatic flick called Infernal Affairs, so Scorsese really didn't do anything, any half with could direct that movie with references like that, he didn't write anything and the only job he had was to pick the right actors but he couldn't even do that right, Scorsese is a sham."

","This film certainly wasn't as masterpiece. It was reasonably well filmed and acted, nothing exceptional though. Up to about half way through the film I thought it was very good, however the film then moved into fantasy land after that.<br/><br/>There were so many plot holes and inconsistencies that the film became almost a parody of itself. The quite ludicrous level that the Matt Damon character was able to get away with anything just went too far. This then ruined the film.<br/><br/>To mention a few of the problems:<br/><br/>Why was Sullivan (Matt Damon) motivated to help Costello (Jack N) so much, risking his career, imprisonment and life. <br/><br/>If you have a mole in the Police you would give the case to another department and not randomly nominate some rookie, who is a suspect and then give him full power over the entire team. <br/><br/>Internal Affairs would be investigating the Police unit, searching for the mole <br/><br/>Sullivan already had a history with Costello, surely this could have been easily discovered<br/><br/>You cannot just delete someone's record from a computer (back-ups, audit trail)<br/><br/>Why did Costigan have to meet Sullivan and arrest him 'in person', on a rooftop, which was already a crime scene.<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but basically you get the point.

"zmeusorul","6","1","6","3 January 2007"," Old Idea
","Scorsese had done a very good job as a director. Only thing that bothers me is that the idea is not American; in fact it is the same idea that is in Infernal Affairs I, II and III, a Hong Kong production which appeared in 2002, 2003 a.k.a Mou gaan dou I, II, III. My own opinion is that ""The departed"" is weaker than ""Mou gaan dou"". I suggest to see the original.I'm very disappointed by the American production. Was it too hard to create a brilliant idea? I think that if you see the original first you can't stand to see ""The departed"". When I saw ""The departed"" I had hoped to the very last moment that something new would come up. Of course the American version offers a bit of ""happy ending"" when Sullivan gets shot by Dignam in the end. In the previous version there is any consolation. Sounds like reality to me."

","I wasn't really sure what to rate 'The Departed' (I have to give it an actual number? One that implies some significance?), but I settled on a solid '1', earned solely by Leonardo's phantastic acting. Leo is the lone saving grace, and for those of you who think a '1' is skimpy for his performance, let me just say that, based on the movie alone, I was thinking in negative ratings.<br/><br/>I'm going to admit here that this is my first real Scorsese flick (besides the Bobumentary) and so I do not have an unquestioned loyalty to him (or biased approval).<br/><br/>As far as sequencing goes, I'd rank this right up there with 'The Wickerman'. A choppy, confusing style that I believe the technical term for is ""pretentious schlock"". One minute we're on the crime scene, the next, in a bedroom! To hell with coherent story lines, I'd much rather be left unsatisfied and aching.<br/><br/>To pull out another comparison, the screenplay, in quality AND in execution closely resembles The Black Dahlia. Lines fly like crashing jets overstuffed with pseudo-noir euphemisms constantly as characters struggle with wonderfully clichéd situations and relationships.<br/><br/>And just a final remark of disgust: Jack Nicholson was already hideously repulsive.

"davideo-2","10","1","8","25 October 2006"," A tour de force! Scorsese's best film of this sort since GoodFellas
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Two hot young new recruits join the FBI in the shape of Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon.) After a tough, unrelenting grilling, they both get the posts- and end up doing different jobs on the same assignment. A major operation has been set up to bring down revered local crime boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) who's just masterminded a heist on a military base where loads of tiny micro chip processors have been stolen to be sold to the Chinese to launch a deadly missile into the air. Costigan is sent undercover to infiltrate Costello's gang whilst Sullivan helps lead the operation to bring him down. But along the way it becomes a deadly and uncertain game where no one is who they seem, no one's motives are as clear as they appear and, increasingly, no one can be trusted.<br/><br/>With his latest movie, Scorsese has returned to his staple favourite, the gangster movie, and defiantly issued a message that if you thought Good Fellas was brutal and hard-hitting, you ain't seen nothing till you've seen The Departed. And that would be a pretty accurate assessment. But aside from matching GoodFellas in the brutality stakes, TD also matches it in terms of all round, well, general quality. This is one of the most thoroughly satisfying and totally excellent films I've seen this year, an absorbing and mesmerizing tale that never lets up from beginning to end.<br/><br/>As the main bad guy, Nicholson is at his absolute best (and that ain't no bad thing) doing his coolly edgy and unnerving act to brilliant effect and to be fair the supporting cast don't fu*k up either. Damon, Di Caprio, Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and even cockney heavy Ray Winstone, in his breakthrough to Hollywood role as Costello's thoroughly brutal right-hand man, are all thoroughly immersed in their roles and make each respective part shine to their best effect.<br/><br/>It's actually nastier with the vulgarity of the language used by Nicholson's mobster (especially some of the explicit jibes he comes out with regarding women) but yes this is also one mega violent film that those with faint hearts might want to avoid. Yes, it's all rather frequent and excessive but it's a blessing and a curse because it also succeeds in giving the film a much needed loud, raw, intense feel that fits the mood of the picture brilliantly. And it should also be commended for managing to skillfully combine this seedier side of the film with a genuinely intelligent plot with many skillful twists and turns that you never see coming. Indeed, as the end draws near, it's veered away from it's mobster movie staple a bit and become more of an L.A. Confidential type film of police corruption and double crossing.<br/><br/>It's become a little depressing by the end too, with all but two of the most obnoxious main characters meeting nasty, blood-splattered deaths at the hands of a gun. But, hey, this is a gangster film and at least the worst villains got their just desserts fittingly. And what a gangster film it is too, one of the finest and most memorable we've seen in a while, everything coming together perfectly to make a fantastic cinematic experience. *****"

"The_Void","10","1","10","17 October 2006"," One of the greatest films of the new millennium
","In general, I'm not Scorsese's biggest fan; but this Americanization of the Hong Kong thriller 'Infernal Affairs' is a great film, and one of the popular director's best efforts, period. The film takes in themes of deception and identity fraud, and carries off its story of undercover agents with style and panache. It is customary with modern day crime thrillers to add a layer of 'cool' to the proceedings; and Scorsese certainly does that here, although it is not a forced Tarantino-style slew of one-liners, but rather a relaxed assurance in the plot and characters, which really pays off once the plot begins to develop. The story itself follows the intriguing idea of two undercover agents infiltrating each other's organisation. Colin Sullivan joined the police force after mob boss Frank Costello decided that it would be a good idea to have some undercover agents on the other side. Meanwhile, William Costigan; another new recruit of the police force, is sent to work undercover in the same organisation being run by Frank Costello. Naturally, both men end up looking for each other and much violence ensues...<br/><br/>As you would expect from an A-list production such as this one, the acting is superb. Both Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio step into their respective roles well, with DiCaprio in particular delivering the sort of gritty performance that you wouldn't expect from him given the sort of films he was making before hooking up with Scorsese. Of course, it is Jack Nicholson who steals the show as the eccentric mob boss. This represents an absolutely great piece of casting, as Nicholson was born to play roles like this, and seeing him completely owning every scene he's in is a delight for the viewer. The rest of the support is more than adequate, and Scorsese manages to put the likes of Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone and the subtly sexy Vera Farminga to good use in a range of roles. There's plenty of violence in the film to satisfy crime fans, with a particular focus on people getting punched in the face. The music used generally works well, with the likes of the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd blending well with sequences in the movie. The ending is potently bleak, and perfectly fits the film up until that point. I don't often find myself saying this of Scorsese's films - but The Departed truly is a modern day masterpiece and everyone who calls themselves a film fan owes it to themselves to see it."
"rummanrahman","10","0","1","9 May 2020"," The perfect movie
","I've seen a lot of movies.one of the cons of watching a lot of movies is that you start judging and turn into some kind of critic. You start asking questions like why this happened? how did this happen? Etc etc.so when I finished watching ""The Departed"" I started asking questions.And rarely enough I found answers to all these questions.<br/><br/>*Question #1: why did dignam leave when Quenan was murdered?
when Queenan was murdered dignam was the only one who knew about costigan.captain ellerby was incharge and from the first meeting scene in the beginning it is safe to assume that dignam and ellerby didn't go quite well with eachother.so dignam wouldn't tell anything about costigan to ellerby.ao when he was offered to take a paid leave.he decided to do that for the moment<br/><br/>*Question #2: why did costello trusted costigan so much?
Costello didn't trust costigan that much at first but he trusted french and French trusted costigan maybe partly cause of his uncle Jackie.Also Costello cross-checked whether he was the rat and he turned out to be clean.so when Costello and French both was dead costello's lawyer contacted Costigan as he was the closest person to Costello alive.a question might arise that why didn't lawyer went to Sullivan then? Costello knew Sullivan for a long time than he knew Costigan.well the answer is Sullivan was his mole rate in the department so he couldn't let anyone know about his connection with Sullivan.<br/><br/>*Question #3 : where was the 2nd rat all along the movie?
Costello maybe appointed the 2nd rat to keep an eye after Sullivan.that actually makes sense cause 2nd rate was Sullivan's classmate in the academy and he was also in his team later. In the movie theatre scene Costello seemed to be knowing about Sullivan's new transfer. How did he know? That's right..the 2nd rat<br/><br/>*Question #4 : How did Sullivan recommend Costigan to be awarded a medal of honour as we seen him deleting Costigan's profile from the database before?
One,there should be a way to recover deleted files.An if not Sullivan printed out his profile information on paper before deleting.look again.he didn't have any reason to delete the file. When he found out that Costigan knows he is the mole.he panicked and deleted Costigan's profile.its my theory<br/><br/>*Question #5 : How did Dignam know that Sullivan was the rat?
This bothered me for a while.then I remembered before his death Costigan gives madolyn a envelope asking her to open that only when he says or he dies. Maybe that envelope containted information on Sullivan being the rat and it stated to contact Dignam.so when Costigan died Madolyn contacted Dignam and then he knew.now if Dignam had all the proofs he needed to confront Sullivan,why did he shot & kill him himself? My theory on this is Dignam is a hot blooded detective.When he found out the rat who was also behind his colleagues' deaths he couldn't wait for all those legal procedures and trials and stuffs and decided to punish sullivan by himself.<br/><br/>10/10 the perfect movie!"

","Good movie, good plot, good acting, not a masterpiece. Many liked Nicholson as Costello. I thought he was way too chirpy and maniacal. Maybe I have seen him similarly in too many roles, but I didn't buy the fact that he was the boss running this organized criminal gang. Being used to watching Scorcese's movies bring masterful performances: Pesci in Goodfellas, De Niro in Goodfellas, Dicaprio in Wolf of Wallstreet, De Niro in Taxi Driver. I never really felt impressed by the chemistry he had with either Damon or Dicaprio. It was mediocre in Scorsese's standards and great for any other standard.<br/><br/>The twists and turns were interesting, but at the end of the movie it ends up feeling rushed and messy. We never really knew who the mole that kills Dicaprio was until the end, and it shaped the end of the movie? I personally could never connect with the DiCaprio or Damon. It is as if the movie had a really fast paced tone, and it didn't accomplish introducing the characters properly. The movie had too many Cameos that it failed at solidifying the experience of any character. DiCaprio was the one that I could briefly connect, but he was complaining so much that I failed to get some sort of perspective of his experience.<br/><br/>Even after the fact that they interacted with a psychologist do we not see some sort of semblance of their charisma, philosophy, ideals, morals. Too many scenes offered little character building for the protagonist in 2 hours and 30 mins. The problem was that not only the protagonist had one-dimensional showings, but the entire cast in the movie did.

"spookyrat1","10","0","2","13 March 2020"," Never Forget The Departed!
","My favourite, of a great list of Scorsese films and what do you know; it's a brilliant remake of a very good Hong Kong film, Infernal Affairs. Many who read and write these reviews will know and understand, that more often than not, American remakes of Asian/European films are inferior for a host of reasons; but not always. The Departed is one of those rare birds, whose quality outshines the very worthy original work.<br/><br/>The casting is impeccable. Leonardo DiCaprio as William ""Billy"" Costigan; has there ever been a more convincing performance of an undercover cop living on the edge? Matt Damon as Colin Sullivan, playing very much against his usual more heroic self, in his cocky, smarmy portrayel of an inside man of the most dangerous type. Who could imagine anyone other than Jack Nicholson as Frank Costello, the ruthless Irish gangland boss with some deep dark secrets of his own. And the lesser lights, Mark Wahlberg very much deserving of his Oscar nomination for his very physical, bullying Dignam. Vera Farmiga's cogent role-playing of Madolyn so persuasive that we can believe the unlikely private relationships she develops with both Costigan and Sullivan. Ray Winstone, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin; the list just goes on. All perfectly cast and repaying us with memorable characters.<br/><br/>Scorsese has created a two and a half hour film that just bristles with suspense and creative, believable twists, that ramp up the thrill levels to a breathless high, before delivering a hugely satisfactory triple play climax, topped off with the symbolic rat running across the Boston Skyline. The pace never slackens and as usual his musical choices are flawless, never failing to enhance the onscreen action.<br/><br/>A number of critics observed that Scorsese's Academy Award for Best Director of The Departed was rather a career acknowledgement than anything else. Don't be fooled. Both Martin Scorsese and his film deserved their oscars. He has created a dazzling, gritty, engrossing gangster thriller that never fails to both surprise and entertain. It's a must see."

"Hey_Sweden","8","0","2","31 January 2020"," Scorsese in his element.
","Screenwriter William Monahan and filmmaker Martin Scorsese do *very* well here, adapting the 2002 Hong Kong film ""Infernal Affairs"" for a North American audience. The nifty premise is that gangland boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson, in one of his last great roles and performances) has spent his time nurturing Colin Sullivan (played as an adult by Matt Damon), who's now his mole inside the State Department. At the same time, a newcomer to Franks' gang, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), is actually a detective so deep undercover that only his handlers (Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg) know that he's a cop. So we have both the cops and the crooks shaken by these obvious ""plants"" in their units.<br/><br/>This truly was ideal material for Scorsese, who understandably won an Academy Award for his fine direction. Although it seems awfully unwieldy at just over two and a half hours long, this viewer never lost interest in it. This is due to genuinely excellent storytelling, a great Boston, Mass. flavour, many colourful characters (and performances), and Scorsese's typically potent, visceral style. Granted, some viewers may not care for seeing some of this violence rendered digitally, but the script does take some interesting turns, and may even have a surprise or two in store for some viewers. The often profane dialogue is highly amusing, with Wahlberg having some of the choicest quips.<br/><br/>Scorsese works with a first-rate cast here (other luminaries include Alec Baldwin, Vera Farmiga, and Ray Winstone, and top character players like David O'Hara, Mark Rolston, and James Badge Dale). Nicholson electrifies in his charismatic latter-day performance. And DiCaprio is solid in the role of a man determined to overcome his sordid family history.<br/><br/>Overall, this is well worth a viewing to see a master filmmaker at work. It drops you right into the action (with a bit of back story); the title doesn't show up until almost 20 minutes in, and the vast majority of the credits are saved for the end.<br/><br/>Eight out of 10."
"CinemaClown","Null","0","4","14 January 2020"," A Rare Hollywood Remake That Outshines The Original In All Aspects
","Helmed by a master filmmaker in complete control of his craft, fuelled by a razor-sharp script that packs armour-piercing dialogues, and further bolstered by a star-studded ensemble that fires on all cylinders, The Departed is one rare Hollywood remake that outshines its original in all aspects, and ranks amongst the sharpest, slickest & most sophisticated examples of its genre.<br/><br/>Directed by Martin Scorsese, the film marks the 3rd collaboration between Scorsese & Leonardo DiCaprio and finds the duo working in better harmony than ever before. It is fast, it is foul-mouthed, it is furiously paced & it is frenetically thrilling. Easily the most entertaining film of Scorsese's career until then, the story exudes an unbridled energy that's unlike Scorsese's works yet exhibits his trademarks throughout.<br/><br/>What makes The Departed so gripping & entertaining is that it never stops to take a breather and is always on the move. Several subplots are at play and it's all headed in the same direction at the same pace. DiCaprio impresses with another calculated input, Matt Damon is excellent as well, Martin Sheen & Mark Wahlberg are in prime form, and yet all of them are overshadowed by Jack Nicholson's formidable & show-stealing act.<br/><br/>A dynamic blend of kinetic direction, explosive screenplay, energetic camerawork, cut-throat editing, breakneck pace, lively soundtrack & outstanding performances, The Departed is powerhouse storytelling that deftly merges style & substance into an expletive extravaganza that will delight both Scorsese fans & causal filmgoers. One of the best films of its year, one of Scorsese's finest, and one of the greatest remakes in existence, The Departed is genre filmmaking at its most vicious."

","The Departed is one heck of a film that has a fantastic cast, a great story, and has another awesome direction by Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>The Departed is about a cop, Billy (Leonardo Dicaprio), goes under cover on a case to infiltrate an organization led by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), who is a gangster. While this is going on, a career criminal, Colin (Matt Damon) infiltrates a police department and reports suspicious activities to his bosses. Billy and Colin then have to analyze each other's identities to save their lives as they find out there's a mole in their midst.<br/><br/>The Departed is an awesome film. The cast is easily the best part of the whole film. Dicaprio, Damon, Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, and Anthony Anderson are some of the great names in this great movie. They all do a great job and play some really good characters. I think this is DiCaprio's second best film (first being Wolf of Wall Street), and had a top notch performance.<br/><br/>The story was very good. It can be confusing in parts here and there, but it still manages to be very entertaining for a crime film. The pacing also went very smooth for 2 and a half hours at least.<br/><br/>All in all, The Departed is yet another fantastic Scorsese film that could easily be the 2nd best film of 2006 (first being Casino Royale)."

","Watching this movie again, remember it as being really good. However, there are far more plot holes than I remember. For example:
1). Leonardo DiCaprio's cover is so thin. He was literally a cop two or three months before becoming Frank's high-ranking guy.
2). Why don't Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio recognize each other in the movie theatre?
3). How does Matt Damon's character get promoted so fast?
4). Knowing there's a rat, why doesn't Frank suspect Leo?
5). Matt Damon stabs a guy to death, then looks up, right into a crime camera. What happens to that footage?
6). Why doesn't Leo pretend he doesn't know Matt Damon is the rat after all that undercover work?? He's just about to get his identity back and a check.
Unfortunately I don't think this quite stands the test of time as a cinematic masterpiece....
I still give it 7 stars because the cinematography and acting I find fairly good."

","With an all-star cast, director Martin Scorsese has directed a tight, emotionally tense, stark crime drama. Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, Vera Farmiga, and Alec Baldwin produce powerful performances in this drama that depicts the psychological life and death interplay of two dueling characters each playing deep undercover on opposing sides of the dark streets of Boston. Thirteen years after my first review which resulted in a mediocre seven out of ten, this is a rare movie that has grown tremendously with a renewed sense of dramatic excitement as the riveting script and performances grip the audience. It is likely the difficult but terrifying ending was experienced many years ago as so unsettling that to negatively color the entire movie. But Boston is to be expected to be a tough town and along with it a tough movie to depict some hardened and strongly harsh performances. The only slight weakness is how Matt Damon's backstory develops while Leonardo DiCaprio seems to get a much more slighted development. Nevertheless from beginning to end, this hard-edged, gripping crime thriller hits the mark as one of the smartest crime movies as opposed to typical action packed, over the top thrillers.<br/><br/>31 October 2006. While I understand why many moviegoers may get a bang out of this movie and can convince themselves that this is a great movie with all these great actors, the execution of the movie still leaves something wanting. The beginning of this movie is awkward as the backstory of up and coming Colin Sullivan get special attention while the more down and out, perhaps even more integrity-based Billy Costigan gets secondary attention. The understanding of these characters are not convincing played out in the beginning but the eventual plot development into the tight corners is tense, intriguing and very well done. However by the end of the movie which is its major downfall is that the execution becomes murder, literally manipulative and too easy a way out for the scriptwriter and director. There isn't any of the more intellectually cool lingering on story that a more sophisticated and higher quality movie could have taken. The love romance also seems weakly developed in both instances and the real potential of a starker, more conflicted role is overlooked.<br/><br/>The director uses surprise shock value to attempt to impress its audience and push onto us a much more mechanical ending than a more deliberate, convoluted and psychologically satisfying resolution of the movie. The acting was great, the interplay and thrills were spectacular. Unfortunately, the final product ultimately unwound itself outside Oscar quality, except perhaps for several of the performances. Matt Damon, Leonado Dicaprio, Mark Walberg do really shine, nevertheless while Alec Baldwin is underperformed in the script. Seven out of Ten Stars."

"kennprop","9","0","1","27 December 2018"," Excellent Boston based story.
","Loosely based on the Whitey Bulger? story this is a Boston based epic. The Godfather was a NY story and of course on a bigger scale. Boston is a smaller place and its old Irish ethnic neighborhood of South Boston is the setting for this gem. The statehouse sits shining on its hill and the
state govt. is riddled with corruption. Whitey Bulger survived and flourished for years as a gang head and was an FBI snitch. He worked with a FBI agent who was born in his home neighborhood. This agent eventually was convicted on corruption charges and went to prison. Whitey mostly gave info about th local Mafia and several convictions came from this. The Mafia ran Boston from Providence RI and its ""offices"" were located on Federal Hill. Bulgers brother was the Speaker of the Mass. State House and later the head of the University of Mass. !!! Whitey was a fugitive for many years, was caught and convicted only to be murdered in prison. Probably for being a rat.
This movie has several stories going at once. Undercover police, Corrupt police, honest police, gangsters both Irish and Italian. Local color and Catholic religion role in the area. You have a heavy duty cast here with several important character roles by Sheen,Baldwin, Wahlberg and others. Dicaprio is huge in this and Nicholson is excellent. They dominate the screen. Matt Damon is very bean town but is just not in the same class. For me he lacks something in his roles. He is a major star but of a lesser magnitude of presence. I found the music in this to be overdone and somewhat distracting. My wife felt it was a very good, intense,tension filled movie. She thought the ending was weak, unlikable, not up to par??? At least the corrupt ones got what was coming to them and that does not always happen in reality."

Jack Nicholson's superb opening monologue greatly elevated my expectation of this film, and whilst I wasn't necessarily disappointed by the remainder of the picture; the introduction was never surpassed. Another strength lies in how the narrative takes a number of turns near the end of the film."
"bowmanblue","9","0","2","10 September 2018"," Jack shows 'em how it's done
","The Departed' is a remake. Therefore it must be merely a cynical cash-grab, right? Wrong. And it's not often anyone says that these days. Yes, it may be a remake of a 2002 film from Hong Kong, but, when it's directed by Martin Scorsese, stars Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DeCaprio and Matt Damon (to name but a few) you know that it's going to be very different some other recent remakes, reboots and re-imaginings!<br/><br/>I haven't seen the original, so I can't compare the two films. And I have a feeling that this US version will be remembered so fondly that many will soon forget that an 'original' ever existing - no matter how good it was. A director as talented as Martin Scorsese, it's no wonder he's dabbled with numerous types of film and genre, but here he returns to - arguably - what he does best - epic gangster movies. I reckon that in time 'The Departed' will be remembered alongside 'Goodfellas' and the like. It really is that good. Or at least it is if you're into gangster films in general.<br/><br/>First of all there's the cast. I've already mentioned the main three, but add Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Ray Winstone (just don't mention the Londoner's attempt at an American accent!) and Vera Farmiga. It's fair to say that there isn't a bad performance among them (and, no, Winstone wasn't THAT bad when it came to the accent - they probably should have just made his character British and be done with it). However, for all these big names, it's Jack all the way. The 'old man' of the film shows everyone how it's done.<br/><br/>Jack plays Frank Costello, who is the 'head' of the Irish mafia in Boston. And, therefore, he's hardly a nice, sympathetic character you'll feel inclined to root for. Only you sort of do. In the same way you'd hardly feel comfortable sitting down to tea with Hannibal Lecter, yet you can't help but see him as a hero (or rather anti-hero!). And this is all down to Nicholson's performance. He oozes charm and likeability, even when he's clubbing people to death, or generally engaging in high-level criminal activities. In short, this is Jack's baby.<br/><br/>The general story revolves around Frank's attempt to 'plant' a bad police officer within the ranks of the force charged with the task of investigating him. However, what he doesn't know is that that very same unit is hatching a similar plot to plant a police officer among Frank's gang. What follows is a pretty tense tale of 'cat and mouse' where you're wondering which side will find out the truth first (and, more importantly, the repercussions when they do!). I'll leave it there in terms of plot, as there are more than a few moments that you probably won't see coming - avoid internet spoilers if possible before watching!<br/><br/>There's little negative to say about the film (it's quite long - if that's really a problem when a film is this good?) and I think that the only people who may not enjoy it are those who generally aren't a fan of the genre. If you don't like crime movies in general, you won't like it. Same goes for if foul language and violence is not your thing. However, if like most, you can appreciate an excellent film that doesn't pull any punches and is just about as perfect as any film is these days, then this is definitely worth a watch."

","""I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me."" So growls Frank Costello, king mobster of Boston. He has more words of wisdom for those looking to make it in the big city, ""If you want something, you have to take it."" The veins of masculinity, morality and identity run strongly through The Departed, as in many a Scorsese movie. But the latter line is actually pilfered from the Buddhist-steeped crime flick from Hong Kong, Infernal Affairs, uttered by Andrew Lau as he shoots the original Costello and ties up all loose ends. He has emerged with his ideal life, taken it with his bare hands, years and years of luxury and rising through the police ranks making this decision for him. When Damon offs his own Costello, it's channeled through impotent rage and betrayal. The gilded State House dome that his apartment overlooks (a rather obvious motif) suddenly isn't so glittery after all. It speaks to the inconsistency of his motivations; how honourable can he be to the state when he was the rat all along? Or has he been lying to himself this whole time? He wants to have his cake and eat it too. <br/><br/>You understand the appeal of a father figure like Costello to a 12 year old boy (wow, magazines!), who can have anything in the palm of his hand in an instant, although the character quickly sheds this mysticism in place for for an almost parody of the unpredictable, unstable gangster. The approach made sense in Burton's gothic web of shadows in Batman, where he rose to the challenge of the iconic comic book villain with a deranged mania, never quite telegraphing his actions to the audience. You couldn't guess whether his gun would sprout flowers or fire bullets. But it sticks out like a sore thumb in the gritty Irish Catholic world of Scorsese's Boston, every gesture a flourish, every threat underlined with a creepy grin. Hokey props reinforce it; a severed hand in a ziplock bag, and one of Nicholson's ideas (you wouldn't say no to a screen legend, would you?), a plastic dildo in a grimy porno theatre. Yes, these men sublimate violence for sex and vice versa, use one or the other as an outlet for their desires in the incestuous criminal underworld, but then along comes Nicholson to deflate the whole thing. <br/><br/>The same can be said for Wahlberg's Dignam, himself accounting for half of the film's allotted profanity count, and in the end existing for little more than the plot's fail-safe (the deleted of Billy's file and identity lacks the original's gut punch for this very reason). Madolyn gets a better rap. Combining two paper-thin love interests into one, she further presses the issue of masculinity and impotence, serving as a foil to the mirrored leads in a tangled triangle. Notice that every facet of her and Sullivan's relationship revolves around humour and surface intimacy, how they'll be one step away from a serious conversation but hastily backtrack (usually into bed). <br/><br/>Schoonmaker edits with a knotty, choppy precision, throwing in flashes of canted action and inverted angles, pilling on smash cut upon smash cut to stimulate urgency, bringing the camera rushing towards its subject before abruptly veering away. Its rhythm and intensity are palpable, drawing attention to the menace that underlines each encounter in the mobster world. See how she cuts the first phone call between the two leads. Not a single word is uttered - the tension is crafted from how she stages the pauses, the silence, the agony of hesitation. Will he answer, and will it mean his downfall?
 Scorsese's style makes the original Infernal Affairs look like a soap opera in comparison, and sometimes it's precisely that; slow motion, black and white flashbacks, mournful music. The claustrophobia of the Hong Kong setting could have used some of the remake's grit and paranoia. <br/><br/>Costigan and Sullivan mirror each other, are two sides of the same coin. That much is obvious. The original script explored this further, and had none of the satisfaction or lasting finality of Scorsese's ending. Lau is doomed to perpetual hell, forever tortured by the path he took and the sins committed that led him to this point. Suppose you live and breath as a cop for 10 years, speaking and acting as if you were the good guy (and telling yourself that everyday). Would you eventually believe the same? Scorsese eliminates this option, makes Sullivan a product of his own unique environment, and then rips it all away from him in one go. He doesn't need to be shot. In the end, his entire world has been built by lies. You'd almost prefer to go the way of Costigan."
"stktaco","10","0","3","16 December 2017"," My Favourite Movie Ever Made
","The Departed is one of the best movies ever made and is my personal favourite. The story is about a mob boss named Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) who is being hunted by the Boston Police Department. So in order to catch him they send Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) to work for Frank undercover, but at the same time Frank sends Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) to be a mole in the police department. So now Billy and Colin have to find each other. That is the story of The Departed. <br/><br/>The Departed is in my opinion a near perfect movie, it gets all the aspects of film right. The pacing of this movie is really well done, the movie is two and a half hours long but it never drags and is always entertaining but one fault in it is that the movie takes place over multiple years of time but only feels like it was 1 year, it is a very minor complaint though. <br/><br/>Another aspect of this movie that is really well done is the direction which is obvious since it is directed by Martin Scorsese who is a living legend at this point. Even though it is directed by Scorsese I don't think it it is the best part of the movie because the acting an writing were so incredible but the director does his job and it is very well done. <br/><br/>Now I will write about the two best parts of the movie and they are unbeatable by any other movie. The acting and writing were amazing, when you have an amazing cast with Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen, and Mark Wahlberg you know you will have a well acted movie and in my opinion this might be the best ensemble cast ever. Not only do the actors do a great job but they also have an incredible script to work with, the dialogue is fast-paced, witty, funny, and dramatic. The characters are fleshed out so much and overall I think this is a flawless script, and I think part of the reason for this is that this movie is based off of another very good movie called Infernal Affairs (2002). <br/><br/>I think the script is so perfect is because they were able to take a script from an existing movie that is very good and then fix plot holes and add more character depth if needed. A lot of people think the original is a better movie but I disagree, probably because I saw it first but I also liked the setting more, thought it was better acted, and I liked the vision Scorsese had for this movie more than Andrew Lau and Alan Mak's.<br/><br/>At the end of the day The Departed is a movie that is well paced, directed marvelously, acted incredibly, and written perfectly. So for those reasons, The Departed is a 10/10 and my favourite movie ever made."

","Mainly the remake of Infernal Affairs but actually taking every great thing in the Infernal Affairs trilogy The Departed surpasses the greatness of the original. The only thing that shines dimmer would be Dicaprio's performance compared to Tony Leung's in my opinion, Dicaprio was amazing but Leung just edged out. The original Infernal Affairs had the strength of a powerful script and stunning performances, but when the director is Martin Scorsese every single aspect is near perfect."

The Departed encapsulates some of the best uses of thematic archetypes, subverting audience expectations and Hitchcockian suspense methods in recent memory. <br/><br/>Something about the film as a whole cohesively brings together every last drop of what audiences want of out of modern cinema and leaves nothing to be wanted when it's all said and done.

","Directed by Martin Scorcese<br/><br/>Starring Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jack Nicholson<br/><br/>​ Plot Overview: South Boston cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) goes under cover to infiltrate the organisation of gangland chief Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). As Billy gains the mobster's trust, a career criminal named Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) infiltrates the police department and reports on its activities to his syndicate bosses. When both organisations learn they have a mole in their midst, Billy and Colin must figure out each other's identities to save their own lives.<br/><br/>Scorcese has a great deal of movies over his long career. His filmography includes cult classics such as 'Goodfellas' and 'Taxi Driver'. I'm here to tell you that 'The Departed' rivals them movies. Packed with spectacular performances, genius writing and some of the greatest foreshadowing I've ever seen in a movie; this movie is a masterpiece. Every actor does an amazing job, from Jack Nicholson to Matt Damon to Mark Walhberg. William Monahan's twisted tale of deception and gangs sticks to Scorsese's iconic brand of film making while simultaneously diverting course and making a masterpiece of a movie. If you haven't checked this movie out, I highly suggest you do.<br/><br/>This movie was adapted from 2002's 'Internal Affairs' and the basic story is generally similar so if you've seen that you should have a rough idea of the plot. If not, then let me tell you that the plot of this movie is genius and is just a spectacular Gang Drama(because Scorsese's NEVER done Gang Drama before and you SHOULD be surprised). I would definitely be able to argue that this is William Monahan's greatest screenplay.<br/><br/>Matt 'The Bourne' Damon does a fantastic job as Colin Sullivan, and this is most likely his greatest performance/role. Leo 'The King' DiCaprio is also amazing as Billy Costigan and the way his arc is shown over the course of the film is truly spectacular. Jack 'The Joker' Nicholson is fantastic as Frank Costello and is easily one of his greatest roles in years. Mark 'The What? No!' Walhberg is a star of this movie and manages to deliver in not that much screen time, a brilliant performance that earned him an Oscar nomination. All the characters had intriuging and interesting arcs which made them all stand out and helped earn this movie 'Best Picture'. <br/><br/>This movie is nigh flawless from all standpoints and the technical side of it is no exception. The cinematography is great, the costume design is excellent and the set design is spectacular, especially if you know what marks the spot. <br/><br/>The use of music in this movie is fantastic and the pacing is just excellent.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is arguably one of Scorcese's best and deserves its place as Best Picture winner.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>Would Recommend"

I love seeing Leo and Matt go toe to toe. The Depatrted truly captures the Bostonian culture built on its own cast-iron bravado. The choice of songs and scores develops the harsh and scary undertones that compliment the tense environment the characters work within. Jack Nicholson is the dark force to be reckoned with! Wow!

"kelan360","9","0","2","18 December 2016"," A film with many subtleties, well directed scenes and a very captivating storyline with great acting. A most enjoyable film.
","The Departed:<br/><br/>An interesting film, it is one that centres on values of people. We begin the film with one of the protagonists, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) who is wooed into a life of crime by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) who evokes power when he steps into a restaurants and asks the owner to pay up as well as showing his eyes for the owner's daughter.<br/><br/>His family has no record of being involved in violent crime so Colin has been able to have an enjoyable upbringing and has passed into the Police Department then State Troopers and finally onto the investigative branch with seeming ease. Little do the police know of his relationship to Frank.<br/><br/>We are then introduced to the character of Billy Costigan, who despite being very intellectually talented has a troubled family tree with many relatives in organised crime which does not bode well for Billy's chances in the Police Department, instead he is assigned as an undercover officer to look into the doings of Frank Costello.<br/><br/>Both of them are now 'rats' and are both closer than ever. The film seems to convey that however close we can appear to a person, we may never know exactly who or what they are. This is made ever more apparent with the love interest for both of the 'rats'- Madolyn (Vera Farmiga). She has slept with both of them so it is unclear as to who the father is. This also makes the two men even more similar as they love the same woman.<br/><br/>As they rise to top positions in their organisations, they begin the hunt for each other, and this is an interesting dynamic with very tense scenes that are very well filmed and executed in the film. The climax is at which they come face to face at the Police precinct after the death of Costello. They both then find out the truth about each other in different means. Their deaths at the end are also very similar and unexpected with a quick headshot from someone unsuspected. <br/><br/>It is clear however that the two have very different moralities. For example after being saved by a fellow rat in the Police Department, Colin then kills the man who saved him.<br/><br/>Billy on the other hand never resorts to killing and always follows the law wherever possible, and it is clear that the constant lying puts a lot of strain on him. This bring me on to another message in the film: It is hard to do the right thing and suffer through pain and hardships, but in the end those who have done wrong will be punished for eternity.<br/><br/>Religious imagery appears several times throughout the movie. The most memorable is when Costello talks to a pair of priests are in a bar and he mocks them about paying him for children as well as talking about the nun before she took her vows and finally gives them a drawing showing a nun with her skirt pulled up from behind. There are also several religious painting being smashed. This can be seen as blasphemous but also show how un-Christian the mobsters are even if they claim to be so.<br/><br/>9.3/10"
"dnjie-50921","9","0","2","4 November 2016"," This movie is fantastic!
","Okay let me first just say that this was a phenomenal film. When I first found the movie the plot and actors sold me straight away. To sum up what the movie is about its hard core hide, and seek. Everything from the cinematography, to the actors were spot on. This movie was jam packed full of amazing actors who all did a good job of creating unique and likable characters all in their own way. But in the end I would especially like to point out Leonardo Dicaprio's acting. I don't understand why he has just recently won an Oscar. His character was interesting. While his character was short tempered, and ill mannered the way in which he acted allowed you to put up with his behavior. Oh i'd also like to point out even though Jack Nicholson wasn't the main characters he always steal the show. He is one of the few people who truly captures the essence of a crazy man. Now to continue on to the cinematography. Michael Ballhaus use of shadows brought the intensity needed to really have impacting moments during the movie. Most of the scenes took place in dark lit rooms. This caused very strong shadows on people such as Jack Nicholson which really stood out to me. Jack Nicholson already looked menacing and conniving but with the shadows it really made certain moments pop out to me. I also felt that because of the specific lighting he choose with warm lighting, and dark shadows the tone of the film came off as a serious film. If he had used any other lighting the films tone would have changed dramatically. Some of the most memorable shots were when the both Leonardo DiCaprio's character is around Jack Nicholson's character. The situation Leonardo's character was in and the close up shots really showed the anxiety his character experienced being around all those criminals. One more shot that definitely popped up more was a follow shot. Where Michael would follow a character there a specific action or sequence, similar to a one shot but only lasting a for 3 seconds max. In the end though what really gave this movie life was the acting. Not one single charter was forgettable. Every character introduced into the film had a unique personality. For example Mark Wahlberg's character would have to be my second favorite after Jack Nicholson. The vulgar language and ill tempered manner of his character was one of the most funniest parts of the film. Even when a seen was supposed to be serious his character served as comedic relief. I would recommend this movie to everyone. To leave you on this note the ending is shocking and yet fits perfectly with the movie. I really wish more films could be executed on this level."

","The Departed has made an impact on modern cinema since it came out in 2006, but I agree with critics of the time saying that Scorsese deserved to win Best Director not only for this, but also for the likes of Raging Bull and Goodfellas.

","It is not often that one is prompted to describe a thriller as ""brilliant,"" but that description can certainly be applied to THE DEPARTED.<br/><br/>Set in South Boston, ""a few years ago,"" it depicts the struggles between the State Police and an Irish gang led by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) for supremacy of the streets. Such battles are complicated by the known presence of moles within the police force as well as in the gang, but no one - not least the protagonists themselves - knows who they actually are.<br/><br/>This is the bare framework of a plot that engages in complex issues of identity politics. THE DEPARTED is a symbolic title, not only referring to central character Billy's (Leonardo DiCaprio's) loss of personal identity, once he joins the State Police, but prompting speculation on whether other characters in the film suffer an equal loss as well. Billy and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) are conceived as doppelgangers; they dress the same, go out with the same girl (Vera Farminga), and pursue roughly the same existences. Their behaviors are so similar that it becomes difficult to separate them. This is the film's point: corruption is so endemic in South Boston that it is perhaps futile to separate the good from the bad, or to expect those either serving or abusing the law to sustain their identities. They have all become part of the same maelstrom engulfing the city.<br/><br/>It is this condition that helps to explain the complications of the plot. It does not really matter who is doing what, with which, and to whom; the characters are simply struggling to survive in a world that is beyond their comprehension. Even Frank Costello, the gang boss with a cocksure attitude about what he wants to do now and in the future, often seems somewhat lost (even though he conceals his insecurities beneath an arrogant exterior).<br/><br/>The action is perpetually edgy, with no one really trusting in anyone else. Colin is perpetually at loggerheads with his fellow police officer Dignam (Mark Wahlberg), and we never really know for sure which side Queenan (Martin Sheen) is actually on. Police operations are elaborately planned but foiled by the criminals; likewise the criminals seem unable to put their plans into successful operation. It is perhaps because of this lack of success that everyone so distrusts one another.<br/><br/>In the end there is a resolution of sorts, with the protagonists apparently getting their just comeuppances. But Scorsese is keen to underline the ironies of the denouement; just because some people have passed away does not mean that there won't be others ready, willing, and able to fill their places, thereby continuing the corruption in Boston that seems insoluble.<br/><br/>As a comment on dystopian America in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, THE DEPARTED cannot be bettered. A modern classic."
"joshuafagan-64214","9","0","2","12 August 2016"," A New Mafia Classic
","Scorsese's still got it.<br/><br/>This is not his best film, though it did get him a Best Picture win and that Best Director nod he had been chasing for some three decades. It's not as good or Raging Bull or Taxi Driver or Goodfellas, but it is still an all-time classic.<br/><br/>The all-star cast is a treat to watch. When DiCaprio (who also starred in Blood Diamond, an excellent film I have already reviewed, this year), Damon, Nicholson, Baldwin, Martin Sheen, and Mark Wahlberg (who is at his best here) are in the same film, sparks are going to fly. They do not necessarily make the film, and I wouldn't single out any single performance as Oscar-worthy, everyone is at the top of their game.<br/><br/>What I give this film credit for is embracing its aesthetic. A Boston crime film should feel fundamentally different from a Las Vegas or New York-based crime film. It revels in its Bostonness without rubbing it in the audience's faces. I give credit to Scorsese for continuing to redefine himself. He has made two of the greatest gangster films of all time in Goodfellas and Casino. If he wanted, he could have made this film like that. No one would have complained. Yet he chose to make a fundamentally different film in terms of structure, tone, and plot. It feels as much a film of the aughts as those other two flicks feel like films of the 90's. It is our first great post-Sopranos crime film.<br/><br/>The premise is equal parts simple and genius. There are two main characters. The first is Leo DiCaprio's Billy Costigan, Jr., who grew up in a life of crime and is thus selected to be an undercover agent for the Massachusetts State Police in the affairs of crime boss Francis Costello (Nicholson). Costello, however, has planted a mole in the police in the form of Colin Sullivan (Damon), whom he has groomed for well over a decade.<br/><br/>It is not long before Costello trusts Costigan and the police trusts Sullivan. The two of them are not suspected when each side discovers there is a mole in their ranks. The two men come to recognize each other as moles, and they hunt each other down.<br/><br/>What I love about this film is how it straddles that line between simplicity and complexity. It's simple enough to explain the plot, but there are interesting and fundamental complexities in how it unfolds. This is true of most of Scorsese's films and is a key reason why they are almost always box office successes, but I believe this to be the best example of this, particularly in the relationship between our two main leads. They aren't friends, but there is an interesting respect between them.<br/><br/>There is a lot more gray area and moral overlap that one would expect given the premise. The characters do not stay within the roles they are expected to play, which I really like. It's hard to make the characters in a more premise-fueled film like this three-dimensional, but Scorsese finds a way.<br/><br/>I like the last hour of this film significantly more than the first. The first hour lingers a bit too longer on establishing the premise and characters, and it cuts between Sullivan and Costello too quickly. This film won the Best Oscar for editing, and while I won't say that it's undeserving of that honor- it is a Scorsese film, after all- it doesn't become a really well-edited film until the second half.<br/><br/>The last twenty minutes of this film are fantastic. They strike the perfect chord between orchestrated and spontaneous. At times, it feels almost anarchic, but after the credits roll, it is apparent that everything made perfect sense. It feels like a roller-coaster, except that instead of coming to a stop after throwing the audience for a loop, it takes them for another ride, and another ride after that. The Return of the King was chastised for its 'fake-out endings'. This film takes the idea of the fake-out ending and turns it to its advantage. Each of the endings hit so hard, and piling them on top of each other gives the feeling of a boulder rolling faster and faster downhill until it is going so fast that not even an adventurous archeology professor can outrun it.<br/><br/>Leave it to Scorsese, the greatest maker of crime films, to redefine the genre once again. This film is not without faults. It feels muddled at times. I wouldn't call it the best film of 2006. But it is a titanic, ambitious, revolutionary accomplishment that has not aged one day."

","I decided to celebrate the Summer Solstice by watching 'The Departed'. Don't ask me why. I had previously loved the Hong Kong-made 'Infernal Affairs' trilogy on which this is based.

This was controversial when it took in a cartload of Oscars, particularly finally a directorial nod for Scorsese, but don't be misled--it's easily one of his finest works.<br/><br/>This is my Golden Rule on both remakes in general, but especially American remakes of international (particularly foreign-language) great films.

The film was nominated for five Academy Awards, winning four of them (Best Editing, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director and Best Picture).<br/><br/>This film is undoubtedly one of the most interesting films I have seen about organized crime. The script is excellent, with many twists and very good action scenes, holding the public until the end. The performance of the main actors is quite interesting, particularly Nicholson, who manages to make his character truly intimidating and unpredictable. The characters of DiCaprio and Damon are equally rich, owners of a complex psychology, several moments of confrontation and very well thought out dialogue. Even some supporting characters are particularly notable and complex, which is less and less seen in current cinema, but always welcome. The photography is excellent and careful, and the sound effects and the soundtrack by Howard Shore, full of themes and moments with strong Irish flavor. The direction of Scorcese seemed to me worthy of little criticism in a kind of recurring film on the work of the filmmaker, responsible for ""Goodfellas"".<br/><br/>So this is a great action movie, full of entertainment and made to hold and surprise the audience."

","A tale of two cops, though on different sides of the law. Colin Sullivan (played by Matt Damon) is a Massachusetts State police detective. He has risen through the ranks to head up a special department. Public Enemy Number 1 is Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), a crime network kingpin, and the Sullivan's main target. However, Sullivan is a paid informant for Costello, giving him tip- offs on police raids and other useful information. Meanwhile, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) works for Costello. However, he is actually an undercover policeman, spying on Costello. In due course, both know that there is a rat in their organisation, but don't know their identity. A deadly cat-and-mouse game ensues, with both trying to uncover the other without being discovered themselves.<br/><br/>Brilliant crime-drama from master director Martin Scorsese. Slick, clever, watertight plot. The symmetry and interdependence of the two adversaries makes for a very intriguing story and nail-biting situations. Often they have a piece of the puzzle but to get the complete picture and identify the mole they have to break their own cover, creating some very tense situations.<br/><br/>Some great character-based drama too, especially involving Costigan. The love triangle involving Madolyn (Vera Farmiga) was a nice touch.<br/><br/>The Departed is an adaptation of the Hong Kong crime-drama Infernal Affairs. Similar plots but The Departed has deeper characters, more interesting sub-plots and wittier dialogue. For these reasons I rate The Departed higher than Infernal Affairs.<br/><br/>Historic movie too in that it gave Scorsese his first Oscar, at last. After six nominations previously with no award, he won Best Director for The Departed. When you look at what he was previously nominated for - Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Gangs of New York, The Aviator, among others - and consider those he should have been nominated for - Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy - then you have to consider him incredibly unlucky. That, or the Academy doesn't like him.<br/><br/>On the subject of people the Academy doesn't like, Leanardo DiCaprio puts in a great performance as Costigan. His was the more difficult of the two lead roles, as Costigan was a much more complex character than Sullivan. Matt Damon hardly had to stretch himself for his role. Sadly, though not unsurprisingly considering DiCaprio's history with the Oscars, DiCaprio didn't even get an Oscar nomination for his efforts.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg did get a nomination, as Best Supporting Actor. He puts in a good performance as the over-the-top, obnoxious, no- nonsense Staff Sergeant Dignam. It's debatable whether the nomination was deserved. The performance does stand out, however, due to the colourfulness of the character.<br/><br/>Remaining cast is pretty much an all-star one and includes Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Vera Farmiga and Ray Winstone. All of them deliver in spades, as do the minor players.<br/><br/>A 21st century classic."

"andrewnmiller","10","0","2","20 June 2016"," One of the best crime dramas in the history of film.
","When The Departed hit theaters in 06', I passed on seeing it, because I wasn't into serious dramatic films. Well, times have changed as The Departed has got to be one of the finest crime dramas in the history of film. From its directing and soundtrack to its acting, this is filmmaking at its best. <br/><br/>The film begins with Francis ""Frank"" Costello introducing young Colin Sullivan to the world of structured crime in Boston. Over the years, Costello coaches Sullivan to be a mole within the Massachusetts State Police, until Colin is allowed into the Special Investigations Unit. Meanwhile, Billy Costigan is hired by Captain Queenan and Sergeant Dignam to go undercover and infiltrate the mod as his family connections make him an ideal choice. He leaves the academy and spends time in jail to increase his trustworthiness. Both Sullivan and Costigan settle into their particular organization, and Colin starts a romance with a police psychiatrist which Costigan is also having a relationship with her. Soon both of them find who the other one is and are told by their respected group to find the ""rat"" in their ranks. What follows is a bunch of double-crossings, murders, lies, and backstabbing. <br/><br/>While this film is a remake of the Hong Kong film, Internal Affairs, moving the location to Boston allows director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan to guarantee that The Departed isn't a rehash of its Chinese predecessor by making the film longer and introducing a few new characters and subplots, but the most critical difference is the portrayal of the crime underworld: whereas Internal Affairs is polished without being extreme, while Scorsese's film includes very colorful language, typical in all his films, and lots of blood, plus the finale of the movie proves to be extremely appalling, but none of the scenes ever extend into the overly sickening levels of Casino's head in a trap scene, but in classic Scorsese fashion, the film remains bluntly gory. <br/><br/>It's always a treat to watch a movie where Scorsese projects and analyzes a crime drama with such splendid skillfulness and commitment. For example, the well-written and fantastically shot scene where Costello lures Colin into the world of crime by giving him comic books and groceries is a straightforward portrayal of how the innocent become the naÃ¯ve and Scorsese works miracles by giving the scene a little tangy twist by adding in a little dark humor. <br/><br/>It's significant how a Hong Kong crime film could be carried over into an American setting with such clever care and William Monahan writes so perfectly, giving each character enough time to develop on screen until you come to care about that character. The story loosens with an honest indifference to anything that is unimportant to the overall story, and Editor Thelma Schoonmaker edits and trims the movie outstandingly to keep it full of tension. The movie constantly throws pot twist after plot twist at the viewer to the point where the person watching the movie is unable to keep up with who is back-stabbing or lying to who, but it's all done so effortlessly that one just goes along with it. <br/><br/>As with all of Scorsese's films, the acting is just perfect. Mark Walberg is fantastic as Sergeant Dignam, stealing every scene he's in with his foul mouth, bad cop attitude and Bostonian accent. Alec Baldwin is perfect as the wise-cracking, crude, yet effective role as the police chef. Martin Sheen is also great as Captain Queenan, providing much of the fatherly wisdom throughout the course of this film. Vera Farmiga is great as Mdolyn Madden, providing the love interest for both our lead characters, but actually adds something to the story. Jack Nicholson is on top form in this film as Frank Costello, walking the line between normality, parenthood, family and psychopathic killer with ease. Whenever Nicholson is on screen, it's impossible for you to relax. He builds tension in every scene he's in with each look and motion, acting likes a pit viper ready to strike. Leonardo DiCaprio excels here as Billy Costigan and is simply mesmerizing whenever he is on screen, causing you to care about him, allowing us to sympathize with him due to the psychological and bodily pain he must endure and shows us how it would feel to be wedged into a network of unfamiliar but relentless danger, while at the same time, he's attempting to find his way with whatever clues he is able to find. DiCaprio may have been loathed for his pretty boy looks, but he has become an accomplished and adaptable actor and The Departed allows him to showcase more of his acting greatness. Matt Damon also delivers a brilliant performance as Colin Sullivan, having great assurance in himself as well as Scorsese putting Matt's traits into a character that isn't compassionate in the slightest, something Damon did in Syriana, but takes it to a greater level in this film. We don't really feel for Damon, and you desire to see him get captured, yet at the same time he's not a typical cardboard villain, and Matt does an incredible job showing us a man who has lost his ethical compass, but is still tore about his twin personalities regardless, and isn't content about the brewing conflict. He is an obsessive liar, but is openly hurt when his untruthfulness affects his relationship with his girlfriend. <br/><br/>I can honestly say that The Departed is a perfect film in every level, and while some viewers may find the plot confusing and the whole who is back-stabbing who hard to follow, this film is still worth watching. It's well paced, has great suspense, brilliant acting, tight editing, a killer soundtrack and is shot wonderfully. So do yourself a favor and go watch this film, it's the true definition of a masterpiece."

","The first time I watched ""The Departed"", it was because a friend told me that it was the best ensemble cast and the most original story that he had ever seen. After watching the film, I did agree that it was a terrific cast but it did remind me of a film called ""infernal Affairs"". I honestly do think that ""The Departed"" is a great remake of a solid Hong Kong film, but I will say that I do get bothered when people tell me that it is a movie based on Whitey Bulger. Jack's character could possibly be a reflection of Whitey, but the story came from ""Infernal Affairs"" most definitely. ""Black Mass"" is a movie based on Whitey. ""The Departed"" is great fiction with elements taken from reality. Also, I would like to point out that even though all the performances were beyond amazing. I thought Mark Wahlberg's performance, as small as it may have been, was one of my favorite characters from ""The Departed""."
"sam_smithreview","10","0","2","9 June 2016"," superb acting, and the only American reboot i LOVE
","Now I know that 'The Departed' is based off of the Hong Kong movie 'WuJianDao' 'Infernal Affairs', but Scorsese really grabs hold of a great story and brings it to the American Screen. My father grew up in Boston and when we walked out of the theater he couldn't stop talking about how authentic the environment and attitude was. Then there's the acting in which the lead actors (Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon) not only give stunningly entertaining performances, but you become engulfed in each one's perspective and dilemmas. The smaller roles that of (Baldwin, Walberg, Sheen) are supporting roles that remind me of Jesus Quintana from 'The Big Lebowski', by this I mean that their screen time is limited but they make lasting impressions that you cherish each and every scene they are in, Alec Baldwin especially. The story itself starts off with the basic intro of the players and the setting, but you'll find yourself slowing following each and every plot twist and rooting back and forth for the good guys and for the bad guys. If you're a Scorsese fan, which I am, I think you will appreciate this film. You can clearly see the Scorsese touch ranging from the cinematography and of course the music, it's great to hear ""Gimme Shelter"" again, but ""Comfortably Numb"" played in so well. It's another gangster flick from Scorsese, yet this one stands alone because feels so fresh and most would agree Scorsese does gangster films the best; so why not let him. Oscar worthy, the acting I certainly hope; this is DiCaprio's best role since 'The Aviator' which was his best role since 'Gangs of New York', am I seeing a pattern here. But my lasting impression wasn't concerned with the politics of the golden statue; my lasting impression was that I had sat through 2 and half hours of brilliant and especially entertaining storytelling. Thank you Mr. Scorsese."

","Despite having four decades worth of competition The Departed in my opinion is the greatest movie Martin Scorsese has ever made because it does everything that movie needs to be good and much more. Leonardo DiCaprio was simply incredible in this movie it's not only his best performance but it's one of the best of all time as there is a story on his face and a variety of emotions with every new scene. The film also have layers upon layers of tension in every scene making it truly unpredictable right up until the very end. While out shined by DiCaprio the rest of the cast give fantastic Performances particularly Matt Damon who also gives the best performance of his career. While it's always going to bug me that Mark Walberg was the only actor in this movie to be nominated for an Oscar he was still fantastic and was the comic relief of the film.

This is one of my favourite movies of all time and it truly is a masterpiece."

","You will either be completely intrigued by this movie or completely turned off by it. If you don't mind gratuitous amounts of profanity and some brutal violence and love a complex plot, it's great fun to watch. The first hour is a roller coaster of intercuts and setups. I don't think there is a conventional continuous scene until the point where the story lines meet up in Costello's exchange with his Chinese trading partners. The only way to tell when a real ""scene"" is over otherwise is when the soundtrack changes songs.<br/><br/>In some ways I kind of wish this had been made into a TV series because we would have gotten all of those smaller moments that weren't important enough to show in 150 minutes. For Sullivan and Costigan to be so trusted by their superiors, there had to have been hundreds of other cumulative events that made Costello and Ellerby to not suspect them of betrayal. As it was, we get some great and interesting scenes on this topic. One would think that there would be no suspense if we already know who the moles are, but the suspense comes from the question of how they will be discovered and how they can uncover each other.<br/><br/>For this reason, much of the plot is character driven. You'll have a favorite and least favorite character by the end. But it seems that they want you to side with Costigan rather than Sullivan. Costigan hates the crimes he has to take part in, whereas Sullivan works for Costello by choice and mostly for his own benefit. Aside from them, the supporting cast is not presented in an overly positive or negative light. Even Costello and Mr. French are not made so despicable that they cannot be liked. I wasn't huge on the main characters getting gradually killed off in the last 45 minutes of the movie, but it does result in some good twists.<br/><br/>There are not many movies that top this one in technical execution. Sure there are big budget CGI action movies and such now, but the raw trade of filmmaking is at its best here. The pacing of the script and Scorsese's work directing as well as the great use of music are excellent and make a good story into a great movie. The acting is pretty good, though it wasn't Damon's best performance and Wahlberg was not Oscar worthy as Dignam. However, DiCaprio and Nicholson were great in their roles.<br/><br/>If you plan on going into the filmmaking business, this is a must-see. If not, it's an interesting watch or two hours of torture. I know some people dislike Scorsese's style and think it's unpleasant to watch, which is understandable. But in some ways, it's good to know that the sort of crime that goes on in mob movies is very real. The one thing I can guarantee you will not be is bored. Overall Rating: 8.6/10."

I just think he's the entirely wrong person to be playing this part. (Is there a right person to be playing an apparently Irish gangster named ""Frank Costello""? Where the hell does that name come from?) He really seems to be walking around in a different film from the rest of the cast. His giant presence seems to pull the focus of the film away from where it should be sitting with Damon and DiCaprio. I have a few other small issues. Scorsese's usually infallible feel for music seems to have let him down here since he includes both the intolerably awful Dropkick Murphys and a terrible version of ""Confortably Numb"" by Roger Waters with Van Morrison's band (???).

Jack and Leonardo acts so good.The Departed is a thoroughly engrossing gangster drama with the gritty authenticity and soupy morality we come to expect.Most of Martin Scorsese's films have been about men trying to realize their inner image of themselves. That's as true of Travis Bickle as of Jake LaMotta, Rupert Pupkin, Howard Hughes, the Dalai Lama, Bob Dylan or, for that matter, Jesus Christ. ""The Departed"" is about two men trying to live public lives that are the radical opposites of their inner realities. Their attempts threaten to destroy them, either by implosion or fatal betrayal.

Among the fast-talking characters, the bloody violence, a plethora of quick- paced, fast-cutting montages, and other of Scorsese's other filmmaking quirks, this is easily the most grounded, most clever, and most engaging of these movies rarely replicated even today. With solid acting, a tangibly gritty New York atmosphere, and a whole lot of blood, THE DEPARTED is as good as you heard, and easily the pinnacle gangster movie since THE GODFATHER.<br/><br/>What comes into play is the dynamic between both the undercover cop, the head cop, and the mob boss. The two know who he is, and are always under tension from whoever takes him down. All of it adds up to some of the bloodiest, coolest gun battles and punch-throwing I have ever seen. <br/><br/>The cast is terrific as always. Scorsese uses his actors to their fullest potential and they all shine. DiCaprio may seem like his pretty-boy looks does not fit this movie, but it works; a troubled undercover detective caught way over his head with both the dangerous mob scene and the detective work that may or may not be using him. Matt Damon is as charming as always, and there is always some fun to be had with Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, and even Alec Baldwin. But hands down the best performance is the great Jack Nicholson. For such a rotten, pride stricken mob boss, he is clearly having fun as always. <br/><br/>Outside of that, there really isn't much to say that requires a spoiler warning, so yeah. GO SEE IT!

"Red-Barracuda","8","0","2","7 April 2016"," Great direction, writing and acting make this one a definite winner
","With The Departed, Martin Scorsese does that thing has done so successfully over the years where he takes what would ordinarily be pretty basic genre material and injects it with his particular dynamic style, elevating the resultant movie in the process. This of course was the film where he finally got the Oscar he so obviously craved and while this is certainly not his best film, it's still a very good one indeed. Its set around the Boston organised crime scene and it examines the blurry lines that exist between how the good guys and bad guys go about their business. To this end an undercover agent is sent to infiltrate the Irish Mafia, while in reverse the gangsters send in one of their young affiliates to enrol and work for the police department, with the purpose of reporting back to the gangsters all police activity. Before long their paths gets dangerously intertwined.<br/><br/>Aside from Scorsese's typically energetic and lively direction, this one is notable for its extremely good cast. There are so many top performers that it feels like an ensemble film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon play the two undercover men at the heart of the story and both actors offer up multi-dimensional portrayals of their characters. Its top drawer stuff from the two principals and it really helps draw the viewer in but there are so many other top actors putting in high calibre work here that it's impossible to mention them all in proper detail. But suffice to say Jack Nicholson is at his charismatic best in the role of a somewhat unsympathetic and nasty crime boss; Vera Farmiga is luminous and magnetic as a police psychologist who is the object of affections of both undercover men, while Mark Wahlberg puts in an absolutely hilarious turn as a police boss with a decidedly confrontational manner.<br/><br/>This is superior stuff essentially. Despite its many characters and plot avenues, it's so very well written that it is always compelling and involving. Along with the later The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), it showed pretty conclusively that, despite his advancing years, Scorsese was still at the top of his game and had certainly not mellowed with age."
"militarylord","7","0","1","6 March 2016"," The Departed is better than your average film but that is only because Martin Scorsese is better than your average director.
","Strip away the glossy exterior of possibly questionable performances by an all-star cast with the direction of a stellar director and you are left with mordantly skewed dialogue from an unoriginal (adapted) script written by the infamous William Monahan who destroyed Ridley Scott's filmography with 'Kingdom of Heaven' (39% RT) and 'Body of Lies' (54% RT) a year or two after some of Scott's greats such as 'Gladiator' (76% RT) and 'Black Hawk Down' (76% RT). Spoiler Alert: His other movies he did the screenplay for: Mojave (2016) got 31% RT (Mark Wahlberg was in this one too). Edge of Darkness got 56% RT. The Gambler (also with Mark Wahlberg) got 46% RT. THESE ARE HIS TOP FILMS. Also I can see Wahlberg trying to get that Best Supporting Actor Oscar with his harlotry by working with Monahan seeing as The Departed got him a nomination for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar that year. If The Departed was written so well why then has Monahan shown that apart from a stolen script he cannot make a proper script? If the Departed was written so well then why has Scorcese refused to make The Departed 2 (Monahan had made a script that would involve bringing back the actors)? If The Departed had such a good script, with so many good actors, with such a large budget for its setting (half of it going to the actors), and Robert DeNiro being in 8 of Scorsese's films with most of them being classics why then did Robert DeNiro decide to decline the offer to star in the film and make another? These aren't conclusively damning questions but watching the movie itself conclusively damns the script...<br/><br/>Also, read the first paragraph of the reviews from the Top Critics of Rotten Tomatoes. Most of them praise Scorsese, the actors and how funny the movie is. Only a couple of the Top Critics praise the plot and screenplay. Only one praises Monahan. Also about 8 out of the 44 demonise the film itself.<br/><br/>Everyone was too eager since Casino (1995) to see another true Scorsesian movie and jumped on the bandwagon of this one thinking it was what they needed. In the past 10 years this has been a truer Scorsesian movie just not a great one. Also, swearing and profanity doesn't pass for a good script either. In fact you are more likely to use these tools when you don't have a good script.<br/><br/>P.S. % RT = Rotten Tomatoes critic ratings."
"AliceofX","8","0","1","28 February 2016"," Great Crime Film
","In The Departed every actor plays to his strengths and it's a film that's worth watching just for the performances. The casting is just perfect. Leonardo DiCaprio is at his best playing the kind of character he was born to play. Matt Damon adds his typical humour to the film.<br/><br/>But besides that this is a film you would expect from Martin Scorcese in its combination of violence and comedy. It's a gritty crime thriller with just enough pictures of the real world to make it feel realistic.<br/><br/>The story is top notch. It keeps you on your toes as you observe its every twist and turn never knowing in whose favour the story might end. The characters play a cat and mouse game with one another with the roles often switching. And of course you can't not mention the music. The film's theme song is one of those catchy tunes that sticks in your head for a long time.<br/><br/>Perhaps the only thing I didn't like about the film is the ending which seemed abrupt. Other than that The Departed is a great film and a must see for all crime genre fans."

","I think the Departed was a thriller from the beginning. Two young men attend Highway patrol academy and become outstanding cops in Boston. Dicaprio and Damon go different directions Costigan really good and Sullivan goes bad working with Jack Nicholson as Frank Costello The movie was very long but action packed. Big time criminals but Frank does his own collection work. They have played roles similar to this movie. The sound was superb with all the bullets flying could have edited out some scenes to shorten some but I like a flow of Action moving pacing the scenes yes the theme fits the bill as crime don't pay Martin Scorsese has another successful movie.

As far as directing is concerned, while this is not the best movie Scorsese ever maid, for me the honor belongs to Goodfellas, it is a really close call. Why then only 7 out of 10 stars. This movie is a remake out of Infernal Affairs. In its own right an amazing movie even with the cultural barrier, being an foreign movie. But with the talent involved it is a little bit sad to only create a new version instead of something original. That being said, this movie will grab your attention and never let go for 2,5 hours. Quite the accomplishment given the usual average movie length. I recommend this movie to not only the thriller genre fans, but to everybody who is not afraid of violence in movies.

The good cop that went bad, the good cop that went good, and the jerk in charge of it all, all showed up for work on this picture. The movie had me wondering but not most of the time and before I knew became sexy. It captured my attention throughout but even though I paid close attention, I felt like I missed the story.

It should be.<br/><br/>When fantastic actors, like Matt Damon, Jack Nicolas and Leo DiCaprio play the respective ""rats"" and one of the best directors to ever walk the face of the earth at the helm makes this a non-linear story line that is surpassingly easy to follow.

Themes of brotherhood, father and son relationships as well as loyalty to the law. Scorsese has had a lot of hits, too many to name, while his early work like ""Raging Bull"", ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Goodfellas"", will go down in history as his best, his later work like ""The Departed"", ""Hugo"" and ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" are fantastic as well and will probably age just as well as his other films.<br/><br/>This is a long film, with a running time of 151 minutes most filmmakers would loose focus and pacing, Scorsese is one of the few great directors who is up for this challenge.

I loved the scene where Billy beats up the guys in the shop and the best part in the movie is when Costello dies even though he was probably my favourite character.

I was never a huge Leo guy to be honest, but when I watched this my opinion changed very fast. The same thing for Matt Damon, he surprised me in this one too. Though the best of everyone in this movie has to be in my opinion Jack Nicholson as Franky Costello. Man, Jack is back and more psychotic than ever!

While many crime films have plots whose holes are crudely filled in with blood and action, this is delicately laid out and executed in the most satisfying way.

","My immediate reaction is: Wow! There is a lot to process.<br/><br/>I'd heard about this movie and actually saw a bit of a spoiler from WatchMojo. I never bothered to watch it before because I understood it to be a drama and I usually need to be in the mood for dramas.<br/><br/>With a movie so star studded it got me thinking about other star studded movies that actually delivered. First, let me qualify ""star studded"". I mean a movie having four or more actors/actresses that are legitimate ""A"" listers: e.g. Ocean's Eleven, Rat Race, Casino, Pulp Fiction, Independence Day, Blues Brothers, and Roots. I'm sure there are at least a couple names I'm missing but these were the ones that immediately came to mind. I'd now like to add The Departed to that list.<br/><br/>Some of my least favorite star studded movies are: Armageddon, Be Cool, Grown Ups and Soul Plane to name a few. With star studded movies there are usually high expectations. With high expectations there is either a meets, outperform or underperform. It's so easy to underperform because the bar is set so high.<br/><br/>This movie did not disappoint. It was very cleverly written and of course, well acted. I would say that they all performed well but DiCapprio delivered an even better performance than the rest. Scorcese did not waste the talent he had to work with."

"williampsamuel","10","0","4","7 December 2014"," A Gangland Masterpiece for the 21st Century
","The Departed is one of the best cop movies I've ever seen, and one of the best gangster movies I've ever seen. I cannot remember any movie that has kept me more on edge and for a longer period of time than this film. Even now, writing this, my nerves are shot, and not just because it's finals week.<br/><br/>The situation is that the Massachusetts State Police are finally closing in on Boston's top gangster, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). They've finally gotten an undercover officer (Leonardo Dicaprio) into his gang. But Costello's got a mole of his own (Matt Damon) in the department. And both sides realize they've been infiltrated. So like the best spy thriller, it becomes a race by the two sides to find the rat in their midst. And the stakes are life and death.<br/><br/>There are so many close calls in this movie that it's just unbelievable. There are so many times when Damon and Dicaprio almost get a bead on each other, so many times that doing their job requires them to come within a hair's breadth of blowing their cover, so many conversations where we're thinking ""This is it, the hammer's gonna drop."" There's a million ways either man could get found out, and no margin for error. The result is more tension and suspense than any movie since High Noon. In that movie you knew nothing was going to go down until the end. There's no such guarantee here, and it's absolutely nerve wracking.<br/><br/>And none of it would work if the actors weren't absolutely on top of their game. DiCaprio has never been more physical or more on edge than he is here. As Billy Costigan, he's wound up tighter than a watch spring, likely to explode at any moment, verbally if you're lucky, physically if you're not. If you look closely enough, you can tell it's an act, but one that's being put on for the gangsters, not us. He radiates stress and an increasing aura of dread. He knows that he can't stay undercover forever, and it's absolutely driving him up the wall. He's got to let off steam, and if it adds to his cover as a loose cannon, all the better.<br/><br/>In contrast, Damon's character is much smoother and under control. He's in a role that he's been playing his entire life. And he's in a position from which he can turn attention to anyone but himself. But under the front of calm professionalism, the tension is always there. Because it's not just the police he has to worry about, if he doesn't deliver, he has to deal with Costello. And Costello is a man you don't want to deal with. Ruthless, amoral, borderline psychotic, and with a massive entitlement complex, he's the archetype of the Boston gangster. He's as smart as they come and surprisingly charming for a scumbag, and no-one could have played him better than Nicholson.<br/><br/>As with any of Scorsese's gangster films, there's a powerful atmosphere to The Departed, one of danger, corruption, and decay. Graphic violence and language are everywhere. Costello and his crew whack people for the most trivial of reasons, then dump their bodies as nonchalantly as if they were taking out the trash. Cops and criminals alike drop F-bombs like they're paid to say it. Crumbling brownstones, smoke filled bars, and the grim expressions of the locals paint a world where life is cheap, every road is a dead end, and the law is just a bunch of big words. This is the closest to the Boston projects most of us will ever want to come.<br/><br/>The Departed is what every thriller hopes to be. It's smart as it is intense, it has great shoot-outs, it maintains an incredible level of suspense, and it keeps you guessing with unexpected twists. It's the mark of a great director to consistently put out great movies decade after decade, and this is one of Scorsese's greatest."

The criminal underworld is brought to life with characters such as Jack Nicholson, playing the part of Frank Costello a violent unhinged criminal boss who has managed to infiltrate the Massachusetts State Police. Matt Damon's character Collin Sullivan a corrupt police officer helping him further his criminal interests. The members of the State Police have a suspicion that Costello has a propensity to avoid them so effortlessly that he must be receiving information from an informant or ""rat"". <br/><br/>The State Police's special Investigations Unit is headed up by Martin Sheens character Captain Queenan and Mark Walberg's foul mouthed Staff Sergeant Dignam. Devising a plot to implant a State Police undercover agent into Costello's organization they enlist the help of Leonardo DiCapreo's Billy Costigan. Costigan's family has a long history of crime in the Boston area and a loose association with Costello's outfit, making him ideal to infiltrate with raising much of a concern from the leadership element the Boston Underworld. The film is revolving around the theme of moral implications and human struggle. The moral implications are put to the viewer as the actions of both parties continue throughout the film. Human struggle is clearly a central theme in the film in the sense of ""good vs evil"" and the toll it takes on the individuals caught with in the struggle.<br/><br/>Proving himself through smaller criminal endeavors such as collecting and enforcement Costigan proves he is a ""trustworthy"" criminal associate, leading to him delving deeper into Costello's world. Costigan has had his identity as a State Police Officer totally erased and reports only to Cpt. Queenan and Staff Sergeant Dignam, playing the part of this criminal begins to have effects on Costigan in a mental and physical effect. Costigan is able to discuss these issues with a State sponsored psychiatrist Madolyn Madden played by Vera Farminga who coincidently has an ongoing relationship with Det. Sullivan. Madden begins a physical relationship with both men, not being aware of the fact that Costigan is actually a Police officer, his cover has a parolee states meetings with her are a condition of his parole. Through a botched sting attempt that Costello escapes with the help of Det. Sullivan the two informants begin to suspect that each other exist. A dangerous game of cat and mouse then ensues as the two men attempt to reveal the others identity to their respective handlers, leading to the inevitable clash of ""good vs evil"". <br/><br/>The Departed is fast paced and easy to become immersed in, well written and directed the cast of Hollywood heavy weights carrying the film makes this film a must watch on multiple genres of film.

Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprioand Matt Damon was perfect.<br/><br/>There was also actors/actresses like Martin Sheen, Vera Farmiga and Mark Wahlberg. This film, is the The Godfather of Irish mafias. If you are fan of gangster films, you should definitely watch this film, right now. This film is a masterpiece. Character designs, directing and acting is like i said, really great.<br/><br/>And finally, the original film has got 2 sequels. But I am not thinking that Scorsese is going to make sequel to The Departed."

Apart from this movie works great and very thrilling as well and i would rather just a ""must watch""."

","Absolutely amazing film on the whole. I only watched this film a couple of years back, but as soon as i saw it for the first time, i watched it a further 3 times within the week. I was mentioning it to everyone praising the film. Firstly on the face of it the cast is tremendous and compliment each other brilliantly. Being a huge fan of DiCaprio i really appreciated his role as to me this is one of the first films I've seen him possess his aggressive side, and it was a tremendous performance. Mark Wahlberg and Matt Damon also brilliant actors, making this film evermore appealing to watch. As well as Jack Nicholson playing the head of the gang and enforcing Matt Damon as the rat in the police crew. There is no other film like this in my opinion. The tension that builds up to who will find the rat in their crew first (DiCaprio being the rat in Nicholsons gang) is enthralling. Directed by none other than Martin Scorsese it is the absolute perfect combination."

","Martin Scorsese's The Departed is an excellent movie about an undercover cop named Bill Costigan played by Leonardo DiCaprio who has infiltrated an Irish mafia and a mole in the same police force working for the exact same crime family. That mole in the Boston police force named Colin Sullivan is played by Matt Damon, ant the mob boss who he is working for is played by Jack Nicholson. This movie also had good cast members such as Ray Winstone, Vera Farmiga, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen. Director Martin Scorsese has crafted one of his best movies as a director throughout his entire career, and goes on a par with mob film such as American Gangster, Bugsy, and Goodfellas. Also it goes on a par with police movies such as The French Connection, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard Dirty Harry and many more."
"alombardy","8","0","3","2 June 2014"," Solid crime thriller delights
","I liked this film a lot - there's a lot to like about it - but I want to address the minor concerns I had with it first.<br/><br/>In honesty, they're the usual problems I have with the more recent Scorsese films. Much like Shutter Island, there's a twist at the end (although admittedly far less important to the narrative as a whole) that was actually fairly predictable. He seems to be obsessed with throwing something in there just to convince the audience (and maybe himself) that he's very clever and in truth the stuff he comes up with isn't as clever as he thinks it is. The other is the creeping sexism again - the female characters are cardboard cutout plot devices and again he thinks he can 'even it out' by throwing a penis in there (that shouldn't be a spoiler if you know Scorsese), but no, it doesn't work like that, and the penis is pointless.<br/><br/>But despite all that, it was not enough to ruin my thorough enjoyment of this movie. The story is very strong and actually gives you plenty of plot twists and turns (which just make it more frustrating as to why he thought he needed to put in that obvious end twist), and the lead performances are judged expertly by Leonardo Di Caprio and Matt Damon. I'm not a fan of either Jack Nicholson nor Mark Wahlberg, but they're convincing here in their respective roles as the sleazy crime boss and the bad cop.<br/><br/>The double agent setup plays out fantastically well and kept me entertained and curious throughout, and even when it is slightly predictable, it's just done so well that I didn't even mind. There's not actually much else to say without giving something away other than a recommendation to go and see it if you want a well paced, thoroughly entertaining crime thriller. 8/10."

","Lots of people bash The Departed for being a complete rip off of the Hong Kong film 'Internal Affairs' with no credit to its source material but, if you manage to see past that, you will discover a masterpiece which has rightfully earned its place in cinema history. Just as a start, the environment and the characters feel so authentic and real, and each actor delivers a awe inspiring performance, some of their best. Even the actors who had limited screen time (Mark Walberg, Alec Baldwin) completely won over me when they were on screen. Jack Nickolson plays the suspicious, evil and cunning Frank Costello with such authenticity and flare, he and Matt Damon steal the show in this crime epic. Martin Scorsese strikes again with his top notch film making, each scene, each element has meaning and it is his finest work since 'Goodfellas' , as you can see gangster films, is where he in his element, its tense, exhilarating, character driven and every second of this two and a half hour film is worth watching and you will absolutely not regret it. It is one of the most spectacular films ever created and deserves every bit of praise it gets.<br/><br/>10/10"
"clay-351-252307","10","0","2","16 May 2014"," Without question, the best film of my generation.
","Some people like movies because of the emotion they elicit, others love to follow the story and some even consume the script word by word. Some people are looking for the lesson to be learned to carry with them after the credits roll. However, rarely does a film run on all cylinders; weaving all of these things(plus more) together simultaneously, delivering all of the above to your senses. The Departed is one of these films. I would argue there are only a handful of films that have ever been made that can lay such claim. Many of the top 250 films have flaws yet their unique nature and/or individuality of the film transcends any rating and makes such an impact on the viewer that the viewer must throw a rose on stage and clap, bravo. The Departed is brilliant in every aspect and for my measure, flawless. Few movies ""have everything."" This film makes its magic in the details and extension of basic ideas. From the lingo on both sides, drenched in black humor and voiced by local accents of the area to the suspenseful uncertainty that develops throughout the film, the viewer feels as if they belong IN THE FILM. I won't say too much but, by the end of it, you are left analyzing the people around you in your life you see every day; at least, I was the first time I saw it. Isn't that the point of a movie? Stop reading. Cancel any distractions preemptively and enjoy the greatest film of the last twenty years."

It is obvious that this film was carefully made in order to win some awards, and I have to say that I am glad that it did win some Oscars, although I am not sure that it deserves all of them.<br/><br/>When you put all these great actors together you will obtain some great acting, but I have to say that Jack Nicholson is my favorite.

","Matt Damon is Colin Sullivan, a Massachusetts state trooper who's been groomed since childhood to infiltrate the Boston Police Department by his father figure, mob boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Quickly rising through the ranks, Colin provides Costello with vital information, while manipulating the system for his own success. Colin learns, however, that his police unit has planted its own mole in Costello's crew. Working deep undercover, officer Billy Castigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) has infiltrated the group and earned the trust of Costello. As Colin and Billy attempt to uncover each other's identity, things are further complicated by a beautiful police psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga) who unwittingly becomes involved in their lives. Scorsese embraces the contrivances of screenwriter William Monahan (Kingdom of Heaven), creating a film that mixes genres with wit and grace. The Departed is equal parts character drama, cop thriller and police procedural, and though the plot is sometimes overly complex (particularly in the final act), Scorsese keeps things tense. Though Damon and DiCaprio share almost no screen time together, Scorsese masterfully juxtaposes their scenes to play off one another. Their intertwined fates and inevitable collision are engrossing, blurring the lines of identity. Damon is the slick snake in the garden, charming us with clever banter and altarboy good looks. DiCaprio is the good cop, losing his soul little by little as he bloodies his hands with ever- darker crimes. Amid the first-rate cast, DiCaprio is the unexpected standout. His third appearance in a Scorsese film is his best performance to date, capturing the tortured desperation of a man who fears he's reached the point of no return. His vulnerability, rage and paranoia are all well-earned, and DiCaprio never overplays his hand. Damon's performance, on the other hand, is believable but hits only one note. There are glimmers here and there of something bubbling beneath his well-varnished surface, and Scorsese gives him lots of screen time, but we never really get close enough to peer inside. Predictably, Nicholson steals nearly every scene he's in. There's no denying the electricity of his performance, but it's not the three- dimensional character some critics would have you believe. Except for About Schmidt, the actor hasn't adopted a flesh-and-blood persona in years, and his turn as Frank Costello is no exception. As an aging gangster who's achieved so much success there's no place to go except crazy, Nicholson tries to inject some heart and nobility into the madness but can't resist a few unhinged gestures and a drunken rat imitation. Scene by scene, Frank's insanity grows as his Boston accent slowly disappears. The rest of the cast is terrific. Alec Baldwin is hilariously self- satisfied as a police unit commander, proving once again he's one of the best character actors around. Martin Sheen brings decency to his small police chief role (a part originally intended for Robert De Niro). Mark Wahlberg follows in Nicholson's scene-stealing footsteps as a savagely foul-mouthed detective, and Ray Winston oozes menace as Costello's second-in-command. As the film's sole female lead, Vera Farmiga salvages her contrived role — a beautiful psychiatrist caught in an absurd romantic entanglement between Billy and Colin. In Scorsese's moral universe, the divide between saint and sinner is slight, and The Departed makes clear which side the director is most comfortable with. Costello's criminal world seduces us with its instant camaraderie and brutal loyalties. But the world of the law, where Colin is forced to make his home, is depicted as a soulless collection of self-righteous cynics and foolish do-gooders. The message is clear: It's not the world that corrupts the man, but vice versa. As Costello states in the beginning of the film, ""I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me."""

His protégé, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), becomes a Mass. State Trooper in order to work as a mole in the force for Costello. Cpt. Quellan (Martin Sheen) and Sgt. Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) begin to develop the theory that there may be a rat working for Costello. So, they enlist former cop-trainee Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) to go undercover and infiltrate Costello's gang. Billy succeeds and Costello welcomes him. Meanwhile, Sullivan is put in charge of finding out who the rat is (NOBODY KNOWS HE IS LOOKING FOR HIMSELF). And Quellan and Dignam inform Costigan that he needs to find out who the rat in the police department is. As the movie intensifies, Costello understands that he has a rat in his gang. Costigan convinces Costello that he is not the rat, and Costello believes him. On the side of all this, Costigan nails Sullivan's fiancée. Now for the Climax: Costello's men throw Cpt. Quellan off the roof to his death. Then, Sullivan learns that Costello talks with the FBI, so he kills him. Sullivan is heralded as a hero around the office, but is still aware that Costigan, who appears at the station, isn't good news. Costigan, via looking at a very important envelope on Sullivan's desk, learns that Sullivan is the rat. Sullivan, simultaneously, learns that Costigan was Costello's rat. Costigan hunts down Sullivan, but is shot dead by Sullivan's men. The movie ends with Sgt. Dignam waiting in Sullivan's apartment. BANG. Sullivan is killed, and Dignam walks out.

","I must say, Martin Scorsese has done it yet again. The cast is unbelievably amazing. Though it saddens me that Leonardo DiCaprio has declined enlisting himself as the main lead which would've made him a potential Academy Award winner. Speaking of which, I would be focusing this review on the talented (and love of my life) Leonardo DiCaprio. The man is such an incredible actor - very professional and very dedicated to his craft. After devoting myself to a bunch of Leonardo Dicaprio films, I would like to join the bandwagon and start of by saying that this guy needs his proper recognition for working his ass off for almost two decades. Of all the films DiCaprio has worked with, 'The Departed' has to be the one completely out of consideration as a letdown. Hands down to the amazing Martin Scorsese as well, who has been creating real entertainment for the betterment of this century."

Leonardo DiCaprio was magnificent. I have never been a big fan of Leonardo. I really liked him in Gangs of New York and Catch Me If You Can, but this performance was over the top.<br/><br/>Having said that, I can't really think of another character's performance in The Departed that is worth mentioning. It ran 50 minutes longer than Mou gaan dou and the extra time was really a waste as it did not add anything to the film. <br/><br/>The setup in the beginning was really a bore.

","The Departed is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast. Martin Scorsese hits it out of the park once again in one of his most impressive movies to date, it combines all the aspects of film that he is fantastic at directing, character development, action and strong dialogue based scenes, it all comes together to make an instant classic, he may have done gangster and mob films before, but this film stands out as very original and intriguing two and a half hours. My only real criticism for the film would be that it focuses on Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio's characters too much, I understand that they are the main characters, but there were many other terrific characters that were left feeling underdeveloped, particularly Frank Costello and Dignam, they were both the most engrossing characters, mainly because of their outstanding portrayals from Jack Nicholson and Mark Wahlberg, and I would have loved to have seen more from them. The performances in this film are outstanding, there isn't a single example of poor or mediocre acting here, everyone gives it there all, the film isn't really driven by one character, it's driven by many and thankfully everyone knew what they were doing. Intense, very well acted and engrossing, I would recommend the Departed to anyone looking for a good drama or crime film. <br/><br/>After two cops working for both the police force and an Irish mob gang learn they are in the presence of a rat, they race to track down one another.<br/><br/>Best Performance: Jack Nicholson"

","'Lies, Betrayal & Sacrifice. How far will you take it?' the quote clearly describes Martin Scorsese's exceptional cop thriller 'The Departed'. Martin Scorsese voted as one of the best directors ever to be gifted to the film industry, returns back to the gangster genre after a span of 11 years. Goodfellas (1990), Mean Streets (1973), Casino (1995) are few of the illustrations of his master hand in this genre. Inspired from 2002, Hong Kong movie 'Internal Affairs ' The Departed makes the viewers witness assembling of an astral cast altogether. I mean who won't give a nod to the movie which has Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson & Mark Walberg in decisive roles. <br/><br/>Screenplay crafted in a well paced & witty manner by William Monahan, the film begins with the director playfully shooting Nicholson in the dark for few scenes as you can just glimpse his out-sized silhouette while everyone else is in the clear view. Scorsese simply wants to symbolize through this that he is the driving force of all the mayhem & destruction; the monstrous devil. 20 minutes post the film starts, you get to know about the title of the film but by then you have already crafted a general picture of the film's plot in your mind; An outstandingly clever move by an outstandingly brilliant director.<br/><br/>Frank Costello (Nicholson), the Irish-American Mafioso is the only powerful man holding the reigns of organized crime in Irish neighborhood in South Boston. He influences Collin Sullivan (Damon) by seducing altar boy by few gallons of milk & comic books & Sullivan is trained to be his very own secret agent in the Massachusetts State Police department; the department run by Queenan (Martin Sheen). On the other hand, Leonardo plays Billy Costigan, an honest person from a dishonest family who cannot make it to being a cop owing to his austere family background finally agrees to Queenan's urge for him to be his undercover informer in Costello's gang. <br/><br/>After a failed sting operation in spite of Billy tipping the police off, the State Police Department grows quite suspicious of a rat in their own department. Thanks to Sullivan from State Police, even Costello is tad convinced that even he has a police informer in his gang. The entire movie is about how both the organizations make their best to find out the moles around them, finally leading to some shootouts, body counts and unsurpassed scene of carnage. Matt Damon who appears to be a well behaved & a neat cop pertaining to his clean shaved look but sadly isn't. He gets involved with the cop psychiatrist Madolyn (Vera Farmiga) and gets into a live-in relationship with her but finally the love tapers towards destruction in the end. The film however gets us the glimpses of some heart-warming intimacy between the couple. <br/><br/>The Departed is a complex story of a paralleled infiltration of organized crime and the police department narrated rather simply as it showcases the idiosyncratic performances of the lead actors & the strong masterstroke of the director. It makes a complicated and potentially convoluted story and delivers it to the audience with sterile clarity. It has the same violence & tension from Goodfellas & Casino minus the narration. However as expected Scorsese has managed to explore the gangster world ahead of the vision & delivered a kaleidoscopic masterpiece. Needless to say, in my view this happens to be Scorsese's best gangster movie till date."
"elshikh4","2","0","1","29 October 2013"," Epic !.. What Epic ?!
","Sometimes, the Oscars, and the film critics, agree on one opinion. Sometimes, I disagree with that. This time is one of their biggest!<br/><br/>(The Departed) is a crime thriller. And coming from such an honored director, such as Martin Scorsese, guarantees thrill and possible substance. However, it wasn't that excellent, and had many problems.<br/><br/>The time-line wasn't taken care of; suddenly, within 2 ordinary scenes, not even a respectable montage, a year passed by! The doctor is falling in love with 2 police officers, where their second is undercover, and no one knows about it; whether their first, or the mob?!! While Jack Nicholson's character, Costello, is a mafia lord, who makes international arms deals, he's still running around the streets, collecting protection money; so is he a mafia lord or a small time goon?!! Mark Wahlberg's character can't be the relief, can't be convincing, and - to tell you the truth - can't be bearable either! The F word is given, every second, in a free and overabundant manner; they used it for a total of 237 times. Unlike Scorsese' other mafia movies, increasing the cursing or swearing wasn't made for the sake of enhancing a realistic atmosphere inasmuch as compensating the drama's weakness, which didn't happen. On the contrary, it added fakeness, bore and nervousness! And how in God's name a dangerous police mission, like sending a man undercover through the world of organized crime, is known by just 2 persons?!?!?!!?!<br/><br/>Who told Leonardo DiCaprio that the movie was a comedy? Because he acted exactly as if he was in one. By the way he looked and reacted, he was a scared mouse all along, so near of crying out loud: ""I'M A POLICEMAN, KILL ME AND PUT ME OUT OF MY MISERY!!"". Matt Damon is not charismatic enough, talented enough, and hence veracious or right. I didn't hate his character, rather I hated him being unable to make me hate his character! His flat face and cold reactions don't tell that he came from the bottom. Vera Farmiga is mediocre at times, and so bad at others. There is no love in her eyes, maybe tension and horror. There is not one atom of chemistry between her and her 2 co-stars. And there is no doubt that she seemed older than them! Martin Sheen was icy as usual, but this time I can blame the script as well; obviously, he had no character.<br/><br/>However, no one was more wrong than Jack Nicholson as Costello, to be the main course in this nonsense feast. Really what's worse than not understanding, feeling, or being persuaded by a character in a movie?! That Nicholson's Costello wasn't catchy, by any mean. And wasn't Irish either, by any mean! To add more and more fuel, Scorsese thought that talking dirty and loud, with some eccentric moves, make a unique evil gangster, but no such luck. So all the performance that I watched ranged between Jack Nicholson's Joker of Batman, and Jack Nicholson himself acting vainly. Enough to recall his scene with DiCaprio, while he was suspecting the latter; which was a complete drollery instead of a master scene!<br/><br/>Speaking about farce leads directly to the movie's own substance. It's bogus. When Ray Winstone's character, who's - by the way - an underdeveloped character, says in bitter wisdom: ""A nation of rats.."", you have to laugh sadly. ""Laugh"" since this is the script's way to insert policy, or social commentary in this already unthrilling thriller. And ""sadly"" because this adolescence comes from someone who used to be subtle like Scorsese. And it's the same adolescence which you find in the last scene with the rat. Ok, in regard to this, The Simpsons' Ralph Wiggum couldn't say it better: ""It symbolizes obviousness!!"". As a whole, the way this movie was made, doesn't turn it into a tragedy about the distrust in post-9/11 America, however maybe a farce about the same subject, especially with the end's farcical massacre!<br/><br/>In his worst movies, Scorsese is interesting. However, here, it is so bad I think. His directing didn't win any artistic top; and it's a rare time when he makes something that doesn't impress or affect. As many of his movies, it's fast-paced, but his sedate touch was missed. Originally, the script lacks the power of cogency, as if it has no time for anything, and gives us the news flashes only. So with frantic editing, the movie felt like a speedy trailer, becoming utterly delirious. Therefore, any intended serious theme or satire came to nothing, and all what remained was mediocre crime thriller of which you don't enjoy much, and regretfully say after finishing: ""That could have been better.""<br/><br/>All in all, in (The Departed) Martin Scorsese pulled off making uninteresting package of nervousness and adolescence, which has no relation whatsoever to his previous, and true, mafia epics like (Goodfellas) and (Casino). Although I may find explanations for choosing it as The Best Motion Picture of 2006 (America's bigwig critics are idiot, 2006's movies are horrible..), but I really don't know how the Academy gave Scorsese his first Oscar as a director for his so-called epic!"
"tomgillespie2002","7","0","1","12 October 2013"," A crazy ride
","I saw Hong Kong crime thriller Infernal Affairs (2002) a couple of years before Martin Scorsese's Hollywood remake The Departed. I remember little of it now, but I do remember finding it to be an ingenious idea and a gripping little movie, albeit a little overrated. Scorsese obviously saw potential in the idea, as The Departed is admittedly bloated, but packed-to-the-gills with eccentric criminals, sweary 'cwops', and CGI blood, expanding the story and characters and executed in that uber-stylish way that the director is so well known for. I'll avoid comparisons to Infernal Affairs as the two share very little in common apart from basic story, and Scorsese makes this film very much his own.<br/><br/>Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is enlisted into mob boss Frank Costello's (Jack Nicholson) crime-ring at a young age, and is raised to be an informant in the Massachusetts State Police. New police academy graduate William Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), a rough-and-ready type from a colourful family, is forced into going undercover in Costello's gang by Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg). When a rat is exposed on both sides, the two must search desperately for the other before they are unwillingly revealed. Unbeknownst to the both of them, they also share a girl in psychiatrist Madolyn (Vera Farmiga). <br/><br/>If you go into this film expecting a gritty and realistic urban crime thriller, you will be disappointed. Although the subject matter is grim and it certainly doesn't pull its punches when it comes to violence, this is a shiny movie with explosions of bloodshed akin to the comic- book aesthetic of manga, and asks you to suspend your beliefs for the duration. I mean, Costello is a known maniac with no fear of dispatching his own, yet Costigan becomes his right-hand man within months even though he is known to be ex-police? There are plenty of plot-holes that I could mention but won't bother, as they are there for the purpose of telling an entertaining story.<br/><br/>This is Scorsese as unhinged as he's been in years, letting the story just unravel regardless of just how mental it becomes. Nicholson, an actor I cannot believe had never worked with Scorsese before, gets frequently mentioned as stealing the show. He certainly steals his scenes, and grabs the opportunity to improvise with both hands, waving a severed hand in a bag around in one scene, and inexplicably covered with blood in another. Costello wouldn't last a minute in real-life, he's just too obvious and psychopathic, but in this world he thrives, and is a memorable Nicholson creation. But it's actually Wahlberg that steals the show, getting lines such as ""if you had an idea of what we do, we would not be good at what we do now would we? We would be c***s. Are you calling us c***s?"". It's a testament to his performance that he has probably 10 minutes of screen time and received an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>DiCaprio and Damon fill their roles admirably, the former being the incarnation of anxiety and the latter proving surprisingly slimy given his history of generally wholesome characters. But its the ensemble that really shines in this array of ridiculous and cartoon characters. By the end, questions of identity and who is really important to the story get blurred with a climax of endless bloodshed. The prize of Best Picture and Best Director now seem somewhat silly, and surely a sympathy vote for Martin Scorsese who has made at least ten other movies more deserving of rewarding his talent. But this is a crazy ride, and one that remains gripping and surprising throughout, bolstered by a smart script and a hell of a cast.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","Wonderfully edgy and powerful remake by Martin Scorsese of Wai-keung Lau and Alan Mak's 'Infernal Affairs' (Hong Kong, 2002), an all-star cast is led by Leonardo diCaprio, Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson, and features Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, Ray Winstone and Vera Farmiga. Among a raft of great performances, diCaprio stands out as the severely stressed undercover agent, while Damon reprises something of the supremely cold performance that we saw in 'The Talented Mr. Ripley'. Jack Nicholson verges on over-the-top at times, but is good value as the gangland supremo, while Martin Sheen exudes integrity as Captain Queenan. It's a tour de force with some great sequences and plenty of intrigue, and Scorsese is predictably adept at infusing the piece with lashings of slow burning tension. Well worth seeing if you haven't."
"raphaklopper","10","0","1","16 September 2013"," ""Goodfellas 2"" only that they aren't friends
","34, 34 years of career as a filmmaker (one of the best who ever lived) Martin Scorsese after 18 films including masterpieces like ""Goodfellas"", ""Ranging Bull"" and ""Taxi Driver "". In 2006, ""The Departed"" was the film that not only and finally gave the Oscar for Best Director to Scorsese, but it was the tribute that Scorsese did to all his work and the elements of his films that made him one of the greatest filmmakers of all time! The story takes place in the south of Boston where we find the police waging war on the Irish-American organized crime, and in the midst of all we found the rookie cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) who gets in the investigation department of the investigators Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) and is assigned to infiltrate the mob syndicate headed by the crazy and smart Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Meanwhile we have the agent Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) the protected and informant of Costello, who joined the police to be Costello's contact inside the police, where Colin throughout his career start winning important position to gather and inform Costello plans and counter-plans against Costello's business mafia. But barely both moles know that the intrigue that connects both is much more dangerous than expected and it is all connected with Costello who has more secrets that they can imagine.<br/><br/>""Departed"" at the same time it is a new genre that Scorsese (who already had explored mafia thousands of times; the ""real "" death of Christ; a war hero that works in a cab and speaks to himself wearing underwear; boxing black and white; knights without armor with cars destroying asphalts; one film director who becomes schizophrenic pilot; the first new Yorkers gangs; and so on) were he gets in to, here he not only explores the genre of cop-thriller perfectly, but also makes a tribute to his old, violent, humorous style (not Tarantino, better).<br/><br/>Since the beginning, the film follows with a fast pace, a real pace of a thriller, but thanks to the superb script of William Monahan the movie at the same time does a certain homage to ""Goodfellas"" which also had a fast pace and was full of a hilarious black comedy, just like Departed. Also exploring the language and curse-language of Boston, but also the Irish language and their curse language, (one thing that at a certain point it had been explored in ""Gangs of New York"").<br/><br/>Not only is the script that makes a beautiful tribute and gives the film a great quality, but also the direction (truly deserving of an Oscar) from Scorsese, showing various places in the city of Boston and its culture (thing Scorsese has always done in his films, ALWAYS).<br/><br/>Direction and script on top quality, but did the cast put up with the movie? Actually they carried the movie on their back, everyone simply phenomenal: Jack Nicholson nor comments, just put another role in his resume of exuberant performances; DiCaprio as ever with a stunning performance by giving the perfect Irish Americanized accent to his character; Matt Damon fits perfectly in his role as dirty-cop since the looks and sadistic smiles; and Mark Wahlberg was the only one to be nominated by the Academy (leaving the three monsters of acting film overlooked by the academy) but it wasn't for nothing delivering a superb performance from start to finish giving the perfect Boston accent.<br/><br/>Hilarious, dark, nail biting thriller, the Masterpiece in which Scorsese pays tribute to his entire lineage of classic films presenting us with a beautiful direction, superb script and a luxury cast, ""The Departed"" it may not be the best of Scorsese, but he showed us why we love him so much and his old and many more to come movies! 10/10"

","I've been a movie buff all my life and have seen some excellent works by great directors, but Martin Scorsese is beyond any doubt - a cut above the rest. The old storyteller has variety, and that is what makes him so special - it's like he's a boon for Hollywood.<br/><br/>The Departed is one of those movies which I saw in a near empty theatre (all alone) and I am glad I did that, because if I would have taken my girl along with me, she would have dumped me for not looking at her even once in the entire 150 minutes of pure awesomeness. I was so engrossed in the movie that I nearly chewed all my fingernails down to the bone, and somehow I felt like a part of the movie.<br/><br/>Exceptional performances by Jack Nicholson and Martin Sheen are ably supported by the rest of the cast. Not to forget a role of a lifetime by Vera Farmiga, the most beautiful actress in Hollywood.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie however, is Scorsese's direction. The man is at his best throughout the movie and some brilliant editing gives the viewers a mouthful of breathtaking action sequences.<br/><br/>The movie is a 10/10 on each and every account. Arguably, it is the best action thrillers in the age ruled by batmen and ratwomen."

","I can't shake the feeling of how much this movie reminds me of ""Goodfellas"".<br/><br/>The Departed is a slam-bam thriller, exceeding my expectations, which were already very high. The way Scorcese moves between scenes and plays this movie up is genius.<br/><br/>The script is excellent, providing rich dialogue to move the gripping story along, and the cinematography is just wonderful. The angles and style of filming that Martin Scorcese is famous for emanates here, shining brighter than films of kin.<br/><br/>The acting is just amazing, with a star-studded cast that delivers the goods, and then some. I enjoyed Matt Damon in the title roll, and Leonardo DiCaprio trails right behind him. Jack Nicholson brings charisma to the roll of Frank Costello, and executes with Oscar-worthy style. I especially liked Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin's loose cannon-like characters. They provided a stunning edge to an already sharp blade of a film.<br/><br/>I can go on and on about everything else that is good in this movie, how it all clicks together, but I suggest you watch it for yourself if you haven't already, and find out what all the hype is about! I would give it more than 100 if I could.<br/><br/>HandHStudios Rating: 11/10 :-)"
"GTeixeira","9","0","1","10 August 2013"," A remarkable remake; Scorsese's return to the mafioso genre
","'The Departed' focuses on two characters: Billy Costigan (Leo DiCaprio), an undercover cop in the Boston Irish-American organized crime, and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), an undercover criminal in the Boston police department. As their actions intensify and they rise in position in their hidden roles, a hunt begins on both the police and the mafia to find the moles.<br/><br/>The remake of the already excellent Hong Kong crime thriller 'Infernal Affairs' makes use of director Martin Scorsese's legendary aptitude for gangster films, relocating the story in order to reference the Boston organized crime scene. While still not as good as his masterpieces of the genre, like 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino', 'The Departed' is far from a stain on his filmography.<br/><br/>As usual, the dialogue is good and flows in a very natural (and aggressive) way. The characters, likewise, are very interesting and well represented.<br/><br/>Both Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon feel a lot more mature here. I still can't shake off the image they constructed by playing cheesy, lame pretty boys (and, in Damon's case, troubled lame pretty boys) in films such as 'Titanic', 'Romeo+Juliet', 'Good Will Hunting' or 'Rounders'. It takes a director of Scorsese's caliber to put them in line, and it shows. Both of them give excellent performances, and for the first time ever I sympathized with a DiCaprio character. <br/><br/>The supporting cast is also top-notch, in special Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone and Jack Nicholson; possibly his best casting choice since he last cast Robert De Niro. Possibly the weakest link of the movie, Mark Wahlberg had a bad tendency to overact at times.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the love triangle subplot involving Vera Farmiga's character was totally unnecessary and just a waste of time; likewise, the Costello twist also served little to no purpose other than confuse the slower viewer. The cinematography, while not bad, feels too artificial (a common occurrence in his recent films) and does not convey the level of realism Scorsese's gangster films usually have.<br/><br/>While not on the same level as his masterpieces, most likely thanks to his recent venture into larger scale works ('Gangs of New York', 'The Aviator'), 'The Departed' is Scorsese's best film in over a decade of mediocrities and a great entry in the gangster genre. Now, if he only kept doing mafia and casting high-level actors such as Nicholson and De Niro..."

","With Scorsese being my favourite director and some really talented actors participating, I simply couldn't wait to watch this film.<br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest advantage of 'The Departed' is the performance of the actors. All - I mean all - performers did great, including those with lesser roles, such as Anthony Anderson and David O'Hara. I can't imagine this film with other actors. The music once more added a lot to a Scorsese project, with 'Shipping Up to Boston' becoming a mob classic.<br/><br/>The story itself was simple, yet excellent. However, I found it really hard to follow the plot some times and this is a serious disadvantage of the movie. And it is perhaps the only reason why this film isn't included in my Top 20 Favourite Films.<br/><br/>Some people say 'The Departed' is overrated. What I got to say is that it's a film you have to watch multiple times to understand its magnificence."
"masola91","1","0","5","14 May 2013"," The Accent - Please make it stop
","Aside from the native Bostonians in this movie, the others don't even try to have a Boston accent. Why do you suppose that is? It causes one to be tripped up by the actors halfhearted attempt at sounding authentic. If the movie were based in NYC or Texas you had better believe they would be spot on. What the director and producers fail to realize is that people from Boston do not talk like they're from California half the time, and the other half as if they're from Boston. It doesn't happen. We never say ""Baaah-ston"" when we mean Boston and for the most part, we never use the letter R in any words. Ever. If you're going to create a movie about my hometown, you need to have your on screen cast perfect the accent or hire native Bostonians. Period. In one scene the lead actress, Vera Farmiga suddenly adopts the accent but throughout the rest of the movie sounds like she's from Los Angeles. This is typical and annoying and because of it, it throws off the movie's ""honesty"". Unfortunately the movie comes off as halfhearted and not believable to those of us from Boston. It's too bad Martin Scorsese didn't care enough to make his actors get it right. If it was a NY movie, you know they would have."

","This is a film that is fairly immaculately made, if it isn't the amazingly integrated music with its consistent inconsistency of when it starts and finishes, this is a film which doesn't waste time setting up the scene by showing you pan shots of the city, its instead a film that gets right into the thick of it and stays in it right up until the last scene. <br/><br/>This film does not even make the most common movie mistake that there is, ending the story when the main story line has ended, all plot lines are relatively ended by the end of the story, apart form maybe what happens to the unborn baby and what ever happens to Mark Wahlberg after his ending scene, but by this stage you don't really care, the rest of the story is so good that it is really overlooked.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent, being a huge Nicholson fan anyway, he is on form as always, as well as DiCaprio pulling off a deep and troubled character although perhaps a little bit too much time is spent on him being stressed without it ever really effecting the main story line. Damon's appearance is also welcomed although as the film goes on we are truly taken though the same experience as him as he starts with an amazingly confident performance, diversifying into a near nervous wreck towards the end. However if each of the characters acting was to represent the tone of their characters, this film is really one to watch for character development as especially DiCaprio and Damon's characters and completely different by the end of the film.<br/><br/>This is a true example of a no nonsense film and is welcome in amongst many films which focus far to hard on surroundings, this is the opposite, its all story, everything that happens is relevant in at least some way, and their is little you are left wandering, why was this put into the film? <br/><br/>And all round amazing performance by many actors, obviously Nicholson, DiCaprio and Damon but further I really enjoyed every moment of Wahlberg's no nonsense approach to every scene he is in, as well as also enjoying Baldwins performance and Sheens, who both acted as secondary but crucial members.<br/><br/>Excellent film that is iconic for the kind of mobster genre of films that are out their.

","'The Departed' is what Martin Scorsese claims to be 'the only film I've ever made with a plot'. It is excellent.<br/><br/>The plot itself is based on a Hong Kong movie 'Internal Affairs'. Having not seen the original version I cannot comment on whether 'The Departed' is better or worse but as a film on its own it is brilliant. The story makes sense and is really intelligent. It's surprising just how many times the story can shock you with lots of twists and turns towards the film's climax.<br/><br/>The cast on paper looks excellent and it certainly does not disappoint. Matt Damon rarely plays an antagonist but this film shows he is capable of just that. Leonardo Dicaprio gives a powerful performance and deserved an Oscar nod for this. Jack Nicholson's performance is one of the best of his career; his sinister portrayal of Frank Costello is certainly worth watching. The best performance however was that of Mark Wahlberg who's character provides so much comedy and gravitas to this film. He definitely stole the show here and overshadowed a lot of other great performances like those of Dicaprio and Martin Sheen.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is fantastic.

That is how intricate and intense this movie is - it keeps you on the edge of your seat and guessing until the very end. I briefly looked over some of the other reviews - especially the very negative reviews, and I am astonished that someone can dig up some pathetic excuses as to why this movie is bad.

","Martin Scorcese won a long overdue best director Oscar for this, his first movie with a plot, and if not entirely deserved the honor was not entirely misguided either. The Departed is a tightly made LITTLE crime/suspense thriller, basically a very good modern film noir (note the use of bled out colors to evoke a noir sensibility) with two strongly drawn drawn main characters driven by contrasting needs and ambitions and nicely creative supporting work by Nicholson especially and Baldwin to a lesser extent. (No kudos for Walberg. The screenplay gave him a unique patter, as baroque as it is foul-mouthed, but the performance is all in the writing. Walberg adds nothing in the way of nuance. Can he spell 'nuance'? One wonders. How does this guy manage to sustain a career? Must have one hell of an agent...) Anyway, the entertaining main story line twists around and around like a caduceus to the point of seeming overly contrived, especially as regards the psychologist character who winds up getting involved with both of the lead characters, one of whom is a patient - a professional no-no, and highly unlikely anyway even if he is Leo Dicaprio. If you can get past some of the more extreme manipulations of the plot, this is a richly enjoyable movie."

","Probably very unnecessary to write a review of 'The Departed', as I would almost go so far as to say it is one of the best films produced in the last decade or so, and by now you've either seen it or you haven't. That is probably not very far from the truth though, 'The Departed' is truly Scorsese's masterpiece from beginning to end, it is clear to see from every angle, as was with 'The Aviator' two years prior, that every single one of our cast and crew members are true experts at what they do. Our four male leads DiCaprio, Nicholson, Damon, and Wahlberg all carry themselves nicely throughout the film. Witty, intelligent dialog galore, Wahlberg truly impresses us here, as does Alec Baldwin who doesn't seem to be overplaying himself and doesn't deliver any of his lines as if they were his last words.<br/><br/>The complex story never really lets us down, no time to stop and take a breath, this is the type of film that demands multiple viewings. If you haven't seen this yet, you should probably get on that, as this is precision filmmaking at it's finest. I couldn't believe how unaware I was that I didn't know Scorsese had won himself an Oscar over this one until moments before writing this, and I have to say that would have to be the film he would win for.

Duality is the main theme here, and it is explored well(it's no accident that these two leads look so alike).

Wahlberg is quite impressive, which is a bit new to me. He also comes off really cool, which goes for, well, all of the main cast. Di Caprio and Damon are fantastic. Sure, the Boston accents are over the top(well, Matt's and a few others... Baldwin appears to think he's portraying a Kennedy), but that's easy enough to look past.

Characters are credible, well-defined and nicely developed(through short, effective scenes that set things up). The pace is tight, and the two hour 25 minute running time is packed. This is directed superbly, and the editing and cinematography are amazing. The tension is thick and built expertly.

I recommend this to any fan of Scorsese, crime dramas and/or the actors. 8/10"

","This Scorscese good cop-bad cop opus is a pretty terrible film. Yes I know it won Oscars as sort of consolation for Scorscese not winning Oscars previously, but, erggh, THE DEPARTED was not the film to be handed them.... THE AVIATOR is the film that should have won the Scorscese Oscars not this horrible film. Jack Nicholson's truly terrible idiotic clichÃ©d performance is possibly the worst since THE SHINING with silly grimaces and Huntz Hall mugging. The shabby restaurant scene when he impersonates a rat is simply woeful, an insults the ticket-paying audience who have trusted the film makers and actors to deliver something a lot better.<br/><br/>If you want to see imagery of your most admired young male actors having their brains splattered on a wall, this sadly is it. As usual over violent, and that as usual marrs most Scorsese films: idiots with guns, swearing and urban decay. Not much has changed from MEAN STREETS. The DEPARTED is a major disappointment. Not as groanworthy as GANGS OF NEW YORK which is simply THE CAT IN THE HAT meets MOULIN ROUGE with a cleaver. Think about it."

","I've watched this movie 4 times because I loved it so much, but the one and only thing that I still couldn't accept is the horrible ending.

Not to mention their doing, trying to uncover the Colin rat (who I hated from the beginning) was, in the end: NOTHING, that Dignam guy (I call him Dicknam), put a bullet into Colin's head and that's it! What the hell, If I was him I would have put two bullets in each of his foot and drag him all the way to the SIU team and then uncover him and then KILL THE RAT.

","It's not a true story. Or is it? With the recent arrest of Whitey Bulger, who was reportedly a partial role model for Frank Costello, the Jack Nicholson character, the movie comes back to life as a testimony to recent historical events. What amazes me is how deeply I was drawn in to what is supposedly a fictional story. If these characters are made up, the screenwriter is, well, actually better than Shakespeare. That, or he knows the place, Southie, so well its molecules ooze out of his skin and just telling what he knows. The placement of literary devices, betrayal, suspicion, tension ratcheting scenes is so precise, so well planned you have to cancel all your calls for the afternoon. It's ridiculous. Never saw a movie so tightly planned, so well played, so unforgivingly methodical in its creation of character. The actors, of course, deserve credit.

","Summary<br/><br/>This particular film focuses on the Boston police force and their attempts to infiltrate and destroy an Irish-American Mafia family within the city. Jack Nicholson appears in this film as Frank Costello, the head boss of an organized crime family. A new graduate from the Boston City Police Department, William ""Billy"" Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), goes undercover and infiltrates the crime family in order to build a case against its top members. Billy soon finds out that Frank Costello has someone inside the police force working for him. Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is Frank's informant and holds a position within a Special Investigation Unit. Billy was convinced to go undercover by Capt. Quenan (Martin Sheen) and Staff Sgt. Dignam (Mark Wahlberg). These two agents are the only ones within the police force that know the true identity of William Costigan. Billy works extremely hard in order to build his case against Frank Costello while Colin Sullivan frantically attempts to foil all of Billy's hard work. With the help of Collin, Frank discovers that someone in his crew is working against him. With their lives in danger, the focus for both sides then shifts to discovering each other's informants before their true identities are found out.<br/><br/>Theme<br/><br/>The central theme of this movie revolves around the identity issues that the three main characters faced. William Costigan had a very sketchy background. A few members of his family were involved in organized crime, most of which were dead. He had a lot of resentment towards these members of his family, which may have possibly driven him into police work. In the beginning of this film, he was faced with the difficulty of losing his mother. He gave the impression that he was trying to find himself and he was hoping that the police force would assist him on his journey. William's path was riddled with prescription drug abuse, violent depression, anger and psychological slipping. Next, from the time the Colin Sullivan was a small boy, he longs for a father type figure. He found this in Frank Costello. He was constantly trying to please Frank. Throughout the film, he referred to Mr. Costello as ""Dad."" He was constantly trying to live up to his father figures expectations of him. He wanted acceptance and unfortunately he went looking for it in the wrong person. Frank Costello was a man who knew exactly who he was and did not try to hide it. He was proud of the stature that he achieved and was very boastful of what separated him from most people. He was very forceful with his views, his words, and his actions. Frank was a very violent, sociopathic, and untrustworthy individual. Although an unsavory character, Frank was very sure of whom he was and the direction he wanted his life to go. He believed that he was very in control of his life, his destiny and other people.<br/><br/>This film was very much about good versus evil as well as individuals internal struggles. William and Collin both struggled with internal conflicts. Each chose their own method of dealing with this conflict. Both of these characters sought out who they truly were, but in opposite directions. But Colin and William also shared a similar interest in the same woman, which led to an interesting love triangle throughout this film. Unfortunately, in a twist ending, William and Collin met their fate in order to achieve the initial goal of dismembering/disrupting the crime family.<br/><br/>Take On the Film<br/><br/>This particular film had a modern-day Goodfellas (1990) meets American Gangster (2007) feel to it. There were definitely twists and turns to it they gave it its own unique feel. Martin Scorsese did a phenomenal job with the various editing techniques in order to give this film an upbeat and intense tempo. Through the use of the introductory monologue and various lighting techniques, he set the stage for Frank Costello, his choice mob boss for this film. The Departed was a fairly ordinary and common detective-goes-undercover story. Martin Scorsese sets this film apart from the rest through his phenomenal directing. The plot is thick, filled with constant action and suspense. It culminates to a plateau near the ending and then surprises the viewers with a twist ending.<br/><br/>The two downfalls I observed in this particular film were occasional overacting and ending that seems slightly disappointing. Within a few key scenes in this movie, especially involving William and Frank, it seemed like the actors were trying to be overly convincing of their role. Some of the emotions displayed seemed irrational and had a swing of emotion that seemed unnatural. This film comes to a peak when William Costigan attempts to arrest Colin Sullivan. The viewer finally gets the feel that good is going to triumph over evil. Then it seemed like the story was attempting to surprise and shock everyone and just abruptly ended in a blaze of glory. The entire two hours leading up to the final scenes had the viewer wrapped up in every moment of the plot and then the story just ended in the credits began to roll. This was a very mediocre ending to an otherwise phenomenal film. <br/><br/>Additional notes <br/><br/>An underlying moral of the film is loyalty. After all, the only survivors are Capt. Wllerby (Alec Balwin), who was completely amoral, and staff Sgt. Dingam (Mark Wahlberg), whose rigid sense of right and wrong get him suspended from the force. He then turns into a killer, out of a misguided sense of loyalty to ""the law"", he breaks the law in the film's final scene."
"cbrueggemeyer","10","0","2","21 April 2011"," A Cinematic Masterpiece
","I thought that this movie was extremely good. The action filled plot kept me attentive throughout the whole movie, and the actors played believable roles that helped carry along the movies plot. This movie had many strong points such as directing, cinematography, editing, and the soundtrack. There were a few small weaknesses in the movie that most critics overlook, but the pros outweigh the cons. Overall, I greatly enjoyed this movie, and I think it is one of the best movies of all time. <br/><br/>I thought that the Cinematography and Editing in this movie was very good. The dark, grainy camera shots perfectly describe South Boston, and the different symbolic camera shots, such as the rat crawling across the balcony in the end, make this movie watchable ten times over. The sideways camera zooms on the main characters, like in the scene where Captain Ellerby and Sergeant Dignam are talking back and forth; highlighting the main characters, and making you feel like you are there with the characters. The quick camera flashes during fighting and chase scenes keep your heart rate up during the movie, and they greatly help to keep you interested throughout the movie. The editing in the movie is pretty good, but there were some scenes that seemed unnecessary, like the scene where Costello his talking to his semi-love interest while snorting cocaine. The movie is over an hour and thirty minutes long, which is tough to fit in a single night of movie watching. <br/><br/>The acting in the Departed is excellent. It has a very strong cast, and some new actors that really seem to shine in this movie. It seems like every role in the movie greatly contributes to the movie throughout, and that great detail went into creating every one of these characters. Leonardo DiCaprio plays William Costigan, a bright young detective who wants to be a cop and nothing else. DiCaprio is excellent throughout the movie. He has to master a South and North side of Boston accent, because his character is a cop in the North but an undercover gangster in the South. He perfectly interprets his dark, moody character, and successfully reveals all of the stresses in his role that go with being an undercover agent. I think that it was his best performance since What's Eating Gilbert Grape? and he proves once again why he is regarded as one of the best actors in Hollywood. His performance feels extremely natural, and shows his overall quality as an actor. Another great actor in this movie is Jack Nicholson. Nicholson is an extremely famous actor known for his roles in movies such as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, A Few Good Men, and Chinatown. Nicholson, in my opinion, does the best acting in this movie. Nicholson plays the hardcore gangster Frank Costello, a man who has no moral limits. Nicholson successfully portrays a crazy old guy, and captures the audience with his stellar performance of the role. His witty but dark comedy also makes the movie a lot more enjoyable. Nicholson shows once again why he is one of the best in the business. <br/><br/>The Soundtrack in The Departed is one of the best I have ever heard in my life. Artists such as The Rolling Stones, The Allman Brothers, The Dropkick Murphys, and John Lennon make this movie what it is. One of the best scenes in the movie is where Costigan is riding with Costello and the gang and the song I'm Shipping Up To Boston is playing. This song's traditional Irish sound makes this scene, and other songs like this one help make the movie so wonderful. The Sound Effects in the movie are also brilliant. Sudden crashes and noises during scenes keep the audience alert at all times. Different cell phone rings tell you what character the cell phone belongs to, so you know instantly if that character is in an ordeal. Overall, the sound effects in this movie are great, and they help turn this movie into the masterpiece it is.<br/><br/>The directing in this movie is very good. Martin Scorsese, one of the best directors of all time, masterfully handcrafts this movie into what it is. Many details in this movie make it what it is, and the extreme importance of these details help guide the story. Scorsese once again makes another gangster movie, but he makes this movie so much different from his other movies that you don't even associate it with being a Scorsese movie. This movie has a lot of twist and turns, unlike Scorsese's other movies with very solid, unmoving story lines. One problem I had with the directing of this movie is that Scorsese doesn't do a very good job of creating a love interest within the movie. The main girl in the movie, Sullivan's girlfriend, cheats on Sullivan with Costigan. This scene is very symbolic, but you feel almost no attachment to this woman character. Besides this, Scorsese does a wonderful job portraying the South side of Boston, and makes a wonderful and thrilling movie that gets better every time you watch it."

","I was looking forward to watching this film, how could it fail with such a cast and a great director, well for me it did fail, in fact i came near to turning it off half way through and putting it on the 'reject' pile. So what was the problem? Well for me it was the barrage of unnecessary swearing, F**K, Fu***R, C**T, was all I was hearing in nearly every piece of dialogue. How on earth did 'Madolyn' (Vera Farmiga) fall for 'The Rat' when faced with such a foul mouthed lout. Also Matt Damon and Leonardo Dicaprio look so much alike, and even dress alike, that it is really difficult to tell what is going on, as, unless you are familiar with their work, you keep getting the two characters confused. However i am glad that i stuck it out to the end just for Jack Nickolson who was as flaky and demented as ever, though even he was reduced to saying C**t in every sentence. And the final shot with the rat...well that was unnecessary and cheap. I will certainly watch it again to see if it improves with age. In the meantime i am going back to watch 'Goodfellas' again."
"fidelio7","8","0","1","1 January 2011"," 'Someone had to die. With me it tends to be the other guy'
","'The Departed' is an excellent film. Director Martin Scorsese, who won the Best Director Academy Award for this movie, has assembled an incredible ensemble cast headed by Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, and Jack Nicholson. I can not praise DiCaprio's work enough; as an actor he just gets better and better. It seems that he has become Scorsese's latest muse, a role filled in past years by Robert De Niro. Everyone acts up a storm, actually, and Vera Farmiga is especially good as Madolyn, who forms a bizarre love triangle with Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon).<br/><br/>Billy Costigan is an ambitious young Boston cop who goes undercover in order to infiltrate a criminal fraternity headed by the charismatic and philosophical Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). At the same time, Frank has a mole working for him inside the Boston Police Department in the person of Colin Sullivan. Colin tips off Costello whenever the latter is about to be busted, allowing Frank to stay one step ahead of the cops. So Billy must uncover Colin's identity while Colin is trying to uncover Billy's. Cue a breathless and mesmerizing flick, filled with intrigue and numerous close calls.<br/><br/>First rate support is offered by Ray Winstone as Mr. French, Costello's right hand man. Winstone does not even have to open his mouth - his physical presence is intimidating enough as it is. And Mark Wahlberg (as the profane Staff Sgt. Dignam), Martin Sheen (Cpt. Queenan), and Alec Baldwin (Capt. Ellerby) round out the cast, while it is great to see Anthony Anderson in a serious role as Brown. Anderson proves here that he can do more than just comedy.<br/><br/>Nicholson is great as always, and he is pretty frightening and totally believable as the crime overlord. This is another triumph for Scorsese and, while it is perhaps not quite up to the standard of 'Goodfellas', it is still highly recommended viewing."
"jake-law123","10","0","2","23 December 2010"," Hands down best crime drama ever!
","Scorsese's all time best film ever made says nothing. This is one of the best directed, acted, produced, and written films made period. Scorsese never fails to impress us, and proves it greatly in this. An all out full cast: Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlburg, Alec Baldwin...the list goes on.<br/><br/>A lot of people compare this to the Asian 2002 classic ""Infernal Affairs"" with it's identical story. This film not only tells it better, but does it better in general. This film includes some of the best performances iv'e ever seen in movies. Every role is convincing as it can be, and every second keeps you on edge until the very end.<br/><br/>The story starts out simple, but quickly goes into complex situations that will have you on the edge of your seat. The film takes place in Boston, Massachusetts, where Irish Mob boss Francis ""Frank"" Costello plants Colin Sullivan as an informant within the Massachusetts State Police. Simultaneously, the police assign undercover cop William ""Billy"" Costigan to infiltrate Costello's crew. When both sides realize the situation, each man attempts to discover the other's true identity before his own cover is blown. Not only a clever story, but it stretches the idea of story telling to incredible boundaries.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is without a doubt the most underrated performance ever. I honestly think he should have gotten an Oscar, but his highest achievement was a Golden Globe nomination. He's good in the entire movie, but his true performance begins when he starts working with Costello. He becomes psychologically tortured by watching all these innocent lives being tortured by the Irish mob, and by the fact that any minute, his cover could be blown and he could die at any moment. His performance dragged me into the film so much, that I felt so bad for him to the point where I almost cried. Not really, but I felt like it. Everyone else is amazing also, but I think Leo's performance truly puts you in the position of a tortured soul. Jack Nicholson is hilarious as Costello. He's ruthless and violent, but keeps his cool when he needs to. Obviously he's the bad guy, so Leo is always on edge when he's around him. Then when Costello is acting goofy, Leo doesn't know what to do. He pretty much acts like a standard mob boss...having no worries in the world, wanting money and sex. Matt Damon is pretty interesting to watch, because he actually starts to work like an actual cop and help track down Costello, as if he changed sides. Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlburg pretty much work as a group. They're the only ones that know William is undercover, so they pretty much have to babysit him the whole time. Wahlburg is a huge prick in this film, but trust me when I say by the end of this film, you'll love him. But what I don't like is that out of all the amazing performances in this film...He's the only one who gets an Oscar nomination. Really? Out of all those, you chose him? I'm not saying it's not good, but Leo's was way better, I think they all should have gotten one, and if just one, then Leo. I don't get what the Academy liked some much about Mark's performance, but I have to say it's a little overrated. Martin Sheen has a pretty good character. Since Costigan's dad is dead, Sheen treats him like a son, and becomes a father figure. Alec Baldwin is just there for laughs in my opinion...that's about it. Oh, and you got the cop shrink who starts dating Damon, then dating Costigan. She's all right, but she's not all that important.<br/><br/>The film combines itself well with comedy. It knows when to be serious, and can be pretty hilarious at times. The funniest performances are probably Baldwin and Nicholson. Oh, and as far as dialogue goes, as long as you constantly say the ""F"" word, you pretty much filled in half the script. Not even joking. Too many of them to count.<br/><br/>I don't how to describe how brilliant this film is. Scorsese is a mastermind, and knows exactly how to please me every single second, (no homo) If you haven't seen this...SEE IT RIGHT AWAY! It is without a doubt the best crime drama film ever.

"TOMASBBloodhound","8","0","1","1 November 2010"," Its no Goodfellas, but it will keep you entertained.
","Thankfully Martin Scorcese returned to the contemporary street crime genre in 2006 after some showy epics like Gangs of New York and The Aviator that sort of disappointed. You couldn't ask for a better cast in this fast-moving tale of the Boston underworld and those intending to take it down or keep it going in perpetuity. The primary characters are Matt Damon as a corrupt MA State Police big shot who has acts as an inside man for a ruthless gangster (Jack Nicholson), and Leonardo Di Capprio as an undercover cop working in Nicholson's street crew. Damon tips Nicholson off about the cops' every move, and DiCapprio keeps the police up on the gang's dealings. The plot isn't difficult to follow, and most of the action is punctuated by gunfire and cell phone usage. Though it isn't a high tech thriller, it depends on our current wireless technology and telecommunication laws.<br/><br/>There are a lot of characters to keep track of from the countless police big shots to the scores of low-level street thugs. Also both primary characters are romancing the same psychologist. There is a lot of inter-lapping between good and bad. And most of the people are either flawed or the complete personification of evil. Nicholson's Frank Costello character is perhaps too evil to be taken seriously. Apparently he was allowed to improvise some of the more bizarre behavior we see on camera. If anything, Nicholson physically looks like actor Rip Torn in any of his recent mugshots. The acting is uniformly excellent, with some of the older characters shinning in their smaller roles. Honestly, have either Alec Baldwin or Martin Sheen even been more believable? Damon has grown into quite a talented actor. Dicapprio has been worse, but one still has to wonder why Scorcese won't make a movie without the guy anymore. The only major weakness is with the plotting. We never really do get a true feeling for Dicapprio's motivation. Why does he agree so readily to put himself at such a risk going undercover in Nicholson's gang? Is it to honor his dead father who was the only honest man in the old neighborhood? Or was it for a handsome tax-free payday? Did we ever learn how much he was getting paid? Even with a head shrinker assigned to him, we still never learn that much about the guy. Anyway, this film is too entertaining to let a couple of plot holes (including a ludicrously violent last five minutes) bog it down. It is thoroughly entertaining, and you will probably love every minute of it. 8 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."

","As for anything 'deeper,' in a film like this one cannot really dig into issues like cultural identity, or masculinity and violence, because, while they are there, they are there at such a superficial level (as opposed to, say, the same theme of violence in Taxi Driver or Raging Bull, explored at a far deeper level). On a technical level, the film does employ music well, and the film succeeds with its many quick cuts, even if more longer paced scenes should have been interspersed to let the actors truly act and cogitate on their lives, beyond the overacting DiCaprio does on Fermiga's couch. Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus does his usual competent job, especially in the retro look of some scenes, which open and close with irises.<br/><br/>The two disk DVD, by Warner Brothers, is naturally bloated. There are not enough extras to need a second disk, and furthermore, for a two disk set, they commit the ultimate crime: no film commentary by Scorsese nor any of the leads. There are nine deleted scenes prefaced by Scorsese's reasons for omission, a profile called Scorsese On Scorsese, a documentary on the criminal this film was based upon: Boston crime kingpin, James 'Whitey' Bulger, a documentary on what influenced Scorsese's crime films, and the theatrical trailer. Solid stuff, but for two disks, more- especially an audio commentary, should be standard issue. But, were the movie better, the gripes re: the DVD package would be minimal.<br/><br/>As it is, The Departed is good Hollywood fluff, yet, given that it's Scorsese, more is expected, although I have the sinking feeling that, like Woody Allen, he will never produce another masterpiece. This film follows a standard cops and crooks formula, which, in and of itself, is not a bad thing- consider the 1997 crime masterpiece, L.A. Confidential. The difference is that where that film took a genre formula and twisted it from pulp melodrama into real drama, via the writing and performances, as well as ending the film with a satisfying twist that was unexpected in the small, even if expected in the large (the good guys won), The Departed does the inverse, never rising above melodrama (even if good), and ending the film with a bad twist, of the worst deus ex machina sort. If you watch the film, don't expect much of an aesthetic not intellectual rush, only some mildly entertaining moments, crafted really well. If you want the former, go watch some earlier films from the Scorsese canon. Unfortunately, given his recent output, that last line was also likely seen coming from a mile away."

","The Departed is in my opinion one of Martin Scorsese's best films yet (tied with Goodfellas). Along with The Godfather it is one of the best crime films of all time.<br/><br/>The Departed begins with showing Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) as a kid. Sullivan is accepted by Boston crime-lord Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). The movie then jumps to Sullivan graduating the police academy. In the meantime, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) plays as a young undercover cop trying to infiltrate Costello's organization.<br/><br/>As Costigan moves closer to Costello, gaining his personal trust, Sullivan is promoted into the Special Investigations Unit. Costello fears he might have a rat in his group, while the Police Chief also believes there is a leak in the Special Investigations Unit. This provides plenty of tension for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Even though The Departed uses the 'f' word more than 236 times in the script, and is rated R for bloody violence and some sex, this film still managed to get several Oscar nominations and wins. The Departed won Best Picture, Best Director (Martin Scorsese), Best Film Editing and Best Adapted Screenplay.<br/><br/>I think that The Departed deserves every one of those awards. This film is simply brilliant, I loved it. Leonardo DiCaprio is an amazing actor and once again shows this with another great performance. He is very believable as a cop who's so screwed he's in with the bad guys. DiCaprio shows a wide variety of emotions including anger, fear, hate, desperation and some slight charm.<br/><br/>However, Matt Damon is the more charming guy in this picture. His character begins the film as if he rules the world. He's moving up in the police force and he's gaining cash from informing his friend Costello. His personal relationships also begin to evolve as he moves in with an attractive therapist. By the end of the film, Sullivan is so worried he will be found, and is worried the police might find Costello, he begins yelling at people and losing his cool. Matt Damon also puts on a great accent for this role which fits the part of his Irish character (even though he is from Boston).<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson once again demonstrates that he can play the creepy crime lord perfectly. If you need an example watch the scene where he talks to DiCaprio about the rat in his group. Martin Scorsese has hit another home run movie, and has returned to his familiar genre of crime-drama. This film is a must-see, and perhaps the best film of 2006."

","So put together one of the best directors ever if not the best, then put some amazing actors, then add an amazing story and yo will have The Departed. Dicaprio show in this movie why he is one of the biggest actors in this time, probably his second most impressive performance (after The Aviator) Nicholson is also amazing, but honestly Wahlberg steals the show as agent Dignam he's funny , clever and an ice cold son of a $%&$%. The story is quite simply, the police has an agent inside the Mafia, and the Mafia has a guy inside the Police. Maybe this is some kind of clichÃ© inside the movies, however the best thing of The Departed it's not the story, not the sideplots, this movie is all about performances and how well timed the movie is. All the movie is fast, violent and surprising at the same time, this is probably the best 00's movie and if you consider yourself a movie fan, this is a must-see."

","You can easily argue that Martin Scorsese is one of the best directors to ever offer his work to the cinematic world and the fact that the Departed was his first Oscar is a shame to us all. Personally he should have won 4 already, Taxi Driver Raging Bull Goodfellas & Aviator (you could also make a case for Gangs of New York), but we have to accept that he did earn it rightfully so w/ Departed. DiCaprio was easily snubbed from a Best Actor nom. as was Nicholson. Apart from Chinatown, this was Jack's best performance (I didn't care for Cuckoo's Nest if that's what you're wondering). But what I enjoy about Departed is the fact that since most famous gangster movies, Godfather & Goodfellas, take place in the past but Scorsese makes the up to date gangster flick very enjoyable.

He's made some good films since then but nothing of the calibre of his earlier collaborations with De Niro. Here Leonardo Di Caprio, one of the best actors working at the moment, gives an outstanding performance making Costigan's guilt and inner conflict completely convincing. Billy Costigan starts off as a police officer in the Boston Police Department, but he apparently washes out, has a spell in prison before joining the ranks of the Irish mob run by Frank Costello.<br/><br/>Costigan is in fact a mole in Costello's organisation and in a quite brilliant concept, taken from the original version of this film Infernal Affairs, Costello has a mole in the police department, Colin Sullivan. Matt Damon's performance as Sullivan is almost the equal of Di Caprio's creating another great character.<br/><br/>They're not the only two, Jack Nicholson gives perhaps the best performance of the film as the mob boss Frank Costello, he's obviously having a great time here by turns funny, furious and psychotic. De Niro was originally down to play this role but due to his directorial effort The Good Shepherd it wasn't possible and Nicholson stepped in. I for one am glad, De Niro, one of the greatest actors whose ever lived despite the awful films he's been churning out in the last 10 or 15 years, can't possibly have matched the intensity, charisma and sheer brilliance that Nicholson brought to Costello.<br/><br/>To discuss the plot any further would be to spoil it, but suffice to say it is rather brilliant and there are many changes if you have seen Infernal Affairs, it is altogether a more complex affair. The supporting actors Mark Wahlberg, Vera Farmiga, Martin Sheen and Ray Winstone all give stellar performances that help make The Departed one of the best films of the decade."

","The Departed is a Martin Scorsese's film,where once again the greatness of this director is proved.Leonardo DiCaprio is obviously his unspoken muse which i respect completely.Anyone who says that Leonardo is just a pretty face with no acting skills,has no clue about movies or actors.His magnificent performance is going to leave you with your mouth open and probably will make fall of your chair.I put this movie along with ""Usual Suspects"" as one of the greatest thrillers ever made. The story follows two policeman working for or against the government.If you think the story is already seen,think again.Scorsese manages to develop intriguing and unpredictable history of movies. Every character is prepared and worked out with great amount of dedication and hard work.Jack Nicholson (you can love him or not ) but his craziness and eccentricity work unbelievably in this motion picture.A role of a mafia boss is so suitable for him,that afterward you won't be able to picture him differently. I must say,Matt Daemon is not my favorite actor,but this is the movie where i changed my opinion.He is brilliant! The music is amazing.You will hear great Irish sounds mixed with a dose of hard rock which suits the movie perfectly. Martin Sheen is another perfect contribution to this movie making it complete and amazing.Still,my favorite character in this movie remains Mark Wahlberg that will ""wow"" you with his extraordinary performance and great,funny,but meaningful dialogs. This movie does deserve to win not one,not four but many Oscars and to find its place in the ""best movies of all times"" list ! One of the greatest movies ever ! A true masterpiece and definitely a must see !"

","After years of rejection one of the greatest filmmakers in history won his well-earned Oscar for The Departed. Martin Scorsese, could, and should have won for Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Casino or Gangs of New York, but he has at least avoid being in the ranks of great directors who never won an Oscar like Stanley Kubrick and Alfred Hitchcock. The Departed is based on a brilliant Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs, which was itself was attempting to be a Hollywood thriller. Seeing that Infernal Affairs was a brilliant film which had two good sequels Plan B Entertainment did the wisest thing it could, get the best writer and director available, William Monahan and of course Scorsese.<br/><br/>South Boston is a famously Irish Catholic area of America, it's underworld is run by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), a ruthless gangster who gets up to usual activities like drugs trafficking, extortion, theft, etc... He recruits a boy who trains to be a police officer, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon); who becomes his mole within the Massachusetts State Police. Another recruit was Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), a young man whom family is notoriously dodgy. He gets recruited by Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Staff Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg in his best performance) to go deep undercover and infuriate Costello's organisation. So the mob and police have moles in each other, and both men raise up the ranks within their organisations. Sullivan does well for himself, joining a special unit, making money, has a good apartment need the state building and forms a relationship with Dr. Madolyn Madden (Vera Farmiga). Whilst Costigan has to deal with the stress of being undercover, having live in a violence world, deal with the enforcer Mr. French (Ray Winstone) and has to see Madolyn. Both the mob and the police discover they have moles in their organisations and a deadly cat and mouse develops as the two men have to find out who the other is.<br/><br/>These is an excellent remake, translating the setting well to America. It keeps the basic plot of Infernal Affairs, adding a few elements from Infernal Affairs 2, but Scorsese and Monahan ensure that they make their own film: an excellent thriller, not just about crime and police investigation, but about the ideas of identity, betrayal and the psychological strain this world would have on a person. Both the mob and the police are very macho worlds where people need to be tough to survive. These are complex characters in a difficult world, where loyalties can be made and broken. Scorsese and Monahan also tells a complex plot with a number of things going on. It is a film about the conflict between the police and organised crime. Scorsese also shows his skill behind the camera once again, showing some excellent images and a world of violence. He brings you into this complex world.<br/><br/>They is a great cast in this film, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen. As stated, Mark Wahlberg was in his best role and could have won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor: a shame he torched it all in 2008. There is also a good comic moment between Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin. Vera Farmiga also shows her talent and is now doing pretty well for herself.<br/><br/>2006 was an excellent year for film: The Departed, Casino Royale, Children of Men, Pan's Labyrinth, The Lives of Others, The Last King of Scotland, Letters from Iwo Jima, all worthy films that could have won awards at the 79th Academy Awards."

","Well, I am just after seeing the title page and was quite shocked to see that the reviewer on show had stated that Martin Scorses's 2006 crime thriller The Departed was the directors finest.<br/><br/>Wrong. Very wrong. I'll admit, this film is very impressive in a lot of aspects. It does tick a lot of the boxes. It has some of Hollywood's finest giving admirable performances, mainly Jack Nicholsen as Frank Costello and Mark Wahlberg as the tough but strong-minded staff Sergeant Dignam. <br/><br/>In addition, it boasts an on-form Di Caprio as the undercover cop Billy Costigan, who infiltrates the mob syndicate run by boss Costello (Nicholsen), and Matt Damon as Colin Sullivan who turns out to be the rat as the story unravels.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, this film fails to live up to the towering standards firmly set by Raging Bull, one of the most poignantly powerful films of all time with an unstoppable performance by De Niro, whom I believe to be much more effective in collaboration with Scorses than Di Caprio. Along with Bull, Goodfellas is arguably the greatest gangster film of all time and Taxi Driver is what made a star out of Scorses and De Niro. <br/><br/>However, this is a dignified effort by Scorsese and his production team and welcome return to form on the back of the monumentally long-winded Gangs of New York (2002) and Aviator (2004) which was decent but slow in parts, lacked authentic characterisation and was similar to Gangs of New York in the sense that it was unnecessarily long. No thanks, I prefer Scorses's earlier work as it is these films mentioned in the previous paragraph that provide a real insight into the particular topics. Raging Bull depicts the highs and lows of Boxing and Goodfellas' portrays the consequences of shamefully living life as a high-rolling, murdering mafia favourite. <br/><br/>Despite this, Scorsese delivers a good film, an enjoyable watch that kept me compelled until the end. I thought that Jack Nicholsen, possibly the finest actor of all time, was brilliant as Jack Costello and enjoyed the turns of Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen and Ray Winstone as Mr. French. <br/><br/>I would highly recommend The Departed to anyone. It is intense, gripping and full of top-notch performance from a roll-call of Hollywood's finest past and present. However, if you are not familiar with the works of Martin Scorsese, I urge you to watch his true accomplishments. Taxi Driver (1976), Raging Bull (1980) and Goodfellas (1990) are probably the most intoxicating and wildly entertaining hat-trick of films your ever likely to see!<br/><br/>8/10"
"khanbaliq2","9","0","4","5 February 2010"," Legendary director Martin Scorsese takes the helm for this tale of questionable loyalties and blurring identities set in the South Boston organized crime scene.
","The Departed is director Martin Scorsese's most purely enjoyable film in years, but it's not for the faint of heart because it's rude, bleak, violent and defiantly un-PC. A young criminal (Matt Damon) is ordered by a Boston mobster (Jack Nicholson) to operate undercover within the state police, while a young cop (Leonardo DiCaprio) infiltrates the mobster's gang.<br/><br/>Scorsese has made half a dozen better films, but finally he has his Oscar and Academy voters have spared their own blushes. Yet this is worth the plaudits: a great crime thriller with a deft, relentless plot that grips throughout. It vastly improves the 2003 Hong Kong thriller Internal Affairs, clarifying a complex story and adding subtlety to characters. Scorsese coaxes superlative work from his actors: DiCaprio and Damon are at their peak, Mark Wahlberg is a real surprise in a relatively minor role, and Nicholson's profanely funny mobster Frank Costello marks his best work in years. Superbly staged set-pieces add to the film's visceral appeal; it's both a hoot and kick in the guts."

","Well entertaining cop thriller from Martin Scorsese with one of the best casts of all time. Although way way below par for Scorsese, 'The Departed' is worth a look if only to see Jack Nicholson in action once more (he's flawless, as per usual).<br/><br/>Matt Damon is the rat working for Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio is the rat working for the cops and to top it all off, they're both bedding the same woman. So far, so good. My only sever gripe with the movie comes from the music. I don't mind directors choosing their own soundtrack for their films but with a thriller like this it really needs an orchestral score. A real good suspenseful soundtrack would improve it at no end. I found myself wondering whether some scenes were meant to be thrilling or comedic. Perhaps we needed something more conventional?<br/><br/>Hmm. Make your own mind up. See it."

The fact that it was a remake also impinged. Looking at the deprated now though one of the first things to stand out is the quality of the cast. Great actors turning in top shelf performances bar none. It might be the last great Nicholson performance as well. Leonardo is excellent and Ray Winstone shines. The narratiive itself drives forward and is pleasingly complex - it fills up the long runing time well. There is no shortage of brilliant individual scenes either. It surely has the best bravura opening of any Scorsese film - 18 mins before a title. I realize I am frothing, I just love this film and it seems to be aging like a fine wine.

","The Departed is a Scorsese film that should win the director a well deserved Oscar. A major theme in the film could be said to be one of the oldest in film. It is the concept of identity and how it affects one's emotions, dreams and even actions.<br/><br/>This is a film that is set in South Boston where a well known Irish mob boss by the name of Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), uses Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) as an informant inside the Massachusetts State Police. At the same time, the police assign undercover cop Billy Costigan Jr, (Leonardo DiCaprio) to try and join Costello's organization. Once both sides of the law figure out what is happening both Sullivan and Costigan try to find out each others true identity before being found out.<br/><br/>There is one scene in which Costello is at the Opera. The camera is looking up at Costello and his two female companions. The lighting in the scene is red and low key giving us the impression that Costello is the devil preparing for his emotional wrath. As I watch this scene I am reminded of a scene in Pretty Women in which Richard Gere hires a working girl from the street played by Julia Roberts buys here nice clothes and makeup before taking her to the opera. Once at the opera the camera is using the same angle looking up at Gere and Roberts but this time the lighting is high key which gives the audience the illusion of Roberts being a beautiful and emotional princess.<br/><br/>As I watch the film, I discover an interesting motif happening in the film. It is one of a father-and-son relationship. We find Costello trying to be a father figure to both Sullivan and Costigan; Sullivan evening referring to Costello as ""dad"" in a phone conversation and a little further in the film Sergeant Queenon (Martin Sheen) acting as a father-figure-to Costigan. <br/><br/>In the final shot Scorsese allows us to see the true identity of Sullivan. The shot is framed with curtains as the audience looks out through a window. On the other side of the window we see two things. The State Building which reminds us of what Sullivan wanted out of life and that is to be a lawyer. The second thing which shows us what Sullivan had really become a rat. On a broader note the State Building is a pillar of stability and the rat is a mobile gutter dwelling creature that will take what ever it can to survive."

Jack Nicholson gives us, as always, the existence only by being seated or walking. Matt Damon is unchanged, but does not remind us of Jason Bourne. Scorsese never gives us a moment to be bored or to go to restroom. I only felt that the ending is a little bit rough, and but even people who usually dislike violence in films like me could concentrate on this film till the end. This is one of the ""better to see"" films. I personally look forward to the future of Vera Farmiga, who seems to show us completely different faces and personalities in other films from now on.

","The original Hong Kong film ""Infernal Affairs"" was a cerebral tour-de-force, packed with enough original ideas to give you a sensory overload. What it lacked was polish and cinematic intensity. Imagine having an almost revolutionary script, but not enough cinematic resources to take your ideas and vision to their apex. What the script needed was precisely the sledgehammer Scorsese method, but with the emphasis on ideas rather than actors. The new screenplay, despite literally stealing every single good idea (entire scenes and even lines of dialog) from IA, manages to be distinct & original in its own right, by altering characterizations, adding some much-needed humor and expanding the scope of the tale. The story rises from a mere cat-&-mouse chase to a universal human drama. Combined with Thelma Schoonmaker's crisp, rapier-sharp editing, the film as a whole is worthy.<br/><br/>Essentially there is much more clarity here as regards psychology and motives. Its much darker, more savage, brutal, corrupt and harrowing. To their credit they've studied the original film very, very carefully, and the ideas that the original merely touched on have been more fully fleshed-out and emphasized. The director's method earlier involved focusing the camera completely on ""strong"" actors like De Niro and Pesci, so that the world would emerge FROM the characters rather than vice versa. This is different. Here too we have strong, indeed savage and nefarious individuals, but the film's focus is on motives and ideas. The blurring of identity, the illusion of loyalty and trust, the reckless moment-to-moment nature of modern life ; all these notions become transparently clear. The humor, the vicious cat-&-mouse game, the ideas and idea-characters reach a near-Dostoevskian pitch of intensity and violence. Its awesome.<br/><br/>The screenplay improves on the original with some ingenious alterations that heighten the loss of identity and solidity. It merges the two women characters (what if the psychiatrist's hubby was the gangster-spy ?). And it adds a triple-twist by making the lead gangster himself an FBI ""mole"". I interpreted the ending as follows : the ""good"" guy dies instantaneously, without the consciousness of death. He dies quickly & painlessly. The ""bad"" guy, conversely, accepts his death consciously. In a sense he kills himself, he accepts his moral/psychological defeat as final. Again, this resembles the life-arcs of the characters of Dostoevsky and Kafka.<br/><br/>Both the remake and the original are superb, each in its own right. Most people who were blown away by the remake first will not find the original film so thrilling. Its a cognitive thing, kind of like the differences between The Matrix and Dark City : whichever one you watch first, you will naturally like that one better."

Their lives cross on opposite sides of the law, as one tries to bring Costello to justice and the other tries to prevent that by any means possible.<br/><br/>It's a movie about lies and deception, filled with blood, guts, and profanity. Living in secrecy takes a toll on the mental states of Costigan and Sullivan, both portrayed well by Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon. But without a doubt, Jack Nicholson as Costello is the best, being truly scary and delivering his lines with a menacing authenticity. The supporting cast is excellent, too, with Ray Winstone giving a standout performance as Costello's tough right-hand man.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese's direction is as skillful as ever, with every scene being great to look at and the actors playing their roles flawlessly. The deeper the moles go, the more he ratchets up the suspense. The sky-high tension ensures The Departed is one of the most effective crime pictures of recent years.<br/><br/>But the effectiveness is diminished a bit by a minor flaw. The ending is nothing more than a bunch of people shooting each other in the end.

","I've seen the film only once, which is not quite enough to catch some crucial details about the father at the beginning. But the film is essentially a frantic gangster send-up like ""Goodfellas"" plus Hamlet with a theological twist: it's the search for identity and for the father, which are essentially the same thing. It's also a film in which DiCaprio is no longer seen as a mere teenager or, recalling Spielberg's leaden caper film, where Sheen is more caricature than believable character. <br/><br/>There's a scene in the film between DiCaprio and Nicholson during which I was conscious for the first time that the former could hold his own--as a mature, believable, adult actor--and with the very best of them. And what a crucial scene that turns out to be. In this modern-day ""Hamlet"" tale about a young man's desperate search for identity, he gains it--threefold-- and just at the moment we're convinced he's lost everything. In the film's last incredibly tense, head-spinning moments, we learn that 1. DiCaprio rather than Matt Damon is the trusted ""son"" of the mafia father figure played by Nicholson (Damon's character rejects outright the sentimental notion of being a ""son"" to Nicholson); 2. we are assured that DiCapio's identity is not lost when Mark Wahlberg's character, as a surrogate for Martin Sheen's character which, in turn, is a surrogate father to DiCaprio's, shows up to dispose of the impostor; 3.finally, the deal is triply ""clinched"" at our realization that the father of the baby being borne by Madolyn is not Damon's but DiCaprio's. <br/><br/>The line from ""Hamlet"" that's recited is ""Readiness is all."" But life, Scorsese, seems to be saying, is far more unpredictable and ludicrous, far more messy than this: none of us is ever ready (Nicholson's line to the effect that ""we're all dying"" suggests as much), and DiCaprio's character seems the least ready of all. Yet in the midst of all the violence and bloodshed, and despite all the lunacy and confusion, justice and clarity win out after all. This is, in many respects, the film befitting a mature, or ""senior,"" director, who is moreover a man of faith. Unlike Coppola's fascination with the ""humanness"" of mafia families, Scorsese seems more interested in the ""humanity"" of these unsaintly, fallen prodigals who come to symbolize us all: they represent the universal human condition in all its absurdity and hope for redemption. For Scorsese they, no less than all of us, must not be consigned outright to the circle of the eternally damned. Even in their twisted, misguided, and confused relations, fathers and sons manage to find one another, mothers produce the sons by the fathers they truly love, the identity that is at once so elusive and questionable emerges after all--there's no question about its being a human identity and there's even a possibility that it retains much that is holy, emanating from a supreme father who ultimately pilots this ship of violent fools to a peaceful end."

It also possesses very good dialogues and several final turns that you/they leave without encouragement. As for the address there is little to say: Scorsese in pure state.

Leonardo Dicaprio is no longer alone a beautiful face that he/she sells portfolios and posters (it already demonstrated it in ""The aviator""), but a great actor that is overcome to if same for moments. Of Matt Damon one can say that he/she has carried out the best interpretation in their career (neither he/she has made big things) and of Jack Nicholson, good, everybody knows that Jack Nicholson plays in another different league... simply formidable, an actor to which you/they don't affect him the years.

So if you are willing to sit through over 2 hours to get to it, (which i am certain you will), you should see what i mean.<br/><br/>Overall this film is nothing short of epic. Don't even think about giving it a miss."

","The Departed is certainly classic Scorsese. Who'd thought that his movies today, can still live up to the standards as his others during his famous run from the 70s to the 90s. The movie has an all-star cast (Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson & Mark Wahlberg), followed by terrific acting, cinematography, music and dialog. It's a top notch suspense that keeps you hanging until the very end which does deliver on all defiant bases. Scorsese defiantly deserved the Academy Award for Best Director, as the movie claimed Best Picture. There was no better movie in 2006 then The Departed. Who would think after twenty years that Scorsese still has so much to deliver. A very suspenseful, highly entertaining piece of work. A must-see for each movie fan."

Scoresease always does things like this. But he just went overboard here. Combining three films into 150 minutes. Now that is way way squashed, everything is always around. I found that Infernal Affairs was a far far better movie. The acting was very very good here but that couldn't save this film.

","Long and hard-hitting police thriller-drama by Scorsese is not without its share of flaws, but remains an immensely enjoyable film. The acting is generally very good, though Nicholson occasionally lapses into caricature. Leo is surely the pick of the cast with his growing sense of desperation very well depicted. Damon is good but a bit flat in a couple of scenes. Baldwin and Wahlberg are both great. The film is long but gripping. One major nitpick with the film: the fate of Leo and some other characters is so suddenly decided, its almost farcical! Still, a good watch.<br/><br/>Overall 8/10"

","This movie has just about all that you need for a great crime drama. It has a great cast, and an intriguing story. In my opinion this is Scorsese's best.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't have a lot of action, but it proves that that is not necessary for a good story, it keeps you thinking throughout and has great character development. It is also great how it spans the genres as it starts out as a drama, then takes a lot more focus on the crime and in the last 30-45 minutes it becomes a thriller.<br/><br/>What is also great about this movie is that it stays real, while other movies stick to predictable Hollywood clichés. Jack Nicholson is fantastic as Frank Costello a mob boss, the character is very necessary to the movement of the story as most of the drama takes place in trying to get to him. He does not have the screen time of Di Caprio or Damon but he is a very great presence and you will enjoy every moment he is on screen. He also has a fantastic monologue at the start. Di Caprio is great as the main protagonist Billy Costagin who is told to infiltrate the mob. He is not your average hero as he suffers from anxiety problems caused by the pressure of the job. Damon is good as Colin Sullivan a smooth, high achieving cop with connections to the mob. I was not blown away by his performance, but it is the best role i have seen him in.<br/><br/>This movie portrays the environment of Boston very well and makes you feel that everyone knows each other in the neighborhood as a few characters might mention someone minor in one scene and then in the next a different character mentions the same minor character.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely deserving of it's awards and as far as I'm concerned is my favourite of the best picture winners as. i do not usually care for other ones as the critics often make a mistake, but there was certainly no mistake here."

"BigBirdtheBum","10","0","2","27 November 2008"," Not quite as good as Scorsese's finest such as; ""Goodfellas"" and ""Taxi Driver"", but it comes damn close
","""The Departed"" was the first Scorsese film I ever saw and I loved every minute of it. ""The Departed"" is not quite as good as Scorsese's finest such as; ""Goodfellas"" and ""Taxi Driver"", but it comes damn close and more than deserved the best picture of 2006. Out of all the Scorsese films I have had the pleasure of seeing; this one has the ""most plot"". Where as ""gangs of New York"" focused on changing relationships between characters and ""Taxi Driver"" with the crashing mind of a mentally unstable man, ""The Departed"" focuses primarily on the police force attempting to take down a local mobster Costello (Jack Nicholson). Both opposing factions attempt to out smart the other by using rats or moles. One of Costello's crew Colin (Mat Damon) is sent into the police force in order to assist Costello, to attempt to eliminate the threat of him being incarcerated. At the same time a special branch of the police force consisting of Mark Wahlberg as Dignam and Martin Sheen as Queenan, persuade a recruit (due to his background with the Irish Mafia); into ""joining"" Costellos crew and rating him out. Tension builds between the two opposing forces and police and mobsters alike meet their brutal ends, as the two ""rats"" attempt to find each other out.<br/><br/>""The Departed"" has all the elements off a classic- the most apparent being a great cast. Scorsese lines up Jack Nicholson, Mat Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen and chucks them in a mob movie, and every single one of them gives a damned good performance, perhaps the must surprising being Wahlberg's. Now Wahlberg hasn't exactly given brilliant performances throughout this career as an actor but his performance of the antisocial cop Dignam really stands out in the film. Wahlberg claims he based his performance off police who arrested him as a child, and hence he is able to portray a believable character with emotions and who never appears to be the good guy, or the bad guy. Instead Wahlberg floats between the two, despite his good intentions he at times, (particularly when he first meets William) seems quite unpleasant and rude. His interactions that occur with William later in the film seem to generate drama and conflict between the police force, which creates a rather interesting diversion from cops Vs mobsters. At least twice in the film Dignam cracks it at two police officers (William and Colin) and attacks them. His emotions leading up to the attacks are rather intriguing, Wahlberg doesn't overact at all instead he responds to the situation how everyday people would.<br/><br/>Despite displaying an excellent performance I personally felt the best performance belonged to DiCaprio. I was absolutely mesmerised seeing DiCaprio's character (William) attitude towards being a rat change. At first he was not very reluctant and willing to hang around mobsters, but towards the end he became scared for his very life. This pivotal change in his mental status result him attempting a variety of methods, to convince Costello that he is not a rat. All of his attempts are rather intriguing to watch as viewers have no idea whether Costello will fall for the ploy, or simply kill him. This unpredictability actively engages the audience into the movie, and ultimately they become quite surprised at the outcome.<br/><br/>The structure of the plot is also another standout point of the picture. Despite cramming a complex plot licked to smaller subplots, Scorsese somehow avoids the film seeming too slow. Every seen serves a purpose; some of the scenes advance the plot where as others such as conversations between characters allow for aspects of someone's personality to be shown. For example towards the end of the film; Costello becomes increasingly paranoid of being arrested by the police and several scenes indicate his paranoia. Perhaps the rather interesting structure of the plot was assisted by the editing. Now a few people criticise the editing in the film, the films editing occurs suddenly as to waste no time (due to the need to contain a lot in the film). If a conversation of a meeting for example serves no purpose in regards to plot or characters it ends; and we enter another scene which builds up tension or plot. Now this also achieves in making the movie seem to have a smaller runtime, than it actually does. Instead of looking at your watch (as even the best of us do in a long movie) you will be glued to the screen. And really you should, there is so much in this movie even a bathroom break could ruin the experience- so keep that in mind watching the film.<br/><br/>Overall ""The Departed"" is a modern masterpiece and definitely ranks amongst Scorsese's best films. ""The Departed"" is not as good as ""Goodfellas"" and ""Taxi Driver"" in my opinion for one reason; and that is ""The Departed"" does lack involvement of characters other than the leads. This is quite a minor flaw but it does make the film seem less intelligent as Scorsese's other classics, but still most people will overlook this and enjoy every minute of the film. ""The Departed"" receives an 8.8/10 for me and more than deserved best picture of 2006. Additionally a warning to some people, like most of Scorsese's films there is a quite a bit of violence in the film, mainly in the form of gunshot murders. So keep that in mind for anyone below 14 (and besides anyone below 14 would struggle to understand all aspects of the film)."

It's ironic that this is his first Oscar win; compare this to Raging Bull or even his remake of Cape Fear (which adds a lot to the original version, as opposed to this remake of Internal Affairs which adds little).

","Up until the last 15 minutes or so I was prepared to give The Departed a 10/10 rating and put it on my list of favourite films ever. I liked everything about this film - the plot, the script, the acting etc. But then the last 15 minutes meant this film finished on such a depressing and dire note that simply left me feeling hollow, and made the film seem a little bit more than pointless.<br/><br/>Character development is something that really shines out in The Departed. Billy Costigan is a cop who is pretending to work for Costello, the head of the Irish mafia, but is in fact a rat and giving information to the cops. Colin is working for the cops but is in fact giving information to Costello behind the backs of all the Police. Costello knows he has a rat in his midst. So do the police. Question is, will either ever find out who? Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as Billy Costigan is not only faultless - it's really quite superb. Gone are DiCaprio's days as an actor purely know for his pretty face - it is clear from this performance that not only does the man know how to act, but acts very, very well - I'm definitely looking forward to seeing more of DiCaprio's later work. Matt Damon as Colin was less impressive for me, but the remainder of the cast cannot be faulted, especially Mark Wahlberg as Dignam - his part may have been small but was definitely memorable.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese did a fantastic job directing this film - he really knows how to create drama and atmosphere - and the contrasting shots of Billy and Colin all through out worked incredibly well and showed Scorsese's skill as a director.<br/><br/>I've got to question the name of the film though, 'The Departed', which really doesn't suit what this film is about and was one of the reasons I put off watching it for so long. But I'm defiantely glad I had finally got around to watching it, and surprised at all the poor reviews this film has got.

","I will start by saying that this is by no means a bad film but having watched the 2-disc DVD it left me a touch sour. The only reference to the original was the fact that media Asia films was mentioned and Scorsese said something bout the original Chinese films in the whitey Bulger documentary. The mere fact that they have tried to liken this film to the Whitey Bulger case is a joke!! This isn't a film based on another film it is a remake! All the key scenes in this are lifted from the original, the rooftop scenes, the hidden mole, the dying criminal that wont give up Tony Leung / Leo DI Caprio's character ( although better explained in the original). The joint relationship with the psychiatrist, given an absurd Hollywoodness to it compared to the more realistic Hong Kong version. That said the inclusion of Jack Nicholson's part being made significantly more important in this version was a bonus and the likes of Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin given characters only increase the films impact. The Original though did not need to rely on peripheral characters or an ensemble cast as its two main protagonists were worthy enough. This REMAKE is enjoyable and i am glad Scorcese has finally his Oscar although he was far more deserving for his original work."
"edchin2006","7","0","5","6 July 2008"," As nice as ""A Fistful of Dollars""
","A nice adaptation of ""Infernal Affairs' (2002) aka ""Mou Gaan Dou"" which was so popular that it spawned at least two other sequel/prequel/equal releases. (I should check - it might be up to MGD V by now.) The ""feel"" of Boston is a nice touch, some of the characters even have decent bostonian accents - the only knock might be the too neat a wrap up at the end.<br/><br/>Most adaptations viz. ""The Magnificent Seven"" attempt to capture the spirit of ""The Seven Samurai"" suffer rather badly. Even ""Point of No Return"" (1993) which is virtually a scene by scene reprise of Luc Besson's ""Nakita"" (1990) is a pale reflection of the original. Maybe, if he directed the Hollywood version, too; it would've made a difference - but how do you bowl a 300 game twice? The only adaptation I like is ""Per un Pugno di Dollari"" (1964) aka ""A Fistful of Dollars"" by Sergio Leone. I won't give away the title, but it's also by Kurosawa.<br/><br/>The best thing about adaptations is that it brings many of us to seek out the originals - the only problem is that there is scant recognition given by Hollywood to the originals (probably to avoid paying royalties). But keep reading these comments; there are plenty of us who will direct you to the (usually better) originals, and give credit where credit is due."

While this is sometimes good like in godfathers, goodfellas, and blow, i think this movie sometimes drags along quite slow. The first half of the movie is mostly setting up the characters as Dicaprio the good guy and Damon the bad guy. If you want a lot of action i would look elsewhere because this is a lot of talk. Don't get me wrong, it is a very good plot, but sometimes it could use more action. i gave it seven stars because it is very watchable and it will keep you entertained.

"Lejink","6","0","2","28 April 2008"," Leaving the building...
","Scorcese's first comment on his old pet theme, gangsters and their world, for some time and the question is can the veteran director still deliver in the grand style of, say ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"". For me however, this movie doesn't hit the mark of its illustrious predecessors and seems to me to lack that particular ""Scorcese touch"", if anything playing out like any other contemporary mob thriller you can see on TV as well as on the big screen. Of course it's distinguished by A-List actors but none of them quite delivers that knockout punch in terms of performance. De Caprio is certainly edgy and committed in his central role as the inside man, the left-hand to Ray Winstone's surprisingly almost anonymous right-hand man to mob leader Jack Nicholson, whilst the great ham himself (sorry, I'm not a fan) is kept mostly in check, keeping his eye-rolling and exaggerated speechifying more or less under control, even if Scorcese does hand him an unnecessary ""Here's Johnny"" / ""I didn't ask"" moment with a ""This ain't reality TV"" crack. Matt Damon, even though more associated with heroic male lead parts (c.f. Jason Bourne) has played baddies before (most memorably in ""The Talented Mr Ripley""), and convinces as Nicholson's man on the inside, but in the end I found this and the other considerable star-power on display (Wahlberg, Sheen, Baldwin et. al.) distracting from the drama. Vera Farmiga is competent, no more than that, as the love interest to both Damon and DeCaprio in an underwritten and unbelievable role as the police shrink. In a movie where the four main leads are not what they seem and engaging in different ways in deception and deceit, be it on a large scale (De Caprio, Damon and allegedly Nicholson) or a strictly personal scale (Farmiga), I think a clearer more believable narrative would have improved matters. The action set pieces are okay and rightly rooted in reality but some of the events are implausible to say the least (Martin Sheen as a senior investigator with the police gets unceremoniously thrown off a high rise building, then everybody else more or less gets shot just before the final reel where avenging angel Wahlberg, cleans up affairs by taking out in-the-clear Damon to bring about some degree of closure to the carnage which has gone on before), but I was frustrated at plot holes which threw me off-track and were not I believe fully resolved or compensated for dramatically. And just what place vintage early 70's music by the likes of the Stones (okay, we know why they had two tracks included - obviously Marty isn't above pitching for a gig with prospective employers), Lennon, the Beach Boys and even Badfinger have with an up to the minute contemporary thriller, is anyone's guess, great tracks as they are. All in all a frustrating watch and proof to me that the Academy can be beholden to sympathy and sentimentality in rewarding perseverance over the individual accomplishment of the job in hand. Okay, so maybe Scorcese's Oscar could be taken as a sop for the unrewarded ""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"", the afore-mentioned ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"", not forgetting my own favourite ""New York New York"", - but I thought that's what lifetime achievement awards were for...!"

","Martin Scorsese is one of the finest directors and seeing this movie it feels great that he hasn't lost his touch. But I think this movie is only half as good as his previous works. Definitely the year's best, considering the crap that is coming out of Hollywood these days. Screenplay is great but the setting subdued. I couldn't think of Nicholson's character as more than a street thug while he is supposed to be some kind of a notorious mafia. There are moments which are electrifying...like the one where Caprio's character gets shot...not to mention the layered story telling and the complexities of characters. As for the performances, the only one that stands really tall is that of Caprio's. I never thought much of him as an actor but after seeing this movie I believe given a right part he is one of the finest actors of his generation. His character is most complex and he delivers without any gimmicks and heavy dialog.<br/><br/>As for others, Nicholson resorts to his usual gimmicks to give punch to his character and I found him more caricaturish than frightening. Damon is a good actor but his character was beyond his capabilities...he doesn't look as mean as the character is meant to be. I personally feel both Nicholson and Damon are miscasted (probably just because of the star power). As for Wahlberg's character, much has been written. If shouting some well written lines with the F... word and being tight face makes him a good actor then I differ on that. John Sheen was good and Alec Baldwin just OK."

Yes, but only in Acting and Directing. The Writing and Picture didn't even deserve nominations. The Writing is over-the-top and phony. Anything Mark Wahlberg says in this movie is completely caustic and unrealistic. I'm sure someone would talk like he does in this film. The Story is good, but not executed well at all for it is covered up with a lot of violence and language. Scoscesse is a good director, I'm not denying that, but I am just totally upset with this film. It is not horrendous, but just upsetting.

This is what modern marketing is all about, and it is what stifles creativity, cue the endless sequels, remakes and movie adoptions of TV ideas.

","Scorsese proves his genius in visualization once again. However this is the first film He has directed with a plot (said by himself). The result of this is a jumbling of characters with no depth. For me personally, none of the characters were deep enough. What makes Scorsese's films so great is that every one of them, even the B level ones, have a character with a struggle that he can identify with. When a film is no longer character driven, but rather plot driven, the director tends to loose that deep connection to the film that can turn out a masterpiece (Raging Bull, Chinatown, The Nun Story). What saves The Departed from mediocrity is near perfect visualization, (once again) flawless editing, and strong performances."

Leonardo DiCaprio is Billy Costigan - a Massachussetts State Trooper who's been able to infiltrate an organized crime group led by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). At the same time, Costello has managed to get Colin Sullivan (played by Matt Damon) into an influential position in the State Force's Special Investigations Unit. The criminals know that there's a police mole in their midst, and the police know that there's a criminal mole in their midst, but no one knows their identities, and both organizations gear up to discover who's betraying them. To make things more interesting, Sullivan (the mole inside the police department) ends up assigned to the task group trying to find the mole (which is, of course, himself.) It sounds confusing, but it really isn't. The movie's quite straightforward and full of suspense over who's going to get found out first.<br/><br/>There are strong supporting performances from Nicholson, Martin Sheen as Queenan, who's in charge of the undercover cops, and Alec Baldwin as Ellerby, who heads up the Special Investigations Unit.<br/><br/>There are a couple of weaknesses in the movie. I was unimpressed with Vera Farmiga's performance as Dr. Madden, the police psychiatrist who becomes Costello's live-in girlfriend but who also develops an attachment to Costigan - without knowing what either of them are doing. Farmiga didn't strike me as believable in the role, and the character of Dr. Madden didn't strike me as very professional. I also thought the movie became unnecessarily bloody in the last twenty minutes or so, which detracted (in my opinion)from what had, to that point, been a nifty suspense movie. I must have missed something in the body of the movie, as well, because - without giving anything away - I found myself confused by the last scene, uncertain of the identity of the shooter or the reason for the shooting.<br/><br/>In any event, I still thought The Departed was a very entertaining film, and it certainly holds the viewers' attention for its full two and a half hours. 8/10"

DiCaprio is also very good as a member of Boston police. His family's bad name has had an effect on his career also, and he is eventually forced to start an undercover operation in Costello's gang. Rest of the cast is also full of big names, including Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin. The sheer quality of the actors is truly impressive.<br/><br/>Scorsese tells a story about loyalty, roots and morale. Cops and robbers are very similar, basically only difference being which side of the law they happen to be acting. It is also story about man's family, and how the echo of your name follows you through your life.<br/><br/>The suspense of the movies grows towards the end, and it seems obvious their faiths eventually become intertwined. However the rate people start to die right and left eventually put me down. It's not that they die, the motives and ambitions of the characters eventually come to conclusion and collide, but the way the deaths are made to seem like random collateral damage from some gang shooting.

"dmgrundy","7","0","1","21 September 2007"," Good film, lacks a certain something though...
","A remake of the 2002 Hong-Kong film 'Infernal Affairs', this will inevitably be remembered as ""the film that got Scorsese his Oscar"", rather than on its own merits. Nevertheless, it's still a good movie, entertaining and with an excellent plot. Jack Nicholson overacts with his familiar anarchic streak, a mad glint in his eyes, mixed in with an occasional hint of cold-blooded menace. Hardly a believable turn, but good fun nonetheless. Leonardo da Caprio is all tortured angst, and very good at it too (the beard helps, making him look about 10 years older). Matt Damon is less convincing - he's made more sympathetic the 'Infernal Affairs' character, and, well, he's just too much of a 'good guy'...Maybe I only say that because I saw the 'Bourne Ultimatum' recently. Mark Whalberg's smaller role is well done; Martin Sheen doesn't really have much to do.<br/><br/>Having seen 'Infernal Affairs' first, I was inevitably going to compare this to it this 'remake'. The plot is pretty similar, but it's been 'Scorsese-fied' - you could argue that it's as much down to the screenplay as the direction, but perhaps the screenplay was influenced by a perception of Scorsese as 'auteur', so tailored towards his preoccupations and styles. Who knows, I'm ignorant of the collaborative (or otherwise) process that went into the making of this film, I'm just speculating. Let me clarify what I mean by 'Scorsese-fied': stuffed full of language (c word, f word liberally splashed through it), sexual references, references to the church, lashings of bloody violence (everytime someone's killed - a major character, anyway - they invariably end up lying on the floor in a big pool of blood. What is it with Scorsese and pools of blood? End of Taxi Driver, the bounty hunter character in Cape Fear, blah blah.) Although Infernal Affairs was unsubtle in several respects (it had a big streak of sentimentality running through it which, from my limited experience, seems to be a characteristic of some of Oriental films), it in a way made something more interesting, 'deeper' out of the story. THere it was connected to Buddhist notions of the cyclical nature of life - there was a quote from a Buddhist text at the beginning of the film, and this cyclical thing was pretty obvious throughout (and even more so if you watch the IA sequels). So we were left in no doubt that the cycle would go on - even if the protagonists died, others would take their place, and the game between cop and criminal would continue, as would the killings. That wasn't stressed nearly as much in 'Departed', particularly with the ending, where Damon's character pops it (rather a ham-fisted touch, I felt, particularly when the camera swept up from his body to a shot of a rat in the window, in front of the view that we saw Damon looking at several times in the film, the view that represented his conflicted desires to be both cop and criminal, or whatever it symbolised).<br/><br/>Another thing 'Departed' lacked was the fascinating relationship between head cop and head criminal, a mixture of friendliness and hatred. Sheen was a peripheral figure, and it's hard to imagine Costello, as played by Nicholson, having a particularly complex relationship with any other character: too cartoonish and OTT for that. His death at the hands of Damon (a cold-blooded murder in the original) becomes an emotional reaction to Nicholson's desire for him to be a son-figure, which comes out of the blue and, well, just doesn't convince.<br/><br/>What is Scorsese's intention with this remake, then? Is he trying to simplify it into just another cops and robbers/gangster movie? Is he trying to do a 'Heat' and show that there's little difference between those on the right and those on the wrong side of the law? (There is a line somewhere which makes this point - Costello: ""When you decide to be something, you can be it. That's what they don't tell you in the church. When I was your age they would say we can become cops, or criminals. Today, what I'm saying to you is this: when you're facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?""). Maybe he's just addressing his familiar preoccupations with male violence, repressed Catholic guilt, sexuality (not such a big part of this film, though there is a scene in a porn theatre), hints of racism (""Twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get a f*cking job, we had the presidency. May he rest in peace. That's what the n*ggers don't realize. If I got one thing against the black chappies, it's this - no one gives it to you. You have to take it"") - though to be fair, for once, there is a black character in the film who does more than get shot or appear on a street. The opening voice-over raises the familiar church/criminal options, the desire to amount to something rather than be just another poor person in the city, mixed in with the desire to belong to a close-knit community, to feel like you belong: i.e. the criminal fraternity (a big part of 'Goodfellas') - ""I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me. Years ago we had the church. That was only a way of saying - we had each other. The Knights of Columbus were real head-breakers; true guineas. They took over their piece of the city."" But these themes aren't really addressed or expanded on as the movie continues, as we instead get to see Nicholson chomp on the scenery, often in a way that's played for gruesome laughs. There's just a feeling that something's missing - fine though this film is, it's not Oscar-worthy: my theory is that it only won at the Academy Awards because the academy feel guilty for short-changing Scorsese back in the years when he made acclaimed, ground-breaking movies. But it's not bad; not bad at all."
"bandw","8","0","1","20 September 2007"," Quality production, graphic violence, strong language
","The concept of having one Massachusetts State policeman be a mole for the mafia in the police department and another policeman be a mole for the police department in the mafia is an interesting one. The parallel stories of the two policemen are inter-cut with great skill. Keeping up with the complex interplay between the Irish Mafia, the Special Investigations Unit of the Massachusetts State Police, the FBI, the Italian Mafia, and the regular Massachusetts State Police kept me on my toes. <br/><br/>Scorcese extracts some excellent performances from Damon and DiCaprio. Restraining Nicholson seems to be the challenge with him at this stage in his career and, barring a couple of excesses, he is in good form. And the wonderful Ray Winstone is perfect for his part - he is so good that you don't know he is acting, until you realize he is a native Brit and is effecting a quite believable American accent.<br/><br/>In the lives of people like Mark Foley, Larry Craig, and Ted Haggard we have seen the ultimate effects of long-term pretense at being something you are not. The analysis of pretense behavior for Damon and DiCaprio is more subtle. They both have qualms about their double lives, but they have been trapped by their decisions, and all does not end well. The examination of character traits that lead to tragedy almost makes this movie have Shakespearean dimensions. And, in Shakespearean fashion, it ends with a heap of dead bodies.<br/><br/>If you are put off by strong language and explicit violence, don't go near this. Some of the violence seemed gratuitous to me and by the end I had seen quite enough of people getting shot in the head. But I guess Scorsese wanted us to see the brutal world these people were living in.<br/><br/>I felt that Damon and DiCaprio having the same love interest was an unnecessary plot complication and I did not sense any chemistry in either of the relationships. Some of the filming techniques puzzled me. For example, when Nicholson first comes on screen he remains in shadows until he finally appears in a full color close up. I did not get the significance of that unless it was a takeoff on Orson Welles' entry in ""The Third Man.""<br/><br/>But, it's hard to find much fault with this film."

After all, I became to hate the Director who didn't give a damn to other country's people in that he took no responsibility to convey to the ordinary Americans that we Chinese were war-lovers who always wanted to throw bombs on Taiwan's land. It's bullshit! I can't believe that it's the same director who shot so many masterpieces such as Taxi driver and Goodfellas.

"jboxer11111","6","0","2","30 August 2007"," Well shot as expected. Great supporting. Lacking leads
","This movie was one of the most well paced movies I have seen in recent years. I was in my seat well passed my bladder and wasn't bored for a single second. Martin Sheen gave a terrific performance as did Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg. My first problem was casting. I know many people will disagree but for me Dicaprio isn't a tough guy cop(or Howard Hughes or the leader of a gang for that matter). Matt Damon isn't somebody I can hate. This is of course my opinion. The biggest problem I have is with the story. Matt Damon is engaged to a psychologist who helps out cops with mental traumas. She doesn't know that Matt Damon is a corrupt cop. Only we do. Therefore to her he is just a good or rather great fiancé. He provides for her and there is no sign pointing to the fact that he doesn't love her. Dicaprio comes into her office seeking help and, being the great looking man he is, she lusts after him then goes on to sleep with him. This breaks not only a professional boundary but a moral one. I don't think we live in a world where a woman being suspicious is given the right to cheat on her fiancé. And if you are going to do this then you must develop a relationship so we can forgive her. Now most people forgive her because Matt Damon is the bad guy. i do not because she didn't know that. This also ruins an otherwise great ending because who cares if she finds out. She already cheated and if Matt Damon knew this he'd probably dump her anyway. The other problem I had with this is that in any gangster flick there is always and should always be and innocent bystander(girlfriend, kids, grandpa, father, mother etc...) that symbolizes a good side in the corrupt character. In this movie it was this girl. I thought during the movie ""Maybe he'll stop being corrupt and just be a good husband"" That thought is always available until that sex scene. It's a shame because this could have been a masterpiece and instead it is just another good Scorsese film."

","Certainly a high-quality piece of work -- what you'd expect from Mr.Scorcese and his cast of American ""A-listers"" ... but ... I was (perhaps morbidly) impressed with his earlier stuff -- Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Casino ... ah, Casino, in which I averted my eyes for the ""Vice Scene,"" having had enough of the routine brutality of this director's work. His glorification of gangsterism wore me out. His portrayal of psycopathy has always bordered on some sort of peculiar admiration of crime most repulsive, and he's at it again with The Departed. Enough, please, with the casual torture and slaughter, the splattering heads, the ghastly executions. Oh, for another ""After Hours,"" a remarkable change of pace from the gruesome inhumanity of his body of work. The man made his name with too-realistic, very disturbing carnage, but it's time to move on ...

","Parents send your kids elsewhere; we are here to talk about, ""The Departed,"" the Academy Award winning movie directed by none other than the great Martin Scorsese. I won't spend a lot of time explaining the movie because it will take longer than actually watching the movie itself. <br/><br/>But it involves DiCaprio's character graduating from the Massachusetts Police Academy and becoming the Boston Police Department's, ""mole"" in investigating the Irish mob, run by Nicholsan. While at the same time Nicholsan sends Damon through the Police Academy to become his informant in the Boston Police Department. Things escalate when both Damon and DiCaprio become aware of each others presence and are ordered to uncover the other one's identity. Don't be fooled this is one movie that is VERY hard to follow if you are not paying immense attention. It is filled with double-crosses, triple-crosses, and I think there was a quadruple-cross at one point.<br/><br/>It's filled with big named celebrities that you are well acquainted with. And there talents are well used. The story on the other hand seems rushed at times and appears it would have benefited more had it been spread out on two movies as opposed to cramming it all on one. But the thing that's confusing is that Mark Wahlberg was nominated for an Oscar, but he's only in about five scenes and isn't even the main focus, his character is completely forgettable up till the very end.<br/><br/>And as far as how this movie wraps up, pretty much, everyone dies. Yep, be careful not to blink or else you'll miss someone getting killed. At the end I looked to my friend and asked, ""Did they just kill-off the entire cast in five minutes?"" <br/><br/>Despite these pitfalls, the movie is still solid, it's directed wonderfully, and Scorsese deserves his Oscar. The acting is top notch, and the atmosphere and the characters and the story (as long as you are paying attention) keeps you until the very end. And the ""F-word"" is used 237 times, how cool is that? I just wished the movie didn't leave me wanting more. And even though the movie did very well and won many awards, it won't be on the minds of people for very long. <br/><br/>So I give The Departed a 3 out of 5."
"manhattanmoviemaniac","8","0","3","18 July 2007"," Very good movie, but best picture?
","This was a best picture winner, which was most likely repayment of an 'I owe you' to Scorsese for all of his great work over the last thirty years. Don't get me wrong. This is a very good movie with excellent dialogue delivered by a top-notch cast. The basic idea of the story is good and based on a Japanese film, but a couple of the characters presented in this version, just don't work for me and hurt the movie's credibility. Still a very good film with four more Oscars than I have.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is great as Billy Costigan, a bad tempered trainee for the Boston State Police, with an attitude problem, when he is pulled out to go undercover in the Irish mob of Frank Costello, played by the master, Jack Nicholson. Now, Frankie Costello doesn't just count on all the blessed saints to keep his Irish ass safe. Just to be sure, he has his 'Statie's' detective in the form of the ambitious Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon proving himself as an excellent actor once again), who has been in Costello's pocket since he was old enough to take comic books as payment. Costigan's handlers are Capt. Queenan (Sheen) and Sgt Dingnam (Walhberg), whose character has the personality that would make it impossible to hold a job as anything, but a doorman at a skid row bar. Soon, both Costigan and Sullivan are getting pressured to find out who is giving info from the inside. They must both be idiots, however, since this doesn't seem like it should be that big of a challenge; particularly with Costigan. Let's see if I were a gangster who just found out that he has a cop in the pack and I have just recruited an ex-cop trainee, I don't think I'd be scratching my head for too long, before I shot the new guy to see if he bleeds blue. If this were not enough, they both end up chasing the same girl, Madeline (Farmiga), whose character also doesn't make sense. I don't buy her unfaithful psychiatrist role and find her relationship with the volatile Costigan without sufficient basis. Anyway, all this keeps the tension level high and is backed up by a great soundtrack.<br/><br/>So, maybe I have to stand alone on this one (what else is new?), but I say this is an enjoyable, but flawed movie, that got 'Best Picture' as a sympathy award for the great Scorsese. Its still worth seeing, and maybe even owning, but weren't they any good pictures that years that didn't have any 'what the hell?' moments?' (This work was first posted on realmoviereview.com)"

At that time it was known that Nicolson had an informer within the Boston police; namely Damon.<br/><br/>So his love interest, latest when she moved in with Damon, should have wondered of how a simple police officer can afford such a VIP apartment and Damon should have been identified as Nicolson's informer in no time.<br/><br/>However, that did not take place and apparently the otherwise very clever police psychologist took it for granted that a simple police officer can afford such an expensive an upper class apartment.<br/><br/>This oversight in logic makes the whole movie look very poor."

The direction of this film was marginally competent, at best, but I truly believe we are witnessing something special in the maturation of Leo DiCaprio.<br/><br/>Direction: So many loose ends, and the pacing alternates between lethargic and frenetic. Composition and memorable visuals? None. (Well, the shots of the characters going into the warehouse door are well done.) Theme? Ummmm... its-a-dark-world-and-people-do-bad-stuff. Ooookay, thanks for that insight, Martin.<br/><br/>Acting: I always look forward to seeing Nicholson and Damon on the screen, and I enjoyed watching them here, but DiCaprio stands out. His performance is pitch perfect: the story is intense, but of all the actors, only his performance has a matching intensity. His portrayal of a tough young man who is scared s***less by what he's gotten caught up in is convincing, human, and non-derivative. While working with Scorsesi, DiCaprio has begun to emerge as an actor who could pick up the mantle of people like Jimmy Stewart, Henry Fonda, and Gregory Peck. Like them, he brings a recognizable and consistent persona to the part, but does so in a way lets the persona enhance rather than limit the character.<br/><br/>Nicholson and Damon are excellent charismatic actors. Johnny Depp is a fascinating explorer. Anthony Hopkins is a master of the craft. Other names could be mentioned. But DiCaprio is growing into something different from each of these... a ""movie star"" in the classic Hollywood tradition."

","I had seen this movie before, but I watched it again last night because I was honestly left a bit disappointed at the first time. Well actually, the movie was better when I watched it again, but it still isn't anything phenomenal like everyone says. The movie was over-hyped and I had huge expectations on it, so that's probably the reason why I am a bit disappointed. It won an Academy Award for the Best Picture, but if you ask me, I'd chosen ""Little Miss Sunshine"" for the Best Picture. Don't get me wrong, the movie's good but I just would have hoped more of it.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese won an Academy Award for the Best Achievement in Directing and I must say it was more than a well deserved Oscar indeed. The movie has, without a doubt, excellent directing, very close to perfection. When I was watching the Academy Awards I literally jumped off from my seat, screaming and giving a big applause when I heard the name ""Martin Scorsese"" at the point where they were announcing the Oscar for the Best Achievement in Directing. That has been by far the most exciting experience I've had when watching the Academy Awards. Anyway, back to the film itself: The movie has a very good flow and the screenplay's very well progressing and good enough, but I think the movie could have been a little bit shorter, as now it's just a bit too long. The last 30 minutes of the movie are, I wouldn't say boring, but slightly too much. Still, the movie's enjoyable from the beginning till the end, just to say that as I don't want to sound too harsh. And to add to that I haven't seen the original movie, ""Mou gaan dou"" aka ""Infernal Affairs"", so I can't really compare these two movies together.<br/><br/>What comes to role performances the one who takes the cake is no other than Jack Nicholson. I must admit that I've never really liked Jack Nicholson that much, but in this movie he's just phenomenal, he's just simply perfect for the role. Being that mad dirty mouthed himself. What comes to other performances, well, the whole cast is just superbly chosen and there is one amazing actor after another. Leonardo DiCaprio, who is one of my favourite actors, is the excellent himself as always. Matt Damon does his job flawlessly, Mark Wahlberg is a rather surreal choice for a bad ass cop, which makes him also hilarious, yet an excellent choice. Alec Baldwin does one of his most fitting roles ever, being surprisingly enjoyable and Martin Sheen is the legend who's the last touch for the movie.<br/><br/>This is a good movie and good entertainment with its twisty plot and witty, even sarcastic, humour. A fine piece indeed. Still, it is a bit disappointing for those who are looking for an amazing movie, as it just was honestly too over-hyped when it came out and it still is too over-hyped. Despite that, the movie is definitely worth watching and I'm recommending it to everyone. It includes great characters who are performed by amazing actors, a top notch direction, a story with a very entertaining flow and music that just gives that last touch of a great guaranteed movie experience.

","Had been waiting to hire this for a while, so was stoked when i dropped into ""Video Busters"" and saw all but 2 copies were available.<br/><br/>""The Departed"" features one of the best assembled cats in recent memory. You've got your Jack Nicholson's, your Matt Damon's, your Leonardo DiCaprio's (who has gone from being a dork in films like Romeo & Juliet and Titanic, to a bona fide action/adventure/drama star), your Mark Wahlberg's and your Alec Baldwin's (in his best role ever). The story revolves around a gangster called Costello (Nicholson), who is untouchable. This isn't helped when Colin (Damon),a man who Costello has been a father figure to, lands a major law enforcement role and will only aid Costello in remaining out of danger. Also joining the force at the same time is Billy (DiCaprio), who lands a deep undercover job and sets out to trap Costello. From here it's a cat and mouse game as Billy tries to find who the rat is while Colin tries to find out who's the cop working for Costello.<br/><br/>Great story, great cast, great direction (Scorcese, who amazingly won his first Academy Award for this, where the direction was a class under ""The Aviator"" ). Well worth seeing, but not a family flick due to some potty mouth on behalf of pretty much the whole cast and some violent scenes."

","The Departed is a very, very good movie. Even if it is a way too long for such a genre, more than 2 hours, still, it holds together well and never gets boring. This is a joint success of the director, actors and the cameramen. Bright, vivid colors of Boston coincide with the terrible, bloody scenes of gang's shootouts. The central idea is very cute, too. One secret agent gets close to Mr. Costello, a very dangerous, bloody bandit; while Costello's man gets right into the Police, and he is very smart man, as no one can seek and destroy him. The film is a tense, brisk, fast and furious. The marvelous play of Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen, Leonardo Di Caprio, Matt Damon, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg adds great suspense and incredible zest to the movie. Up to the end you sit with your breath off, never knowing how it all will end up. The final is very tragic, but you have to see it yourself, because it will lose much if anybody tells you about that before. Watch it, you will not be sorry. Even if this film is so sad and offers no happy end, it stays as a bright example of a serious gangsters' movie."

","Martin Scorsese latest instalment of gripping movie making follows his art at exploring the crime genre in The Departed, a remake of the Hong Kong movie Infernal Affairs. Although most remakes are dismissed, Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan have re-created the B-grade movie into a hit American epic tragedy. The movie has received four Oscars, this includes Scorsese first 'Best Achievement in Directing', along with a Golden Globe for 'Best Director  Motion Picture' and a 'Best Director' from The Directors Guild of America. The Departed has been described as his ""Best picture since Goodfellas"" and praised alongside his most celebrated movies, such as Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. The cast is complete with an all-star line up who were awarded 'Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture' by the Screen Actors Guild, includes A-list actors such as Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin accepting supporting roles and Leonardo De'Caprio, Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson as leading roles. At the age of 69, it is obvious that with three Oscars and seven Golden Globes under his belt Nicholson, like a fine wine, has enhanced with age (if that's possible). He delivers, as can be expected, an excellent performance, full of colour as bad man, Frank Costello, a psychopathic Irish-American gangster, complete with humour, profanity and hard boiled discourse. Damon and De'Caprio play two members of the Boston police force, both of whom grew up in the Irish-American community and as they join the force their paths begin to merge. De'Caprio gives by far the best performance of his career as Billy Costigan, an academy enrolment from a rough background and family of criminals. Costigan joins the force hoping to become a law abiding state trooper but Captain Queenan (Sheen) and Sgt. Dignam (Wahlberg) have alteria motives for him. Costigan is sent undercover to use his family connections to get close to Costello and inform the police of the gangs movements. Damon's performance as Colin Sullivan should also be praised, Sullivan also joins the force but for different reasons. He's a right-hand man to Costello, to provide inside knowledge to the gang, a binary opposite to Costigan. The film opens with a line that will engage anyone's attention ""I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me"" and the plot continues to grip the audience. A high-stake battle of cat and mouse begins, Costigan feeding information about Costello's plans back to Queenan, whilst Sullivan counter acts by leaking the cops intelligence back to Costello. Both informers know there are leaks on either side although both are oblivious to the other position. Scorsese delivers a complicated yet intense movie, expanding the crime genre to a new level, apart from Costello's girlfriend Gwen (Kristen Dalton), you will be surprised by the lack of stereotypes apparent in The Departed. In fact Scorsese has stunned us all by using just one character, Madolyn (Vera Farmigan) to play a psychiatrist for the police force, who is both Costigan and Sullivans girlfriends. Although conventions of the genre are apparent such as Irish-Americans gangsters (White Heat) and hard boiled discourse (The Public Enemy), this movie is derivative of the Crime genre, although it is definitely not 'just another crime movie' but a new development."

The only thing it didn't win was supporting actor for Mark Whalberg who plays a Sergant in the Boston Staties.

","I always wondered when Martin Scorsese was going to win an Oscar for Best Director, after 6 nominations, and he deserved to win for this inventive crime drama thriller. Basically years ago, Irish mobster Frank Costello (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Jack Nicholson) got Colin Sullivan to go through the many courses to become a professional cop, and now grown up, Colin (Matt Damon) has everyone's trust, but what they do not know is that is in fact keeping an eye out for any police activity that could come to an arrest. The police decide to get young undercover cop Billy Costigan (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Leonardo DiCaprio, Oscar nominated the same year for Blood Diamond) to get into Frank's gang, earn his trust, and hope to get evidence of his guilt, and crimes. It is when word gets out about two rats, in Frank's gang and the police that trouble brews for both groups. Also starring Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Mark Wahlberg as Dignam, Martin Sheen as Captain Queenan, Ray Winstone as Mr. French, Vera Farmiga as Madolyn, Scary Movie 3 & 4's Anthony Anderson as Brown and Alec Baldwin as Ellerby. I really like the idea of two rats in both groups, and the concluding scenes are the personal highlights. It won the Oscars for Best Editing, Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Editing, Best Adapted Screenplay, the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Director, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Leonardo DiCaprio was number 94, and Jack Nicholson on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 63 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 7 on The World's Greatest Actor, and Ray Winstone was number 32 on The 50 Greatest British Actors.

","I thought the actors held the movie together, they played off one another well despite being hampered by the script. Not that the story was bad, it just missed that psychological depth it was (I think) shooting for and came off as a slightly more deep than normal cop-shooting-action movie. In the 2 1/2 hours the developments of the cop mole and the mobster mole were short and time was rushed, not just in the early years, where that is expected, but throughout the undercover operations, so that each character advanced without the audience quite knowing how and why. The scenes often jumped back and forth between the two moles, comparing them, yes, but adding more to the fast-paced action feel. The supporting cast were all brusque and cutting, which was enjoyable, but as seen in an action film. There was little connection between any characters, including the rather ridiculous love interest who could have been the emotional release, but the story skimmed over that, again, too quickly. Too many years were covered, and had to be covered for both of them, without a clear focus. I'm interested to see what scenes were actually cut from the film. Not Scorsese's best work,but don't expect that and it's a darkly fun cop flick."
"maatmouse-1","7","0","1","5 March 2007"," Martin Scorsese's film which won awards but divided critics
","I came to this film, pleased that Martin had won awards at the recent Academy Awards night. For him, this was confirmation of what most of us already knew: that he is a brilliant and innovative director and should have got his awards years ago.<br/><br/>I have seen a number of Scorsese films, namely Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, Gangs of New York, and now this. For me, this is not one of his best. It is a long, drawn out familiar territory type of film which takes a brilliant plot, that of divided loyalties in a police department and runs with it. DiCaprio, Damon, Wahlberg, Sheen and Farmiga are all brilliant whereas Nicholson plays himself with a performance similar to that in the Witches of Eastwick, ie unpleasant, full of expletives, especially towards women and his relationship with them and something akin to how you imagine the devil to be. For me, he was far too way over the top and a little more restraint from Scorsese could have reigned Nicholson in to give another brilliant performance. <br/><br/>What lets this film down is not the story or plot or players. It is the script. As seems to be the trend nowadays, there is a lot of swearing and sexual swearing in this film. Two films seemed to do this excessively, one being Inside Man and this one. I am aware that a streetwise police officer and cop in America and gangland hoodlums will indulge in a lot of swearing and general profanity but why can't films have something better to say? This film could have gotten away with far less profanity and a lot less of the references to female bodily parts and female specific bodily functions than it did. It would not have made the film any less watchable. For me, it speaks of lazy writing and implies that the women in this film are second class citizens and they are not. Even although there is a very good role for a woman in this film, the implication is that women are second fiddle. This seems to play out a lot in Scorsese's films. My advice to Scorsese is: employ a brilliant female actress of which there are numerous and give her something really good to say and do and don't make her a prostitute. <br/><br/>Finally, there is an outstanding performance from DiCaprio in this film. Talk about maturity! DiCaprio has well and truly buried his pretty boy image in this film by far. He delivers the tense, lonely performance of a man who doesn't really know who his friends are and anyone he can trust. Damon, too is excellent. As the duplicitious Sullivan, he delivers a performance not unlike that of another character - that of Mr Riley. One minute, you like Sullivan, the next, you realise you've backed the wrong horse.<br/><br/>One key thing about this film is the little details. This is a film you have to concentrate with, otherwise things are missed."

Calling somebody a ""homo"" with derogatory intent is not only a put-down to that one individual, but also to the entire culture / society of homosexual individuals.<br/><br/>As per the ending, well.. not many people like witnessing lead characters being killed off. In this particular case, pretty much all the characters had been killed off.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie was quite a disappointment."
"das417","8","0","1","5 March 2007"," Good thriller but not worthy of best picture
","The Departed creates the scenario of deception on two separate levels but involving the same group of people who, whether they know it or not, are on a path of destruction. With Jack Nicholson, Leonardo Di Caprio, Matt Damon, and Martin Sheen, The Departed has an all star cast that creates a plot that brings one into a world of murder, lies, and deception that makes up Boston's underworld.<br/><br/>Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is used as an undercover officer to infiltrate the circle of Frank Costello (Jack Nicholoson) and to gain enough evidence to lead to an arrest. However, unknown to Costigan and his superiors, Boston's elite organized crime branch has been infiltrated by Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) who while as a child gained the trust of Costello after the older man becomes a near surrogate father figure. When Sullivan becomes a Massachuchests trooper, he serves Costello loyally by providing what information he can to protect Costello's operation from the police and the FBI.<br/><br/>The conflicts brought up by The Departed are many and often cross each other in their complexity. Costigan is an honest man placed into the role of a thief, liar, and even murderer while Sullivan is the criminal who is forced to play as the law. Over a year the two eventually realize that the forces attempting to protect and to destroy Costello are deeper then either could have realized. The love interest of counselor Madolyn, who neither Costigan or Sullivan realize has become involved with both of them, adds an extra layer of tension between the two. Much as in the fog of war, Costigan and Sullivan are two opponents who find themselves fighting but without a clear idea of who it is and even what it is they are struggling against.<br/><br/>Now to the problem. The Departed was a good movie and was well written and directed. However, the title of best picture of the year does not belong to this movie for at least one good reason. And this is Jack Nicholson whose character more or less resembles the role he played in As Good as It Gets except that he murders people and sells technology to the Chinese. I could not believe that Costello, who we are to believe is this genius underworld criminal hated and feared by the police and those who know him, was really who he claimed to be. Often he comes off more as comic relief in his conversations with both Costigan and Sullivan. The character was unbelievable and because of this the award of best picture should not have been given.<br/><br/>I would never say The Departed is a bad movie. However, I feel that the ultimate source of conflict, that is Frank Costello, was not strong enough or even reason enough for the plot that followed around him. The twists were well done writing was strong but these alone were not enough to make up for the character of Frank Costello. Costigan's and Sullivan's own conflict, while intense and well acted, were not enough to give such a high review and award.<br/><br/>What should have won best picture?

So I get a more critical perspective of the actual quality of directing or acting, without the overwhelming assault on sensations that occurs in a theater. Many films seem great in a theater but then only average on a home TV! The Departed was well directed and acted, but I've seen better acting and direction in other films, many times. Matt Damon did not do the best job he could have. Mark Wahlberg's character seemed a little un-realistic. Some of the film did as well. It was not Martin Scorsese's best directing effort, so do not expect that. There seemed to be too much effort to make it ""stylized"", quick and modern, to appeal to younger audiences. I hate that trend. Mr. Scorsese is one of the best directors of all time without a doubt. He should or could have won ""Best Directing"" for several other films in the past, including Goodfellas, The Last Temptation of Christ, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, The Color of Money or After Hours.

","Let start this review of by saying that I am by no means a big Oscar lover or fan of the glitzy-glitz award shows and ceremonies but having just seen The Deaprted, its hard not over look this movie and not give it the awards it was nominated for. When I read that Martin Scorsese was going to take up the task of doing an American take on the Hong Kong smash hit Infernal Affairs , it did raise eye brows as yet Hollywood's take on the Grudge ans Ring were well ...crap to be honest and I can't really see a remake of The Eye being all that either but having said that I was completely shocked and mesmerised by Scorcese and I would say that this is probably his best film to date (taking over Taxi Driver and Cape Fear by miles). Not your average cops and robbers thriller, The Departed takes place in Boston with Jack Nicholson as Frank Costello who is head of the Irish Mafia who has sent his best knight in shinning armour into the State Police with the task of rising above the ranks and slowly take control of the force . Whilst on the other hand the state police send an undercover mole to infiltrate the mafia , from there on it becomes a game of who is screwing who ? The acting of the movie was nothing short of superb Nicolson, DiCaprio, Damon , Sheen, Baldwin and Walhberg ALL shinned but I think kudos should go Dicaprio for his stand out performance (he might be a worthy advisory for Jhonney Depp ). The script and pace of the movie was sharp and quick with equal wit and attitude , my only complaint was that it ended a little to quickly for me.

","This movie is great. Scorsese does it again! Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio were very good. Jack Nicholson was the best. He keeps you hanging all the time. The acting in this movie is better than the Hong Kong movie Interal Affairs, which they ""ripped,"" (but credited) the story from. There were twists and turns everywhere (but almost the same like in the movie Internal Affairs). Exciting and very good. The movie in my opinion should not deserve an Oscar for best movie, since its a ""rip"" of another movie. If you like this movie, go and rent the 2 sequels at Chinese movie shops.

","This film is the most ridiculously amazing movie I have seen in a long time. I have not been so surprised and awed by turns of a plot since Park Chan-wook gave Oldboy to the US.

If Scorsese does not win the Oscar, then I just don't know what this world is coming to.<br/><br/>As to those who cry about the path the film took (all the way up to the end credits)...what did you expect? Did you think everyone was just going hug it out? Get real. <br/><br/>The purpose of a film is (supposedly) to tell a story or bring out certain emotions in the viewer. If it angered you, then it still did it's job. I was shocked by many events of the picture, but by the end I was cheering. <br/><br/>It kept me on my toes and the edge of my seat simultaneously. I kept jumping up, ranting, and effectively becoming a ""better door than a window"" for the rest of my group watching. If a movie can not only make me feel, but cause physical reactions, then I know this is a great one.<br/><br/>To sum it up, I only have one thing to say. It's a movie! It's there to entertain and intrigue you, no more no less. So if you are ready for that, along with many ""What the h...?!""; then sit back, relax and enjoy!!!"

","I am so glad to have seen this contender for ""Best Picture"" from last year and I fully understand how this fits into the Lifetime Achievement of a notable American director - Martin Scorsese. It still does not really extend the engaging story of the original Hong Kong thriller-cop drama ""Infernal Affairs"". I must say that I felt that the original movie was thoroughly engaging with (for me) regular-looking actors and the 2006 remake seemed a bit of a tour de force for several highly paid actors to ""earn their chops"" (i.e. salaries in the millions). The movie also served as a way for the New York-born director to work out some resentments toward authoritarian systems (e.g. city police forces, state police academies, Roman Catholic clergy, abusive relatives, alcoholic-enabling family members, plus more). My prediction is that the Academy on Feb. 25-upcoming may reward the adapted screenplay work and the direction but NOT give this the ultimate Oscar when the whole show is over. A good movie but not on the superb level that ""The Usual Suspects"" was a few years ago."

","Brilliant film, not just because it's a Scorsese film but because of who the film portray! Irish gangsters haven't been brought to film as much as Italian ones have been, we've had Saving Grace and Gangs of New York but since the bad press of Gangs of New York the Irish have been seen as stupid and unable to run a REAL crimunal organisation, but the Departed shows that we can with Jack Nicholson as the gangboss.<br/><br/>I'm full Scottish and part Irish, so it's great to see Celtic gangsters take the screen instead of the Italians. Jack Nicholson excels as Frank Costello, he portrays a violent but smart gangster perfectly. I must also say that DiCaprio is even good too, he unlike in Gangs of New York plays a role he can do. Matt Damon is great as bent cop on Costello's payroll. For fans of Irish gangster films, check out Saving Grace and the TV series Brotherhood.<br/><br/>Oh and by the way...

Jack Nicholson is the same character he always is in most of his movies except in this one he drops his r's like a good Masshole. It was fast paced and I did enjoy the violence and suspense. And I had a feeling that a lot of people were going to die throughout (hence the title). Anyway, It's been ten years since Titanic and Leo does not look like he has aged a month. It's been eleven years since the Basketball Diaries and Mark Wahlberg looks old enough to play DiCaprio's father. Anyway do not go into this expecting a whole lot of depth. Scorcese has never been able to pull off a movie where the viewer is completely surprised by the outcome. I must say Alec Baldwin is hilarious, Marky Mark is cool, and Martin Sheen is getting old, damn. And the one black guy is not in it very much, reminiscent of Samuel L. Jacksons brief brief appearance in Goodfellas. Anyway go see it, have fun, root for the good guys to come out on top, and ask yourself, why does the academy always nominate the same people year after year?

It contained that ingredient that makes for great screenplay ""same but different"". In that sense it somewhat reminded me of ""Training Day"", but that movie never lost its groove, as I feel that ""The Departed"" did. With about a half an hour to go in this film, I blinked. The movie was no longer seamless. I leaned and said to my wife, ""this is getting too long"". She nodded in agreement. At about that point I stopped caring what happened and just wanted it to be over. I think this movie could have withstood some serious editing and perhaps used a few audience reactions to tighten it up. About a third of the audience at the show I was at started laughing towards the end of the movie. Lots of blood and guts throughout, so if you're not already case hardened to that stuff, then this movie ain't for you. The acting really was great, apart from Damon (who I usually like).

The story was pretty much exactly the same.<br/><br/>The original version (Infernal Affairs)had a much more powerful ending rather than simply killing everyone off. For instance, what was the point of his old colleague showing up at the end to help him? It's like Scorsese didn't know what to do in the end. Please tell me if anyone agrees (only those who have seen the original should comment).<br/><br/>I find it rather frustrating that American cinema has run out of ideas of their own, so decided to rip off all of the foreign films to win awards.

Why would the Therapist (which had very little character development) sleep with Dicaprio so quick (there was no motivation and makes her look cheap) and how did he know where she always lived anyway is a bigger question? 5. Why didn't DiCaprio just turn in state evidence directly to a news team and blow the case wide open. He didn't have to try and capture the top guy on the top of a building. He could've called Wahlberg who he knows he can trust since he was hired by him in the first place? 6. Why didn't they have the secondary insider in the FBI earlier in the movie?...

","The Departed has fine actors (especially Jack Nicholson as the bull goose bad guy), excellent cinematography, and tight direction but all that these things add up to is an empty, soulless shell. That the film may get an Academy Award for best picture makes it hard to maintain a vision of Hollywood that involves anything more than technical proficiency.<br/><br/>In addition to Infernal Affairs, the Hong Kong film that's the apparent source of its plot, The Departed relies heavily on HBO serials. Comparison with The Wire or The Sopranos shows what The Departed lacks. Although the good guy/bad guy similarities resemble those in The Wire, any realistic portrayal of everyday life in a police department or criminal family is absent. In The Departed, a bit of brogue and mutual intimidation by rival psychopaths are all we get.<br/><br/>The consequences of the extreme violence in The Departed never go beyond small groups of gangsters and policemen. To put it mildly, this is not what happens in real life. Although the psychotherapist role may be borrowed from The Sopranos, it's forced into a stereotyped mold. Having a male client see a female therapist becomes a little like the proverbial gun that, when introduced in the first act of a play, must go off by the second. Client and therapist need to be seen in bed together before the movie's over.<br/><br/>The Departed may be worth seeing if you want to learn film technique. Just don't expect anything more than that."

Strangely this movie is inspired and made from a Chinese movie. I was a bit unhappy by hearing his  because I was not able to imagine that Martin Soccerer has to depend on an already made movie.<br/><br/>But after saying that Martin Soccerer has done a wonderful job; he has created an edge of the seat thriller, with numerous twist and turn.

I like his selections of movie and movie directors. It seems that the pairing of Martin and Lenardo is working well.<br/><br/>The end twist of the movie was the surprise of Jack Nicholsan being of FBI and pitching criminals in the state police forces. That was interesting. In this movie too I did not like the ending  because Leonardo is killed  but no regrets  because it is Martin's style of film making.<br/><br/>After seeing the movie I felt  this is the way to tell stories  which we know is fictional  they are like reading books  that are like dream and fantasies.

","Despite the fact that the Departed is in part Martin Scorsese returning to his roots, it does not quite feel the same as acclaimed Scorsese pictures such as Raging Bull, Casino, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver and Mean Streets. Indeed, newer films by Scorsese like Gangs of New York are firmly embellished with his trademark. The Departed, however, whilst not groundbreaking in story or direction, is a step up for Scorsese. He has abandoned the past and is going for something based in the present, and furthermore, his trademark touch has softened.<br/><br/>Remade from the 2002 Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs, the Departed follows a story of deception, betrayal and loyalty. Both the Boston Police Department and the local Irish mob send moles to infiltrate the opposing group. Ironically, the moles are paradoxes given the group they work for; Billy (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a rough cut cop with past connections to the mob; Colin (Matt Damon) is a straight edge opportunist with close ties to the Irish mob boss, Frank (Jack Nicholson). Both men have to earn the trust of the group they have infilitrated, and soon the line between who they work for becomes unclear. The storyline is a complex one, ridden with intrigue and deepens as the film progresses. It's unusual for Scorsese to craft something that is so based on its story, given that he goes for biopics. However, while the plot is crucial in the film, Scorsese does not pass up the chance to develop his characters and explore their psyche. It's a fine mix of both story and the people who are embroiled in it.<br/><br/>However, whilst the Departed is an unusual project for Scorsese considering what he is accustomed to, aside from that he is not hugely treading new ground. He doesn't do anything new with direction, and in the end you forget that it's a Scorsese film, as it is so largely led by its characters. Jack Nicholson is back on form with the sadistic, paternal Frank, whilst an impressive DiCaprio brings to the role the physical presence that has been lacking from his past films. Indeed, the cast is star-studded, including Ray Winstone, Alec Baldwin, Vera Farmiga, Martin Sheen and a brilliant Mark Wahlberg. On the negative side, conversely, as the film counts down to its climax, Scorsese brings the film to a lazy finish, cursed with rushed conclusions and a slightly contrived end.<br/><br/>The Departed is a film that shows Scorsese simultaneously focusing on character, direction and story, which is rare. Perhaps this is why his touch feels so distant, or perhaps the new arrangement of cast members. It's hard to tell. Nonetheless, he succeeds in making a thrilling, deep, well-crafted film that is superbly acted, but won't win him the Oscar that we've all been waiting for.<br/><br/>Atmospheric, complex, deep ... yet those loose ends remain present. It succeeds as a first rate thriller, but the Departed does not break any new ground and has by no means topped the Scorsese masterpieces."

","Since I saw the Hong Kong movie ""Infernal Affair"" first, I cannot help comparing this remade version with the original one.<br/><br/>""Infernal Affair"" is a superbly intelligent movie. It is actually not telling a mafia story, it is about the conflict, compromise and confusion of living in somebody else's life, how people want to escape such a life but can't due to some objective and subjective motives.<br/><br/>If the original work is already outstanding, the point of the remaking should be showing some different perspective on those outstanding parts. Unfortunately, this time ""The Departed"" went exactly the opposite of that direction.<br/><br/>""The Departed"" hasn't closely and concretely portrayed the innermost struggle of the two moles, and how arduously and awkwardly they interact with the exterior world, especially for Matt Damon's role. This is the reason why many plots and behaviors of the characters make no sense. What even worse is, the most memorable, sensational scenes are still inherited from the original movie, Scorsese barely created any improvements.<br/><br/>Scorsese abandoned the beauty of the original work and concentrated too much on the details of the gangsters and cops' business, which makes it a mediocre mafia film. How their tasks are conspired and operated, how their transactions are dealt, how the boss cultivates his jackal, these typical Hollywood scenarios are not supposed to be the focus of this film.<br/><br/>Those, who think this movie is much better than the original version, certainly don't have a deep comprehension of the culture in the Far East countries. Since Hollywood now is going through an era of running out of the neat and innovate ideas, it's only fair to introduce some great foreign language films from other regions by remaking them and earn a hell lot box office. But please at least do some homework beforehand, to thoroughly understand an artistic work from a completely different culture and background. Don't make everything too ""Hollywood""."
"bfetter","5","0","3","25 December 2006"," Go see the original!
","A few years ago I saw the Hong Kong police thriller ""Infernal Affairs"", of which movie ""The Departed"" is a remake. I wrote this review of it on the IMDb: ""Great movie! In the same league as Michael Mann's ""Heat"", but it does not ""Out-heat"" him, as the tag-line on the DVD-box suggests. On the other hand: this movie brings back the exciting and exotic feeling of the first John Woo films. A word of advice to Martin Scorsese, who's named as the director to make an American remake: forget about Matt Damon (one of America's worst and most boring actors) and Leonardo DiCaprio (a fat has-been these days)! It would be an offense to the great original movie to cast actors like them in the main roles. Forget about the box-office, Marty! Just make a good movie! I suggest actors like Edward Norton and Tim Roth for the main roles, and for example Al Pacino as the police captain, or the main hood."" Now, having seen ""The Departed"" I still agree with myself. On the other hand: this movie makes the original even better. (By the way: there are also two sequels: ""Infernal Affiars II"" and ""III"", but don't waste your time watching those; they are complete rubbish!) Don't get me wrong: ""The Departed"" is not a bad movie at all, and I've always respected Martin Scorsese. He's one of the great modern directors, and has made some fantastic movies (I don't think I have to name them for you). But when you're watching a remake, and can't get the original out of your head, there's something wrong. In the first place there's a reason why the aforementioned DVD-box hints on Michael Mann. The original was clearly inspired by his films. So, in my opinion, he was the perfect director to make this American remake. He could have given the film the looks and feel the original has. Scorsese clearly made another choice, and made the film less glamorous, and put it more in the tradition of say ""Mean Streets"". Also, because Mann is in fact not a mainstream director, I trust he would have kept the feel of the story, with is essential to why ""Infernal Affairs"" was so attractive. I admit, Scorsese isn't really mainstream either, but he and his scriptwriter made some ridiculous changes to the story, typical for ""Hollywood"" movies. The most irritating two: in this version the two main opponents (the undercover cop and the undercover hood) share the same love-interest (very unbelievable), and there's something you could call a ""happy ending"". Why oh why? The original has an ending which leaves much more to our imagination. Then, about the actors! I think Jack Nicholson is a great actor, but as the mafia boss he is to much over the top, as he unfortunately often is now-days (Eric Tsang in the original is less of a caricature, and much more powerful). Leonardo DiCaprio surprised me; he's actually quiet good. Matt Damon is still boring and overrated (by chance I also saw him this weekend in John Dahl's great movie ""Rounders""in which he's a college kid, a perfect role for him, and is played of the screen by his friend in the movie, Edward Norton). Martin Sheen as the police captain is OK, but oh sweat dreams, it would have been so beautiful when De Niro played this role. A reversal of what he and Pacino did in ""Heat"", but I know it's very unlikely they will ever work ""together"" again. Finally the music: there's really something wrong here! Wake up Marty, this is 2006! But all I hear in the movie is music from the sixties. Don't get me wrong; I'm a big Stones fan, so it's good to hear ""Gimme Shelter"" and ""Let It Loose"". But the only music from these days in the film is by the Dropkick Murphys (of whom I'm not really a fan, but that's my problem). Also in this aspect, your average Michael Mann film, and even an episode of ""The Sopranos"" is much more up to date. In short: I think Scorsese is getting a bit old."
"brewsterschmidt","6","0","2","17 December 2006"," it's really not that good
","First of all , I have to state that I haven't seen ""Infernal Affairs"", so no comparisons between the two movies are possible. Judging the movie on that basis I have to say that I cannot understand all these rave reviews. Most of all I think that M.S. has made far better films, this is not a great one.<br/><br/>Some points of criticism: Apart from the fact that the film is too long, that some of the characters are not well developed and some stupid- the police psychiatrist, for example (by the way: is there any film where these people are not depicted as insecure people or morons?), it is the way in which violence is depicted here. At the beginning of the movie with the first execution scenes M.S does it right, violence here is shown as an awful, gruesome thing. Later in the movie,with the killing of Nicholson and especially in the elevator scene it looks like part taken from an ego shooter game, part a joke. It doesn't work. And the swearing. Absolutely nothing against that usually, but it's too much and ends up being a joke and then boring. Or are policemen like that, are they generally -like the gangsters- neurotic-psychotic idiots? It's all overdone , I think , from Baldwin to Wahlberg. And I think it gets the wrong reactions from the audience. It's playing to a teen audience. Despite the interesting conflicts, there is no real depth in this movie, nothing is really touching. And , last but not least: Why have Wahlberg come out in the end and kill the Damon-character so that a kind of justice is restored? Was it like that in ""Infernal Affairs""? Well, I will check it out to see if the original is better than this one.<br/><br/>I wish M.S. would do something like ""The Aviator"" or ""Good Fellas"" again."

"gorgeouzz","7","0","2","14 December 2006"," Interesting, full of twists.. great for those who haven't seen Infernal Affairs, cringe-worthy for those who have...
","This film is made into a movie of its own. Although based on Infernal Affairs (HK production), the story have been slightly altered perhaps to fit the culture of American street gangs. I do admit, there are many things I do not like about the film, being a fan of Infernal Affairs, it is more wishy-washy, and Jack Nicholson was... well.. not that wonderful. I read somewhere that apparently Jack Nicholson didn't even research for his role, so he just ""naturally"" played him.. so you can see, this character ended up being more of an ""evil clown named IT"", rather than the terrifying controlling leader of the mob. That really disappointed me, because characters in control (Chinese Triad bosses, Godfather, etc) are all very strong, controlling and more level-headed characters, whereas Jack Nicholson's character is more a clown than a boss. Another cringe-worthy scene is where they hired poor Cantonese speakers to act as triads from China (speaking Cantonese?? you mean they're from HK or Canton?). Any Cantonese speaker will cringe and laugh at how poorly they spoke Cantonese! I know that's not overly important for those who doesn't understand Cantonese.. but just makes the film more tacky.. you know... just unrealistic .. so it's tacky.<br/><br/>Leo DiCaprio was surprisingly good, hands down for his magnificent performance - a great mature comeback from his gone teen-heart-throb era.<br/><br/>Besides that, the story of course is brilliant. No one can deny or hate the story-line, as it is magnificent, unique, and clever both in the HK and the Hollywood version. My vote is given for the story line and Leo."

"Pavel-8","7","0","1","9 December 2006"," If only it had finished well...
","On the heels of the annual fall movie lull comes the beginning of Oscar season. And you know what that means: lots of pretentious films that aren't very good! Yay! First in line, from Martin Scorsese, the man who brought us the overrated borefest that is ""The Aviator"", is ""The Departed""...or is it? Plow on, fair reader...<br/><br/>Generally speaking, Martin Scorsese's films all have a similar theme: exploring the complex lives of unlikeable people. His latest is The Departed, which follows two Boston police academy graduates who take drastically disparate paths. The movie is tortuous in every sense of the word. Plot twists are prevalent; people are not always who they seem; and deceit is the rule rather than the exception. Therefore Scorsese is the perfect director for this film, which can be neatly compared to a good piece of rope. (Go with me on this one, okay?) ""The Departed"" opens with a handful of story tresses that are related but different. Each arc appears to be going the same direction, although the connection isn't immediately evident. But the big picture soon begins to come into focus as the strands are woven together. The noteworthy editing of Thelma Schoonmaker, who has chopped most of Scorsese's work, contributes mightily to this effect. Early on the movie is nearly disorienting, jumping rapidly from story to story at almost random intervals, as quickly as second by second. This fitfulness soon settles into a comfortable equilibrium, in part because one becomes accustomed to it, and in part because the stories braid themselves tighter and tighter.<br/><br/>As the film finds its rhythm, it occasionally soars on the wings of its stellar cast. In their parallel roles, Leonardo DiCaprio continues to mature with his hard-edged part; Matt Damon plays an interesting spin-off of his altar-boy image, and as a local crime boss, Jack Nicholson is...well...Jack Nicholson. Even though the hard-nosed characters are not particularly likable in themselves, Scorsese takes the time to provide glimpses into the quieter parts of their lives, not just the adrenaline-pumping moments. Like the characters or not, this makes them more human, more interesting, and more worthy of sympathy. It also produces the movie's best moments, which are not entirely congruous with the rest of the film.<br/><br/>As a Boston-based crime drama, ""Departed"" virtually demands comparison to 2003's stellar ""Mystic River"". Clint Eastwood's film holds a few things high above Scorsese's, namely a soul. Like Kevin Bacon's detective, Vera Farmiga's fresh-faced police psychiatrist brings some semblance of a moral center to the project. But as she is sucked into the vortex of chicanery, she slowly blends into her surroundings like Darwin's peppered moths. Another key difference lies in the closing act. River didn't wrap things up cleanly, but satisfyingly left story arcs somewhat resolved while still open. ""Departed"", on the other hand, tries too hard to tie a pretty bow on this occasional present to moviegoers, and that is where Scorsese's project disappoints most.<br/><br/>Regardless of how strong a piece of rope appears at its center, the ends are what define much of its value. Likewise with a film, if the final act isn't finished well, the film loses much of its punch, as ""Departed"" does. Rather than tie off the end or perhaps unbraid the story lines, Departed instead sloppily hacks off the end of the stories that pull the viewer along. The final scenes may seem like an acceptable finish upon initial glance, but a closer inspection reveals not a snip and a solder, but a absurdly quick chop-chop, a slovenly deus ex machina that jarringly diverges from the slow build of the previous two-plus hours. It almost feels like one of those wisely discarded alternate endings on a DVD, like something someone jokingly threw out as an lazy way to conclude matters.<br/><br/>With its frequent outbursts of intense violence and words, hard-living characters, and twisty story lines, ""The Departed"" is a Scorsese work through and through. At times the director, aided by a loaded cast, provides wildly entertaining moments and scenes. But like a couple of Steven Spielberg's recent movies (""War of the Worlds"", ""Munich""), the discordant final act prevents this movie from attaining greater heights. Perhaps Departed could have joined the pantheon of mafia-type films (""Godfather I/II"", ""Goodfellas""), but the late shortcomings prevent it from reaching even the strong second tier (""Untouchables"", ""Road to Perdition"", etc.).<br/><br/>Bottom Line: A slow but steady start, a strong middle third, and a weak last act make ""The Departed"" recommended only to those interested in seeing it for genre- or Oscar-related reasons. 6 of 10."
"last_samurai","7","0","2","4 December 2006"," Imagine a great bicycle kick, now imagine it hits the post..
","I can not believe the difference of the satisfaction level between the first and the second halves and there's one obvious reason for that: The screenplay!! Even before you have read or seen any comment about this movie, your expectations are high since the cast is amazing and it's a cop vs mafia( although you really see it's not that black and white when the movie starts) situation where you think that the names in the cast will pull out a great job right? Well, THAT, you got!! Even more than you think which is easily realized by the outstanding Di Caprio performance( which however i believe is boosted to its limits thanks to Nicholson more than Scorsese). The movie gets you right where it wants starting from the first lines in the means of direction, acting, pace etc.. It sets up the story, neighborhood, main characters perfectly.. It builds up beautifully with its storyline and even the choice of music adds up to your inference power about the events. However, you start to raise your eyebrow to some small mistakes characters start to do towards the end. A little bit of chin scratching is added to that when the mistakes become more obvious and you find yourself praying not to walk out with an awful ending. Finally, the screenplay collapses towards the very end. I mean, what the heck was William Monahan thinking? The original Infernal Affairs screenplay was much better. I believe he also wrote the screenplay for 'Kingdom of Heaven' which I think was also lame. I am giving some serious thinking on not to reach to my pocket to buy a movie ticket if i find out that this guy is involved! You simply don't have the luxury to make mistakes in a screenplay where reality, accuracy or consistency affect the overall rating of the film more than the average. This is no 'Daredevil' or some other kind of fantasy movie and i definitely can't show the same tolerance as a viewer. But STILL, it is a great movie and I definitely recommend that you see it and decide for yourself but beware for it's like watching Ronaldinho perform a great bicycle kick which hits the post, having an amazing foreplay without a happy ending or meeting the girl of your dreams and then finding out she's a lesbian."

","Martin Scorsese and his wonderful editor Thelma Schoonmaker, certainly know how to open a film. The degree of visual energy and panache in the first twenty minutes of The Departed is absolutely glorious, beautifully thrilling. I wish I could say the same of the rest of the movie, which, while enormously entertaining, has so many twists and turns, and is so long that after a while one would like to get off the fun ride. It is extremely violent and as happens with all movies that depend on intrincate plots, at a certain point one asks very logical questions of things that are not happening but should. Such as ""how is it possible that the Irish mafiosi controlled by a fun, over the top Jack Nicholson haven't figured out by now who the rat is""? The Departed is delightful because everybody in it is a pro: Nicholson goes to town hamming it up, but his relish is contagious and he is wonderful. Matt Damon is extremely fine as a cold, professional, ruthless villain. I'm glad he was cast against type. Di Caprio is quite good as his counterpart, a mole in the mafia. And the rest are adorable pros: my beloved Ray Winstone, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and even Mark Wahlberg, trying real hard to come up with the goods and acquitting himself nicely. The Departed touches upon recurrent themes in Scorsese's work: true morality, human hypocrisy, the corruption of the soul, how easy it is for evil to run rampant in this world, how very f***d up is human nature. The movie, as entertaining as it is, has substance, and is the best thing Scorsese has done in years. The one weak link I found was the subplot with the female shrink, played, not too convincingly in my opinion, by Vera Farmiga. She falls in love with both Damon and DiCaprio and to me that's already gilding the lily. Still, if you want to see what a master of movie making can do, run to The Departed and enjoy the mayhem. One big nitpick: too much rock and roll music in every scene."

","The Departed is a cop movie, through and through, with almost as much mafia flavor thrown in. It could be considered part of the gangster genre, I suppose, but with the double agent detectives being the major players (DiCaprio and Damon), I stick by my original classification. So yeah, this movie has a little bit of everything. Not in that it seems mashed together, but in that it feels real. The characters are deep, constantly living even when they weren't on screen, and the plot line is rich. There's plenty of emotion, both raw and tamedfor those people that like to cry or clap at the end of a movie, lots of guns and blood, and laugh out loud humor delivered via Alec Baldwin and Mark Walberg. Acting is excellent, as to be expected. It hooks you from the moment you sit down andas clichéd as this may beit never lets go.<br/><br/>My only qualm would have to be that the editing was as choppy as a baboon's arse is red. Martin Scorsese, the director, didn't finish the editing until a week before the release, but I would have been happy to have had it delayed a month and seen it at its best. At many points you see characters from an angle and then the angle will change and they will be standing somewhere else. I expected more in that department.<br/><br/>It's a must see, though.

","This is by no means a terrible movie, and indeed if you haven't watched the Infernal Affairs trilogy, or just don't believe in having to do anything that resembles reading when watching a movie, then it certainly works. The best moments in The Departed pretty much coincide with the best moments in Infernal Affairs, and all in all the movie benefits greatly mostly from the ingenious concept behind the movie.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most damning criticism I can think of with regards to Scorcese's remake is that apart from the montage of archive footage at the very beginning of the movie (possibly an after-effect from the cut and paste job he did on No Direction Home) there was nothing else in this movie, cinematically speaking, which marked it as a Scorcese movie. To me, it felt like this movie could have been shot by any director in Hollywood. Even Scorcese's gift of ""right song, right moment"" seemed to be on the wane.<br/><br/>But special mention must go to Jack Nicholson for the most outrageous, over-the-top hamming up I have seen in the cinema for some time. Never the most restrained of actors, Nicholson clearly relishes the opportunity to play the trademark ""Scorcesean Bastard"", and the man chews the scenery like a dedicated gourmand. One expects a runner to be on hand to give the man indigestion tablets at the end of each scene. I found myself actually pining for the less-showy and thoroughly reliable blandness of Alec Baldwin after a few minutes of Jack. Everyone else turns in perfectly decent performances, but was surprised to find that it was Mark Wahlberg who steals the show with a memorable performance, without having to stoop to Nicholson's exaggerated theatrics.<br/><br/>All in all a rather disappointing effort, and certainly not the return to form that many critics seemed to be saying it is. It's certainly better than Gangs of New York, but really doesn't even compare to ""The King of Comedy"" let alone ""Taxi Driver"" or ""Raging Bull"". I would urge people willing to enjoy a genuinely original and innovative film to check out ""Infernal Affairs"". The mere fact that Martin Scorcese was pulled on board to direct the remake surely should tip you off that it really is something quite special."

"jimmy-304","8","0","1","24 November 2006"," Continuity Problems, Etc.
","I liked this movie a great deal, but there were continuity problems that really annoyed me. For example:<br/><br/>The scene where Madolyn (Vera Farmiga) is moving into Colin's (Matt Damon's) condo. He pulls a picture of her (as a child) out of the box. They talk about it, then he says it's going to hang in the bedroom - and takes it in there - presumably to hang it. Later in the film, Billy (Leonardo DiCaprio) comes to Madolyn's apartment where there are still boxes of stuff being readied for her move - one can only assume she needed to make multiple trips. Billy and Madolyn talking and he pulls a picture from one of the boxes and comments on it. But it's the same picture that has already been moved into Colin's condo!<br/><br/>Also, there's a scene where Billy gives Madolyn a package with instructions on what to do with it if he is killed. You never hear anything more about it. The contents of the package are never revealed, but it's obvious it's something that will clear Billy and divulge who the ""rats"" are. However, since there's never any mention of it after that, it seems totally unnecessary to the film - more filler than anything else.<br/><br/>I also have a problem with the ending (this is not a spoiler). The appearance of a rat on the balcony was the hokiest thing I ever saw. I can't believe Scorsese would stoop so low. What the Hell was he thinking?!!"
"ruby_fff","7","0","1","22 November 2006"," The popular Hong Kong police-triad drama ""Infernal Affairs"" has a solid screenplay, enabled ""The Departed"" a worthy adapted version with its stellar cast
","When I saw the trailer for ""The Departed"" - just snippets from the movie, I thought how very much like Hong Kong's ""Infernal Affairs"" aka 'Mou Gaan Dou' 2002. There's no mention up front that it's a remake, but the impressive quadruple leads with Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen plus Mark Wahlberg, under Martin Scorsese's direction is simply irresistible. For first-time viewers who didn't get to see the original Hong Kong's ""Infernal Affairs,"" the western back-story, characters and screenplay adapted to U.S. setting as a police-Mafia movie can stand on its own.<br/><br/>For those who have appreciated ""Infernal Affairs"" Hong Kong delivery, subtitles and all, with the irreproachable Tony Leung Chui Wai (in many director Wong Kar Wai's films: 2046; In the Mood For Love; Happy Together; Chungking Express) playing opposite the ever versatile singer-actor-can do no wrong Andy Lau (in ""Full-time Killer"" and many popular Asian romantic comedies, love stories, action drama, period or contemporary) - there is no comparison to the superior original. The layered plot line, the subtle performances from both cop & mole 'undercovers' - the literal translation of the Chinese film title can be 'no defining boundaries/rules' - a cop as mole and a mole as cop mixed in the police and triad worlds. How the writers came up with such an intriguing plot is beyond fascination. (Dialogs in 'The Departed' mostly can be picked up as direct translation from the Hong Kong version; the female part is expanded more for Vera Farmiga, just as Wahlberg's role is more fleshed out and critical, too.) The collaborative efforts of co-directors, Lau Wai Keung and Mak Siu Fai, with strong supporting cast, namely Anthony Wong as 'Wong Sir' who knows, understands Tony Leung's cop character, while Eric Tsang as 'Hon Sam' the villainous boss that appears to be amiable yet 'black-faced' in an instant - truly made ""Infernal Affairs"" an unforgettable Hong Kong film experience. Highly recommend - available on DVD.<br/><br/>On remakes in 2006, director Tony Goldwyn's ""The Last Kiss"" adapted by writer Paul Haggis (again), who provided steady ingredients for Zach Braff to shine in the leading role, and quite an opportunity for Blythe Danner paired with the ever so nuanced Tom Wilkinson as the parents - the remake version is actually satisfying with a more fulfilling ending than the rather abrupt one in the Italian original ""L'Ultimo Bacio"" 2001."
"powerfull_jedi","9","0","1","21 November 2006"," The only other Scorcese movie I've really liked
","Cape Fear was the first and only and as of today, The Departed is the second. A great crime/thriller, talking about an insider for the mob in the police force(Damon) and a insider for the cops in the mob(Leo DiCaprio). It doesn't hurt to have also a great cast including the likes of Martin Sheen , Alec Baldwin and Mark Whalberg and of course, Jack Nicholson who plays the Irish mob's big boss. Add also great dialog(the movie's pushes swearing like there's no tomorrow and Alec Baldwin's character's remark towards the Patriot Act was priceless) which will provide you with a couple of chuckles and a plot filled with twists and turns(the last 10 minutes might will be a major shock for the audience). Acting is great, though you'll notice that Jack Nicholson once again plays that type of character you'd come to expect from his movies, slightly more tamed, but steals the show nevertheless. Leo plays pretty much a similar role as seen on Gangs of New York(a movie which I strongly disliked), but was well suited here. Matt Damon seems to be having fun with his role as Costello's(Nicholson) insider pulling all the strings making sure his father-figure(it's explained in the beginning of the movie) stays untouchable and in turn making life a living hell for our undercover hero(DiCaprio). My only gripe was a few soundtrack complaints(that Irish hardcore mix got a little on my nerves), the only lead female character who doesn't do much but is connected to the two main characters and some Chinese gangsters look pretty silly but that's pretty much it as far as flaws go. One last note, do not let kids see this, it's extremely violent and foul language roam free. Crime movie buffs will get their guaranteed fix."

","I watched it because I liked to see how a Hollywood adaptation of a HK flick comes out. I watched the Infernal Affair years ago and still enjoy the DVD.<br/><br/>The adaptation is really well done to fit American audiences. Compare to the original Infernal Affairs, it misses the subtle tension and the melancholy portrayed by the original. In the original, the relationship between the mole ( as Billy in The Departed ) and his boss in the police ( split as Dignam/Queenan ) was a very strong one. This piece is especially missed. Also, the scenery played in HK is very different from that of Boston. It is somewhat surrealistic in the original scene where the crime boss was finished off. On the other hand, the ending of The Departed is more convincing than the Infernal Affair.<br/><br/>What can I say, difference in movie culture makes two epics of their own."
"kingmonkey","7","0","2","19 November 2006"," Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants, Falling Short Of The Height
","The Departed is a film I wanted to fall in love with. Instead, I ended up having a prolonged, non-committal fling with it.<br/><br/>The cop-criminal crossover film genre has an impressive benchmark already, namely De Niro and Pacino in Michael Mann's Heat. Scorsese was brave to tackle similar territory in the first place, although granted The Departed takes a vastly different approach to the subject.<br/><br/>This is not a film that will spoon-feed the audience. Any knowledge of the broad plot before you see the film is a bonus, but be wary of spoilers. One cannot fault either the screenplay, something which treats the audience as intelligent, nor can one grumble about the work Scorsese does, as excellent as ever.<br/><br/>The problem comes in with the cast. Why Scorsese is so hot for Di Caprio is beyond me - I will confess this is the best of the Scorsese-Di Caprio films to date, but still all too often Di Caprio looks just out of place and out of his depth. He just does not have the range nor the appearance to pull off the character he portrays.<br/><br/>Conversley, Matt Damon's boy-next-door appearance works to his advantage in this one. I trust that this film opens up some doors to rather more substantial film parts in the future.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson is good in this. He does not give ""the performance of his lifetime"". He does not give ""one of his top five performances"". He probably has done enough to get a number of ""supporting actor"" awards here, there and everywhere. If this is Jack symbolically handing over the reins to a new generation of actors, it is a misguided one.<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest disappointment in the casting area is the lack of use of real gems. Martin Sheen, possibly the best actor in the world today to cast as a head or chief of any Police division, seldom does more than sit at a desk. Mark Wahlberg gives a Grade-A, Boogie Nights level performance that suggests maybe he should have been given one of the two leads, but then again who would play his important part in his absence? Finally, a round of applause for Mr Alec Baldwin - a great, understated delivery of a support role that indicates he has at last matured into one of the leading character actors of this era.<br/><br/>Sigh, Oscar talk. If they give Scorsese awards for this, it will just underline the injustice for him not being given such things for Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and so on. If Stanley Kubrick never got an Oscar for his directing, then no director really needs one for any reason other than a nice ornament.<br/><br/>I find it hard to imagine where, with the cast, crew and director involved, anyone who would want to see this film would trouble themselves with a review beforehand, but if you want an opinion then it is to see the film, but hold no expectations of greatness."

","Scorsese does a good job in making a sassy action film, but the story line is not incredibly sophisticated. There are too many ""main persons"" involved in the plot, and the dynamics between them are more sketched. The different events are loosely connected, and one gains the impression that the film just moves from one setting to the next without any good story underneath of it. Additionally, once scene can be seen as condescending towards other cultures, when Costello emphasizes three times towards foreign criminals how ""things are done here"", in the States -- like, we are gangsters, but we still have a better culture. Poor is also the way Scorsese puts the only women into place -- even though being a psychologist, and in touch with the key persons, she remains passive throughout the movie. One can only think, how would that be if the role was played by a guy? On the positive side, however, the film has some great acting to offer. Especially DiCaprio sticks out and really being Colin Sullivan, authentic to the smallest detail. Vera Farmiga, within her role, also plays wonderful, and Jack Nicholson is in his best as a bastard. So, four points for that, but to be a really good movie, but a lot is missing for it to be a really outstanding movie."

","Scorcese is a wonderful director. I will always go and see a Scorcese movie and that's that. But this is a weak Scorcese movie. It is not a bad movie by any means. I mean, it engages your attention and you can watch it all the way through. But by Scorcese standards it is passable. Merely passable.<br/><br/>Apparently there isn't much to choose between the ItalianAmericans and IrishAmericans. So who cares that these people are IrishAmericans ? Apart from the accent they may just as well have been ItalianAmericans. Apparently there isn't much to choose between cops and crooks (although which of the two would you prefer to respond to your 911/999 calls ?), but the movie doesn't really bite the bullet on this. Really, it just takes a long convoluted route to saying: good guys win in THE END.<br/><br/>Considering the gory body count of people who get their heads blown off, this is dull, routine stuff. Going through the motions. Overlong. The attempted 'love interest' was borderline silly with both 'cop' and 'crook' falling for the same woman. It added nothing, it subtracted credibility. Better to have left it out altogether. What on earth was the point of that episode with the Chinese gang and the microprocessors ? Presumably it was some kind of reference to the original (which I haven't seen). All this communication by mobile phone stuff just seemed annoyingly modish (and surely not a secure means of communication for crooks who know they are under high-level surveillance). These bits and lots more could have been cut. It should really have been a 93 min movie not 150 min. The acting is non-descript at best, at times just plain naff: Nicholson badly over-indulges himself in a couple of scenes; Damon is as wooden as ever (he'll never match the best part he ever played - which was in 'Team America'); DiCaprio was the best but didn't have material of enough subtlety to work with - the psychological effects of being under deep cover like this is potentially fascinating. Again, the movie never really gets to grips with what it has taken on.<br/><br/>Whilst watching this movie I kept thinking this COULD have been a really good movie. And I was thinking: I must finally get around to seeing Infernal Affairs. I wonder whether Scorcese hasn't so much lost the plot these days as simply lost his place. Violence has been done bigger, smarter, wittier and more stylishly by Scorcese himself (Casino, GoodFellas) and the likes of Tarantino and Cronenberg and many others since. Likewise the blurred moral distinction between cops and crooks. And everybody knows there are far too many dubious re-makes these days. We don't need the likes of Scorcese wasting his talents on them as well."

","Any movie having as high-profile cast as this one is bound to generate interest. Being directed by Martin Scorcese is just the icing on the cake. However, if you're expecting a classic comparable to 'Raging Bull' and 'Taxi Driver' then you'll be slightly disappointed. The plot twists and turns its way through a myriad of sub-plots and the 'who's chasing who' story comes to a terrific head when both sides meet at the building where Martin Sheen comes to meet his informant. Jack Nicholson was superb, as always, playing the dirty scumbag role in which everyone loves to hate him. Matt Damon revel led in his shady and slimy role, Di Caprio gave another example of his growing stature as a decent actor while Baldwin, Wahlberg and Sheen all played their part reasonably well. The sudden downfall of Nicholson and the abrupt ending slightly damages the movie's credentials. However, the mole-chasing-mole story is excellently depicted and this movie is definitely recommended for all the Nicholson or Scorcese fans out there."

","The only serious complain I have may be that in the original Hong Kong version, there was a high sense of honor and great pride deeply inside DiCaprio's character, which served as his only psychological balance when he was forced to do dirty works. Because he had been undercover for so long, his only wish, the only thing kept him going, was the promise that someday he will be a regular policeman and will be able to shout to bad guys: Police! That was also the reason he joined the police academy. I think this is essential to make the character believable. A minor complain is that Damon's character should have some sense of guilty. After all, before he was promoted so that he would be truly useful, he only worked as a policeman as others. Not all his work could be in conflict with his dirty interests. He should have some internal struggle for quite a while that he would be at least less willing when he leaked the critical info."

","Most people don't know that 'The Departed' is a remake of the absolutely excellent 'Infernal Affairs' Hong Kong thriller. I saw the original film a few months ago, and it was excellent. I must say, we Americans know how to screw up a perfectly good movie. Most of the characters in The Departed are so over the top and unrealistic, it's set in Boston so everyone has the obligatory horrible Boston accent. And whats up with Mark Whalberg and his hair-doo and unnecessary bad attitude?? Most of the Police characters are running their own Departments and they are relative children, so it seems unrealistic, even for fast burners. Matt Damon and Mark Whalberg are waaay too young to run those Departments, barely old enough to be street Cops. Anyway, where-as the original was a Masterpiece of suspense and betrayal, The Departed veers off into unnecessary directions, with unnecessary characters that add nothing to the story. Jack Nicholson as the crime Boss who still does the lowly shakedown at 60+ just seems crude, when he has so many henchmen, but his acting was spot-on as usual and needed more dialog. The Departed was OK, but the original was so much better so I suggest you see that and then come back and see the departed for some perspective."

"solanki17","6","0","1","9 November 2006"," Infernally disappointing
","A lot of good reviews and positive comments have been made about this movie. Unfortunately I don't think the movie lives up to most of them. Its difficult for me to review this movie without referring to the Hong Kong Super original which is a classic in its own right, Infernal Affairs. The Departed literally takes the exact same storyline and swaps the Chinese Triads with the Irish Boston underworld. The story revolves around to central characters Sullivan (played by the wooden Damon) & Costigan (the awesome Di Caprio) both are having there strings pulled, one by the gangster boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and the other by the Police Departments undercover chief Quinnin (Martin Sheen). Both characters are effectively ""rats"" for the bad guys and good guys. The interesting part of the story is when the line between good & bad starts to become blurred and each undercover doesn't know where they stand. This part of the storyline was done with great impact and good characterisation in the Chinese original. As often happens with remakes, re-works or re imaginations upon an original, The Departed doesn't do this too well. In fact it tries to hard to adapt the storyline to suit the American audiences. By throwing in a love interest for both central characters to chase and also have characters like Mark Whalberg's comic police officer (although he does this really well). Its quite funny Scorsese is one of the greatest directors of all time and for him to take an existing storyline and take the good bits and copy them and leave out the excellent bits and replace them with mushy justifiable movie going fare is just a bit of a cop out. Don't get me wrong, for those of you who have never seen or heard of the original or never even knew The departed was even a remake they will probably love this film. But for those of us fortunate enough to have seen the great Infernal Affairs will think what have they done to my classic Hong Kong Thriller. Scorsese films usually have memorable scenes, but I can only think of a few, memorable lines are even more sparse. Where as his classic ""Goodfellas"" begins with a truly memorable line ""As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster"". One trait Scorsese keeps from goodfellas, Casino, Gangs of New York is the use of a great soundtrack and The Departed doesn't disappoint with the Boston Irish Bagpipes used to aplomb. It maybe a bit ""heavy Metal"" but it works well with the theme. The huge collection of quality actors from Jack Nicholson, Ray Winstone, Mark Whalberg, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin all do well but none are a patch on Leonardo and they are all let down by the po faced Matt Damon and his unemotional turn as Sullivan, though it could be argued his character has been so drained of emotion his own life it just adds to the performance. Compared to most of the trash out in the cinemas right now namely ""Borat"", I'd give the Departed some time if you want to go to the cinema, but to wait for it on DVD isn't a bad thing either. Never thought I'd say that about a Scorsese film but its true. <br/><br/>If you want to see a great performance with a good but not great storyline and have no expectations in comparison to the original then you'll enjoy, what more can I say !"

A Sean Penn Oscar should be his though comparisons to Mystic River may dim his just award! Damon is truly outstanding in a role as a tough FBI agent whose connection to South Boston overpowers his potential decency. Of course, Nicholson is, well, Nicholson, the consummate actor who owns every role and scares the bejeezus out of everyone, including some in the theater. I loved it! I'd see it again."

By all means, all the acting is great. Kudos to Wahlberg, Sheen and Damon. Jack Nicholson is over the top but so what. The film is full of tension yet it's not the kind that makes you nervous but rather it's the type that is thrilling and exciting.

","I am reluctant to give any movie a 10, but this one deserves it. Not only is it well-acted, the plot (though a tad difficult to follow for those unfamiliar with Scorcese) is exceptionally engaging. You do have to suspend your disbelief when it comes to Nicholson's on-again, off-again Bostonian accent, but who cares? I thought Titanic had tanked DiCaprio's career, but this film shows his true talent as an adult actor. The same can be said for Wahlberg, who proved himself years ago with Fear and Boogie Nights and continues to be a true pleasure to watch. Matt Damon, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin give performances unlike any I've ever seen from them, and I've seen 'em all! If you can't see this movie in the theater, rent it as soon as it's available.<br/><br/>If I were able to ask Scorcese one question, it would be, ""What's with your attachment to the Rolling Stones, huh?"""
"Robert_duder","8","0","1","3 November 2006"," Scorcese creates a whole new classic
","The Departed will hands down become an instant classic further positioning director Martin Scorcese in the cinema hall of fame. This is Scorcese's biggest public hit now grossing over 100 million dollars. The cast is brilliant, an ensemble the likes we have yet to see this year. The story is gritty, violent and captivating. Despite a bit of a dragging tempo it only leaves you open to be more blind sided by the shocking twists when they do happen. The climax and the end of the film will literally move you to the edge of your seat as it all boils over. It's a thriller, crime drama, mob story and delivers everything it promises and best of all it seems to be simultaneously a critical and viewer smash success and I predict certain Oscar wins as locked in the bag perhaps even a nomination for long overdue Leonardo DiCaprio. I won't say it's one of my favorite films of the year, in fact I toyed between 8 and 9 but the film has to be given respect and points for it's cast, gritty direction and style while I still sit on top of the opinion that it flows a little slowly and almost predictable at times.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio sincerely knocks one out of the park as young, if not slightly naive rookie cop Billy Costigan. Despite this huge incredible ensemble cast DiCaprio stands out as really doing an amazing job. Forced undercover in this brutal Boston mob war he struggles on the line between good and evil but holds his moral ground when all is said and done. If DiCaprio doesn't get an Oscar Nod for this portrayal there is something wrong!! Matt Damon plays DiCaprio's counterpart in more ways than one playing slick and dirty cop Colin Sullivan. Whereas DiCaprio is undercover on the mob side, Damon is undercover in the police precinct for the mob. Damon's character is almost the mirror image opposite of everything DiCaprio's character is as they play this cat and mouse game with each other without ever really coming into contact until the final scenes. It's brilliant and wonderfully played out. I found Damon a little much, almost over acting, but still his character was a sleazy bad guy that you definitely detest. And then there is Jack. Honestly...what can you say about Jack Nicholson. The guy is an icon, he's a master, a genius and rumor has it that Scorcese even gave Jack full authority over his lines in the film telling him to go with it...I mean he's Jack!! He plays the head of this crime family Frank Costello and although he is portrayed as the incarnation of evil he doesn't really come across as overtly brutal but a leader nonetheless. He ups the ante to this story by leaps and bounds and DiCaprio and him are brilliant together. Mark Wahlberg plays a smaller supporting role as Detective Dignam, in charge of DiCaprio's undercover work. His role is a brutal, mouthy, loud man who just really wants to get the job done and make sure the undercover work is not being screwed. All in all Wahlberg gets everything he wants but his role is unfortunately small. I think he has really done some terrific work as of lately and this is a great performance by him. And finally the terrific Martin Sheen in an unfortunately small supporting role as Oliver Queenan, the aging detective who convinces DiCaprio to go undercover. Sheen is terrific on screen and could easily hold a leading role even in his aging days but he gets a supporting role that is decent.<br/><br/>If nothing else The Departed has plenty of surprises in store for you. It's not like it has a twist to it...the story is almost predictable but nonetheless you will find yourself shocked by some of the outcomes the scenes involved. Just when you think you're in for a heavy handed drama the guns come out blazing so to speak. If nothing else this could the crime drama of the year considering the slightly disappointing Black Dahlia and Hollywoodland. The Departed is a throwback to the great films of the eighties with hundreds of foul words used, brutally bloody violence, and an almost film noire feel to it. Scorcese has this picture locked up because fans of his say this might be his greatest to date and I say it's absolutely worth seeing for the cast and for the story alone!!! 8.5/10"

","There happens to be one director in the modern times who can extract the best performances out of actors who were previously only considered for their star quality. Scorcese gets the best out of Alec Baldwin, Matt Damon,Mark Wahlberg and we all have to ask why has it taken so long for Jack Nicholson to come under the master's direction. <br/><br/>The complexity of the story and the riveting and unpredictable second half leave you feeling it was worth the effort and price of admission to go and see this movie.Even Martin Sheen excels in his minor but most important role and that is what makes Martin Scorcese the most formidable director of our time; the bit parts are sometimes the glue that holds all the major players and script together.

","The Departed is a remake of a Hong Kong film ""Internal Affairs."" Having not seen that film I can't compare the two movies.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio plays a mole who is tight with mobster Jack Nicholson while Matt Damon plays a mole in a police force unit headed by Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin with Mark Wahlberg as a cop. Vera Farmiga plays a love interest.<br/><br/>The plot is essentially a cat and mouse game between Nicholson and the police as they try to bust him.<br/><br/>The acting is first rate, as you'd expect, with Nicholson perfectly cast as a crazy-eyed genuine nutcase, creepy to the max, always dangerous, and very vicious. Vintage nutso Nicholson as we've seen him before in many films.<br/><br/>There isn't much character development in the film with little background information given about Nicholson, DiCaprio or Damon and this hurts the film turning it into basically a cat and mouse plot. There are plenty of graphic shootings and spattering blood and, since the characters are people we care something about at least, the violence hurts, unlike the cartoonish violence of a horror film.<br/><br/>This is not a great movie by any means or even one of Scorcese's best and it certainly does not compare to Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather."" With the exception of one scene where Damon and DiCaprio follow each other, Scorcese's direction is not very exceptional or remarkable. <br/><br/>I would recommend this film but it is brutally violent so beware."

","I am sure that most audiences who have seen Hong Kong ""infernal affairs"" would not feel satisfactory with this new US version. ""The Departed"" copied most of the HK ""Infernal Affairs"": the same story, except for the ending. However, the actors' lines are full of dirty words, which is a complete difference to that of ""Infernal Affairs"" with deep content. In addition, ""the Departed"" is ending rapidly. Several roles were shot in no more than five minutes, without any close-ups or slow motions, making me feel the director ends the story too roughly.Furthermore, the music in ""the Departed"" is not attractive at all. On the contrary, the music and songs in ""Infernal Affairs"" have then won a lot of reputation and rewards and population and still i can recall the astonishing scenes when I once heard of the music. what i feel after i saw this movie is that i strongly believe that ""infernal affairs"" is a HongKong Classic that no other copies or versions can compare, no matter how much the script is adapted or how bigger or famous the cast is."

","What's happened to the Scorsese of old? Is this the same director of Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Bringing Out The Dead? With his last two films being fairly mediocre, I didn't go into this film with high expectations. Being based on a Hong Kong shoot-'em-up, there were no illusions that this would be high art. Still, the film just didn't work for me.<br/><br/>The relationships depicted were not convincing and virtually all the female roles women were simply obligatory window dressing. Vera Farmiga's role was weak, and there seemed to be little chemistry between her and Matt Damon's character.<br/><br/>There was a tangible sense of tension, particularly for DiCaprio's character, and he played his part well. Mark Wahlberg is an actor that always seems to shine, and doesn't seem to get much screen time. Mostly the performances were good, but there were too many flat spots that broke the tension, and the film would have benefited from being cut to two hours. However, the film did move at a fast pace, and this helped to mask some of the many implausibilities. I found neither the violence nor language offensive, and quite appropriate for the genre.<br/><br/>Scorsese is renowned for his technical excellence. There seemed to be none of the stylish use of camera work and long takes of his better films. With this and his previous two films, it seems to me that Scorsese is struggling to find his earlier creative core. There are some great crime films done previously (some by Scorsese himself). The best for me was Takeshi Kitano's Hana Bi, which has a lot in common with Scorsese's earlier work.<br/><br/>Perhaps the director is suffocating under the expectations based on his previous great works. Perhaps he is caught up in a sense of self-importance. Maybe he would achieve a better outcome if he didn't depend so much on big name actors and big budgets and got back to his roots. The film is not bad, but it's not that good either. It's my least favourite of Scorsese's."

"prop03","9","0","1","29 October 2006"," A Scorsese triumph
","An intriguing plot that twists and turns and has you on the edge of your seat at times; an all-star cast (mainly male though); some truly excellent special effects and, as you might expect from director Martin Scorsese, a wonderful sound track.<br/><br/>These are the ingredients that combine to make this a truly memorable picture. The central plot deals with a corrupt Boston police force and a mobster, played by Jack Nicholson at his demonic best. The police have an undercover operative in the mobster's gang, and he in turn has a snitch with the cops. The best scenes of the film occur with these two, portrayed by Matt Damon and Leo DiCaprio, trying to discover the identity of the other, while the audience tries to work out which of the two is the real villain.<br/><br/>There is also a common love interest (which reminded me somewhat of LA Confidential) and plenty of gory action. The supporting cast is great, and includes William Baldwin, Ray Winstone (does he ever turn in a below-par performance - I think not!), Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg who has the best role of his career as a menacing police detective.<br/><br/>The movie runs for about 150 minutes, and yet it easily maintains interest and suspense for its whole length.

(Although the Wind gets it for best film this year.) There's very little wrong with it. OK it's not completely flawless, the scene where Nicholson walks back into the bar (Who let this IRA motherf*cker in?) and then says ""slainte"" is the only weak point. It's pronounced ""Sil-on-cha"" you White Lace Motherf*cker!"
"santegeezhe","5","0","1","26 October 2006"," Not terrible, but massively over-hyped
","For some reason, this movie seems to be getting praised left, right and center by both the critics and regular folks. I can't really see why, other than the fact that it's a Scorcese flick. But honestly, it's just not that great, and doesn't even compare to such previous Scorcese gems as Taxi Driver and Goodfellas.<br/><br/>There were things about it that I liked, such as the soundtrack, which was heavy on classic rock (with ""Gimme Shelter"" being used twice!); the hot therapist, who I could have ogled for a long time; and DiCaprio's performance, which was the latest in a string of great performances. But overall the movie seemed like a convoluted, confusing mess, which failed to engage me much beyond wondering when it'd be over.<br/><br/>I found the plot to be rather confusing, or at least, it took far too long for things to get going. I kept thinking to myself, ""when is something going to happen?"", and ""am I missing something?"". But in reality there just wasn't that much going on for large chunks of the film. In essence, it was just way too long.<br/><br/>Also, I thought that this movie couldn't really decide what it wanted to be. There certainly were a lot of comedic moments for a dramatic film, although I'm not sure how many of them were intentional. Either way, the audience was laughing out loud during many scenes. And if this was supposed to be a suspenseful film it failed miserably. By the two-hour mark I didn't care what was happening anymore, I just wanted it to end so I could go home.<br/><br/>Other than DiCaprio's performance, the other characters were fairly one-dimensional, with Jack Nicholson turning in a particularly uninspired performance. It must have been a nice payday though.<br/><br/>One of my friends liked this movie so much that he went and saw it twice, but there's no way I could sit through this convoluted mess again.<br/><br/>To sum up, it's not a terrible movie, but it is massively over-hyped. And you can forget about that elusive Oscar, it ain't gonna happen with this puppy."

""For dramatic effect insert as many F's and C's in the script as you can"" does not really cut it for me. Maybe he is more suited to an action/explosion film. At least Leo is starting to look like an adult, and can now pull off these parts. Also the continuity of sound levels was bad where I watched it. Highlight was definitely Vera. Stunning!!

"neilajarn","7","0","1","23 October 2006"," A departure from reality
","''The Departed'' has been hailed as an emphatic return to form for uberdirector Martin Scorsese, and while it does contain moments of customary vividness and verve ( the music score alone is worth the cost of admission), ultimately, when set against its closest predecessor,""Goodfellas"", it fails to convince as an authentic tale of gritty gangsterism, which is a shame as the film manages to evoke a credible sense of how easily the lines between good and evil become blurred.<br/><br/>The convoluted plot revolves around two rookie cops from the same underbelly of Boston. One of the new recruits, Billy Costigan (poignantly played by Leonardo DiCaprio), beset by rumours questioning his loyalty to the force, is coaxed and coerced by his superiors (Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg reviving the old good cop/bad cop routine to maximum dramatic effect) into infiltrating an Irish-American mob empire run by the slippery and elusive Frank Costello (a memorably malevolent, albeit hammy turn by Jack Nichoson; an X-rated combination of Jack Napier and the Joker - but one that, regrettably, for his character is purportedly based on a real life Boston crime lord, thrills rather than chills).<br/><br/>The other new recruit, Colin Sullivan ( played with detached ruthlessness by Matt Damon), groomed from an early age by Frank Costello, rapidly gains promotion to a prominent position in the Special Investigations Unit hell-bent on bringing his shadowy mentor to justice; and to further complicate matters, his boss ( a bellicose yet comical Alec Baldwin), painfully aware that his own team has been infiltrated by a Costello mole, charges Sullivan - irony of ironies - with sole responsibility for flushing out the guilty party - himself!<br/><br/>This elaborate set-up - never, for one moment, does it feel real or ring true - certainly grips the attention, dragging the viewer headlong on a rollicking roller-coaster ride of a movie; but it does have an unmistakably ersatz quality to it: yes, the performances, with the possible exception of Nicholson's ill-judged grandstanding (don't rule out another Oscar nomination!) are uniformly strong and moving; yes, the screenplay, though it does suddenly, and violently, lurch from earnest realism to campy grand guignol, is riveting; and yes, Scorsese's kinetic direction, coming after his turgid Howard Hughes bio, is a sight to behold; nevertheless - and this has nothing to do with the fact the film is roughly based on a popular Hong Kong actioner/thriller - ''The Departed'' never manages to convince as anything other than an amalgamation of other, more illustrious gangster flicks. And none of them had such a weak ending.<br/><br/>After every new Martin Scorsese release, a single, hopeful/doleful question is asked: is this the one that breaks his Oscar duck? Well, as anyone with even the tiniest knowledge of the arcane Academy Awards voting system will tell you, the best nominees don't necessarily get to waltz down the star-studded aisle to the podium, gush sentimental thank-yous to all and sundry, and finally bag the gold statuette. Devoted Martin Scorsese fans - and I, for one, count myself amongst their legion - must pray that this perplexing pattern continues."

"hesperuswreck","7","0","3","22 October 2006"," Enough about the ""original"" already!
","Well, my difficulties with this flick seem to veer off a bit from other reviewers on the site, so I'll just put in my 2 cents and leave 'em on the table: 1. Is it absolutely mandatory to have seen ""the original"" screening of the Hong Kong adaptation of this story? Filmland is full of different interpretations of the same source material, and I think one has to keep an open mind when viewing the latest. Many people dismissed the most recent reincarnation of ""Vanity Fair"" due to earlier interpretations of the story. As for myself, I found the 'Bollywood' additions creative and appropriate.<br/><br/>2. That said, I would have rather seen another director's reinvention of the tale, much as I'm often wowed by Scorcese. I keep thinking about Clint Eastwood's masterful production of the similarly-themed ""Mystic River,"" and wonder if the story itself may have been more concisely told and still have retained the somewhat Shakespearean element referenced in this film.<br/><br/>3. There were some bothersome plot holes in this film that I kept waiting for some explanation for. Why did Costigan receive ""therapy"" from the police psychiatrist in the first place if only Queenan and Dignam were aware of his true identity as a cop? Where was there any evidence that there was another ""rat"" besides Sullivan in the department until the bloody end? How did Sullivan explain the bloodbath in the elevator exactly? Was the female shrink's baby fathered by Costigan or Sullivan? The subplot concerning Costello's role as an FBI ""rat"" may have been easier to swallow if there had been even one example of this particular treachery somewhere in the film. Oh, I could go on...<br/><br/>4. Many people didn't like the ending, perhaps based on the ""original."" I had mixed feelings, because I smelled it coming. Dignam disappears for an inordinately long stretch at the end of the film (and his exit was a mite unbelievable, as some have mentioned.) So I'm sitting there for 20 minutes or so thinking that Dignam will return to finish off Sullivan. No surprise there, and just one last body on the mounting pyre. Classic Scorcese blood fest. Liked it better in the underrated ""Gangs of New York."" Alright, So I've poked a few holes in this otherwise riveting gangster-cop saga. Overall, I agree with the comments applauding the cast, but I actually was relieved that Nicholson wasn't as ""over-the top"" as I feared he might be: just about right for the flamboyant character he played. And add me to the list of people who weren't big DiCaprio fans until this film. He should keep working with Scorcese, who seems to be guiding him well lately. I loved seeing fresh-scrubbed Matt Damon as another wolf in sheep's clothing (e.g., ""The Talented Mr. Ripley""), too.<br/><br/>I'll keep watching Scorcese films, bloody and tragic as they are. But I still keep thinking he has at least one more coming on the level of ""Taxi Driver."" May it arrive soon!"

","One word. HUH? I have never been so shocked after walking out of a movie in my life. The different sequence of camera shots and character display confuses the audience right in the beginning of this movie. Then the slow paced confusing beginning just got more boring. I was about to walk out before the action started - which I may add took forever. This 2 and a half hour movie could of been shortened by an hour or so.<br/><br/>The police who were trying to locate and arrest the mob boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) found that they have a mole in their precinct who is tipping off Costello leaving him a few steps ahead of the police. To Costello's surprise, he too finds out he has a federal undercover agent in his mob. With plenty of questions and scenes which leave you at the tip of the seat, I would say the ending made the film!

"yoel_marson","7","0","3","22 October 2006"," above average crime thriller let down by weak ending
","I saw this film a couple of nights ago and wanted to review it straight away. It was only then I realised it was a remake so I held off till I could see the original.<br/><br/>To start with, the acting is excellent. DiCaprio ,perceived early in his career as the teen-girl favourite, now has genuine presence and character. I started appreciating Matt Damon since his incredible performances as Jason Bourne, where he plays an action hero with genuine emotions. They were on par with the original leads; Nicholson was better than IA's Sam and the shrink made a much better contribution that the shrink and girlfriend together in the original.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg was entertaining as Sheen's sidekick but devalued from him and ruined the symmetry. There are two bosses and two protégées. Each of the protégées appears to be working for one but is actually with the other. This is much cleaner in the original. In the departed sheen is the join operator of DiCaprio and is the superior but not the boss of Damon.<br/><br/>The length of the remake allowed for better character development and better explanation of events. There was more time to develop the relationships between the leads and the shrink. The critical scenes were less rushed.<br/><br/>I was disappointed by the ending of the remake, in a meaningless blood splat. In the original, the bad mole gradually feels tormented by his actions, especially after sheen's death. He kills Sam in order to start a new life. I believe he would have let the good mole live and brought him back to the police force if it wasn't for the fact that DiCaprio saw the envelope. in the original, Damon is saved by the second mole. Damon terminates him so that he can continue his new life and salutes his counterpart at the funeral. In the remake, Damon is just pure bad and is cleaned up at the end by wahlberg, who reenters the film as abruptly as he left it after sheen's death.<br/><br/>In both films, the death of all (or almost all) the central characters prevents the realisation by the bosses of who the moles were.<br/><br/>There were also a couple of clues prior to the envelope about the identity of the moles. After their telephone call, Damon knew the moles voice and could have worked out who he was ( he certainly didn't sound like frenchy or ray winstone). there was a scene where Nicholson demands the tail car be pulled off and it happens straight away; at that point it is obvious that if you find the cop who gave that order you find the mole."

","Did the whole web page forget to state that the only reason this film is so good is that it's based on the hit Hong Kong film that later expanded into a trilogy? That is, in many people's opinion, still the best of the two? This film borrows way too many scenes and ideas from the original movie to attempt to be original in itself. Granted, the acting is excellent, but so were Andy Lau, Tony Leung and Anthony Wong from the original, against which I would say everyone but Leo DiCaprio just pales against. Also, the mirrored scenes lack the same punch as the original precisely because this is a Scorsese film. Characters die without the same punch to our guts; the same emotional shock that the original film's slow and music-heavy moments deliver, and that is it's greatest flaw as a character-driven film. I mean, the last scene * SPOILER * where three characters died consecutively * END OF SPOILER * drew more laughs from the audience than gasps! This, with the rushed ending that stinks of 'Aviator' lowered my opinion of Martin Scorsese, but my opinion on Leo just rose :D"

It also have the taste of the original and flavor of Boston. i did like the end because trying to fit the story very quick. the original leave it open. in this movies mix the first 2 movies in original into one. Tony Leung Chui Wai Vs Leornado DI Carpio. They Were very good at there version. Tony Give is character with more subtle way to want to get out. Leornado give is character little bit more expose emotion. Matt vs Andy i think they very good job in showing the character loving the new life."

","I see that I am one of the few who didn't think this film was the best thing since sliced bread. Having seen the original I knew that the ending wasn't going to be a surprise but I was a little shocked by what I did see. Obviously some form of retribution was needed, why I don't know as it kinda ruined it for me.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm getting old but I found that there was just a bit too much swearing for me. I don't usually care about that sort of thing, but I found it just a bit too much and off putting. It made me think that the script writer was a 12 year old who thought that saying ""f*ck"" after every other word is ""cool man!"" The whole film left me wanting...wanting for what? Sympathy. What made the original so good was it's sadness and how you felt for the main characters. You did for Leo of course and at least they kept that. But Mat Damon character was a t*ss-pot, a homophopic numbskull and that ruined it for me. What about gritty realism I hear you say? Well yes this version is set in Boston as instead of Hong Kong so there are a lot of differences but I thought the point of the film was that both Leo and Mat wanted normal live. Mr Damons character seemed to enjoy his role a little too much.<br/><br/>Mark Walburg was great even with that really bad hair, I enjoyed his character to a point. Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin were great too I really liked them. Jack Nicholson? Dare I say this aloud? I didn't like him at all, he was his usual type cast over sexed over dosed self and it was boring. He added nothing to the film and it concentrated too much on him too, he should have been a side character giving the orders. The though of him getting ""c*nt"" was just as sickening as hearing your parents do it at night. It's wrong and sick and we shouldn't have to put up with such nonsense! If it wasn't based on Infernal Affairs it would have been better. But it was and I think that it was rather bizarre that the script writer didn't watch the film just read the transcript....<br/><br/>Anyway my advise is make up your own mind, but do see the original it's charming and funny. But see this version too it's not bad if a little OTT at times."

","Scorsese takes us into a violent travel into the crime and police environment. By making a remake from a series of three Hong-Kong gangster films, he staged some Irish characters in a violence that blast us out of our chair. We love them all. Any death become a sad event, and it doesn't happen only once.<br/><br/>Then, Scorsese edited it has a rapid series of events that flow into a back wall of songs (but it's used in a different way as Tarantino's Kill Bill, at last). The scenes are shorts and right to the point, always cutted to maximize the clever style of the film. We feel like the time is rapidly passing by, and the characters are developed by some quick details (like an Alec Balwin's dirty shirt).<br/><br/>So, this is a comic treatment of a tragedy, like the antics ones. And the actors are all in their best shape, I never liked DiCaprio, Damon or Walhberg before and then, suddenly, they play some Oscar roles.<br/><br/>Simply refreshing, entertaining, fascinating and clever!"

I was a little confused by the ending, but felt the movie was amazing. I will be very surprised if Leo is not nominated for this movie. Martin Scorsese is known for making spectacular movies and this by far was one of his best! To get so many big actors on one movie and have it turn out this great is a huge accomplishment.

This movie over all is great, take away the mindless shooting and swearing and the movie is almost fantastic.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio did an excellent job portraying an inside cop with issues and pressure not to get caught. This is one of his better acting films. But of course he got shot, it was like watching Jack Dawson float to the bottom of the ocean again. Heartbreaking.

","I have seen THE DEPARTED twice now(both opening weekend) and I have to say that it is without a doubt one of the best American movies to come out in the last decade. Everything from the ground up is top notch in this ultra violent crime thriller.The writing was superb, providing not just one cast member, but the whole cast a stream of clever and effective speech. The performances were nothing short of incredible. Leo and Damon act as the glue holding together this tangle of lies and deception, both providing plenty of raw emotion, and a noticeable realism to both of their characters. Jack as always rules any scene he appears in as the hilarious, yet psychopathic Frank Costello, and should be receiving without a doubt yet another well deserved Oscar nodd. The supporting cast of Wahlberg,Sheen,and Baldwin also provide authentic knock out performances that both enhance the films realism, and add to its' fun factor. The direction by good old Marty is BRILLIANT, as if we expected anything less. He somehow puts a creative spin on each and every shot, so the viewer is never left with a boring angle they've seen too many times before.The music used in the film is also pivotal as it strikes the right nerves in our bodies at just the right time(gimmie shelter,one way out,comfortably numb,plus an Irish jam from The drop kick Murphys). The plot is very intriguing as we follow two moles from both sides of the law set out to report on what they find. This film wonderfully pulls off what could have easily been too difficult of a plot to manage, and for that you can thank Marty. A lot has been said about the ending, and their seems to be varying reactions to it, however I felt it was very clever, and brought the plot full circle just in time for the credits. This movie will make you laugh, make you cringe, make you glad you are not undercover, and make you feel like you actually saw a film worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Come Oscar season many predictions have been made. Having seen FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS already I can easily say that flags has no chance at the major Oscars. It was terrible. SUPPORTING:JACK good possibility LEAD ACTOR: LEO good possibility WRITING: MONOHAN most likely BEST DIRECTOR:MARTY I'd say so just so the Academy can get rid of him.EVEN THOUGH he more than deserves it. BEST PIC:THE DEPARTED We shall see, but some how the real best pictures never win. Advice from me? SEE IT. THEN see it again."

For a remake, I think it isn't bad at all compared to those other really bad remakes. Even so, I am born in America so I judge everything equally so don't go crazy on me.

The storyline develops much better in the Chinese version so I suggest everyone to watch that with subtitles. Can't be that bad right?.. the Martin did buy the storyline to remake.. so you can't trash it xDD.. Anyway... the ending was a bit expected and all since when he bought the story, he didn't know there was a trilogy.. I didn't like how he died though...

","Some understated performances from Damon and Nicholson do not make up for a non-existent script and a paper-thin plot that resembles all-too-much a dumbed-down ""State of Grace"". Aside from Damon doing a bang-up job of exuding the privileged arrogance and charisma of the ""well connected"" Boston cop, and Nicholson finally toning it down a bit, there just ain't much here. The dialogue is goofy and seems strung together only for aesthetics- so that Damon and the completely-unconvincing-as-tough-guy Marky Mark can rattle off their Bostonese at a machine-gun clip. But really, when you get down to it none of it makes any sense. Neither do the actions of the ""love interest"", Nicholson, or Walberg. At least, their motives are not at all fleshed out to the point where subtlety could make a meal out of these parts. But let's face facts- Scorcese is anything but subtle. However, for the Marty die-hards there is plenty of male posturing, violence, classic rock tunes, cursing, and minor plot twists (involving brutal violence, of course) to go around. To me though, the Maestro shoulda hung 'em up after Goodfellas....and The Departed is exhibit A."

If this movie has a flaw, it is the fact that Mark Wahlberg's character was under-utilized. The Departed is, beyond argument, the best film of the year.

"Ed Groubermann","9","0","1","15 October 2006"," Everything you would want out of a movie
","Martin Scorese's new film ""The Departed"" is one of those rare Hollywood gems that defines all expectations in cinema today. There is humor, drama, action, violence, and character development. <br/><br/>I feel that this film can be broken down into three films as a matter of fact. You have, the original Chinese film ""Infernal Affairs,"" Scorese's hints of ""Goodfellas"" inside, and an ending similar to Shakespeare's ""Hamlet.""<br/><br/>The original Chinese film lacks substance compared to Scorese's remake. This is one of those rare instances were the remake is better than the original. To name a few of my favorite remakes: John Carpenter's ""The Thing"", Gore Verbinski's ""The Ring,"" and Don Siegel's ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers."" While in ""Infernal Affairs"" we are given abridged version of ""The Departed."" Another comparsion is like comparing Peter Jackson's remake of ""King Kong"" to the original. Although, in ""The Departed"" the extra minutes add to the film with character development and further plot points. ""The Departed"" is a spiced up version of ""Infernal Affairs"" to all means.<br/><br/>When comparing this film to ""Goodfellas"" you come up a little short handed. Although, you get an excellent performance from Jack Nicholson as Frank Costello. Nicholson's character belongs and could be from ""Goodfellas."" As an actor, It is easier to take Nicholson seriously now. I am comparing him to Robert De Niro, who has more share of silly movies added to his resume than Nicholson. Nicholson clearly sinks into that role of Frank Costello just as well as De Niro as Jimmy ""The Gent."" The two other characters, Decaprio and Damon fit into this film as if someone could replace them. Perhaps, Decaprio was better in his role than Damon, but I must say they played the parts well. They are not Joe Pesci or Liotta like in ""Goodfellas""<br/><br/>I must say, is Decaprio taking DeNiro's place as Scorese's main man?<br/><br/>In the end, we overcome a huge shootout very reminiscent of ""Hamlet."" It becomes a tragedy in the final chapter, or does it? As a viewer of this film you sympathize with Decaprio's character immediately. Damon's character is viewed as a spy, and Wahlberg's character is viewed as an asshole. At the end of the film, we have our innocence lost after Decaprio's death, Damon venerating Decaprio, and Damon's death by Wahlberg. Is it fate for Damon to die? In ""Infernal Affairs"" Damon's character lives. There is no Mark Wahlberg character in ""Infernal Affairs."" I think Scorese gave his audience an ending without remorse. You don't feel angry about either of the main characters having known both of them are murdered.<br/><br/>So, we see an ending that is concluding and not depressing. Not many films can conqueror this. Well done Scorese 9 out of 10 stars.<br/><br/>-Review by Radley Silla"
"sbands1","10","0","2","15 October 2006"," Greatest of the Year (if not more so)
","""The Departed"" is awesome. It is now my new favorite movie. Never have I seen so much good acting and great direction in one film that is not only cinema-graphically superior to anything else from 2006, but highly entertaining as well. The only two movies that even come close from this past year are ""Inside Man"" and ""V for Vendetta."" Unfortunately, Martin Scorsese has once again come up against Clint Eastwood. And not only that, but Eastwood is directing a ""war at home""-style World War II movie that is guaranteed to win all the Academy's hearts. The point is that it's Scorsese's turn to win and he does deserve it. ""The Departed"" isn't a ""Goodfellas Part Two"" or a second ""Casino"" (thank God), it is a brilliantly thought out gangster tale that will keep you on the edge of your seat, when your not laughing at the dark, sarcastic lines. Great, great, great, great movie."

","Because this is a long movie it seemed the end was somewhat rushed. Some plot angles did not come together. For instance, what was in the envelope Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), gives to Madolyn the police psychologist (Vera Farmiga)? Later he sends her a CD in the mail so that wasn't it. She put his name on the envelope before placing it in the desk drawer, leading you to believe her rat boyfriend Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon) would find it. That never happened. I think this is one place you're just left hanging due to the hurried nature of the movie's end. All in all though, this was time well spent at the movies.<br/><br/>The actors did an outstanding job of with the Boston accent. This can often separate a good actor from a great actor. Having stayed in Boston and worked in Maine, the New England accent is often mispronounced, to my ears, and can ruin a picture. I expect Matt Damon to get it right but was surprised with Walbergs' excellent portrayal in this area. <br/><br/>DiCaprio has out done himself on this one. It's easy to see why he sticks with Martin Scorsese."

","As most people know, this is a remake of the excellent Hong Kong-movie, ""Infernal affairs"". No American remake of a movie from another country has so far been better than the original movie. You can compare with the fact that all the novels that has been filmed, the books are almost always better. Some things shouldn't be done.<br/><br/>When it comes to remakes, your opinion about it all depends on if you have seen the original movie or not. I must assume, because of the high score for ""The Departed"", that most of the voters on IMDb, have NOT seen the original.<br/><br/>The first ""Infernal Affairs"" was such success, that they made another one, ""Infernal Affairs II""... Because of what happened in the first film, they had no choice than to go back in time and tell the background to what happened in the first one. And as the second one also was a hit, they followed up with a third one, now going back even further in time. After the third movie, they had told the complete story, there was no more to add. Some might say that you should see the third movie first, then the second, and finish with the first one. I don't think so. You can do whatever...<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie in question is ""The Departed"", NOT the originals, although it's impossible not to compare if you have seen them.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson is one of the finest actors still alive. In this movie he uses every evil, mean, crazy face he can come up with. There is no good about him, he was probably born evil. The same person in the original movie is to begin with just an ""errand boy"" to mob leader. He's rather harmless, almost a friend to the police chief. He climbs up the ladder after the first mob leader gets shot. But he still isn't all bad, he's even to testify against the new mob leader, being on the right side of the law. But as things develop, especially after the second mob-leader being shot, he finds himself in some sort of dilemma. There is no natural ""third"" mob leader... He sees the opportunity to take over, to become the new boss of this crime syndicate. The temptation is too strong.<br/><br/>The original movies combines music/sound and picture VERY well, there is often no need for words, the pictures tells it a lot better.... There is too much talking in the remake, it's often also too slow... And as in most American movies, the violence has to be ""more"" than what has been done before... More close-ups of shooting, you must show a lot of blood... The more, the better? I don't think so... It's like ""they"" think that ""they"" must SHOW a bullet going through somebody's head, and later showing the same person laying in a pool of blood, otherwise the public will not understand what happened.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese is NOT a bad director, making a remake of ""Inferal Affairs"" was a just a bad idea. See the original movies, no need for seeing ""The Departed""."

The Departed really puts shame to other movies from the ""gangster"", ""action"" and ""thriller"" genres. Even the soundtrack is intense. Ranging from the Rolling Stones to the Dropkick Murphys to Nas, like the cast, it fits. The Departed is a movie that one can go see over and over again. It is full of symbols and illusions that if a viewer caught them the first time, I would be more than impressed. This movie is unreal.

","There are things wrong with 'The Departed' - mostly in the last ten minutes. Before that, however, there many fabulous performances, and there is Frank Costello: the most sleazy, loathsome scumbag of a crime-lord to hit the screen, possibly ever. Others have suggested that Nicholson is giving a mannered, unbelievable performance: maybe it is, but it is also a performance that leaves an indelible impression and which is given wings by a script that has his sewer-mouth gush endless cynical degrading filth until he is silenced with an expletive and a bloody fall into a digger's scoop. No doubt it may be accused of being written for shock value, but it isn't. The script embodies the values of someone who does what he does for the worst of reasons: he isn't even greedy, it's a life he chooses in perpetuity because he loves it. Nicholson's performance is a tour de force precisely because the physical embodiment of threat that we might expect is reduced to a portrayal of a very 'ordinary' old guy whose soul is so rotten that he corrupts everything he comes into contact with.<br/><br/>Martin Scorcese and his entire cast and crew have delivered a stunning visceral movie. It would be hard to imagine the film working as well without its very singular villain and it just proves that Nicholson is still 'the man'."

With tremendous plot twists and hidden deception, The Departed is one of the most captivating films of recent History.<br/><br/>With such a star studded cast, including Nicholson, Di Caprio and Damon I was apprehensive about whether or not I was going to be blown away by the overall performance. As always Jack Nicholson lived up to his reputation as one of the best and delivered what i feel to be the best performance throughout the film, despite him being in a supporting role. Matt Damon tapped into all the acting talent he had and delivered the best performance of his career. However the biggest surprise for me came from Leonardo Di Caprio. Ever since first seeing him in Titanic when i was a boy I never really clicked with him as a viewer. However my respect and appreciation for his incredible acting ability was revived after this film. He delivers what I feel is the best leading role I have seen since Jonny Depp in the second Pirates of the Caribbean. His range of emotions and ability to manipulate my emotions as a viewer was simply breath taking.<br/><br/>The movie has a quite confusing narrative which is far from linear. However if you really get into it and don't twiddle your thumbs waiting for the credits you will find the film will grab you and you wont be able to loosen its grip until the final scene has ended.<br/><br/>An incredible piece of directing and editing that will be one of the best films you will see this year and quite probably for many years to come.

","Based on the enjoyable, if flawed, Asian film Infernal Affairs Scorsese and screenwriter William Moynahan expand on that films neat premise and where that was a cops and robbers thriller here Scorsese has fashioned a gangster epic almost on a par with Goodfellas. Speaking of Goodfellas, this is easily Scorsese's best film since that 1990 masterpiece. Its as if Scorsese has rediscovered his youth with this film its sparky energy and style resembling Mean Streets. The acting as well as the directing and screen writing is outstanding. But what would you expect from a cast that includes: Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Ray Winstone. As for Oscars, personally I think it shows the idiocy of the awards that Scorsese who is undoubtedly one of the greatest directors of all time has never won an Oscar and the likes of Ron Howard has.So he probably won't win this year either. Nicholson may(deservedly) get nominated for best supporting actor but even though DiCaprio and Damon are awesome in this movie, they probably won't get nominated. But its Marty, Jack, Leo etc that will have the last laugh as I feel in twenty years time people will still be talking about this movie.

The Departed features a stellar cast, including five of the best known actors working today: Nicholson, Dicaprio, Sheen, Wahlberg and Baldwin. Four of those five, including the hottest young actor in years, Dicaprio, subordinated their egos to the greater good of the project, headed by Marty, who has directed handfuls of the best known and most influential films of the last thirty years. One actor did not choose to subordinate his ego. One actor decided to turn The Departed into yet another tawdry and showy funeral monument for an acting career that died decades ago, dispelling the hopes for rebirth of his career that a few more nuanced recent performances have encouraged. <br/><br/>I read somewhere that Nicholson has boasted that he did no research for his character in The Departed. That's a funny thing to do, Jack, considering that The Departed is as wedded to the cultural specifics of its locale as any movie I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Many reviewers have complained that The Departed lacks the frenetic energy expected from a thriller, especially a thriller modeled on Infernal Affairs. I think they are missing the point, in that, while Marty blatantly teases us with thriller energy, backed up by the hard push of Boston irish punk, Marty's real point in The Departed seems to be that all the wild action of his cops and robbers ultimately sinks into a larger passivity, a miasmic sense that nothing positive can be accomplished, that no sacrifice and no outpouring of brutalism and violence can ultimately accomplish anything.<br/><br/>But if that point doesn't come across to viewers the way it should, the fault is ultimately Marty's. Marty, it was your job not to hire a one-man artistic trainwreck like Jack Nicholson, or to find a way to wring a great performance out of him if you did hire him. If you really believe that it takes a monster ego to play a monster ego, then please look back on Daniel Day Lewis' performance as Bill Butcher in Gangs of New York. The opposite is more likely to be true.<br/><br/>A train wreck performance needed a train wreck of a movie. The Departed has the former, by Nicholson, but isn't the latter.<br/><br/>I'm calling for a do-over. With more Boston irish punk, by the way!"

","Who knew Leonardo had it in him--he is excellent in this role as is the entire cast-... The ending takes you a little by surprise--but never a dull moment... This is one of the best written and directed films that I have seen in a long time--Jack is never disappointing and gives a commanding presence in this film---although none of the other actors are considered in his league (yet?)they definitely hold their own--perfect casting. Wish Mark Wahlberg had a little more screen time. Definitely a movie to go see and one to own to watch time after time. This is definitely a hit. I will be anxious to see if there is any Oscar buzz about this, it's creator and actors deserve it."

Nothing more I can say except see it, just go and enjoy a fantastic movie with performances that will blow you away. This movie will IMHO garner many Oscar nominations. I would see it again, that's how good it was. Matt Damon has also done the best work of his career and Mark Wahlberg, Alec Badlwin and Martin Sheen put in very notable work. Jack Nicholson, is always good in most of his work but he was born to play this role he did an excellent job. Once again, Martin Scorsese turns in another winner. Cinematography was excellent as well, hard to find any fault with this film, in fact there is no bad part of this movie, unbelievably great ending.

","************* Warning: SPOILERS AHEAD********************<br/><br/>I feel that Departed was not excellent: I thought the film had<br/><br/>a) too many coincidences (2 moles passing each other on their first day, both fall for the same girl and sleep with her, good cop seeing incriminating envelope on bad cop's desk) <br/><br/>b) trivial things ala Hitchcock McGuffin in the form of 20 computer chips for $1million <br/><br/>c) confusing plot (and I'm above average in following them). Like: why didn't the police arrest Costello -- as the good cop said -- for the many things they had him on. In real life, Al Capone was put away for tax evasion. <br/><br/>It wasn't quite on the level of a James Bond flick where the villain says ""I'm about to kill you Mr. Bond, but first let me give you a tour of my laboratory."" (Gee: I am ambivalent if I should watch the new Casino Royale movie coming Nov 17 2006.)<br/><br/>On the other hand, I felt that it was a bit like ""Easy Rider"", which was called a mediocre movie with a great ending.<br/><br/>Yup, I felt that a top star dying before the end was incredible, just like ""Dressed to Kill"". The realistic ending of the cop who quits coming back using all his cop skills to act as an avenging angel was great.

","Double infiltration -- interesting movie. DiCaprio & Nicholson are amazing actors, no doubt. I give it a 7, because there are places that could have been much better directed in the telling of the story, but it was pretty killer overall - except for the fact that it leaves you feeling depressed instead of hopeful. Also- I left the theater right when they shot DiCaprio and the whole theater gasps in disbelief... I thought to myself: ""yep- yet again the good guy, the glimmer of hope in all of this corruption get's wacked...in typical 'new Hollywood' style; it seems they like to have 'evil' triumph now-a-days. (I wish I'd stayed to see Walberg get Damon, but it didn't matter at that point, because a typical viewer is naturally pulling for DiCaprio to overcome the enormous dangers he's in and expose the bad guys.

","I won't retread what everyone else is writing about...comparing it to ""Internal Affairs"", etc. Not fair. This was not a 'great' film, but just a really good film that was tense and very enjoyable, although about 20 minutes too long. Could have cut a lot of fat, Marty. The acting was terrific from Jack and DiCaprio, but how the Sheen and Walberg characters were developed made no sense. Or maybe it was that they under and over acted, respectively. Their opening scene together with DiCaprio was distractingly bad. I also didn't like to co-love interest angle at all...how many time have we seen that? And the ending, the last scene...was very confusing.<br/><br/>But what chapped me the most throughout this film is the music that ran through the background. It's like a jukebox was planted in the corner somewhere in the oddest scenes, playing the oddest songs. It was so distracting because you couldn't figure why it was there to begin with. In fact, it was so oddly placed in one scene that I honestly thought it was bleeding into the audio system from somewhere else. Unless there actually IS a jukebox playing in a diner scene, why would you overlay a song unrelated to the dialog or emotion of the scene. It works great in ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Brothers and Sisters"" but not here.<br/><br/>Despite my annoyances, overall I still liked it, but don't let anyone tell you it's the best film of the year."

","Synopsis: The Departed is set in the heart of South Boston, where the Massachusetts State Police is waging war on the Irish Mob. As the family of newly-minted trooper Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) has a long criminal history, he is challenged by Captain Queenan (Sheen) and his second-in-command Sergeant Dignam (Wahlberg) to infiltrate the mob syndicate run by gangland chief Frank Costello (Nicholson). While Costigan quickly gains Costello's confidence, another trooper, Colin Sullivan (Damon), whose family, unlike Billy's, has no criminal history, is rising to a position of power in the Special Investigation Unit, headed by Captain Ellerby (Baldwin). However, he is a protégé of mob boss Costello from childhood, who has infiltrated the police department as an informant for the crime syndicate. Each man becomes consumed by his double life, gathering information about the plans and counter-plans of the operations he has penetrated. But when it becomes clear to the mob and the police that they each have a mole in their midst, Billy and Colin are suddenly in danger of being exposed  and each must race to uncover the identity of the other man first in time to save himself.<br/><br/><ul><li>Scorsese has and always been the Master of making mob movies. Some of his memorable mob movies are Goodfellas, Casino and Gangs of New York. I personally believe that 'The Departed"" is ranked upthere among them. His directing expert has really made this movie looks really BLOODY VIOLENT, which of course the major characteristic of mob movies. Jack Nicholson is back to his NASTY ass since his bad guy role as Joker in Batman (1989). Matt Damon is returning back to the future trying to be somebody that he actually is not in this movie like the character he played so marvelously in 'Talented Mr Ripley'. But the one that surprised me the most is Leonardo Dicaprio. This boyish looking guy oftenly played as a soft-charactered person in his past movies. However, you will see a different Leonardo in this movie. He kicks, he punches, he swears a lot, and he fires a gun, anything about him in this movie is that he looks really MAN. I think this was the first time Leonardo ever got to play in such role, and he excelled first time! I did watch the original HK movie 'Infernal Affairs', and I can assure you that the 'The Departed' is much better than the original and more attuned to American Culture. Who's gonna beat Hollywood anyway? A true MASTERPIECE from the master himself, Scorsese. I rate this movie 9/10 - A must watch!</li></ul>"
"nobbytatoes","8","0","1","15 October 2006"," scorese returning to what he does best
","A remake of any film is usually a woeful moment. Only a hand full have reached the mark of the original film, a few soaring above it. Hollywood has been pillaging the Asian cinema, with many remakes of their horror films and action/dramas. Based upon the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs, The Departed looks to be exempted from this. While not have seen Infernal Affairs, the argues argument of comparing the films; ""which one is better"", is left muted, and all for the better.<br/><br/>It has been some time since Martin Scorese made his last gangster/crime film, with Casino back in 1995. During that time, his most major films Gangs of New York and The Aviator, where great yet muddled films. The Departed sees Scorsese returning to great form in a genre he does best. While not reaching Casino, Taxdriver or Goodfellas level, when the starting tune of The Rolling Stones Gimme Shelter rolls in, arms open saying 'Welcome back Martin'.<br/><br/>While it is rejoicing when The Departed starts, it dips not long after. The major flaw is the editing. Scenes run so lightning fast making a disjointed flow to the narrative. Scene cuts are erratic and images shoot past without time to comprehend what was shown. It's all the set up, Sullivan getting into the police to be Costello's mole, Queenan and Dignam setting up Costigan to infiltrate Costello's organization, you start to doubt whether Scorsese has dropped his form.<br/><br/>Yet things do settle, breaths are taken and proceeding calm down. Its the change from a urban setting. When both sides realise they might have moles in their midst, The Departed jumps tracks changing into one gripping and taut thriller. The intensity spikes and doesn't drop, with twists and turns, as Sullivan and Costigan hot on each others heals. Screenwritter William Monahan has succeeded in transfer the story into a complete American setting, with little presence of any Asian cinema influences, with Scorsese making it his own film to stand by itself.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese's directing is impeccable, the shoot out between the police and Costello's drug shipment enforces this, perfectly executed and staged; though the editing during the first part does detract from his talent. Continuing his collaboration with Scorese from The Aviator and Gangs of New York, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers his best performance, growing better with each film he does. Matt Damon, while not his best, is great as crooked cop Sullivan. Jack Nicholson perfectly mixes comedy and vulgarity in Costello. Mark Wahlberg doesn't drop a note as fouled mouth, hot headed Dignam. Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin are great in their supporting roles.<br/><br/>While not his best work, The Departed is Scorsese's best film in awhile."
"nickmansell","8","0","1","14 October 2006"," Certainly not the best of M.S.'s movies...
","The actors may have been the only reason to pay $7.00 to see this movie. Their charisma definitely lent to a story that only had one hidden moral: since every ""warrior"" dies in the end, the futility of joining one side over the other makes loyalty or morality ultimately worthless. A much cooler film ""Reservoir Dogs"" handles this with much more spunk and awe. Worth seeing, but not buying the DVD when it comes out. I think it was somewhat of a waste of Jack Nicholson's presence, but after ""The Pledge"" I think he's lost stock as an avante-gard visionary. Perhaps he has become too willing to do projects on the Director's past work to be judgmental or critical enough about his recent script picks. How many years does he have left to be wasting time on movies like About Schmitt, The Pledge, and Wolf. Mark Walberg came off as trying too hard to be a bad ass, the baby face didn't go with what should have been an older actor's role--someone with hair on their chest. Matt Damon and Leonardo Di Caprio were well peered, though. I found the energy levels seemed to keep the movie fresh even when the characters had all been done before. I hope Scorsese can find his way back to doing movies like Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, Cape Fear, and even After Hours--movies that created a new adventure upon unexpected paths."

","Personally I went to this movie not even knowing what it was about, I knew who was in, but knew nothing about it or the hype(if there was any??). The movie never hit the spot it should of, the idea was there, but I kept waiting for something to grab me and make me want to scream out yes. I then saw the credits rolling and thought to myself why, not only should it have ended 30 minutes ago, but since the movie insisted on continuing, why didn't something better happened that would give me my YES.<br/><br/>Not only did it not fulfill what I needed, but Matt Damon's character just seemed to dumb to me, and in the lead role thats not something you want. It wasn't his acting that I didn't like, he's a good actor, but he just didn't come off as a bright person. I also cannot believe his character could get a way with what he does for so long.<br/><br/>Now I know this movie is a serious movie, or supposed to be, but the characters kept cracking jokes lightening the mood, for whatever reason, I just never could take the movie seriously. I also couldn't take the ending seriously, but I'm sure some people loved it(it wasn't very clever). I always thought I'd love an ending like this one, but not from this movie.<br/><br/>Marky Mark also needed to be in the movie more, he was hilarious in it and should have been a bad ass too, but just didn't have a big enough part to make his mark.<br/><br/>Go see the movie or don't and you'll probably love it, but after seeing the first 10 minutes or so I expected a lot more. If you give me or anybody the set up to this movie, I'm sure we all could have wrote a movie as good as this one it would be different, but just as entertaining, it was the idea that made this movie watchable the plot just never went in the right direction."

Then, were one a Boston cop/detective/investigator one would have cause to be plenty miffed at having the police department portrayed, as done here, as being populated by a bunch of screaming bunglers who are badly in need of remedial investigation and surveillance skills.

","For fans of Troy Duffy's The Boondock Saints (2001), this movie returns to gunslinging Boston, Mass. for another parlay into a rain of bullets, but this time, there isn't the religious ethos eternally present. I have to say I didn't even know from seeing the previews that this movie took place in Boston. But was literally ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT through two hours of this two and a half hour film. I found the fact that a plethora of not even a shred of Irish actors managed to put on the appropriate linguistic vowel pronunciations to sound the part, and that their jibes were effectively Irish and at the same time affectionate, something I consider not so easy to do. With an absolutely stellar cast of actors at the top of their game, this is a movie not to be missed as you will undoubtedly be left out of countless conversations regarding it. One of my fave parts of the film has to do simply with a suit. Jack Nicholson's character ""Costello"" is wearing a gray, micro-checked suit with what looks like a textured suede-cheetah print tie. FANTASTIC job by the costume designer on using the suit as a way of showing the immense personality and charisma that is presented through the character. I WANT that suit! That's how much I liked it. Amazing."

","The 2 men behind the Hong Kong box office drama Infernal Affairs, Andrew Lau and Alan Mak, will be pleased with Martin Scorsese for giving new life to the Asian trilogy.<br/><br/>The Departed is an adaptation of Infernal Affairs Trilogy, where Leonardo DiCaprio's Billy Costigan is the role of Tony Leung Chiu Wai's Chan Wing Yan, while Matt Damon's Colin Sullivan reprises the role of Andy Lau's Lau Kin Ming. Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello is an Italian mafia, which is an answer to Eric Tsang's Sam, a Hong Kong trial society's kingpin. Martin Sheen's Oliver Queenan is the equivalent to Anthony Wong's SP Wong in the American adaptation.<br/><br/>Scorsese has given a new life to Infernal Affairs trilogy, where he concluded the whole story in 152 minutes, rather than making it into a trilogy adaptation.<br/><br/>Firstly, it was a full American flavored, where the story was presented in American context, instead of sticking closely to the Hong Kong version. FBI, Italian mafia and grocery store is the answer to Hong Kong Police Force, trial society and illegal gambling dens. By using something that is closer to home, Scorsese tells a story from Asia with American background.<br/><br/>Secondly, bits of elements from Infernal Affairs 2 and 3 was seen in The Departed, such as Costello being a womanizer and the short conversation between Queenan and Costello with Dignam (Mark Walhberg). This may not seem sticking close to the trilogy, but it shortens the time taken to know the tale behind the trilogy.<br/><br/>DiCaprio, Damon and Nicholson may be the whole focus of the film, but it was Walberg's Dignam that leaves the audience with the deepest impression. A hot tempered and fouled mouth inspector, he was not seen in Infernal Affairs trilogy, which adds a new twist to The Departed. Vera Farmiga's Madolyn is the combination of Kelly Chen's Dr Lee Sum Yee, the psychiatrist Chan was seeing, and Mary, the lover of Lau.<br/><br/>Scorsese ends the film with an unexpected twist, which has proved a success to The Departed. If Infernal Affairs has impress you, The Departed brings Infernal Affairs to a greater height."

I have to admit, I'm probably going to be a little biased in my rating of the movie, because Mark Whalburg, Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio all happen to be some of my favorites, and of course, do not disappoint me in this movie.

","THE DEPARTED Written by William Monahan Directed by Martin Scorcese<br/><br/>This is it, folks. It's the one you've all been waiting for. It is a true return to form, style and relevance. It has been all too easy, almost expected, to laud Martin Scorcese pictures with praise in recent years. The man has talent and has crafted some of cinema's landmark films, from TAXI DRIVER to GOODFELLAS. The industry was naming his last picture, THE AVIATOR, the film of the year. That seemed exaggerated, an all too safe a thing to say. To name the same of his previous epic mess, GANGS OF NEW YORK, was even more absurd. There seemed to be regret for not crowning him king earlier for more deserving efforts. The later pity praise felt apologetic instead of congratulatory. The films themselves felt manufactured for mass appeal, devoid of personal involvement and often a courting of industry acceptance. This time is different. This time Scorcese feels concise and calculated, like a man with a purpose, focus. This time Scorcese has left his hopes for accolades behind him and engineered his own cinematic rebirth. This time Scorcese says goodbye to his past and embraces THE DEPARTED.<br/><br/>Borrowing its intricately woven story from the 2002 Japanese film, INFERNAL AFFAIRS, THE DEPARTED stars Leonardo Dicaprio and Matt Damon as moles infiltrating both sides of a war between the law and organized crime. Dicaprio plays Billy Costigan, a Boston State Policeman with a family history entrenched in crime. As he is trying to make a new name for his family, he is thrown back into the world he worked so hard to escape. Costigan will go undercover and make his way into the confidence of Boston's biggest crime boss, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Costello, meanwhile, has his own man on the inside of the Boston State Police, Colin Sullivan (Damon). Sullivan was brought under Costello's wing when he was just a boy who was doing well in school. Both Costigan and Sullivan sought power. Costigan's power lied in authority and changing his apparent destiny through hard work. Sullivan was seduced by a different kind of power. He still had to work hard but he had the muscle to back him up when he needed it. Dicaprio's and Damon's solid performances heighten the tension and make for insightful character studies. As Costigan, Dicaprio is anxious and unstable. Pretending to be a brute with nothing to live for and no reason to do bad other than it being his genetic makeup goes against everything he's ever struggled with. His eyes flare up and his whole body flinches every time he is around intense violence; he never seems to get used to it. As Sullivan, Damon is a confident, cocky liar who gets off on how many people he's fooling and just how well he is fooling them, from his colleagues on the force (a supporting cast consisting of Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin) to his psychiatrist girlfriend, Madolyn (the relatively unknown and engaging Vera Farmiga). When it becomes apparent that both teams have been permeated, the game to catch the rat becomes tenser the closer each gets to figuring the other out. Amidst growing suspicion and fear of getting caught, THE DEPARTED becomes unpredictable and entrancing.<br/><br/>The surprisingly layered performance of Nicholson as Costello is one of THE DEPARTED's best features. I expected that Nicholson could pull off a mob boss in his sleep but he brings experience and the effects of time to the role. Like one would expect, one doesn't become a mob boss from being a nice guy. Costello is evil right through. He finds amusement in how a body slumps over to the side instead of forward when he blows a bullet through the back of her head. He has grown accustomed to getting everything he wants, to having no one stand in his way. To some extent though, he has grown bored and complacent with this lifestyle. He knows of nothing else but knows that alternatives exist. He seems to live his life appreciative of his position but with regret, or at least an awareness, that he did not make other decisions. When he speaks of Costigan's father as a guy who could have been a big boss if he wanted to but didn't, the acknowledgment alone highlights the power of choice. When he tells Costigan that he should go back to school, it highlights his own choices.<br/><br/>Something Costello is fond of saying is that ""No one gives it to you; you have to take it."" It is a mantra for Costello and it seems like one for Scorcese as well regarding his approach to this film. Scorcese's command of THE DEPARTED can be felt in the composition of each shot, in the energy of the omnipresent soundtrack and the grasp of the subject matter. Like Costello, Scorcese has been coasting in recent years; the results have been passable, at times solid, but always tired. THE DEPARTED announces Scorcese's return to making affirmative choices again, and the right one's at that."

","First he sets the characters and the world up so vividly, so interestingly and with such finesse. You watch him stack the dominoes side-by-side, wondering where he's going, what pattern he's making. And before you know it, he knocks one of them over and you watch the domino chain fall in the most exciting and elaborate way. The tension in this film just rises and rises - it's so incredibly well structured and paced. The film becomes exhilarating - a word I too rarely get to use to describe a film.<br/><br/>This is an instant classic - a definitive crime film. The cast is fantastic - what a great ensemble piece. Scorsese is the best thing that's ever happened to DiCaprio - he turned the guy into a real actor and this is his best role so far. Damon is great, Sheen, Wahlberg, Baldwin...excellent. Nicholson is very entertaining - sure, he hams it up a little - but it's so well done. The cinematography is at the same time very visceral and immediate, as well as cinematic - capturing the excellent setting of Boston in a very unique way.<br/><br/>Sure, I was expecting great things - but not this good. Scorsese knocked this out of the park. I couldn't give this anything but a 10/10. This is a film that people will be talking about fifty years from now."

"dhaufrect","10","0","1","13 October 2006"," ""The Departed"" is an outstanding addition for Scorcese
","Martin Scorsese has succeeded in creating a masterful thriller in his recent release of ""The Departed"". Jack Nicholson does another piece of perfect portrayal of Frank Costello, and underworld villain whom one loves to hate. Matt Damon is a cop who becomes an undercover agent on the dark side named Colin Sulivan. He too gives a thrilling performance and he leaves no stone unturned. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan the ""good guy"" cop with a distorted childhood. Martin Sheen is Oliver Queenan, the lead cop in the Boston patrol who organizes the sting, and gets tied up in his own plot. Alec Baldwin is the chief police officer on the Boston team in charge of the hunt for Costello. There are few moments that lack suspense, and surprises are abundant. It may be a bit too violent for the young, however, the violence is well performed and tastefully fits the tone. ""The Departed"" is a must see movie for 2006, so be sure to put it on your list now."

","Well, in this movie, both the Good Guy and the Bad Guy have badges. Ben Affleck is the crooked cop, Colin Sullivan. He works for Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), an Irish-American gangster whom Sullivan has both feared and idolized since childhood. And, he apparently measures success by how close he can live to the ritzy neighborhood where the Old Boston Statehouse is located.<br/><br/>Leo DiCaprio , on the other hand, plays Billy Costigan. An honest cop whose late father was apparently a nouveau riche gangster who married a Boston Brahmin debutant. And, so, he has spent most of his young life feeling like an outcast in both the blue-collar and green-collar parts of Beantown.<br/><br/>Costigan is recruited to spy on Costello's mob, so that Capt. Queenan (Martin Sheen) can finally send his old rival to prison. While Sullivan, of course, is paid to keep that from happening! In a way, then, these two young men are just pawns in a real-life game of chess, where Queenan and Costello are the players.<br/><br/>But, in a major piece of irony, the pawns _become_ the players after the deaths of both Queenan and Costello! And, caught between them is Madolyn, the psycho-analyst they both fall in love with.<br/><br/>Just like in ""Taxi Driver,"" Martin Scorsese proves that morality is not so much black-and-white as various shades of gray.

"ignus5uk","8","0","1","13 October 2006"," A real gem and simply brilliant...but don't forget the original!
","Based on the Hong Kong masterpiece 'Infernal Affairs', Martin Scorsese delivers what is an instant classic with profundity and after a few misguided films (such as 'Bringing out the Dead') Scorsese is back on top form with 'The Departed'. From the opening frames of Jack Nicholson and the bone-crunching chords of 'The Rolling Stones', we can see Scoresese's talent and dexterity shines through at the highest level and you know this is a ride that will thrill you and keep you attentive until it fades to black.<br/><br/>Set in present day Boston, with Irish gangsters dominating the state, 'The Departed' tells the tale of Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) undercover and assigned to infiltrate the mob run by crime lord Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). While Costigan gains Costello's trust more and more and enters into the murky crime-world, we see Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), a rising Police officer through the ranks and a protégé of Costello, acting as an informant for the crime-syndicate. As we see each character getting deeper and deeper into their double life, it soon becomes apparent to the mob and the Police that a rat is in their midst, which places danger on Costigan and Sullivan's lives, who must race to expose the enemy's identity to save himself.<br/><br/>'The Departed' has a multitude of depth to it and is able to deal with a myriad of themes such as loyalty, betrayal and relationships. We are also able to see Nietzsche philosophy of good and evil within each character as a prominent theme emerge. These are all evident throughout 'Infernal Affairs' too, however are presented slightly more subtly. 'The Departed' is not flawless and although these may be few, it is these that separate this from 'Infernal Affair', which was there first and with better results.<br/><br/>William Monahan provides the script and with the tame and meandering 'Kingdom of Heaven' in his past now, Monahan screen writes the western take on the emotional 'Infernal Affairs' , without a dependency on its predecessor. Monahan does not restrict himself to what is in the original and is able to add a new hemisphere of further character and story development with an explosive and stinging dialogue, whether it be from Jack Nicholson's darkly wit or Mark Walberg's punchy, foul-mouth.<br/><br/>There are buckets of gore to secure a quite just 18 certificate and it is not this that Scorsese uses to create high amounts of drama. It is well-directed scenes with little dialogue and it is these that produce a dynamic tension that is only comparable to that of Hitchcock.<br/><br/>As far as the casting goes, it seems as though everyone brought their A game to the film. DiCaprio continues to show us no end to his ability as an actor as we see his character slowing descending to a breaking point. Matt Damon is also able to give a highly emotional and complex performance, while Nicholson is able to bring characteristics of his role as 'The Joker' and reach's unprecedented heights of evil with what is undoubtedly one of his finest performances. With an equally glamorous and star filled supporting cast we see talent and charisma ooze through from the likes of Ray Winstone and Martin Sheen. Vera Farmiga is a wonderful actress who brings a mix of sex-appeal and intelligence to her role. Although Walberg's performance is one of the finest and most memorable of the film, it almost feels as though he creates a slight obstacle between what should have been a more emotional and father-son type relationship between DiCaprio and Sheen's characters.<br/><br/>Leaving those unnecessary questions behind such as 'Is it Scorsese's year at the Oscars?' and watching 'The Departed' with an open mind and heart, you will forget some of the minor flaws, shout at the screen as you are rooting for both DiCaprio and Damon and love every minute of the next best thing since Goodfellas!"
"gazzaa2","9","0","2","13 October 2006"," Scorcese back on form with a modern classic
","As a big fan of Martin Scorcese and his earlier films, I have long waited for him to produce a modern classic and return to his favoured gangster genre. Goodfellas, Casino and Mean Streets specifically are all gangster classics but in recent times, his modern stuff, like The Gangs of New York hasn't been as watchable. I wondered before hand, whether this re-make of the Asian classic ""Internal Affairs"" was wise but as re-makes go, its fantastic. The difference this time was the classic script was back; The Departed is wonderfully written and like Goodfellas from all different angles. Its hard hitting, its funny, its tough and gritty but unlike Goodfellas, it doesn't attempt to humanise, either the Gangsters, or show their good side, or even the same with the law side. Its every man for himself in the film but what every character values deep down is loyalty and throughout the film some have it in abundance and others only to an extent. While the selfishness and greed is the downfall of some, loyalty is the downfall of others.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson produces his best performance for a long time as Irish boss Frank Costello and Ray Winston is good as a more dumbed down role, as Costello's right hand man. These two men value loyalty but only show it to each other and Costello is a dangerous man to trust.<br/><br/>Matt Damon and Leonardo Di Caprio play differing but similar ambiguous roles and rarely appear as they seem to the people they get close to, whilst both having a keen interest in the same woman. Billy Costigan played by Di Caprio is a man with no ties in his life and whilst looking to get into law enforcement is sent on a mission to bring down Costello and his crew and has a tough job trying to keep his cover. This isn't made any easier by Matt Damon's character Sullivan, who is sent by Costello into law enforcement to keep the crew on the street and out of jail. Martin Sheen and Mark Whalberg play excellent supporting roles in the police force and are the only cops who know about Costigan's undercover operation but struggle to keep it a secret, while finding out who the rat is, in their department.<br/><br/>The plot twists and unfolds in a thrilling and unpredictable way, right till the end and goes down easily as one of the best gangster films of the decade. Highly recommended"
"djtodd","9","0","1","13 October 2006"," A taut film with excellent dialogue and great acting
","I don't have a great deal of time to write a review of this film, but suffice to say that I thought this was an excellent, compelling movie. It has realistic dialogue for the most part (the law enforcement characters are a little over the top at times, but this provides comic relief) and I thought Leo's performance was simply amazing. Overall, the film is intelligent and well directed. I honestly would have liked a half an hour more of scenes from the criminal side of the film since Nicholson's character is wondrously evil and fascinating. I am a bit critical when it comes to films, and this is only one a very few movies that I thoroughly enjoyed and will likely see again. The plot is not overly twisty, but it is strung together in a smart way that requires some work from the audience. Strong language and violence may turn off many, so make sure you have the stomach. Lastly, Matt Damon's performance is on part with the rest of the film, but Damon, for me at least, is just one of the actors who is always himself...like Tom Cruise. What I mean is that he simply can't make me suspend my disbelief like Leo or Jack does in this film. This is not to say his performance is poor, but just a little underwhelming. Fortunately for him he chooses good roles and puts his heart into his acting.<br/><br/>Overall, this film did the job for me and now I must watch Internal Affairs ASAP."

","This genuinely is a ten out of ten movie. No exaggeration. From the first frame to the last this screams Oscar at you. Best Actor (presumably Damon, but Di Caprio's role is just as awesome) best supporting actor for Nicholson (no question whatsoever) His rat scene rivals Anthony Hopkins' Fava beans for outrageousness. Best Director (goes without saying) Best movie, best editing for Thelma Shoomaker. Best adapted screenplay. The soundtrack's pretty cool too - even if the use of Comfortably Numb, which I predicted to myself quietly as the scene before it prompted (Was it Van Morrison covering?), was a bit corny.<br/><br/>If there is a weakness it could be the love interest coincidence which I felt was a touch unlikely, but so what I'll forgive that.<br/><br/>The swearing is as good as I've ever seen in a movie. Really, really great F****** swearing. Really great.<br/><br/>The cast is universally magnificent and the scriptwriting is so real it's like...real.<br/><br/>The (many) deaths are executed like you'd expect them to be in real life, no huge contorted death scenes, just wham bam you're dead.<br/><br/>My jaw was on my chest for most of this movie.

","After the movie concluded (and it ended in about 4 parts), I practically slumped, exhausted, in my seat. After 2 1/2 hours, almost no one in the theater even stirred. It was an amazing, emotional experience. I felt like I had watched a season of ""Deadwood"", ""The Shield"" and ""24"". Whew! <br/><br/>Since 100's of people have reviewed the plot, I just needed to decompress by saying that the performances were uniformly amazing, right down to the most minute roles. Sensational casting, and Scorcese got them all to nail their performances. Nicholson is never over the top, just the right mix of menacing and zany. DeCaprio, who I felt struggled with ""Gangs of NY"" and had nothing but crazy to fall back on in ""The Aviator"", gives an electrifying performance here. He and Nickolson should start working on their acceptance speeches. Not to slight Matt Damon, who has the charismatic baddie role down perfectly. The film is so perfectly cast that I could go on and on (Walhberg & Baldwin had insanely cracking dialog), but must mention Vera Farmiga. If I've seen her before, I don't remember it, but her she handles a very difficult part with great style. She made the ""girlfriend"" role interesting and meaningful. She was stylish and attractive, without the stunning ""movie star"" look. Of all the players, she should come away with a huge career boast. <br/><br/>So, a perfect movie? Pretty damn close. I could use a little less violence, but apparently Boston has its own ""Mean Streets""!!!!"

The Departed was an intense crime-drama that I literally did not want to end. I had my doubts about DiCaprio playing this part but he nailed it.

"pitstick1349","10","0","2","12 October 2006"," The Best Movie of the Decade
","Up there with Goodfellas, Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. And in many ways, it's better than them all. It has the depth of Taxi Driver, touching on the human values and ethics of today's corrupt world. It has the same style of Goodfellas, in it's unexpected violence, and hilarious dialog. Moreover, it has Raging Bull's delicate touch of human passion and emotion, which carries this adrenaline charged story. It's quite impossible to compare one Scorsese film to another. The only ones that even resemble each other are Casino and Goodfellas. (one could argue Goodfellas and Mean Streets.) There is no way that this movie can be hyped up enough, but don't let anybody ruin it for you! (It is very unpredictable.) The music is amazing, and unlike Goodfellas, it doesn't carry the movie, it only emphasizes on the situational moments. This is the best movie of the decade, the best I've seen in a theater since Fight Club. Jack Nicholson is back, DiCaprio is finally here, and its the best movie both of their careers.....hands down."
"ghostface626","10","0","1","12 October 2006"," Scorcese's defining moment
","It's no surprise by now that Martin Scorscese has long since lived the bill as one of Hollywood's greatest directors never to have won the Oscar for best director. Like Kubrick or Hitchcock before him, Scorcese has never been able to persuade the Academy with his amazing visual accomplishments. Not that this means very much seeing that anyone who knows anything knows the Academy voters have always been weak minded. With the exception of Citizen Kane, the biggest example being in 1981 when Best Picture and Best Director went to Ordinary People, instead of Raging Bull. No offense to Robert Redford but Martin Scorcese got robbed. However history itself can now be changed, with the release of The Departed.<br/><br/>The Departed quite simply is Martin Scorsese's masterpiece. It is a remake based on the Chinese film Infernal Affairs about a cop who infiltrates the mob only to discover that there is a mole within the police system putting his life in serious jeopardy. Leornardo DiCaprio portrays the undercover cop delivering a riveting and ultra mature performance as his character throughout the film unfolds in never understanding completely who he is. Jack is just being Jack as the lead gangster in a role tailored only for himself. Matt Damon gives a convincing turn as the mole always manipulative as his characters life is all one lie. With Mark Wahlburg showing that cursing has never been so hilarious, and Martin Sheen along Alec Baldwin contributing impressive veteran presences, this film has it all. As a roller-coaster from beginning to end, this film delivers the goods on a scale never imagined. Scorsese has really scored big here as it shows this is the film he was born to make. Complemented by a brilliant screenplay the film kind of runs at you with the substance of what Donnie Brasco could have been mixed with what Goodfellas really was."
"dillyboy_4","9","0","2","12 October 2006"," Scorsese's Best. Better than Goodfellas, Raging Bull, and The Aviator.
","This film absolutely blew me away. I've seen it twice, so I'll give you my summary.<br/><br/>First of all, it's amazing how Scorsese is able to keep you drawn to the screen. The backdrop and atmosphere of the movie isn't that interesting, but somehow you are drawn into each scene.<br/><br/>The scene in which Nicholson is trying to find out if DiCaprio is a rat from the police department is a classic. Nicholson does a fantastic job of toying around with DiCaprio. This may be the best scene in the film.<br/><br/>Speaking of DiCaprio, his acting in the film is flawless. In his previous Scorsese effort, The Aviator, he tended to over-do his acting in some scenes. This is not the case with The Departed. The acting is incredibly solid, and DiCaprio may finally win Best Actor for his performance. Not to be outdone, Damon and Wahlberg also show us some of their best performances in their career. When you have a film where each actor is giving their best performance, you know that there is something special going on.<br/><br/>The film never drags, and doesn't ever get to a point of dullness. I found myself riveted the first and second time, which is why this film gets a 10 out of 10. Don't pay any attention to those saying that this is a carbon copy of a Japanese film; 90% of the people watching the film don't know that anyway! Best film of 2006. Hands down."
"supertom-3","10","0","2","12 October 2006"," Masterpiece.
","When this project was first announced as Scorsese's next film; there was undoubtedly a sense of trepidation from the movie goers. Perhaps a sense, from myself included, that Martin was selling out, and following the Hollywood bandwagon, in its pursuit to remake, or redo. We are rife with remakes and sequels, spin offs and the rest, with nary an original film in site these days. Rightly it was a concern that Mart was re-doing one of the best films to ever come out of Hong Kong. A concern that would be the same if he'd done the Killer over again, or any of the decidedly few master pieces from the land the brought us Jackie Chan. And what is the result? The result, thankfully, is a rare remake that betters the original, and is also one of Scorsese's best films. Certainly it's his best since Goodfella's and already is being talked about as a masterpiece, that will retain the same adoration that Fellas, Taxi Driver and Raging Bull still have to this day. It's certainly able to stand toe to toe with his previous best works, three of the finest movies ever made. Will it become a regular in the age old argument of what is Scorsese's best film? Ask me in ten years time! Anyway, the Departed is a fabulous film. In truth the film, for me, started off quite slow. As I initially sat and watched, I felt a sense that the film has been hyped, praised and placed on a pedestal, perhaps not its worth. It's an opening period while the story catches up to the here and now, and while we acclimatise ourselves to the Boston accents, that jar initially to how we recognise Nicholson et al, as speaking in real life. No sooner does the tale switch into the realm's of intrigue, and psychological study though, do we see it begin to become engrossed into a thoroughly brilliant piece of work, and in truth it's important to remember that even Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and to a less extent, Goodfella's, started the same. Arguably it's a great way to really suck the audience in, letting them ease themselves into the experience.<br/><br/>The story is full of twists and turns with essentially Di Caprio's undercover cop ingratiating himself into the world of Boston big boss gangster, Frank Costello (Nicholson). Simultaneously, there's Colin Sullivan, a state policeman, and almost an adopted son to Costello, who keeps Costello constantly informed of the polices investigations against him. As both characters get deeper into their roles, both lose their identity, and become darker, particularly the once do-gooder, Billy Costigan , played by Di Caprio. It's not long before Costello suspects a rat in his organisation, and the police too suspect a mole in theirs. The film is full of surprise and is paced exceptionally well, until the inevitable climax.<br/><br/>The cast are first rate. Di Caprio is outstanding, really shining again. Since starring in Titanic, he's moved away from mainstream as much as possible. He's also picked and chosen his roles carefully, and not in much regularity. Again Di Caprio firmly establishes himself as one of the finest actors to have emerged in the last ten years. He is currently Scorsese's go to man, and this generations De Niro, or Pacino. If there were any question marks over him being merely a poster boy, then this puts them to rest. Di Caprio, is an actor of the highest calibre. Jack Nicholson also delivers in a role that could so easily have been from his 1970's heydey. So dark in so Jack. He's tried to play his age a bit more in recent times, and also go quirky. But here, there's a dark side to Nicholson, and intensity that evokes many of his early masterpieces. Nicholson could be a good bet for an Oscar nomination (he's not the only one in this). Mark Wahlberg delivers his best performance too, while Martin Sheen, Vera Farmiga, Ray Winstone and Alec Baldwin are all excellent. For me though Matt Damon stands out here. He delivers a superb performance, and again is a fine actor who oft gets question marks over his validity as a top HW performer. Perhaps his association with Ben Affleck holds him back but lest we not forget, Damon is already an Oscar nominated actor. With this role, and his role in the upcoming The Good Shepard, Damon could really put himself right up as one of the top talents around. He, as Leo, Nicholson and also Baldwin, should be receiving an Oscar nod for his work here.<br/><br/>Scorsese as per usual shoots this brilliantly. His sense of imagery, pacing, and direction is almost unsurpassable in the modern era. The film looks the part, as well as having gorgeous photography, a brilliant score and one hell of a soundtrack. All in all, The Departed is the first awe-inspiring, potential masterpieces, since Schindler's List. It's a film worthy of being in the HW golden period of the 70's when guys like Scorsese, Polanski, Forman, Coppolla, Lumet, reigned supreme. This will only continue to gain more and more status. *****"

At the same time Colin Sullivan, played by Matt Damon giving a rare performance as the 'bad guy', a member of the Irish Mafia infiltrates the police departments special intelligence unit. It ends up being a struggle for survival for both men when both the police department and the mob discover that a rat is amongst them.<br/><br/>While the main characters are brilliantly acted, for me the best role in this film was played by Mark Wahlberg, playing Sgt Dignam.

I actually thought Walhberg did a good job as well where I wasn't a huge fan of his acting ability beforehand (except in Boogie Nights). I probably would have voted this movie a ""10"" if the ending wasn't disappointing. I felt shocked when DiCaprio's character got blown away at the end. I am sentimental I guess, I liked his character and thought he put more on the line to stop crime and bring down a madman than 99.9% of us would do. I think it may have been a better ending if Wahlberg's character showed up at the elevator to blow Matt Damon and the other guy away and save Costigan (DiCaprio). Having said that, I realize that the ending was a wakeup call to illustrate that not all great cops have a happy ending. I think the movie is a sure fire Oscar nominee for best picture, as well as Scorsese for Director, DiCaprio for best actor (or supporting actor if they decide he wasn't the mian guy), and possibly Matt Damon as best actor/ supporting actor."
"raysond","Null","0","2","12 October 2006"," Overflowing with performances..""The Departed"" is one of the best films of the year.
","As with most Martin Scorsese films are:beautifully edited,brutally violent sequences,brimming with life even as bodies are hitting the floor in pool of blood and gore,all awash in a blaring Rolling Stones tune where the musical selection in either Scorsese movie is usually The Rolling Stones' ""Gimme Shelter"",or some other signature tune with have the musical selections of either Tony Bennett,Dean Martin or perhaps Frank Sinatra. This is always the case in any mob-gangland crime drama that is coming from any Martin Scorsese movie.<br/><br/>His newest venture,""The Departed"" is basically the Americanized version of the 2002 Hong Kong hit ""Internal Affairs,""-but this remake of that movie is pure vintage Scorsese at his finest and one of the best films of the year. This comes from a veteran director who knows his territory-who has made a brilliant study and a magnificent film about Boston cops and mobsters(this time around its the Irish mafia instead of the Italian syndicate)with dazzlingly rich performances from a top notch stellar cast and an ambiance that screams Scorsese's typical cultural authenticity. And this is coming from a director who is known for gritty crime dramas,and his returns to that familiar side of the mean streets is a welcome sight. Leonardo DiCaprio,reuniting with the director for a third film following ""Gangs Of New York"" and ""The Aviator"",stars as Billy Costigan,a Massachusetts State Police detective who has gone undercover to take down syndicate crime boss and head of the Boston Irish mafia Frank Costello(Jack Nicholson, in a devlish tour de force performance that is worth seeing and the return of the Jack Nicholson everybody loves--crazy,out of control and always doing the unexpected). Matt Damon,meanwhile stars as the crime boss'protégé,Colin Sullivan,who worked his way up the state police ranks to become staff sergeant of the special investigations unit. The two function in a perfect parallel until it starts to become clear that Costello's gang is staying one step ahead of the police,even while the police seem to know too much about Costello's operations. Never the use of cell-phone text messaging seemed so sinister. <br/><br/>And so Billy and Colin are each asked to sniff out the rat(or stoolie)in their midst-to seek out each other. It's a nice touch that the two actors(DiCaprio and Damon)so strongly resemble each other,with those crystal blue eyes and a look that can be considered boyish or fiendish,depending on your view or perspective. However,Billy and Colin are on two sides of the same coin,both raised in South Boston,trying to escape their lineage of Southie Irish trash but having chosen opposing routes.(The screenwriter William Monahan grew up in the city of Boston and draws strongly from his roots. He absolutely knows the people and rhythms,not to mention the mean streets of it too. Scorsese shot much of the picture on location in Boston and also in New York,and that actors Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg are natives of the city too--they were born and raised in Boston. If you listen to the accents,at least they got it right.)<br/><br/>The movie itself delivers a clever but thrilling moment in each scene and this what makes the film a standout,especially with the performances from the actors. It's movie that grabs your attention and from there it never let's go. ""The Departed"" is a game of cat-and-mouse and goes very well with the shocking climax that will have you on the edge of your seat. The brash energy and breathtaking suspense keeps the film on focus throughout. Among the cast members here,Mark Wahlberg is eloquently brilliant as the surly sergeant in the brash detective unit,and basically steals just about every scene he's in; Alec Baldwin as the jacked-up police captain,is just as darkly funny. On the other side,the under-appreciated British character actor Ray Winstone is a force of nature,as always,playing Costello's top thug. Actress Vera Farmiga provides a touch of warmth as a police psychiatrist and the only woman among the main characters-though it is a massive plot contrivance to have her character get involved with both Billy and Colin. Anthony Anderson is along for the ride as one of the detective working under the supervision of Colin. But mostly the film belongs to Jack Nicholson who basically commands every scene and most of all do whatever he's involved. Their work and that of Martin Sheen as the under pressure level handed captain of the department who places Billy undercover,protects his identity and helps him keep sane before his cover is completely blown. At a running time of 154 minutes,this is a movie that is riveting from start to finish with lots of soul searching before reaching its climatic rooftop conclusion. One of the best of the fall batch of the movies to be out this year that stands among the crowd,and for director Martin Scorsese,the Oscar for Best Director will come at a greater time than now for this brilliant masterpiece."

"DICK STEEL","10","0","3","12 October 2006"," A Nutshell Review: The Departed
","The big question on the minds of those who have seen the original Hong Kong movie is whether this Hollywood remake is worth watching. I'd say hell yeah, down to your last dollar, weekend price or otherwise.<br/><br/>Infernal Affairs (2002)earned its place in recent Asian movie history for reenergizing the cop thriller genre. Directed by Andrew Lau and Alan Mak, the movie had a one of a kind storyline about mole vs mole in the underworld and the police, and starred heavyweights Andy Lau and Tony Leung Chiu-Wai in the lead roles, with support by recognized character actors Anthony Wong, and Eric Tsang, with the appeal of Gen-X/Y actors in Edison Chen and Shawn Yue.<br/><br/>After opening to rave reviews and becoming a trilogy, the rumour mill was out and about with Hollywood wanting to do a remake, starring Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise, whom to my personal speculation, would have just been as riveting with either actors taking on either role. It's a kind of Face/Off situation where the distinction between good-bad guys gets blurred.<br/><br/>Essentially, with any spectacular, gripping story, you can have it done and made countless of times, and each version should all come out great given that the source - the story - is the same. However, it is always easy to screw up and not meet expectations, and herein likes the innate pressure that the cast and crew must have felt, taking on something that works, and making it their own.<br/><br/>In Martin Scorsese's The Departed, the director teams up once again with Leonardo DiCaprio, after two consecutive collaborations in Gangs of New York and The Aviator. Here, DiCaprio takes on Tony Leung's role as the police mole in the underworld, headed by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). As Billy Costigan, the biggest challenge is always to be on the positive side of an unsteady gangland boss, and maintaining some form of sanity while dealing with an identity crisis. Matt Damon is Colin Sullivan, in a role modelled after Andy Lau's, as the gang member inside the police force, feeding information to Costello. He finds himself living the good life. and contemplates the risk in having throw it all away should he get caught. And the cat and mouse game begins as both moles try to outwit, outplay and outlast each other, knowing that any revelation of their true identities will be totally disastrous, each trying to flush the other guy out.<br/><br/>The acting's all round superb from both leads, with a stellar ensemble featuring recognizable faces in Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin. It's a welcome return for Nicholson back in the bad guy role after his recent attempts at comedies. I thought each instance where Wahlberg came on is a hoot, as his character, Dignam, comes with a dirty mouth which shoots off the cuff. In fact, Anthony Wong's character had to be split into two, shared between Sheen and Wahlberg (which I think is a nod to Wong's ability, given two persons required to fill his shoes). Newcomer Vera Farmiga took on Kelly Chen's role as the psychiatrist and Sammi Cheng's role combined into one, doing away with probably an additional unnecessary character which the original featured. There are other minor changes along the way (no remake can be an exact copy of another), but none too drastic, keeping intact the integrity of the premise, key scenes, and plot elements and devices.<br/><br/>Clocking in at almost two and a half hours, an hour longer than the original, you will not feel its length, even as the movie took its time to establish the story and its characters. The dialogue is a major draw with some memorable lines, and if you've watched the original, your mind is constantly racing to draw parallels, but in most times, you'll find it equally engaging and as exciting, as if you're coming across the story for the very first time. Of course the pivotal ending, which was marred with the original having two of them to pander to being politically correct, is one such scene which actually helps to build anticipation as to how Scorsese would have to conclude. It's that sense of familiarity, yet a sense of something new. With some scenes being extended in duration, it helped build a certain depth for the characters as well, which does wonders for the movie.<br/><br/>But what I felt lacked in this remake, was that personal link between the two moles, of a ""what-if"" scenario between the two before they faced off each other. Here, they are adversaries all the way, but the original provided a sort of hint, that if these two were on the same side of the law, they could have been the best of friends. Also, in the first mole versus mole match up, while in an attempt to be different from the original, it unfortunately lacked the intensity that Infernal Affairs had, but just for this particular scene.<br/><br/>If you're wondering if The Departed is as good as Infernal Affairs, I'd say it is a worthy remake, except for that cheesy last shot before the end credits rolled. Some folks are already screaming Oscars.<br/><br/>But remember, Asian Cinema produced this gem first!<br/><br/>P.S even though rated M18 locally, there were noticeable cuts in the movie, especially in dialogues."
"lauralol2002","10","0","1","12 October 2006"," Jaw dropping fantastic
","And yes my jaw did actually drop on a number of occasions throughout this film as I witnessed one of the finest films produced by Scorcese and in the gangster genre in a long time.<br/><br/>Scorcese is back doing what he does best: creating gritty, uncompromising urban dramas that centre around tough working class boys, playing men, who continually vie, simultaneously, for both your affections and loathing.<br/><br/>The pace of this film, (noteably because of the deliberately abrupt style of Scorcese's editor Thelma Schoonmaker) leaves you reeling, as does the dialogue that is layered with Boston street and cop slang as the characters continually use each other as punch bags, both physically and verbally. The casting is superb and each actor cranks up their macho and prowess to give 100% to their characters, probably aware that as a Scorcese film, their every word and action will be taken apart and mimicked.<br/><br/>What separates Scorcese from his contemporaries in this film and indeed in this genre is that he allows the characters to have layers, each man pitting his wits against the other in attempt to achieve whatever it is they are searching for, both personally and professionally. That sounds a little deep, but it is rare in todays saturated market of ""gansgta"" movies and the false image of urban culture that the mainstream movie industry is forcing down everyones throats, to have characters from tough areas to be portrayed as scared, comical, stupid, evil, good, courageous and real all at the same time.<br/><br/>I already want to see this film again and I only saw it last night"

It's a long film and really requires a great deal of concentration to follow the intricacies of the story.

"LewAshby","Null","0","1","10 October 2006"," My 2 cents
","It was a really good movie up until Leo got shot, that was just completely unnecessary IMO all it did was take the whole audience by surprise and from the sound of it, they didn't like it. It's as though he was too good to die like that and even though it was for dramatic purposes i felt Sheen's death was enough. Speaking of which, am i the only one who feels like we could've gotten more from a Sheen and Nicholson relationship like Pacino and DeNiro in heat? I also thought Wahlberg was grossly under used and although he came back in a big way he should've been around a lot more.<br/><br/>The death scene of Nicholson also left me feeling like it could've been a bit more engaging, maybe throw in Leo or something (might've been 2 on 1 but not if Wahlberg was around).<br/><br/>back to Leo's death, it was just too fast and cluttered. It's good when a movie blindsides you---think million dollar baby---but sometimes it's okay to show the good guy on top and his character was deserving of that.<br/><br/>Remakes are always being changed around and this could've benefited from a few of them."

"Utterkins","Null","0","2","9 October 2006"," Confusing
","First we start off with Colin Sullivan(Matt Damon) who is taken under the wing of Costello(Jack Nicholson)- some mafia/gang boss in Boston - as a young boy. Costello grooms him to be one of his many pawns. Colin keeps a straight stand up record and ends up becoming a chief detective in the ""statees"" and also a rat to report to Costello.<br/><br/>Next there is Billy Costigan. He is violent and definitely has a lot of emotions... look at him the wrong way and he is likely to kick the crap out of you. He has gone to the same military school as Colin except he was booted out. He tries to apply to the same office as Colin except they tell him he will never be a ""statee"". Instead he is asked to go back into jail for what I can assume was to mess up his record even more. He then becomes part of Costello's gang as an undercover agent. The only people who know he is working for the police is Dignam(Mark Wahlberg) and Queenam(Martin Sheen).<br/><br/>Dignam is an ornery cuss that isn't afraid of anyone and certainly isn't tactful about the way he feels about you. You will hate him and love him at the same time. Mark Wahlberg was absolutely spectacular in this role.<br/><br/>Colin and Billy are both rats for the opposing team and things get quite hectic when every time a lead is found one of the rats cancels it out.<br/><br/>Turning point in the movie - Costello himself is an FBI informant. At this point I am thinking .... WHAT? This is the mafia boss... he is the one calling the shots... and he is also working for the FBI? How is this possible.<br/><br/>I think that Colin got a raw deal even if he was the bad guy because I doubt he would have turned out the way he did unless Costello perverted his mind. Costello can't be given all the credit but he certainly helped a lot. He took the place of a father for a young boy living with his grandmother and polluted his brain.<br/><br/>With all the lying, confusion, and deception it is no wonder that murder becomes the only solution.<br/><br/>I recommend this to anyone who might have a fondness for movies like ""Good Fellas"". There is a lot of killing... but in the end there is really no point."

","This is easily the best movie I've seen in a long time. (The last 2 good movies I saw were ""The 3 burials of Malquiedes Estrada"" & ""Collateral,"" FYI.) Great acting (even from Leo who I don't like), taught drama, the fast pace of this movie never seemed to let up, to me. (I had read reviews saying it dragged at points.) It was just non-stop intense drama and action and an ending - well, I won't give away the ending. It's one of those movies - I wanted to sit back down and watch it again as soon as I got out. Scorsese is SO good, this movie is so well written and every actor turns in a star performance. One glitch seemed to be the editing at points - the scene transitions were at times very quick - maybe too quick at 1 or 2 points - but the audio didn't seem to keep up. That's a trick of his, I know, but at 2 points, I thought it was unintentional. Whatever, that's my only critique, you know? PLUS - hello? Comfortably Numb from the Roger Waters Berlin Wall show?

Scorcese does not disappoint and the cast is phenomenal.<br/><br/>Everyone gives a great performance, especially Jack, and they throw the audience for one heck of a loop at the end. I mention it only because it is not one you could figure out, but instead just a complete twist or 180 that is literally impossible to see coming. While there are quite a bit of profanities thrown out in the movie,it is only the extremely sensitive that would be offended. For the rest of us, they are easy to get past, some even quite comical.

"samseescinema","10","0","2","8 October 2006"," Will probably stand as the greatest work of film in this decade
","The Departed reviewed by Sam Osborn<br/><br/>My problem when reviewing a film like The Departed is that I tend to veer towards broad exclamations of cinematic history and directorial brilliance and, at times, a kind of divine intervention with the art of movie-making. Anyone who read my review of Brick will understand my overindulgence in writing about great film. And so with that said and with you readers warned, let me just make my one embarrassingly broad statement about The Departed: if the following three years continue as the preceding seven have, this film will probably stand as the greatest work of film in this decade. <br/><br/>Scorsese has a tendency to hold such titles, as his Taxi Driver is often thought to be the best film of the seventies, contending with Chinatown and The Godfather. Raging Bull is often thought of as the greatest film of the eighties, even though it was released at the very cusp of the decade. And Goodfellas, made in 1990, is often thought of as the great American film of the nineties, contending maybe with Schindler's List and Silence of the Lambs. But whether or not my broad prophetic praise is of any worth, it's simple and seemingly natural to admit that The Departed is, at the very least, a damn good slab of cinema. <br/><br/>The story is loosely based off the hugely successful Hong Kong action trilogy, Infernal Affairs. I say loosely because Scorsese has made a work of intense originality here. The story may have the skeleton of its predecessor, but screenwriter William Monahan has massaged out a flesh that's boldly American. The characters are the offspring of immigrants; Irish immigrants who found opportunity in this land whether or not it was held under the pretense of legality. The most villainous of these is Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), the serpent's head to the Irish Mob of Boston. Nicholson is in overdrive here, snarling his vicious lines with every pound of evil his goateed face will allow. When he executes a crying couple on a beach and the woman crumples sideways instead of forwards, Costello chuckles to himself, looks to his partner and snarls while laughing, ""she fell funny."" <br/><br/>Opposing Costello is Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) and his partner Dignam (Mark Whalberg), heading up the painfully secretive undercover portion of the Special Investigations Unit in the Massachusetts State Police. The film works as a quiet battlefield, with each side manipulating the actions of an inside man. Costello's boy, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is a quickly rising detective for the police, soon to be heading up the force supposedly hunting down Costello. Queenan's boy, William Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), is an unlikely cadet turned undercover agent who scuttles his way into the inner circle of Costello's crew. The result is a game of two cats and two mice, all lunging for the same prize of ousting the rat. <br/><br/>No directorial prodigy could have made this picture. It's not a debut of unlikely brilliance or any farce of beginner's luck. The Departed is a film that could only have been made by a master of the art form. Without effusing too broadly, it's a work of experience. Scorsese has a deep hat full of tricks, and the choices he makes as to the tricks he'll reveal are choices no textbook, no teacher, and no film critic can explain. Only a man with so many movies under his belt could have constructed this film as it is, and trying to catalogue the vast number of techniques he utilized in the process would probably only reveal that Scorsese knows more than me about the art of cinema. <br/><br/>But I can at least say that it's rare for us to be so affected by an action movie. We fall in love easily enough in a romance, we scare pretty easy by horror, and we're all devastated by the sadness expounded in a historical drama. But only in the most original works of the action genre are we left so completely flabbergasted as The Departed left us. Rating: 4 out of 4<br/><br/>Sam Osborn"

","of course the characters motivations will be messy in a Remake set in Boston! Irish Boston is a place split between tribal loyalties and their religion, Catholicism, which, while there are many personal exceptions, teaches people to do what's right. You have to grow up, live and die in a morally conflicted environment. You'll never escape your roots, so you can't just start living on Beacon Hill, but you can't escape your religious upbringing either. American Irish are perhaps the only people who might kill you knowing full well that they'll go straight to Hell for it, and knowing people among them who are going straight to Heaven for going to Mass everyday and not being a gang banger.....and living like a Stoic with this whole set of moral information.

"scrapmetal7","8","0","2","9 October 2006"," Scorcese's welcome return to urban crime, Nicholson's welcome retreat from romantic comedy.....
","Martin Scorscese's return to urban crime is as fluid, loud, and intense as one might hope. Mixing the exact right songs with his fluid camera work, he gives us an intense, complicated walk through a dangerous town during its most dangerous times.<br/><br/>The cast is all superb. DiCaprio is intense. Nicholson's performance is only hindered by his past work; he doesn't have to build the character because we already know what he's about the instant he first appears, since we know him so well. It's a gimme. The addition of Ray Winstone as Mr. French, Nicholson's second in command, was a wise choice. Winstone brings his menacing character to vivid, bloody life.<br/><br/>While based on the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs, The Departed is not entirely chained to that film's storyline. Some of the differences are as follows (SPOILERS): <br/><br/>DiCaprio's parallel character in Infernal Affairs, played wonderfully by Tony Leung as Yan, has been undercover for ten years. DiCaprio's Billy Costigan is only undercover for one year. <br/><br/>Damon's Collin Sullivan is perceived as charismatic by his peers, but has almost no redeemable qualities. His Infernal Affairs parallel, Tony Leung's Ming, is secretive, but not fake. Ming is a lot more likable to the audience, and conflicted about his loyalties.<br/><br/>Nicholson's parallel character in Infernal affairs, Eric Tsang as Sam, has no right hand man to parallel Ray Winstone's Mr. French. Similarly, Anthony Wong's Inspector Wong, the parallel to Martin Sheen's Queenan, has no right hand man to parallel Mark Wahlberg's Sgt Dingnum.<br/><br/>A little more of DiCaprio/Costigan's background is given in The Departed than is Yan's in Infernal Affairs I. However, in Infernal Affairs II, More of Yan's background is given, and it is a lot different than Billy Costigan's.<br/><br/>Finally, the biggest and most effective difference: In Infernal Affairs, Ming has a fiancée and Yan has a female psychiatrist, and they are two different women. In The Departed, these two female characters are combined, so that Damon/Sullivan's fiancée IS DiCaprio/Costigan's psychiatrist.<br/><br/>It should be highly enjoyed by anyone who likes a good, intense urban crime drama."
"n88819","10","0","3","9 October 2006"," subtle style, sensational craft
","Scorcese as always covers violent, sensational topics while refusing to become a pulp sensationalist. He delivers the violence with no neat endings or beginnings, no neat love story. He puts forth violent human interaction honestly, messy, loose. Violence is never a neat event, no matter how intelligent or driven the perpetrators are. This movie feels like drugs, feels like desire, feels like all the things the Buddha tells us to leave behind. It is complete in that sense, that there is no desire left uncovered. There is the bad guy, wanting to be absolved, and the good guy in pain, wanting to feel safe. The only criticism i could offer is that Scorcese is the ultimate masculinist, leaving him still unaware and naive when it comes to the female gender. He has completed his study of males, maybe he needs to humble himself and delve in to the realm of the feminine."

","i liked the ending for these reasons, the same reasons people disliked it: 1. Costingan getting shot: I think it was necessary, even though I loved that character more than any other one in the film. If he would've turned Sullivan in, and gone through the rigmarole of due process it would've been satisfying, but not as much as seeing him get popped in the temple. Sheen's character dying on top of Costigan getting shot made me want Sullivan to die that much more.<br/><br/>2. The phantom envelope: My theory is it was information on how to contact Wahlberg's character in case something should happen to Costigan, which is why Wahlberg showed up to pop Sullivan.<br/><br/>3. Whose baby is it?: It's most certainly Costigans. They never say it, but you can infer by the fact that she shows up to the funeral. Why would she show up? She had to have known Sullivan would be there, and it's was obvious she wanted nothing to do with him anymore. Furthermore, she was heartbroken at his burial, and besides a few intermittent visits and a torrid little tryst, she constantly avoided Costigan. I just think it was his baby and she was paying respects to it's father."

","I hadn't even heard about The Departed until 1 hour before I went to the movies with some good friends. I had been so busy and haven't gone to the movies in awhile. I just recently saw The Black Dahlia and thought that was great and looking forward to seeing Hollywoodland, but hadn't heard anything about The Departed. From the first moment and every scene until the end credits my heart was pounding. I was so filled with excitement and the suspense was incredible. The acting was amazing. At first I was surprised at each actor that came into play and I no long saw the actors, but became involved, intertwined and wrapped up in each character. Liking, loving, and getting emotionally involved. I was so wired when I got home. The next day I wanted to run to see it again. I haven't yet seen it again...but I want to. These characters are so real and easily become attached to you...making you laugh, cry, happy, sad, and feel alive...like a shock..shocking you...inspiring you...making you think...and even appreciate life even more...I certainly do. This is the Best movie of 2006 and Brilliantly written, casted, acted and directed. Go see it...take your friends...enjoy!!"

","I have tried to within my power to show everyone the first Infernal Affairs before The Departed had come out. <br/><br/>First of all, I want The Departed to do good. I guess in the long run it does good for Hong Kong cinema. However, it physically hurts me to see the Hollywood machine eating and going to be taking credit for this film much like Quentin Tarantino did for presenting Hero. The film's title is ""Quentin Tarantino presents Hero"". The film, ultimately, is a remake, so how do you critique it? I guess the best way is try not to compare the two films and access how well this film works on its own. Of course that is impossible to do but I went in being as fair as I could to The Departed.<br/><br/>The film was really well made. The acting good; Jack Nicholson is insane but he got the part down and is very memorable in giving us another villain. He hasn't played one in a while. I had heard about the dildo story in the theater scene but I did not expect to see it. Leonardo Dicarprio was spot on but it seemed from the script he took a more conventional approach to playing an undercover agent (one who was intensely stressed, anxious and swearing). Tony Leung's performance in IA had a wider dynamic as you see more aspects of his character besides him on his job. Tony Leung has said himself he approached playing the role of Yan of being a very optimistic person as that is the only way (and a fresh way) he can imagine someone can get through being an undercover agent. That is not Dicarprio though. Matt Damon played his role subtly. Mark Walhberg's role as a chronically verbal abusing cop was pretty entertaining and seemed like he had fun playing a role like that. Something really worth mentioning is the editing; it is very scrambled and you jump quickly btw past and present but it all seems to work because it makes sense.<br/><br/>The following is what three points that I did not like about the film that makes the entire story weaker, which weakened the ending. So the following would contain spoilers. Do not read beyond this point if you haven't seen the film. Those who don't care, proceed. 1) The role or function of SP Wong in IA has been divided into three characters in this film. The importance of SP Wong in the original film was that he was the only one who know Yan's (Tony Leung's) identitiy. His death was crucial because of this. In this film, you have two character that know the identity of Leonardo Dicarprio's character. One dies falling off the roof, ala SP Wong, but the other survives and disappears till the end of the film. This weakens the protagonist's conflict. At the end, when Damon deletes DiCarprio's identity on the computer, there remains 2 characters (Anthony Anderson and Mark Wahlberg) who are still alive who know DiCarprio's true identity. 2) The two female interests in the first film is reduced to one female interest. The psychiatrist role dates the mob mole and has the cop mole as a patient. This does not harm the film, but deviates and changes the Matt Damon role majorly. In the original, Andy Lau's wife plays a role into his character wanting to be good and hence pushes him to kill the crime boss. Matt Damon's character is not tortured as Andy Lau's character was in the original IA. In TD, Matt Damon kills Jack Nicholson because he's been informed that Jack Nicholson has been exposing his identity as a mob mole to the FBI; which was a very weak reason for their final confrontation. Dicarprio's storyline is less significant but in IA having Kelly Chen had added another dimension to his Tony Leung's character. 3) They replace morse code with text messaging. Matt Damon hides his cellphone in his pocket and types cellphone messages. I do not know why they had to do this. I liked the finger tapping, it seems more feasible as it is more stealthy and in the IA sequels it remained as a motif for sanity/insanity. This change just seemed arbritary. But no biggie.<br/><br/>To conclude, I was really engaged by this film and I was in the presence of good film-making. I just think the changes hurt the ending to the film. Nonetheless, the film will entertain you."

","What an amazing film The Departed is! The story is so riveting it's almost Shakespearean, and if this film is an adaptation of a Chinese film, it is nevertheless all American. Screenwriter William Monahan has breathed the essence of Irish-Catholic South Boston grit into it. A magnificent achievement.<br/><br/>And the actors! They are uniformly marvelous. Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlburg are perfect as plain-clothes detectives of the Massachusetts State Police, and Ray Winstone is wonderfully cast as the criminal chief's right hand man. As anyone will know who has seen the excellent Aussie film The Proposition, Winstone is an actor's actor. All of these actors get better year by year. How great it is to see actors of this quality achieving higher and higher artistry. The character actors of the Irish gang are outstanding, too, radiating extreme menace beneath that natural Irish charm.<br/><br/>Vera Farmiga's performance is, in my opinion, worthy of an Oscar. Playing a state psychologist who falls under the spell of both Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon she is radiates vulnerability and intelligence. When she is in a scene with either of those men all eyes are on HER.<br/><br/>The leads in this film, Jack Nicholson, DiCaprio, and Damon demonstrate that a film of this great quality can accommodate all three of these immensely talented actors. These review pages will be full of well-deserved praise for all three of them, but forget anything you read about Nicholson chewing the carpet. He is perfect: he is the boss, what he says goes, and he leaves no one in any doubt about that. No other actor could have brought his level of passion, intensity, and - yes - humor to the part. Director Martin Scorsese was right to let Jack run with the role. It will rank up there with - and possibly exceed - even the work of Brando and De Niro.<br/><br/>Damon and DiCaprio reach new heights in their performances. They've always been very, very good, but now they're both verging on greatness. They don't deserve to be lumped together, but when they're roles are so similar - the two faces of Janus - one can't help but remark on how similar their accomplishments are in this film. The intense, crusading Irishman of DiCaprio versus the glib, charming, shape-shifting hypocrisy of Damon. Two halves of the same Irish-Catholic coin. And we are the richer for it.<br/><br/>I know nothing about directing, but if it's Scorsese who's brought all this together and who's created what is bound to be a classic American film then he will truly deserve every accolade he gets for this fantastic film. Like Woody Allen, maybe Scorsese is too ""New York"" for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, but no one has ever deserved an Academy Award for a film more than Martin Scorsese does for The Departed."
"c-blauvelt","9","0","1","8 October 2006"," Scorsese's Return to Form
","Martin Scorsese's return to form, The Departed, is a complex investigation of the roles death and violence play in people's lives, a classic Scorsese theme. Every one of the characters in the film orients himself to death in some way. The story takes place in present-day Boston where Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an undercover cop infiltrating the crime ring of Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). However, Frank also has a mole in the police force, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon). These two moles gradually begin to recognize each other's existence until the fateful first connection over a cell-phone binds them together in a life-or-death struggle to survive that plays out over the rest of the film. The point of the film is that the poorest of the poor in America's big cities have little choice but to turn to violence to survive, or as Frank Costello puts it: ""When I was your age, they would say you could become cops or criminals. What I'm saying is this: When you're facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?"" The marvelous acting conveys these different characters' reactions to death. DiCaprio and Damon become locked in a dance of death from which neither can escape. They both have so much to gain from defeating the other, that they gladly risk their own necks. Their working class Boston accents are very authentic, conveying the difficult, unschooled backgrounds from which they have risen, determined to forge better lives like Clarice Starling in The Silence of the Lambs. Just as how her humble origins inspired Starling to pursue her foe to the death, Billy Costigan and Colin Sullivan's impoverished backgrounds reveal why they are so determined to destroy one another.<br/><br/>But how could I forget Jack? Jack Nicholson's character, the mob boss Frank Costello, is the master manipulator of death, someone who profits from violent deeds with no remorse or pity. His purposefully lazy speech and twitchy mannerisms convey a neurotic who has clawed up the ladder with the blood of countless others on his hands. His impression of a rat conveys exactly who he is, a scavenger who preys on society's garbage.<br/><br/>It's a given that this film is engrossing, but Scorsese employs a number of techniques that make it particularly captivating. First of all, he allows us to root for both DiCaprio and Damon, even though one is a cop and the other a crook posing as a cop. That doesn't matter. Good and evil don't apply here. All that matters is the power to survive. Watching these characters deceive their way to survival in the face of death is like watching a wild animal trying not to show fear while staring into the face of a predator. Scorsese crosscuts between these two to make us root for them both much like Alfred Hitchcock does with his hero and villain near the end of Strangers on a Train. We don't want either of these characters to die, because that would be the end of the suspense.<br/><br/>Secondly, whereas Scorsese used eye-line matches, reaction shots, and slow-motion cinematography to capture the psychological state of his characters in the 70s, here he uses percussive sound as the calling card of death. The end of the film becomes a hyper-kinetic bloodbath, which I don't remember as much for its images as I do for its sounds. Particularly, Scorsese's sound designer turned a gunshot into such a percussive alarm, that we don't need to actually see someone getting killed, we hear it. Every time a gun is fired it feels like a portent of doom, a signal that someone has just departed this world, or that all of our illusions and artifice have been stripped away to reveal merely life and death in its most raw form. Whenever I heard a gunshot in this film I was reminded of Mersault in Albert Camus' The Stranger talking about how shooting a man four times was like ""knocking four quick times on the door of unhappiness."" Likewise, Howard Shore's pulsating Celtic rock music acts as a war anthem driving our characters unswervingly toward their tragic end.<br/><br/>Some people might dislike the jarring nature of the final 30 minutes with characters being killed left and right with little time to process their departures. This is not like Macbeth where Banquo can announce ""I am killed"" before actually dying. The characters that are killed die in a split second. We have no way to emotionally process their deaths. However, I believe that the final greatness in The Departed lies in the arbitrary, unsentimental way characters are dispatched. That's exactly as Scorsese intended it. Most people in life are not granted the luxury of protracted deaths with melodramatic monologues. Death is all around us. None of us knows when it is coming or how, but we all know that one day we will be among the departed.<br/><br/>The Departed by Martin Scorsese--A"

","This is classic Scorsese; go see it. I am very happy to say that Marty has made another great film after several good, but certainly not great films.<br/><br/>Scorsese understands violence better than any director in American history. 'Gangs' dealt with the spectacle of fear and the role of violence as a means of achieving and maintaining power. His recent work, ""The Departed"" is a brilliant film, not just because its entertaining, beautiful, and perfectly crafted, but because of its intelligent handling of the typical Scorsese themes: crime, violence, religion, and the American psyche. We see the nihilism, the angst, and the complete lack of trust or security that comes with a life of violence. There were several deaths in the films that affected me viscerally. I was amazed that I could still be shocked by someone being shot on screen after so many films. The film was brutal without being gory or gratuitous. <br/><br/>The acting is spot on; even Leo was good this time! Nicholson shows the demonic intensity that make him such a star. Of course the music is fantastic and the editing is flawless. Look... if you like Scorsese, you will be relieved to know that Marty can still produce cinematic gems. I think we might finally have the film that wins him the long-overdue Oscar for Best Director. Go see it!"

Also, a big nod to Alec Baldwin who was hilarious whenever he had screen time.<br/><br/>I have one quibble about plot: when the girlfriend discovers that Matt Damon is mobbed up, I can't believe that she was stupid enough to confront him. I also can't believe that he didn't kill her immediately at that point - he had no quibbles throughout the film about killing anyone else who found him out. Outside of this small point, though, the rest of the plot rang true.

"sushidroid","7","0","2","8 October 2006"," As a remake and as its own film
","Scorsese's re-imagining of Infernal Affairs weighs in at a good hour longer than the tightly-paced original, and it is in this extra hour that Scorsese delivers a markedly different experience. How these differences play out in terms of quality is a bit more questionable. The new script writes in many more scenes between the film's two central characters of ""undercover good cop"" and ""undercover bad mobster,"" attempting to fill them out with more profanity, grit, and add more ""moral grayness."" This is a process that I feel is successful at what it sets out to do by blurring the characters' senses of right and wrong more so than the original film, but by doing so has also erased part of what made these two characters likable and distinctive in the original work. While I enjoyed the complexity added to the characters, I do not feel that it went particular lengths to serve or strengthen the central storyline. As negative as it may sound, wandering off-topic from the original plot is where The Departed most succeeds. The storyline ventures off in considerably more directions than the original, taking much longer to hit the same key plot points that the original delivered at such a rapid pace. Herein lies the strength of Scorsese's film, as it remains a rapid and very entertaining picture despite the vast expansions and additions to the story. However, the key plot twists from Infernal Affairs generally feel uninspired compared to their delivery in the original film, and the closer The Departed gets to emulating the original, the less powerful the film becomes. As much as the climax has been retooled to make a tense scene even for those familiar with the original, the ending (which comes off as an oddly humorous combination of the endings of both Infernal Affairs and Infernal Affairs 3) is ultimately less impacting than that of the original film, and in my opinion failed to communicate what made the original's ending so good.<br/><br/>The film is alive with a very well-chosen cast (including Alec Baldwin portraying who was in the original film, the Asian Alec Baldwin), and includes one character being split into two, and another two characters being fused into one. Again this works to make The Departed a more chaotic, gray-zone film than the original, and while very watchable, lacks the clean and fast elegance of the source material. However, this is not to put The Departed on a ""lower level"" than Infernal Affairs, rather, it is a distinctly different film (good thing), but I still feel the original is a better movie (perhaps inevitable).<br/><br/>My initial impression is 7 out of 10, though I also feel on a repeat viewing I'd appraise it at a higher rating. It's a good movie, though due to my attachment to the original, I don't know if I'll ever jump into it as gleefully and willfully as say, Roger Ebert has."

The Rolling Stones,Pink Floyd,Dropkick Murphys and tons more memorable pieces of music gave The Departed a great sense of style which Scorses wasn't able to do in Gangs Of New York or The Aviator.William Monohan's adaptation of the Asian film Infernal Affairs was great it took its basic plot of spys on both sides and that is it the rest was from his own creation and the dialogue is fantastic and very authentic and real to where the film takes place.One of the best written movies in my opinion ever since Micael Manns Heat.<br/><br/>In the end I see The Departed winning Best Picture because there hasn't been a film of this caliber in many years ever since 2000.Martin Scorsese will be nominated but i doubt he will win and get ripped off once again considering the amount of racial slurs and slang which is part of The Departed's realism which is also featured in Goodfellas is one of the reasons Scorsese will get ripped off again.The violence will also be apart of it because the Academy just cant stomach it. Best adapted screenplay definitely The Departed will win.In the actor category Jack Nicholson will definitely win I've haven't seen an actor so devoted and loyal to a character ever since Philip Seymour Hoffman in Capote.Leo Dicaprio and Matt Damon should also be nominated for best actor however Nicholson will get the nomination due to his age and time in the business of film.<br/><br/>-Don Logan"

"johnnymonsarrat","10","0","2","8 October 2006"," Jon Monsarrat review: Fantastic in every way
","The Departed works as an action / thriller, but it is really a serious drama with the best plot line and action since The Untouchables. Every actor, including the supporting cast, is spot on and the plot keeps you guessing. The accent is a little overdone at times -- television and radio have cut into the traditional John F. Kennedy Bostonian accent and not everybody in Beantown speaks that way. But if that's the biggest gripe I have, the film must have been nearly flawless.<br/><br/>The film gives a sense of the underworld, and undercover investigations, without the flair and rippling muscles of Miami Vice. Nobody takes stupid chances to save the day because They're Just That Good. Nobody says ""I'm too old for this s---."" It's hard to say who's better, Matt Damon or Leonardo Decaprio... I'm not sure Matt could play a bad guy, he's just so clean cut. Leonardo is one of those actors who (unlike Tom Hanks who seems to play the same guy in every film until lately) really has no pre-specified film persona that scripts are ""written for"".<br/><br/>Every nuance of the film avoids being trite and campy, but it also avoids going into melodrama. There are no flying triple spin car explosion stunts, but the action is engaging because of the drama of the people involved. I'm usually bored right away when we dwell on the pain too much... this film did not do that. The musical score does not interfere with the mood; it stays in the background like good movie music should. This is what distinguishes the action flick from a serious drama; whether celebratory music is playing during the action. And none of the minor supporting characters get a plot; they are window-dressing and they stay in the background, too.<br/><br/>As a nice addition, much of the film is actually shot in Boston, where I live, whereas most films set in Boston (Blown Away, Good Will Hunting) have a few outdoor staging shots and leave the rest to Hollywood sets.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- Everyone, if you're old enough to handle the violence, which is not Quentin Tarantino bad but there is plenty of it.<br/><br/>-- Whitey Bulger, wherever you are<br/><br/>I'll give this film an outstanding 10 out of 10, something I will do possibly 2 or 3 times a year, max. Note, it is kinda long, so don't forget to use the restroom beforehand."

Both Costello and the police captain realize they have a mole leaking information, and everybody begins to crack up trying to search for the rat.

The story remains interesting and engaging throughout, and the twists and turns only make it more exciting. The direction style is genius, but of course we're talking about Martin Scorsese here. The only thing that keeps the movie from getting a 10 for me was that toward the end it started to drag a little bit, but not enough to make it boring.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is great. Jack Nicholson is just as good as in any other movie. He's just an amazing actor. Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio were amazing in this movie. Leo is quickly shedding that Hollywood pretty boy image. Alec Baldwin and Mark Whalberg were great when they bickered back and forth at each other.<br/><br/>Overall, this is the best movie of 2006 so far.

Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.<br/><br/>Simply the best movie of the year. Everyone in this movie could receive academy award consideration from the spectacular Jack! Jack at his all time best. Just Jack! Scorcese will finally get the Oscar. Matt Damon, Leonardo DeCaprio, Martin Sheen and the entire cast including Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin make this the best movie of the year.<br/><br/>It is a gangster movie that is funny too. It has a great plot, not predictable and a complete joy. Don't miss it."

","I felt somewhat traumatised walking away from this film. It was one of those ones that I needed to go and do something enjoyable after mulling it over before I could sleep properly. Indeed, watching a re-run of England beating Wales in the 2003 RWC just about did the trick, but now it is all coming back to me as I write this...<br/><br/>The story is compelling. Matt Damon is a superpoliceman/mobster mole tasked with essentially rooting himself out of the Boston PD. All along he is really trying to id undercover policeman Leonardo di Caprio for Jack Nicholson's nutter at the top Francis Costello. Di Caprio is posing as a mobster crew member trying to provide evidence to put away said crime boss away for life. So far so confusing? Not really. But what ensues is a taught ride of cat and mouse as each comes close to being discovered.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, the script, rude, crude, intelligent and at times very amusing. The action is shocking. Several cut away edits and scenes left me shocked to the point of forgetting to breathe. Without giving too much away, the showdown leaving 'Jed' flying and the aftermath of the lift scene where Matt Damon begs to be killed when the net tightens. It is cruel, blood splattered and superbly edited. Definitely recommended (but take a strong constitution with you)."

","I'm generally not a fan of mob movies with an overdose of violence. But, this was different. Violence here becomes an inevitable part of a gripping, cat-and-mouse storyline. The movie reminded of the 'Fugitive' with its plot twists, taut editing and edge of the seat suspense. Both Matt Daemon and Leonardo Di Caprio have acted extremely well in atypical roles. I thought Leonardo had even outdone Matt Daemon, esp. towards the end. And, Jack Nicholson was, as always, peerless. You want to strangle him in almost every frame and that's his supreme achievement. The movie is surprisingly and genuinely funny at times. The dialog is not for the faint-hearted. It's coarse, foul-mouthed and makes you squirm. But, it still comes across as very natural and really sizzles with edge and intelligence."

"Jimi_01","10","0","1","8 October 2006"," Bloody, Brutal, Brilliant
","""Huh, she fell funny"", these are the words of Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) as he casually executes a woman from close range. Costello is a show stealer, just as Bill the Butcher (Day-Lewis), Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and 'Johnny Boy' (De Niro) before him. The audience have a new semi-psychotic gangster to root for, as he snorts, beats, kills and shags his way through the narrative. Costello is a cold character, larger than life and extravagant in every way, marvel at his brutality and dark humour because characters of this kind rarely grace our screens. This Irish mob boss is a leopard skin wearing, dildo wielding maniac who Nicholson and Scorsese clearly enjoyed bringing to the screen. This is not to say that Nicholson is the film's saving grace, he merely gives a stand out performance in a film overflowing with talent and in some cases genius.<br/><br/>Modern day, South Boston and two fresh faced State Police Troopers are about to embark on very different journeys. Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is a go-getter who quickly rises through the ranks and joins an elite group of detectives whose job it is to stamp out organised crime. Colin might seem like the trustworthy type, though he has secretly been groomed by Costello from an early age to infiltrate the Police and become a mole for the mob. Simultaneously, Billy Costigan (Leonardo Dicaprio) due to his troubled past has been planted by the Police within Costello's crew to act as informant on his dirty dealings. It soon becomes apparent to both The Police and Costello's gang that they each have a 'rat' working for the opposite side within their outfits, leading to Costigan and Sullivan embarking on a race against time to discover each others identities.<br/><br/>Loosely based on the Hong Kong classic Infernal Affairs, The Departed consciously maintains its individuality. This is not a remake, and in many ways Scorsese surpasses the tension filled Asian version, with his own brand of Cops and Criminals facing off against each other. Visually, Scorsese has recaptured the true menacing nature of the mean streets. One scene in particular perfectly captures the steam filled, neon lit labyrinth that Costigan and Sullivan negotiate whilst avoiding detection from each other.<br/><br/>Nobody does violence like Scorsese, The Departed is truly brutal and realistic; people are cut up, beaten to a pulp, thrown off buildings and shot in the head at a frantic pace. Marty himself says ""Violence is part of who I am, if you're gonna see violence, you'd better experience it"". The Departed unites a group of characters that have been rejected by society and dance with death on a daily basis. To label the film a 'cat and mouse tale' does not do it justice. The Departed is a slick piece of modern cinema that depicts extreme violence, alienation and the corruption of power.<br/><br/>If Scorsese is The Departed's brain and Nicolson the brawn then the heart of the film belongs to the excellent Vera Farmiga who plays the Psychologist Madolyn. Girlfriend to Sullivan and councillor to Costigan her Dr/patient relationship with Costigan is particularly complex and tender. As the only character in the film untainted by violence and crime, Madolyn provides some much needed emotional relief to the weighty plot.<br/><br/>The Departed is film-making at its grandest, a powerhouse script, precision directing and impeccable performances all round make this the film of the year so far. With a supporting cast that includes Ray Winstone and Mark Wahlberg The Departed's beefy cast cannot be faulted and makes the film one of Scorsese's best. The mono-browed auteur may have been courting Oscar with Gangs of New York and The Aviator, though The Departed sees him return to what made him truly great in the first place. Welcome back Marty, you've been away too long."

Wahlberg puts on quite a show as well, and you can't deny Baldwin his limelight. It was also an unexpected pleasure to see Farmiga as the leading lady. Immediately I recognized her from Dummy, and remembered I always wondered why I never saw her in anything else. She is quite charming. The film keeps your adrenaline pumping right up to the credits.

","Just got back from what turned out to be another Scorsese masterpiece. The Departed is one of the best movies I have seen in years, and will surely draw some intense Oscar attention. The acting (including the bit parts) is absolutely superb. Leonardo DiCaprio proves himself once again to be one of the elite actors of our time. The Scorsese/DiCaprio duo once again delivers. The movie is full of rich dialogue, character development, and even sneaks in some humor (though usually in a rather vulgar form: see Mark Walberg). Though the film was a bit lengthy, it never seemed to slow down. This is the best American film this year and I hope that both Scorsese and Leo finally get the Oscar recognition that they deserve."

I am only upset that Leo will probably get robbed once again of an Oscar. A Scorcese is a Scorcese, the movie is written so well and filmed so beautifully that each actor trumps the next. When you start to watch it you think Walberg will dominate, then you see Leo get tough, then you get amused by a surprisingly amazing Baldwin, then you see the master of Jack and the stability of Damon. Leo is good - not just as a character but as an actor - hes the only one who really reaches for something not easily attained. Leo should get an Oscar even though he plays a smaller portion than he did in Gangs of NY and the Aviator. The movie is brilliant, the story so close to the James ""Whitey"" Bulger story and something that every man and woman should see. This is a great movie."

DiCaprio is again spectacular (as always) and Damon shines in the bad guy role. The entire cast is well chosen, with the best scene stealer's being Wahlberg and the ever versatile Alec Baldwin. The mental chase games between the good cop and the bad cop are tight and suspenseful in a way uncommon in big$ Hollywood pictures these days. Expect a little taste of L.A.

The last ten minutes of the movie came across as an hour's worth of plot jammed into a small time frame. I would have more than willing to spend three hours in the theater watching this movie unfurl the right way. There was also too many unanswered question's that will not see a sequel.

My friend did tell me it was the same exact premise of the Japanese movie infernal affairs, and as i looked up this movie after i saw it, i wasn't surprised to see that it was worked on by some of the same writers as the Japanese movie. So i guess this is just an American version of it, which kind of disappointed me that the idea wasn't fully original. Plus towards the end it gets a little TOO crazy.

"IRateFilms","10","0","1","7 October 2006"," The Departed : A Sure Arrival of Martin Scorsese.
","Martin Scorcese's new film, The Departed, a remake of the 2002 Hong Kong hit Internal Affairs, takes the action from the streets of China and moves it to Boston. Although it was changed to an American film, The Departed still focuses on the same conflict between the state police and the local mob, in this case overseen by the old-school, charismatic, Irish mobster Frank Costello played by the delightfully maleficent Jack Nicholson. Double crossing and infiltration have been a classic setup within most of Hong Kongs gangster films, and this is no exception. Starting with the City on Fire remake Reservoir Dogs, America has been doing an excellent job of remaking, whilst simultaneously manipulating, and thickening these thrillers.<br/><br/>The Departed, involves two cops, both working for the Massachusetts State Department, and working both sides of the law for Costello. The problem is the two know nothing of each others involvement within the crime syndicate itself. William Costigan (DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Damon) never actually cross paths until the end, and this evolves into a breathtaking plunge into the much anticipated climax of the film. And let us not forget the brilliant role of Mark Wahlberg, the always disgruntled, crudely blunt cop working with Queenen (Martin Sheen) in charge of the undercover unit. This team intelligently offsets itself, from the exaggerated bad cop role to the less intimidating, but sensible good cop.<br/><br/>Honestly one of Scorseses' best pictures since Goodfellas, The Departed is terribly engrossing with its double-crossing, not having a single scene robbed of suspense. The stellar cast brings together some of the best cops and robbers imagery we've seen since Narc, never having dull performances, or stealing the believability of the characters. Cutting between the lives of two ""rats"", living on the opposite end of the spectrum, Scorsese truly captures the fear and anxiety of the two characters, which is unequivocally unfathomable. I commend this film, in not only bringing originality in its dialog from a remake, but for its re-birth of the genre. There is nobody perfect enough to bring the life back into crime films, as the person who perfected it, Martin Scorsese. If there ever was a Kill Bill for the Scorsese fans, The Departed would be it, with a gun splattered stain around every corner."
"zachary-dillard-0525","10","0","1","7 October 2006"," A Masterpiece

But the other performances were excellent as well. I wont get into the nitty gritty plot but as far as I am concerned this is a much deserved Oscar calibur movie for Scorcese. If he doesn't win Best Director for this I will truly be baffled. 10 out of 10 stars. This is a must see if you are a Scorcese fan, or if you really like a movie with endless twists. This film is blessed with brilliant acting and a plot that's smooth as silk. I recommend it over all else at the movies right now. Truly excillence"
"WBSlinger63","10","0","1","7 October 2006"," Brilliant Adaptation, Departed is a Standout in its Own Right
","Martin Scorsese has been very consistent thus far, what with Gangs of New York and The Aviator both having gotten such great critical reviews and Oscar nominations. But with The Departed, he has hit his critical mass, and I look forward to seeing Oscar time when the stars and director get their recognition. The Departed is based on the original Hong Kong film by Andrew Lau, Infernal Affairs, which starred Andy Lau and Tony Leung in the original roles that are played here by Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio (respectively) in equally, if not beyond, excellent performances. Damon and DiCaprio both play undercover cops in the Boston Police who work to infiltrate a dangerous, vicious, and insane mob boss who has control of the South Boston crime section, played with wicked and equally humorous (at least to him) skill by Jack Nicholson. However, Damon's character, Colin Sullivan, is a supposed perfect cop who in fact is a mole planted by Nicholson's mob boss character, Frank Costello, and quickly works up the ranks. DiCaprio's character, Billy Costigan, finds himself kicked out of the academy and instead working as Frank's right hand man. But everything's for a reason, and Costigan's no different: he's a undercover agent himself, his identity known only to Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg). That's as far as I go in terms of the story, which I give immense kudos to William Monaghan. The shortcomings of the original, though the best Hong Kong film I'd ever seen, was that it was far too complicated and complex. What Monaghan has written here is one that is straight to the point and gripping as well. The strong helping factor to this whole thing is, of course, the directing, in which Scorsese hits his high mark, and the performances by a massive, unbelievable cast. Damon and DiCaprio are great here, the latter in his best performance yet. Martin Sheen plays a great role as Queenan, an essential character in maintaining Costigan's sense of who he is. Of course the high marks go to Wahlberg, whose vulgar and sarcastic Digham is a scene stealer. But Nicholson's Frank Costello is one in a million. Nicholson goes completely over-the-top here, to the point that if he'd gone any further it would've been overkill. Costello is vicious and evil to the core, and yet he finds something funny about the whole thing nonetheless. Whereas the original villain in Infernal Affairs was minor, sometimes humorous at times, Costello is the main focus here, a perverse character who has killed and deceived so much it becomes almost mundane to him, and Nicholson savors every moment of it. This is the best film I've seen so far, and it deserves every Oscar nomination and win that it gets."

The film opens very well, and as soon as the first installment of the soundtrack started (a throwback to Goodfellas) I was smiling broadly! The film was very good, but I felt it could have been a cinematic masterpiece, which I don't think it is. I have seen the original Infernal Affairs, but didn't want to try and compare them, I wanted to see this as an original film. The story is a good one, the characters are good but are developed very quickly, I felt the opening hour was just a quick rush of the characters, trying to squeeze everything in. The performances, however, were generally very good. I felt the screenplay lacked something, though. Jack Nicholson's character didn't really work for me, a lot of things didn't make sense (no spoilers!!!) and especially with his character, it all felt a bit clichÃ©d. If anything, I felt the story and script may have been a little simplistic, there weren't really any twists and there was no suspense. There were a dozen great scenes, but they were well spaced! I didn't like the way the filmmakers felt they had to make the story so transparent and obvious, but that seems a general theme in Hollywood now.... I would definitely see this film again, hopefully I can enjoy it more, and would recommend it, but I feel a little disappointed that this wasn't the epic crime film I was hoping for....

What a cast!!! Of course, it may be a TAD obvious as to why Damon and Wahlberg were cast as Massachusetts State Police UC officers. That's the EASY part. Two of the major characters didn't have to learn how to ""capture"" authentic Boston accents. It is hilarious to listen to Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin (and sometimes Nicholson) try to do their best bad imitations of Jack and Bobby Kennedy. Damon's girlfriend drifted between a generic accent and a half-ass Southie accent depending on with whom she was in a particular scene. She is QUITE stunning, however. (by the way...at no time did I ever hear anyone in the film utter the immortal Southie phrase ""wicked pissah"") All nitpicking aside, this is an instant classic. Cast, soundtrack,and it's actually really funny in most scenes. Sometimes funnier than most comedies. I guess it goes without saying that Nicholson is in perfect form as the Whitey Bulger type ""Frank Costello"" He almost LOOKS like Satan. (Whitey could only HOPE to have as much charisma) <br/><br/>Location and supporting cast is spot on. I've seen so many films that are shot in Boston and it seems like the director or producer didn't do their homework in capturing the true flavor that is Boston, Massachusetts. Scorcese deserves an A+ in preparation as far as set and location.<br/><br/>A local radio host once said "" Boston is all about TWO things...politics and revenge"". It's also about the Irish mafia. To be quite honest, as violent as the movie is it may not even come close to the real carnage that has been reaped in Southie over the years.<br/><br/>I don't have any reservations about recommending this movie. I saw it the day it premiered so I wouldn't be influenced by any outside sources. It is destined to be a classic alongside such greats as GoodFellas, Casino, Scarface etc.<br/><br/>Be ready for a flurry of twists and turns at the very end of the movie. No spoilers here. You won't be surprised....well, that is, until the last 30 seconds of the movie.

","Infernal Affairs is such a fantastic movie, and I sort of groaned at first when I heard it was going to be REMADE in the US rather than just RELEASED here (theatrically, that is).<br/><br/>Then I found out Scorsese was directing and that got me interested.<br/><br/>So now, four years after the original, it's finally here. And it's very good, maybe even great - though I'll need to see it again to pass that judgment. In a way, that's really saying something right there because with the original my eyes were glued to the screen (which was only a six inch portable DVD player - pretty far from the 50 foot screen I saw The Departed on yesterday) and my spirit was soaring from the opening credits. The Departed lacks the breathtakingly beautiful flowing movement (camera work, editing, nuanced physicality of lead actors) of Infernal Affairs and replaces all this with grim, violent intensity. It's a very American, very Scorsese remake. There are great moments when it creates it own powerful, visceral sense of the pain that fills its characters. The Departed puts its focus much more on the painful consequences of lying to people and on the destruction that people who are lairs by necessity (because they have so much to hide) wreak upon their world. You can surely see the social/political message implicit in this - but sometimes I want a movie to be a sweeping emotional experience and not try to engage my political conscience."
"Dragonsouls","7","0","1","6 October 2006"," Great film, but not his best job in director's chair.
","I really think Scorcese created a unique way of depicting criminals in unconventional forms , whether you are a police captain or a member of a mob family working double shifts. The story is real. It's modern, the writing is smart and the film lets you know in the opening scene that it's setting takes place a few years ago. But in reality, it's a story that takes place right now, present time to near future. There are hints of political jabs concerning levels of power now given to the local police departments and FBI and all other agencies of law enforcement for that matter. So the writing was smart and I was really never bored once throughout the entire 2 and half plus hours.<br/><br/>Now I'm not going to tell you what this film is about, just go see it. It's a modern cops and mobsters/Donnie Brasco/state of grace type film. The cast has all stars everywhere. This film has a B-movie feel to it, set wise, and firefights were OK, but nothing major..very little extras, very little car chases or anything else that looks expensive to produce. Most of the budget must of went to the cast. Starting off with Jack Nicholson. He was at his best here comically since Batman. He is great comedy throughout the film, and acting wise he does a good job at showing valence, and is believable as a mob boss. The show stealer in my mind was Leonardo DiCaprio. In my honest opinion, he overshadows everyone else in the film and that's saying a lot considering how good Damon was. The only good character development Scorcese paced well is the character Leo plays named Billy Costigan. I didn't care what happened to anyone else in the film. He was as emotional as anyone has ever gotten on film. It was almost as if other actors who were on screen with DiCaprio were intimidated by his overpowering acting. The other great performance that stood out was Baldwinn's character as a vulgar fast trash talking cop. He had me laughing throughout.<br/><br/>So great story, smart unpredictable writing, and top notch acting; What else does this film need? well, other the split screen time between Damon and DiCaprio kind of took away from good character development. Scorcese paced the movie in choppy manner, with cuts at inappropriate moments, and some scenes were just time fillers. He might win the Oscar this year, but its all politics.He deserved it plenty of times before, but not this one. Don't take it the wrong way though, this movie deserves at least 3 Oscars, one for DiCaprio, other for Screenplay, and perhaps a third for score. This movie had some pulsating scenes in it, due in part to it's great rock and roll trademark 70's Scorcese soundtracks.<br/><br/>The love story was OK, nothing like Stone and Deniro in Casino, or even Diaz and DiCaprio in Gangs of NY. But there is a subplot love story in the film. The story is about going crooked in life. Monsters could be anyone, and some are saved, some are only going to wind up dead. Every dog does have it's day. Scorcese will in March, when this film racks up some awards. 8 out of 10."

","I am a big fan of Martin, and this film made me fall in love with his work all over again. To me a good sign of a movie is that as I am watching it, I get so caught up in it, I hope it never ends. Of course all movies must end, but I love a long ride. <br/><br/>This movie is not predictable, all the time I was watching it, I never had any idea if good or evil would prevail.<br/><br/>Great story, great cast, great editing, this movie tells a story in such a way that I haven't seen in a while.<br/><br/>Something else about the location filmed in Boston. It captured the city well without being a ""travelouge"", many other films show too much of a famous city, this film showed only the city you needed to see. My wife (a former resident of Boston) pointed that out to me.<br/><br/>Definitely the best movie of 2006. I'd go watch this movie tomorrow, as a matter of fact, I think I will.<br/><br/>Thanks Marty.<br/><br/>Steven Truitt spt@swbell.net"

","I saw the term ""potboiler"" applied to The Departed by some review. I thought the term meant ""suspense"", but m-w.com defines it as: a usually inferior work (as of art or literature) produced chiefly for profit.<br/><br/>M-W need to amend their definition: Pot full of water. Add plenty of rough chopped potatoes. Lots of salt. Burner on full. Now watch it come to boil slowly but surely. Let boil over.<br/><br/>Damn it's been a while since I've head some satisfying stew!! <br/><br/>Thank you, Mr. Scorcese, grandmaster chef extraordinaire.<br/><br/>------ My comment does not contain enough lines, it says.

"bobthecob_j_rod","9","0","1","6 October 2006"," Great Remake of a Great Film
","Going into the movie I didn't know what to expect having seen Internal Affairs. But I can say that Martin Scorsese is one of the true great filmmakers of our time. I enjoyed the movie immensely and was impressed by how well the plot line moved from the Hong Kong environment to the Boston one. I am also glad to report that it is not a carbon copy remake of Internal Affairs as one poster would like you to believe. I think that this movie is maybe even a little bit better than Internal Affairs. I hate to say it but it has a few plot points that are different and I won't go into those now. But Martin Scorsese has done a wonderful job in directing this movie.<br/><br/>The acting is also wonderful in this movie. With what I think should be an Oscar winning performance for Jack. As he is great in almost every movie he is in but he has outdone himself here. It doesn't hurt that he has a great supporting cast. I know a lot of people have denounce Leo for not having any talent but I think he has redeemed himself for Titanic. But I think he has proved himself with time. If anything the worst actor in this movie is Matt Damon I found his performance was stale and he wasn't very likable unlike Andy Lau in Internal Affairs.Alec Baldwin gives somewhat of a comedic performance in this movie as does Marky Mark.I think that this movie should be Oscar worthy for sure and hope it finally gets Martin the statue he deserves."
"superman2162","10","0","1","6 October 2006"," Far from original, but a classic nonetheless
","Just left the theater, and for the first time in awhile, I feel like my money was well spent. Although parts of this film were predictable, the performance of every main character was so convincing that it didn't matter if I knew what was going to happen. DiCaprio & Damon can both hold their own w/ Nicholson, but Jack is the greatest and he proves why here. Wahlberg, Sheen & Baldwin were all superb in their supporting roles, especially the one formerly associated w/ the funky bunch. The last 20 minutes is like a kick in the gut to the audience, and will make you question who's side you were actually on. The ending was well worth the 2 hrs and 29 minutes of uncomfortable sitting. This movie receives my highest recommendation for the genre, and I think we will be hearing a lot more about this film come awards season.<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

","Its one of those movies that has you thinking but not a lot. I really thought it was good.Jack was amazing as always. Matt Damon was perfect for this role, looking like a good guy but good at hiding his dark side.And of course Leonardo DiCaprio who is one of my favorite actors really took the spot light. He really has become a leading man rather than a boy. He is so believable.I really thought his character had this undeniable charisma. there were also some other really great performances from the co-stars. Overall I thought it was a really well thought out film. Martin Scorsese doing what hes best at. He is always doing good films. Recently they have been unnoticed by many. But this is a classic to be placed beside a movie like Goodfellas. Maybe even something in the Oscar cards for Scorsese. One thing I like about this movie was that I didn't get distracted by anything. I could not. Bravo"
"muhon-nin","10","0","3","6 October 2006"," A good return of the old Scorsese
","The Departed starts out with a scene that Scorsese does well. the mob boss walking through a shop, paying for other people things, and acting in charge of things. We soon meet the young Matt Damon character that grows up to be a cop that's in bed with the Irish mob. Then, we meet Leonardo DiCaprio's character, a cop who got kicked out of the police academy who gets a second chance to work against the mob. The story move right into story before you know it. Matt Damon's is soon a detective, with a kick ass apartment over looking Boston. For Leonardo, things are so smooth. Getting a chance to get at the Irish mob, he soon takes. When the mob boss, Jack Nicholson, asks Matt Damon's character to find out who the other cop is.<br/><br/>The story does one thing very well that original Chinese movie 'Infernal Affairs' did, also. The quick story pace. Of course Scorsese being Scorsese the story won't hang in a nothing scene. I love the differences from the original movie, and LOVED the fact that Scorsese didn't go through the Italian route. It was a very nice change, and a nice look back at what he was doing in the seventies and on. the movie provided a very well written story, and the movie was very well acted. This, I hope, will beat that Oliver Stone melodrama. 10 out of 10."
"iKickstand","8","0","5","6 October 2006"," Violence, Language & maybe a bit over-clever
","I will start by saying if you are not a fan of very strong violence or very strong language, you should probably steer clear of this one. If you have seen any Scorsese movie before, you should know what to expect, but be warned this should be able to give goodfellas a run for its money on the cold blooded killings and swearing front.<br/><br/>I did like this movie a lot, but did have a hard time keeping up with it at times. There is A lot of people being undercover, switching sides and generally lieing to each other as to who's side they are on. Luckily it didn't get to the point of trying to be too over-clever (see oceans 12) but at times it was trying, and I feel the average viewer would have a hard time keeping up with this story.<br/><br/>Jack Nocholsons character reminded me a lot of Ben Kingsley's in Sexy Beast. A very intimidating and unpredictable man, who uses extreme violence and language on an everyday basis. And even though they both did not have much screen time (compared to some other major characters)I think everyone will agree they were both the best thing about both of these films.<br/><br/>Throughout watching this film, I couldn't help think it reminded me a lot of Michael Mann's action-drama ""Heat"". Both films used a lot of character development to make the shootout scenes that much more rewarding. Both used a mix of mellow and tense music to add extra depth to the scenes, and both used the entire first three quarters of the movie just as a warm up for the end when all the action took place, and you finally figured everything out.<br/><br/>I'm sure a lot of people will like the final 20 minutes a lot, I felt a bit like as there was so much time spent on developing thee plot and characters, Marty felt as though there wasn't much else left to do so just decided to kill everyone off. But I guess this was the way it turned out in the original, so I cant comment on that.<br/><br/>Overall I liked this film a lot. I think it should have maybe ended about 10 minutes earlier, as at one point near the very end I thought to myself ""Most of the characters are gone, what is left to do""? I'm still deciding if it was my favourite of the year so far, but after 6 months or so waiting for the release, I think I can safely say I was not disappointed."
"o_ramo_23","10","0","1","6 October 2006"," Absolutely great
","This movie is amazing. I saw it today in London, and it blew me away, even more so as I was thinking about it, 2 hrs after I left the theatre. I was not a big Di Caprio fan beforehand, because I was let down with his performance in Gangs of New York, and the movie in general, but he more than makes up for it here. He is a real man now and his performance shows it. The rest of the cast, from Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Jack, Damon, the beautiful shrink, and Ray Winston all deserve academy award nominations. Scorsese paints a masterpiece here. It is such a detailed movie that seemingly inconsequential details come back through the movie to explain certain scenarios, and that only an artist can do. This movie will become a true classic."
"lelliott-3","10","0","1","6 October 2006"," Goodfellas for our generation.
","I was too young to see Goodfellas in the theater but now I can imagine what that must have been like. As the movie opens with the Stones ""Gimmie Shelter"" you know you're in for a treat.<br/><br/>Scorseses last two films have been very good but after seeing The Departed in the theater my generation now knows what made him the directing legend that he is. Dicaprio grew up in this picture and finally delivered the performance that his reputation would you lead you to believe he had given many times before. Damon is in true ""Good Will Hunting"" form and Jack is well...Jack. It's hard for me to imagine another film due this year delivering better entertainment than this. In my humble opinion this and United 93 stand alone as the top two films of 06 so far."
"mdechene","7","0","1","6 October 2006"," Excellent flick!!
","Typical Scorcese film: ""Black,"" violent, lots of blood, twisting plots! If DiCaprio doesn't get an Oscar for this part, it will be a shame. If you remember him in a swell role in ""Gangs of New York,"" you'll be amazed at how he tops that role in this film. And...I'm not a Dicaprio fan! Usually, when you see a flick loaded with stars, it's a pretty good sign that it's not worth seeing. Not so here! Nicholson is his typical scroungy hateful self. Great job on his part. Matt Damon, whom I absolutely do not like did a great job at being a worthless rat! One of my favorite stars is Mark Walberg. I was disappointed that he was given such a small role, but watch out for him in the end of the movie!!!!"
