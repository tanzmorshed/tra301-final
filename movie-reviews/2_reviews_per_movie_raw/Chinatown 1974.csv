","I knew CHINATOWN was hailed as the paragon of a film noir, and that's why I finally got down to watching it. However, despite having known about the movie for quite a while, I wasn't really prepared for just how dark it could be. The movie starts slowly, with a private detective taking on what looks like a routine case. But soon he finds himself enmeshed in a web of conspiracy, murder, lies and deceit. The plot is like a perfect machine that relentlessly moves towards a final resolution that is truly epic and truly soul-wrenching.<br/><br/>In a recent New York Times piece, they called CHINATOWN ""a meditation on evil"", which is spot-on. Set in 1937, this movie is just all-round perfect, first and foremost how everything is connected within the grand structure of the movie, that is rich in themes (water, evil, trust, guilt, greed) and even richer in suspense, as the audience—just like our protagonist—tries to find out what is happening. The story is ""complex"" for sure, but it's not ""complicated"". Everything makes sense in the end and the complexity pays off big time.<br/><br/>Besides the impeccable screenplay, everything else about this movie is perfect as well. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway carry the movie with sophistication and dignity. Dunaway's stunning performance in particular fills every scene with an aura of mystery as you are trying to find out what her motives are. The set pieces are beautiful, the score is compelling; and camera-work and editing could not be any better. There is a reason this one is called a classic! So, if you're ready to delve deep into a richly layered exploration of the dark side of humanity—enjoy the ride. But don't expect to come back unscathed."

","The seventies were the last years of great (American) films. I say films because when we speak of movies nowadays, we allude to blockbusters that generate hundreds of millions of dollars, the least amount of controversy, and are mostly inane crowd pleasers with tacked-on endings.<br/><br/>Consider the output of influential film makers Allen during that time: Coppola, Scorsese, Altman, Lumet, Ashby, Bogdanovich, to name a few Americans, not to mention European directors Fellini, Bergman, Wertmuller, Truffaut, Argento, Saura, and Bunuel -- all household names in those days. Before Spielberg and Lucas came along, not a single one of these made movies appealing to the ""summer blockbuster tradition,"" and unlike Spielberg or Lucas, they have a body of work filled in high artistic quality with minimum special effects and a lasting mark on future generations.<br/><br/>Polanski is another one of these directors, and with ""Chinatown,"" he reaches his directorial peak amidst the scandals which seemed to taint everything except his art. One can only imagine him in the forties, living his scandals, and transmuting this into high art -- when film-noir was at its darkest. Thankfully he lived in a time which did not demand the ""happy ending"" or re-shoots in order to be politically correct -- else ""Chinatown"" would have lost its devastating punch and conformed to the norm.<br/><br/>A departure from the horror genre which brought Polanski to stardom, he re-creates an equally grim genre with his jaded view of 1930s Los Angeles down to the choice of the color palette, and using the acting powers of Dunaway and Nicholson to a fantastic effect, he creates haunting characters who can't be easily dismissed as film-noir archetypes without looking very closely at their reactions, listening to their words, and following their progressive involvement in a plot which threatens to swallow them whole, and ultimately does. And having Huston play Noah Cross -- who virtually took noir to its heights with ""The Maltese Falcon"" -- Polanski hits the mark dead center, because Huston is the hardened heart of the corruption in ""Chinatown."" In brief scenes he creates a character almost unbearably evil with a hint of madness just underneath, and how he affects the characters around him will pervade the viewer long after the credits have rolled -- after all, he is the person who tells Nicholson he has no idea what he's getting himself into.<br/><br/>I doubt this movie could be made today for reasons stated above. I'm thankful Polanski's vision prevailed, and not Towne's. Film-noir is a genre about human darkness, and here, the envelope is pushed all the way through, making this film, in my opinion, rank second to ""The Maltese Falcon."""
"bob the moo","Null","215","287","3 January 2005"," A very classy, consistently engaging and dark detective story
","Jake Gittes is a former cop turned private detective. When he is contracted by a Mrs Mulwray to find out if her husband is having an affair, he takes to trailing Water Company Executive Hollis Mulwray. Mulwray appears to only have water and a dry riverbed on his mind but eventually they catch him with a young woman, although almost immediately the news gets leaked to the papers and Mulwray goes missing, only to turn up dead. At this point the real Mrs Mulwray comes to Gittes threatening to sue him for his involvement and Jake realises that he had been set up to set up the Mulwrays. He continues his investigation into the murder only to find a conspiracy involving thousands of gallons of water being wasted during a drought and the mysterious presence of Mrs Mulwray's father, Noah Cross.<br/><br/>As a fan of film noir and tough detective movies, I am too often put off by modern entries into the genre that try to replace atmosphere and intelligence by just having nudity and swearing; the genre managed atmosphere without these in the forties and fifties but yet modern films seem to rely on them. With Chinatown however, everything works well as a homage to the best years of the genre and, as such, is very well set in the period and is of suitable presentation even if the material and tone is darker and harder than would have been allowed years ago. This is not to say it is just a copy and paste from better films because it isn't and indeed stands out as one of the best detective noirs I have seen in ages. The plot is always going to be the most important thing and it gets it spot on throughout, doing the proper thing of starting with a simple story and continually building it more and more complex as it goes. Unlike some other ""classics"" of the genre, Chinatown manages to do this without ever losing the audience and I found the plot to be both rewardingly complex but yet still very easy to follow.<br/><br/>Needless to say, things are very dark and the script is convincingly dark and miserable, leading to an ending that is as depressing as I've seen  not so much in what actually happens but also in the wider implications for the characters that the credits prevent us from seeing. Director Polanski does a great job of putting this story in a lush setting that produces a real strong sense of period but also manages to always be showing us the darkness coming through subtly throughout the movie. Of course it helps that he also has a great cast to work with. Jack Nicholson is iconic in this role and, if I had to pick one film to act as an introduction to Nicholson then it would be this one. He is tough yet damaged, upright but seedy and he brings out his complex character well. Dunaway has less screen time but is just as impressive with a similarly dark role. Huston adds class and manages to ooze menace while also coming across as a harmless old man. The support cast are all fine but really the film belongs to these three, with Nicholson being the stand out role.<br/><br/>Overall this is a very classy film that has stood up very well to become a well-deserved classic. The story is complex, mysterious yet simple to follow; it is dark and seedy without relying on swearing or nudity to set the atmosphere. The direction is great, with a real atmosphere and sense of time and place that is matched by a great collection of performances delivering a great script."
"ArtVandelayImporterExporter","9","13","14","4 November 2019"," I hated this movie
","The first time I saw it. After one of my buddies claimed it was the greatest movie every made. I mean, what could live up to that hype.
Then, over the course of 20+ years I discovered a much wider world of films beyond what CBC and CTV showed late at night to pay the bills. We rented every B&W movie the video store had on tape. TCM came along. I discovered film noir. I drove Interstate 5 through California in the midst of a terrible multi-year drought. I visited Los Angeles. I discovered Arts & Crafts homes.
Then I watched this movie again tonight. And I realized my buddy may have been right.
It has Jack Nicholson before he became a caricature of himself. John Huston showing he was as good an actor as he was a director. And Faye Dunaway, my goodness, was she on fire for a decade or what. When she's trying to explain things to Nicholson in the third act and she's breaking down while doing so, if that doesn't get you, you have no heart.
But you know what else? If you know the ending, the movie is more riveting. Because then you understand why the characters are addressing the things they do, and you're watching the characters act and react, which is where the magic lies.
This is a superlative film. I feel like a dope for taking 20 years to properly appreciate it. I only wish my friend were still alive so I could tell him he was right."

","There is a word, impossible to spell, that describes the alignment of solar bodies like the planets when they all fall into place together. A similar word would describe this film. Everything about it is right. Polanski never directed a better movie. The performers, down to the lowest atmosphere person, are superb. The editing, the score, the sound, the decor, the dialog, all are just about flawless. The photography is peerless. The white garden apartments, the terra cotta roof tiles, the palms and desert sand are all painted with a faint gold, faintly ripe with false promise, like the oranges that bounce from Gittes' desperately speeding car in the northwest Valley. <br/><br/>Polanski deserves much of the credit. When Gittes surprises Evelyn Mulwray in her car, after he follows her to her daughter's house, her face slumps forward and beeps the horn briefly. Then, so faintly, we hear a few dogs bark in the background. Not only is the scene itself exquisitely done but it prefigures the ending, as does Gittes' remark earlier to Evelyn that she has a flaw in her iris. The movie is too good to deserve much dissecting. It stands repeated watching. If there is anything wrong with it, it is the serious and tragic ending that Polanski always insists on tacking on. Robert Towne was right and Polanski wrong in this case. Everything came together on this film. It's not only the best detective movie ever made; it's one of the best movies ever made -- period. A marvelous job by everyone concerned.<br/><br/>I have to add (6/27/05) that the word I mentioned in the first sentence is spelled ""syzygy."" Man, did I get enlightening email on that. I might as well add two other impressive features of this movie. (1) Polanksi takes his time. Example: Gittes sneaks into Hollis Mulwray's office and begins to go through the drawers of his old-fashioned wooden desk. As he slides each drawer out, Polanksi gives us a shot of their humdrum contents (checkbooks, magnifying glass, and so forth) and we can almost smell the heat and the odor of shellac and sawdust emanating from the wooden containers. The contents reveal nothing of importance in this case. But (2) sometimes irrelevant information crops up that resonates later in the film with its own echo. The detail might be just a word (""applecore"") or an ordinary object (a pair of spectacles found in a pond, immediately after Gittes imitates the Japanese gardener's remark that the water is bad for the ""glass."") Some of the references may be so consistent as to constitute a theme (water). None of this hits you over the head with its significance. It's all very neatly stitched together."

","Chinatown is a tremendous collaborative effort that produced one of the most memorable Hollywood pictures of the 1970's. Director Roman Polanski (his last film in America, and the first he made in America after the murder of Sharon Tate), stars Jack Nicholson & Faye Dunaway, and writer Robert Towne, all come together to create a detective story classic. At times it slows its pace down so the viewer can think along with Nicholson's character, to take in the environment as well as the situation he's in (i.e. when he goes to the empty reservoir, when he visits Noah Crosses house the first time). And the script has the perfect sense of drawing us into a story, fueled by curiosity, grit, and cynicism, and engages the viewer by its realistic dialog between the characters. <br/><br/>J.J. Gittes (Nicholson, in one of his best 70's performances) is in Los Angeles circa 1933 in the line of private investigator, usually dealing with people who may or may not believe that their significant other is having an affair. Evelyn Mulwray feels this may be the case with her husband Hollis, and Gittes decides to take the case. However, this draws him into a deeper case involving the city's loss of water once Hollis- a major player in the water supply controversy in the city- is found murdered. This eventually leads him to Noah Cross (John Huston), a big businessman and who also happens to be Evelyn's father. Intrigue starts to develop, as Jake's own life begins to be at risk. <br/><br/>As a intricate, detailed detective story the film is an above-average work, with Towne's script containing the maturity, and wicked sense of humor, of a James M. Cain or Raymond Chandler novel. When the thrills come they come as being striking. And when humanity and compassion get thrown into the mix, the film reaches a whole other plane of intelligence. The last third of the film could turn off some of the audience (depending on one's own level of belief), but it holds strong thanks to the performances. Nicholson doesn't over-step his bounds in any scene, finding the right notes in suggestive conversations. Dunaway is better than expected (though I'm not sure if it's an great performance). And Huston's Noah Cross is one of the more disturbing villains of that period in movies. Add to it some good cameos (Burt Young as a driver, Polanski playing the little guy in the infamous 'knife' scene), and a smooth soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith, Chinatown comes out as strong piece of movie-making, and arguably one of the greatest in the crime/mystery genre."

","Set in late '30s Los Angeles this 1974 film opens with a woman, identifying herself as Evelyn Mulwray, asking private detective Jake Gettes to find out whether her husband, chief engineer of the LA Water and Power Company, is having an affair. He follows him and ultimately photographs him with another woman. Somehow these pictures end up in the papers and he is approached by another woman who it turns out is the real wife of Mulwray... and she intends to sue. He continues to investigate Mulwray and suspects some odd goings on at Water and Power... then Mulwray turns up dead; drowned during a severe drought. His continued investigation brings him closer to the real Evelyn as well as into real danger as he learns the truth about Water and Power's activities which could make some people very rich at the expense of other, poorer, people.<br/><br/>This film may have been made about a quarter of a century after the classic era for film noir but it perfectly captures the feel of those films. It has morally ambiguous characters inhabiting a murky world that contrasts with the bright Los Angeles sunshine. The story has many twists and turns without feeling unnecessarily complex or confusing. The cast does a great job; especially Jack Nicholson who is in every scene so that the viewer doesn't know anything Gettes doesn't know. Faye Dunaway is solid as Evelyn Mulwray and John Huston is suitably menacing as her father; a man standing to make a lot of money with many dark secrets. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody wanting a good mystery or fans of film noir."
"Neal Wruck","Null","102","141","21 November 2001"," An excellent piece of filmmaking.
","If it wasn't for the fact that most of the cast would have been too young or not born yet, this movie could have been made in the 1930's or 1940's. It reminds one of the film noirs that Hollywood used to make during that time period. It is a superb example of film making, certainly among the 20 best movies I have ever seen. <br/><br/>Jack Nicholson is private detective Jake Gitties, who can be as hard-boiled as Humphrey Bogart's Phil Marlowe. But Gitties is different: He is intelligent, dresses well and has associates whom work with him. Gitties is hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate into an extra-martial affair she believes her husband is having. However, the investigation leads into bigger things involving the water supply of Los Angeles, which is in the middle of a drought. A series of double-crosses, murders and plot twists all lead into a climatic showdown in Chinatown which has a surprising conclusion. <br/><br/>If the saying `They don't make them like they used to' was ever more true, it was with this movie. Sex is only suggested between the Nicholson and Dunaway characters, yet it is convincing enough. And although Faye Dunaway is a beautiful woman, we never see frontal nudity of her (Directors today would do just the opposite). Some of the plot twists also would not be possibly made today, especially the ending (Which, if you haven't seen the movie, I cannot reveal). <br/><br/>Nicholson is a tour de force in his role as Gitties, but the rest of the supporting cast (Including John Huston as Mulwray's deceptive father) is equally superb. As to how Nicholson could loose the Best Actor Oscar to Art Carney in Harry and Toto is beyond me. Faye Dunaway was also nominated for Best Actress, only to loose to Ellen Burstyn for Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore. Fortunately, Nicholson and Duanway have both won Oscars since. In addition, the film itself received nominations for Best Picture and Best Director for Roman Polanski (Who has a cameo in the movie as the knife-welding thug who cuts Nicholson's nose), but those Oscars would be lost to The Godfather, Part II. The only Oscar won was for Robert Towne's screenplay, which is today considered the model for film writing. After watching the movie, one will know why. From the stellar performances to the sharp direction to the superb screenplay, this is a cinema treasure."

Everything about the film shines, and it looks better now than it probably did in 1974; of course, there's a lot of junk in the theaters these days. Acting, cinematography, script, atmosphere, it's all 10s baby. The story of a struggling P.I. getting a case that has more twists and turns than a mountain road is still one of the most crafted storylines ever concocted. Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, John Huston, John Hillerman, and everyone else deliver superb performances. Robert Towne's script, John A.

","Polanksi's 'Chinatown' stands as one of the classics of 1970s American cinema, the last classic period in American cinema. It's a great reminder of how utterly engaging cinema can be without the special effects, flimsy plots and outrageous stunts of many major studio productions now, not evening mentioning the obvious marketing tie-ins.<br/><br/>The cinematography and screenplay could be considered almost economical in its minimalism as it is really the story, script and characters that drive this movie forward. <br/><br/>Chinatown tells the story a detective, confidently played by Jack Nicholson, who gets embroiled in an investigation involving the mysterious murder (suicide?) of the head of the Water Board. During the investigation, he gets involved with Evelyn Mulwray, the wife of the murdered man who appears to want to get to the bottom of the mystery but during the course of the movie demonstrates that she is not telling the whole story and has something to hide.<br/><br/>Everything in this movie works from already mentioned tight editing down to the costumes and sets.<br/><br/>Nuff said!<br/><br/>10/10"
"attitudeadjustment","Null","227","364","28 June 2004"," Yes, this really is the best movie ever...
","From the first 10 minutes of the first time I saw this movie in the theatre, I've truly loved it, more any other movie I've ever seen. Why? Well, that easy, it's just so... PERFECT! <br/><br/>Obviously there are many other great movies, and many other movies I personally also love, but Chinatown has a real spell over me. Other fans have commented here on the story and the spellbinding way that the forlorn and utterly mysterious story unfolds. I certainly agree. <br/><br/>Chinatown's cinematography and editing? Yes, I agree again! IMO, it's breathtaking, with pacing so tight that I sit straight up thru the whole movie and my nerves become completely raw every time I watch, listen and FEEL it again. <br/><br/>I don't think anybody has commented yet on the great choice of the many supporting actors. Each one so well cast and very believable in their roles! You've got the entire cast credits list (thank you IMDb) so I won't list them here but there are so many memorable performances here! It would be unfair to highlight one, two or three! Good cops, bad cops, ugly rich, up-and-coming, downtrodden poor, the very honest and very crooked with all shades in between! Each and every role a character study in and of itself and together they make a living ""time capsule"" of the forties that we can revisit for generations to come.<br/><br/>And then there's that sound track which hooked me on great trumpet players and the Est Coast Jazz sound of the era. I just love that music and way it interweaves with the ongoing theme - it's perfectly united with the faithful and compelling use of the film-noir style.<br/><br/>I saw this movie first in Chicago and heck, back then I knew nothing about LA, though I've since moved to and lived in the area for years. Once relocated, I quickly discovered the historically interesting side to the story and then appreciated the movie from yet another compelling angle. No question, the plot is fundamentally sound with many totally unexpected and yet quite plausible turns. But I later understood that it's within the realm of believability from factual standpoint, as well as intellectually/emotionally.<br/><br/>Geez, I'll never forget that first confrontational scene at the Albacore Club! The study in absolute raw and evil power as masterly portrayed by John Huston. In the very same scene Jack Nicholson skillfully paints the subtleties of his cautious, cynical, small-time hustler character. The air crackles! I must have played this scene in my mind a thousand times. When I visited Catalina Island for the first time in about 1985, not knowing its significance to the movie, I walked by the Albacore Club (The Tuna Club in real life) and froze transfixed. I recognized it instantly of course, and I must have stood there gawking for 20 minutes not saying a word. I could literally HEAR the Chinatown theme - the memories were that clear and fresh!<br/><br/>In closing, I guess then what does it about Chinatown for me (why I feel so strongly that it is the very best movie of all) is that every facet of the movie construction, from the opening scene to the ending credits, somehow fits together in a homogeneous, complete and absolutely flawless way. <br/><br/>I find it fascinating to analyze the characters and their makeup. To imagine the reasons they did what they did. But there is NOTHING I would change. Nothing."

","A film about LA and water set in the l930's during a drought with a dark incestuous subplot and some stunning performances by Faye Dunaway and Jack Nicholson, and superb cinematography that seemed to capture the essence of LA. Directed by Roman Polanski, who makes a terrific cameo appearance as a switchblade wielding heavy, and using the considerable acting talents of John Huston as a ruthless and perverted landowner. Read Cadillac Desert to know about LA's water grab but see Chinatown for its brilliant allegory of water and corruption, both public and private. The direction, the screenplay, the acting, the photography, and the soundtrack combine to make a convincing and atmospheric picture. The crushing ending is just so much more icing on the cake."

","While I don't care too much for Roman Polanski's style of direction(maybe I'll grow to like it eventually, maybe not), I can't deny that this is a truly great film. Jack Nicholson really shines through in his role, and his acting in this film perfectly fits the character... his shark smile, his voice, his tone... all of it, perfect. I always thought, when watching films with Nicholson, that he'd make a great lead in a noir film, so when I found this film and discovered that it was indeed noir, I naturally saw it as soon as possible. I found the film to have a slightly slower pace than what I would have preferred or expected, but apart from that minor detail, it was flawless. The plot is great, and thoroughly interesting and involving. The pacing, while not fast all the time, is more than acceptable. There are sequences that are really intense and exciting. The acting is great... like I said earlier, Nicholson shines through and really takes this character and makes him his own. The characters are well-written and credible. The special effects are well-done and still hold up pretty well. The dialog is very well-written and memorable. There are quite a few quotable lines, as well. The cinematography is good, and even when the plot doesn't move a lot, Polanski keeps our interest through interesting angles and sequences. I liked that there was often something subtle going on in the background, while we're focusing on what's directly in front of us. While Polanski certainly doesn't possess the attention to detail that Kubrick does, he manages to put a good bit of detail into many of the shots, and there is fairly little left to coincidence or chance, much like Kubrick. The film has a few twists that are quite good, and they come as surprises... I don't think I really saw them coming, and I doubt anyone would be able to. Of course, some might not find the twists to be that impressive, but the story stands on it's own nicely as well. This is a great movie, which should be seen by just about anyone who can take it(it's more than just casually adult in nature, even though there's not that much violence or sex in it). I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys film noir, watching Jack Nicholson in perfect shape in a role that was tailor-made for him, a good mystery, Roman Polanski's direction and just a good movie with a more adult tone that many others. 10/10"

It started out like a simple detective story, but the plot kept turning, and it's anything but simple or conventional. Jack Nicholson gave one of the best performances of his career, and we kept finding out more and more about Faye Dunaway's character, eventually knowing, shockingly to me, why she was both fond and afraid of intimacy. No line in the script is wasted. The cinematography painted a great picture of L.A., reminding me of Collateral, and the music score is fantastic as well. It is a real thriller full of mystery, kept me guessing all the time, but also a real tragedy in a personal level. I feel bad Chinatown had to compete with Godfather II in the same year.

"gab-14712","9","4","4","18 October 2017"," Example of Masterful Film Noir!
","Over the years, people have called Chinatown one of the best movies ever. I don't quite agree with that statement, but there is no denying that the movie is a masterpiece. I may not find it one of the best films all-time, but I do find it as one of the best films of 1974. This noir film hearkens back to the days where similar films were produced left and right. But starting from the 1960's, this genre slowly began to fade away. The film may come across as really taking its time to tell the story, but the thriller has lots of tension that builds up to its climatic ending. This film brought public awareness to some issues people may not have really known about. Water is a commodity for human survival and whoever controls the water, controls the money. This movie is a complex series of events surrounding the control of water and that people can die over this issue. Ah, the wonders of being a human being! The movie is a complicated follow, so don't lose yourself in any train of thought, or you might lose what will happen plot-wise. Boasting one of cinema's all-time greatest screenplays by Robert Towne and a powerful lead performance by Jack Nicholson, you are in for a fantastic time.<br/><br/>As I mentioned briefly, the film's plot can be complex as the film will turn down a completely different path in a heartbeat. Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a private investigator who specializes in matrimonial affairs. One day, he gets a visit from a woman claiming to be Evelyn Mulwray. She tells Jake that her husband is cheating on her and she would like Jake to investigate her claims. He does his job by taking photographs of him and he catches him with another woman. That ensues a scandal and Gittes is confronted by the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway). When the husband shows up dead, Gittes is led deeper and deeper in a web of deceit, lies, and murder.<br/><br/>This movie is given its voice by a variety of elements such as Robert Towne's fantastic screenplay or Roman Polanksi's visionary directing style. But let's not forget about the wonderful performances including the tour de force performance by screen legend, Jack Nicholson. Nicholson's performance is nothing short of excellent as he portrays Jake Gittes. I loved how the movie gave in-depth characterization to this character. Gittes may not be the nicest man in the world, but he's a man of honor and honesty. The movie is all about lies and that forms a rather bleak mental state for Gittes. All we wants to do is find the truth and move on, but that seems impossible to do with all the lies and murder. Nicholson was nominated for an Oscar for his performance, and some might say he should have won. Who can forget that scene at the river bed where he is slashed in the nose by this random creep. Faye Dunaway also delivers an amazing performance. On the outside her character makes you believe she is good, but she has some fishy motives about her. Gittes falls in love with her, but he can't take her sneaky lies. Then we have the performance of John Huston, the legendary director who plays Evelyn's father. His character, Noah Cross is the antagonist of the film one would say as he wants to use his wealth to control the water. That dinner scene between Noah and Jake is quite something. Noah and his mean, beady eyes are put to good use.<br/><br/>This film was directed by Roman Polanski, before he was extradited to Europe and could only make films there. This movie has him returning back to the director's chair, only a few years after the brutal murder of his wife and unborn child. I loved his sense of direction and he really captured the noir feeling you would find in the films of the 1940's. His conflict with the screenwriter Robert Towne became somewhat famous. Towne had the film end with a happy ending, but Polanksi went against that. The ending is not a happy one as we get some unfortunate deaths from the wrong people, but it was an effective ending nonetheless. No matter what, Robert Towne written one of the best screenplays of all time and that will endure for many, many years into our future.<br/><br/>Even though Chinatown is a fictional movie, it's based of the Los Angeles water grab of 1908. This is a city that formed in a desert and it should be impossible for water to exist, which makes the control of the water ever more so fundamental. Towne did a great job adding his own 1930's spin to the story. This movie is undeniably a great film. The pace crawls at times, but the content of the story kept me captivated. This is not an action thriller, but it's one of those slow-burn thrillers focused on telling a top-rate story. The film fires on all cylinders because of it's wonderful acting and solid direction. But we also have a great but sad, trumpet-infused score from Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography from John A. Alonzo that captures the L.A of old in a very effective way. Let's not forget about the award-winning screenplay from Robert Towne. Nominated for 11 Oscars, this film is worth a watch. This is a fantastic thriller that relies upon excellent storytelling.<br/><br/>My Grade: A-"
"MovieAddict2016","10","51","83","20 December 2004"," One of the best film noir/homage films ever made!
","""Chinatown"" is so good, it's scary. Jack Nicholson is Jake Gittes, the iconic private eye hired to spy on the husband of a woman who suspects he is having an affair. What Jake soon uncovers is a vast conspiracy involving local tycoons and water - heading towards a great conclusion with a classic surprise ending.<br/><br/>""Chinatown"" might not be the best film noir ever made but it is certainly one of the best. Like ""Indiana Jones"" it is a loving homage to its source - in this case movies of the 1930s, 40s and 50s such as ""The Maltese Falcon"" (most obviously!) and lesser-known film noirs such as ""D.O.A."" (which no one else I've seen so far has mentioned in comparison to this, but it does have its similarities).<br/><br/>Nicholson is absolutely superb in his role, playing Jake with all the touch panache of an instant classic anti-hero. This was certainly a movie of the 1970s, with its anti-hero being the guy we come to root for.<br/><br/>Robert Towne is a genius and I may seem to be giving ""Chinatown"" loads of fanboy praise but I can honestly say that I'm not obsessed with it in any way, in fact I've only seen it a few times. But it's just a really, really great movie that's perfect in just about every way - direction, acting, screen writing, cinematography, editing, sound...the list is endless. Polanski deserves as much praise as Towne I suppose, because his direction is flawless and very noir-ish. (If that's a suitable description.)<br/><br/>Overall, this is a classic - for good reason. After seeing this and ""L.A. Confidential"" within a few days I can say with confidence that ""Chinatown"" is much better, and will probably be more fondly remembered years from now."
"gleebs75","6","28","43","10 March 2006"," It's Chinatown.
","As is often the case with any Jack Nicholson film, Jack was the greatest part of this film. While it is said to be a crime thriller meant to keep audiences on their toes with its action and drama, which is not really the effect that Chinatown has on the audience. This film actually makes more of a statement on the social and political situations in the United States (in this case L.A). If audiences walk into this film expecting a mindless crime thriller, then they will be sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>In a broad sense, this film is about America as a corrupt capitalist society. Jack Nicholson's character J.J Gitte seems to be one of the only characters in the film who sees the water drought in Los Angeles for what it really isthe controlling of a vital source of life for a civilization by the rich and powerful. The rich and powerful owners of capitalism are represented in the film by the character of Noah Cross and (most of) the members of the Water Department. These men are able to use money and power of influence to re-route the city's water to certain places in order to make themselves even more money. It's a classic case of the rich getting richer by stealing from the poor. J.J sees through this and as a private investigator used to dealing with cheating spouses, he gets himself in way over his head while investigating the death of Noah Cross' partner (and son-in-law), Hollis Mulwray. Hollis, it appears, was one of the good guys, one of the liberal men like J.J, wanting to do good. It was his decision to give the ownership of the city's water to the people instead of himself and the corrupt Noah Cross.<br/><br/>The characteristics of Noah Cross and J.J Gitte are almost entirely opposite from one another. Also, the way that these two men treat women seems to be indicative of the way they treat others. Throughout the film, references to J.J's past working in Chinatown seem to be ever present. It comes to our attention that J.J left Chinatown when he tried to ""save someone from getting hurt"" but couldn't. It's to be assumed that he tried to help out a woman that he had feelings for, failed, and that she died. This is exactly what happens to Mrs. Evelyn Cross Mulwray. He falls in love with her (or at least lust), tries to help her, and it ends up turning out exactly as his past Chinatown experience. J.J tries to do good, but there are so many powerful situations beyond his control that he simply cannot. Noah Cross, on the other hand, controls everything. Throughout the film we come across many different people who's actions have been influenced by Cross. It then comes to our attention that Noah Cross raped Evelyn when she was 15 years old, that she got pregnant, and that the childKatherineis both Evelyn's sister and her daughter. It is no understatement to say that Noah Cross literally controls everything around himincluding his daughter and what to do to her. He seems to embody the epitome of cruel, whereas J.J embodies the epitome of naïve goodness.<br/><br/>Chinatown itself is another symbol present in the film. Chinatown appears to be the place where everything goes wrong for the good guy. There's no law in Chinatown, there's nothing to stop the rich and powerful from getting away with whatever they want. It is the end of goodness, as is represented by the murder of Evelyn Cross Mulwray by one of the cops. J.J's associate walks up to him as he is staring at Evelyn's dead body in the car and listening to Katherine's screams as she is taken away by her cruel grandfather/father. The situation is entirely hopeless, so all he can think to say to J.J is ""Forget it Jake, it's Chinatown."" It's a powerful last moment of the film, but it still offers no relief to the audience. We know that J.J won't be able to stop Cross' plans to steal a majority of the city's water to help himself profit during a drought, we know that Katherine will be raised by her ""grandfather"" and perhaps suffer the same fate with him that Evelyn did, and we know that there is no solving the fact that the nation (symbolized by Chinatown) will never stop being run by the corrupt because the good are powerless to stop it."

","'Chinatown' is one of the best films of the 70s and without doubt one of the most memorable in the crime/detective genre. This is a first-rate picture all round with very few faults, if any.

The cinematography is on another level to anything else I've seen from the 70s - each and every scene is crafted in such a stylish and elegant way. The script is also brilliant and gives us some classic lines, including of course the famous last line of the film, 'Forget it, Jake.

But watching those take work because you have to cocreate the world.<br/><br/>Sometimes the film is set in the context of a genre where the metanarrative is about how it sets within the genre. `Rosemary's Baby' was great because it played with everything that came before, adding great portions of architectural evil and fey vulnerability.<br/><br/>Noir revolutionized film.

But one film in particular stood out from all the rest and it shows why that was one of AFI's 100 top films of all time.<br/><br/>The year was 1974. The motion picture is ""Chinatown"". This was the movie that cemented Jack Nicholson as a bonafide superstar throughout the entire decade of the 1970's. This was the movie that started it all.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson graduated from star to superstar playing a gumshoe in this marvelously intricate film noir of the 70's directed by Roman Polanski,who has a memorable cameo as a sadistic hood,gives Nicholson the most famous nose job in motion picture history. Robert Towne's Oscar winning script(whom they used in some acting and writing classes as a learning tool in some colleges)brilliantly depicts 1940's Los Angeles as a glittering cesspool of murder,incest,and corrupt land deals. Faye Dunaway steals the picture with a haunting performance as the film's alluring female fatale,and John Huston,as her creepy millionaire father,will make your skin crawl. The stunning finale still packs an emotional wallop. ""Chinatown"" was the apex of what the cinema of the 1970's was about to become,and this was the prime factor of that as well.<br/><br/>The film was nominated for 11 Oscars including Best Picture and won three for Best Original Score(Jerry Goldsmith),Best Screenplay(Robert Towne),and Best Supporting Actor(John Huston)."
"ags123","10","12","17","23 May 2017"," Let's talk about Dunaway
","By now it's only redundant to heap more praise on this film. The writing, acting, cinematography, direction, editing, etc. seamlessly come together as if predestined. And yes, I think Polanski's decision to go with a downbeat ending was the correct choice - that final scene is unforgettable. <br/><br/>What I'd like to focus on is Faye Dunaway's remarkable contribution to the film. She reportedly did not get along with Polanski, in fact, was labeled ""difficult"" on several of her movies. Yet she turned in an incomparable, complex performance. Starting with her look. Hitchcock placed great emphasis on each character's outward appearance, which told us just about all we needed to know. Here Dunaway takes a page from his book and immerses herself in the trappings of a wealthy woman of the 1930s. Compare the way she looked in ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" also set in the 1930s. The eyes and hair are straight out of 1967. <br/><br/>Keep in mind that she was 33 when she made 'Chinatown."" That's a knowing performance from someone so young. Her cool demeanor when we first meet her turns out to be misleading. She embodies the classic femme fatale until just toward the end, in her famous ""She's my sister. She's my daughter"" scene, when we suddenly understand she's the only character with an ounce of integrity. There's been quite a lot going on beneath the surface. <br/><br/>Next time you watch this film, pay close attention to Dunaway. You won't find a better female performance anywhere."
"Lonestar55","10","3","3","11 January 2020"," Just about perfect..
","Watching Chinatown again recently, it struck me that it is just about perfect.
All the elements of film-making were performed here at an extraordinarily high level, and the result is one of the most satisfying movies...EVER!<br/><br/>Chinatown is THE standard against which period mysteries must be measured.
Start with the wonderful script by Robert Towne. His plot, characters and dialogue entertain and intrigue us and the film's brilliant central metaphor, Chinatown, reveals, conceals and resonates long after the credits roll.<br/><br/>Next, people the story with a terrific cast led by Jack Nicholson, who despite his worldliness is in way-over-his-head without knowing it. Faye Dunaway as the fragile femme fatale, Evelyn Mulwray, and John Huston as one of the most memorable villains in moviedom as the rich & powerful, ruthless yet seemingly benign, Noah Cross.<br/><br/>Brilliant director with an equally gifted cinematographer, Roman Polanski was an inspired choice to direct this film. Polanski is adept at creating tension and dread on film. Chinatown's great success is in the atmosphere and tension and ominous feel of foreboding that overlays the film. Chinatown succeeds because its mystery is actually mysterious, its story complex, its secrets genuinely surprising.<br/><br/>Chinatown is beautiful and meticulous. And the music score is so good that it has been imitated MANY times in Chinatown wannabes. Chinatown is about as good as Hollywood can do, meeting both entertainment and craftsmanship of filmmaking at such a high standard that it raises the result to the level of art.<br/><br/>Chinatown is a brilliantly unique story and a masterpiece we all have recognized from its initial release. A timeless film that should not be missed. A GREAT film!"

The great point that draws attention to ""chinatown"" is his script, he is completely magnificent, I would say, which is a complete synthesis of the perfection of how to script a movie, in 2 hours we have complete development of all the characters, we have a simple plot which gains layers of depth every minute, we have problems that mix with the city, turning into a political and social plot while bringing a classic story of a detective full of twists, who at one point surrenders to the cliché, but then surprises the all showing that in ""chinatown"" there are no spaces for the obvious. The film touches on such as love, police, ethics, society, organized crime, rape, nothing in a very deep way but also nothing is shallow, it gives the introduction to the theme, and the viewer who links the dots, alias, ""chinatown"" is a film that has to be seen and reviewed to be able to connect the points in a more satisfactory way, and to have a broad and complete notion of its history, which is not easy to understand in the first one visited during the film. With a great photo, extremely clear and brings new york life together with an assembly that joins the script to bring a great rhythm to the film, and a soundtrack that combines but is not marked in technical parts, the film has no much to criticize, is not perfect, but is not far behind the artistic part of the film, part that brings jack nicholson who is incredibly in a centered role, and alias, doing a great performance, and the stunning Faye Dunaway, who we love and hate her throughout the film, and she makes the whole story run around her, and she succeeds in behaving like the guiding thread of the script, interpreting many facets.

So far, so good; the acting is great and the two leads are believable in their respective roles. There are a few contenders for the murder suspect, although the ultimate perpetrator is fairly easily identified as the likeliest killer quite early on. Unfortunately, from about halfway through, the plot begins to drag quite dreadfully, the two leads form an unlikely and frankly unbelievable union, and the ending is both unsatisfactory and highly implausible.

","My goodness. What an awful ending. It was as if they got too deep into all their twists and turns that, instead of attempting to untie the knots and resolve the plot, they just decided to end it and be done with it as abruptly as possible. It also felt like it was a sequel to another movie that actually had something to do with or at least used the subject of Chinatown for more than a couple ominous and vague one-liners. It honestly felt like this was Chinatown 2 and I missed the far superior, more exciting Chinatown 1. It was as if the writers knew they liked the line ""Forget it, Jake. That's Chinatown"" but were so eager to end the movie with it that didn't bother to explain to the audience the significance of the line. It was like a callback that didn't have an initial call. A comparable example is the line TIA (This Is Africa) in Blood Diamond. It's used early on and you get a sense of its many different meanings and it's supposed familiarity amongst Africans and then the line is called back in a very moving way at the end. That's what the Chinatown line at the end should have been, but wasn't. I am just in awe as to the lengths people in the film community will go to to fall in line with the status quo on things like this. I cannot imagine anyone has ever seen Chinatown and been moved or enthralled to the point of wanting to watch it again. It seems to me that, much like the contemporary art community, film critics put on kid gloves when it comes to the so-called noir genre and are absolutely ready and willing to write off any lack of depth, lack of character development, and terrible endings as insightful and artistic noir touches. Why even name the movie Chinatown if there are only going to be 4 lines in the whole movie having to do with Chinatown? So many roads to nowhere in that movie. And then in the end, the whole movie is a road to nowhere. Chinatown could be summed up as: a private detective spends two hours unfurling an intricate web of conspiracy and corruption and then it just ends."
"chaswe-28402","10","10","15","24 March 2017"," As perfect as possible
","It's difficult to imagine a more flawless movie than this. A youthful Jack Nicholson is at his very best and most plausible in the role of Jake Gittes, featuring in a continuously engaging story, which can be appreciated as a timelessly sophisticated tribute and homage to Chandler. Each scene and every moment of the swiftly evolving plot is redolent of intrigue and anticipation. Dunaway and Huston are also superbly cast, as are Burt Young, Diane Ladd, Perry Lopez, and the entire list. The acting and direction throughout are uniformly professional and superior. I was particularly struck by the old lady in the retirement home. The script is exceptional, and the dialogue totally polished and realistic. There are one or two lines which are directly evocative of Chandler at his best. <br/><br/>For anyone with an IQ above moron level, even if only slightly, it is worth investing a profitable two hours of their life watching this film. It is guaranteed to provide enjoyment and will extend their sensibility and general perception to a very great degree. Audiences expecting a mindless crime thriller will naturally be disappointed, as it is highly intelligent, though ultimately shockingly tragic. The relationship between personal conflicts and the wider ramifications of civic and corporate crime and corruption is unusually subtle. Chinatown is an area of enigmatic impenetrability, which is better left alone. Polanski excels himself. A matter for amazement that this masterpiece languishes as low as 127 on the top 250 list. <br/><br/>Some time ago I was discussing movies with a friend's daughter, who is married to a man in the film business. After much thought we mutually decided that Chinatown was probably the best film both of us had ever seen. I just watched it again, for the umpteenth time. This is a wonderful, wonderful film. A clockwork jewel of precision."
"EThompsonUMD","10","11","17","16 April 2007"," L.A. as neo-Noir Wasteland
","Directed by Polish-born Roman Polanski, Chinatown (1974) is often credited with reviving the classic film noir detective/crime genre exemplified by such '40s and '50s American films as The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity, and Touch of Evil. While classic film noir is characterized by low lit, black and white cinematography, Polanski managed to infuse Chinatown with a profound sense of corruption and nihilism while setting his tale amid the relentless blazing sunlight of a Southern California drought and despite employing two photographic elements previously thought antithetical to film noir style: color film stock and anamorphic widescreen composition. Chinatown's great critical and popular success demonstrated once and for all that the essence of film noir lay mainly in its bleak moral vision, not its cinematographic style.<br/><br/>Seizing full advantage of the 1968 demise of the Hollywood Production Code and the subsequent liberalization in American cinema's treatment of sex and violence, Chinatown builds upon the film noir tradition of exploiting and exploding social taboos. Take, for instance, the central plot function of incest or the notoriously brutal scene in which Jake Gittes has a protruding part of his anatomy nearly cut off (no, not literally that part - but the phallic implications are clear and played for sly comedy in subsequent scenes). Yet Polanski also added an entirely new dimension to classic film noir by linking up its darkness with the paranoid/depressive mood of post-Vietnam, post-Watergate America, thereby extending the noir sense of corruption beyond the mean urban streets and to high governmental and privileged economic places. Chinatown may be set in 1930s L.A., but its soul is in the 1970s.<br/><br/>Like earlier film noir private detectives, Chinatown's protagonist, Jake Gittes (a role Jack Nicholson was born to play) is derived in large part from the cynical, wisecracking, ""hardboiled"" detective popularized in 1930s novels by such writers as Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett. Also like many earlier film noir works, Chinatown adopts a storytelling point of view that is analogous to a mix of ""first person"" and ""third person limited"" narration in the novel. Such a viewpoint immerses the audience in a subjective search for truth within a maze of deceptive appearances, recognizing or failing to recognize clues (the ""bad for glass"" seawater in the Mulrays backyard, the obituary column, Noah Cross's bifocals) just as Gittes does and not a second sooner. Indeed, Chinatown is very unusual in the degree to which it sustains a subjective narrative viewpoint, often punctuating it with clever point of view shots using binoculars, camera lenses, car mirrors, and a variety of Peeping Tom setups.<br/><br/>Gittes's perspective proves to be much more unreliable even than that of classic film noir era private eyes. Like Chandler's Philip Marlowe and Hammett's Sam Spade, Gittes is courageous and resourceful; like them and unlike the police, he is governed by a code of honor, however unconventional or self-defined. Nevertheless, the world in which Gittes operates is far less redeemable by the actions of a detective hero than was the mid-twentieth century world of classic noir and eons remote from the optimistic 19th century world of such English detective novel heroes as Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot. Repeatedly in Chinatown the private eye code either fails to function or is subject to mockery - until, in the film's shocking last scene, Gittes fails for a second time to save a damsel in distress and is led away mumbling ""do as little as possible"" while a bought police force ushers the innocent Catherine Mulray into the grasp of her rapacious grandfather/father.<br/><br/>Chinatown's representation of another archetypal film noir character, the femme fatale, significantly departs from original film noir conventions as well. The casting of vampish looking Faye Dunaway in the role of Evelyn Mulray would seem to fit well enough, but what happens to the character in the plot and what, even more disturbingly, we learn has happened to her in the film's back-story is not at all in keeping with classic noir. Evelyn's alluring deceptions and even her nymphomania are ultimately the effects of her quite literal violation by patriarchal power, not another instance of female sexuality ruthlessly wresting power in a man's world. If in classic film noir the death or exposure of the femme fatale is requisite for whatever moral redemption is extracted from the darkness, Evelyn's brutal death in Chinatown marks a plunge completely into the darkness.<br/><br/>Of course central to the structure of Chinatown is that most noir of all cities, Los Angeles, centered here on its eponymous ""Chinatown"" district, where the film's plot climaxes. The scarcity of water in Polanski's Los Angeles transforms the city into a symbolic spiritual Wasteland akin to T.S. Eliot's. But here the fisher king won't die because he is an all-powerful capitalist/father figure willing to ""do anything"" without moral restraint. Played in a great piece of postmodern self-reflection by John Huston, the father of film noir, Noah Cross is also a figure of the Anti-Christ. Note his ironically doubled Biblical name, his favorite lunch (suggestively Christian fish served with the heads on!), and his power over water, which he diverts not to liberate any chosen people but to line his pockets and own everything he possibly can, including ""the future, Mr. Gittes, the future."" <br/><br/>Few, if any, American mainstream films have bleaker, more nihilistic resolutions than Chinatown. And few are more powerful or memorable."

","Directed by Roman Polanski and stars Jack Nicholson as a private eye who is hired to investigate and expose her husband Hollis Mulwray but soon finds out that the woman who hired him was not his husband and finds him murdered it becomes something much bigger and much more complicated. To start things off the cast is fantastic in this movie, Jack Nicholson is magnificent especially his subtle acting, for example after Mrs. Mulwray saves him from being shot, the way he looks at her indicates its the first sign he is starting to fall in love her. There is also another scene in the movie where Jack shows brilliance in his subtle acting where he is checking up on Mrs. Mulwray because he feels something suspicious is going on, while he is driving just the look on his face shows that he is tired and he has been through a lot through out the day. Faye Dunaway is fantastic in this film as well and seeing her and Jack work together in this movie was amazing. Just like the acting the movie itself is also very subtle, the theme is not just straight up in your face it does require some thinking. This movie is also very good at foreshadowing for instance when Jake and Mrs. Mulwray are at the restaurant she says that she has had affairs but she would not call it cheating on her husband, that is indicating her father Noah Cross has raped her which is revealed later on in the movie. Noah Cross is a very disturbing villain the more I think about it because he is an old person who has raped his daughter and killed his son-in-law/former business partner and the actor who played him did a really good job. The movie is able to not feel messy even when a lot of things are going on and instead feels contained. The scene where he talks about his past in chinatown I felt like that could have been a movie by itself because in his past he talks about how he tries to protect this woman and later she dies, the same thing happens in the film where the woman who he is trying to protect dies and gets killed, he tries to do the right thing throughout the movie but in the end he is vulnerable and can't win and it was unavoidable and Jake is back to where he was before. The message of this movie is not a positive one but it is honest and it is great to sometimes see a movie that is not perfectly wrapped with a bow and everything is all good. Overall this movie is a must see and I will give this a definite 10 out of 10."

Interesting and thrilling script by Robert Towne who wrote the screenplay with Jack Nicholson in mind and deservedly won Oscar for the best original screenplay . The Chinatown screenplay is now regarded as being one of the most perfect screenplays and is now a main teaching point in screen writing seminars and classes everywhere. This was the first film of a planned trilogy about corruption in the development of Los Angeles. It was set in the 1930s and was about the water department and in the original script, no scenes took place in Chinatown at all. . The second film, The Two Jakes, was directed by Jack Nicholson in 1990 and was set in the 1940s and was about the gas company. The third film of the trilogy was about the building of the massive freeway system and was to be called ""Cloverleaf"", named after the famous interchange in downtown L.A., but it was never filmed. Awesome acting by Jack Nicholson ,because this film was the first of a planned trilogy, Jack Nicholson turned down all detective roles he was offered so that the only detective he played would be Jake Gittes. At the time of filming, Jack Nicholson had just embarked on his longstanding relationship with Anjelica Huston , this made his scenes with her father, John Huston, rather uncomfortable. Secondary cast is frankly magnificent such as Burt Young , John Huston , Diane Lane , Perry Lopez , James Hong , Bruce Glover , among others . Roman Polanski wanted William A. Fraker as his cinematographer, having successfully collaborated with him on Rosemary's Baby, but this notion was blocked by producer Robert Evans .Cinematographer Stanley Cortez was fired soon after production began because his classical style did not match the naturalistic style Polanski wanted for the film and proved too time consuming , Polanski had to find a replacement in only a few days and chose John A. Alonzo. Emotive as well as sensitive musical score by Jerry Goldsmith , including unforgettable leitmotif ; though Phillip Lambro was originally hired to write the film's music score but it was rejected at the last minute by producer Robert Evans, leaving Jerry Goldsmith only ten days to write and record the new score. The motion picture was stunningly directed by Polanski (Repulsion , Rosemary's baby , The pianist , Bitter moon, Frantic, Dance of vampires) . This is the last movie Roman Polanski filmed in the US and resulted to be the 15th biggest grossing film of 1974. And 2007, the American Film Institute ranked this as the #21 Greatest Movie of All Time. And ranked #2 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre ""Mystery"" in June 2008 ."

","Of the films this reviewer has seen (and that is quite a lot) this film is one of the select few to come as near to cinematic excellence as possible. From the first shot to the infamous final line, you belong to Polanski; in his hands for the whole ride - and those hands, I think it safe to say, are the hands of a master. The film features a phenomenal cast with Jack Nicholson as Jake Gittes, the beautiful Faye Dunaway as femme fatale Evelyn Mulwray and the excellent director John Huston in an acting role as one of the most horrifying villains in the history of cinema: Noah Cross. Now this is one of those films where little of the plot can be revealed because it's all just far too complicated BUT it's also a film you aren't likely to ever forget. Ever. With beautiful cinematography, a heart- pounding story line, fantastic acting and one of the most atrociously heart-rending finales this reviewer has ever seen, this film is an absolute must. My rating 10/10"

","And I don't mean that in a good way. Perhaps the most highly acclaimed feature of CHINATOWN is its script, which surprises me because of all the totally implausible elements written therein. Incredulity abounds. For one thing, I found the romance between the two leads to be unconvincing at best. Worse still was director Roman Polanski's rewrite of scenarist Robert Towne's originally happy, originally good ending. (Spoiler coming) Maybe it's just me, but I have a serious problem with the way this movie ends. The emotionally distraught Evelyn Mulwray, her life and mental health in ruins because of her father, is pointing a gun at this heartless monster and only succeeds in shooting a hole through the sleeve of his jacket. Oh, come ON. She got herself killed and all she had to show for it was a ruined jacket? Please! Plus, the fact that our hero keeps screwing up and repeats the past just defeats his own effort to help Evelyn. I'm sorry, I just don't like it. I think it's stupid. Granted, it's well-done overall, but there is just too much material here that stretches the limits of plausibility. The ending, which is supposed to be a very strong point in a film, is far too poorly done. Depressing does not make a movie a masterpiece, nor does its being a ""classic."""

","This film reminds me of ""The Big Sleep"" with Bogie and Bacall, although ""Chinatown"" is more enjoyable than the 1946 so-called ""classic"". Both Jake Gittes and Philip Marlowe exude smugness and insolence; both have to contend with, and are inexorably drawn to, classy women with secrets. And typical of movies that feature gumshoe detectives, the stories of both ""The Big Sleep"" and ""Chinatown"" are confusing and convoluted.<br/><br/>""Chinatown"" combines power and corruption with sex and murder into a needlessly complex plot, written perhaps deliberately to confound viewers, in keeping with traditional noir doctrine, which espouses that confusion equals arty sophistication.<br/><br/>So who did kill Ida Sessions, and how did she get possession of those pictures? Fans of ""Chinatown"" would regard such questions as irrelevant, just as fans of ""The Big Sleep"" would regard the question of who killed Owen Taylor irrelevant. Who cares who the killer was, so long as you have the infallible Nicholson, as heir to the infallible Bogart, to distract attention from the story. Sorry, but I just don't agree that a muddled story can be a film's virtue.<br/><br/>""Chinatown"" does have its strengths. Good acting permeates the film, even among minor characters. But the performance of John Huston was inspired (pardon the irony), and should have been recognized as such with an academy award. The music, too, is impressive. The slow, lonely horn evokes a dark and brooding mood totally in sync with the classy cinematography.<br/><br/>This film has a haunting cinematic atmosphere and, to some extent, that helps overcome a perplexing plot."

"tripper0","4","31","65","6 August 2001"," I hate film noir and I always will......
","Film Noir has to be the most overrated style of film being made.  'The Maltese Falcon', 'L.A. Confidential', and now 'Chinatown' are film noir films I have seen that are highly overrated pieces of s**t.  Someone has to say how crappy this style of film is.  But perhaps I am the only one using my brain when I watch these over complicated, yet extremely simple, and most of the time non-existent and forgotten about plots. First of all, the plot twists.  There are too many to count in every one of these.  She could be a daughter, then a lover, then a wife, then a man. It doesn't matter, apparently all of you fools will buy into anything they tell you and call it a masterpiece.  You may as well watch 'Days of our Lives'.  I bet they have great plot twists for all of you to sink your teeth into.  There's sure to be double crosses.  And as long as there are ten or eleven of those, contrived as they all are, you seem to love it.<br/><br/>Now 'Chinatown' is no better than any of those.  Jack Nicholson was a million times better in 'One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest', and that had a coherent script.  So I guess thats out.  Plus that had characters that you could have sympathy for, where as in film noir, this film is no exception to the rule, all of the characters are just a tool for the plot twists.  They don't have personalities or souls, they just have surprises, all of which are surprises because they come out of nowhere and don't cohere with the story they initially started telling. And continuity, can I get a little of that, please.  By the end of the movie, the main story element didn't even matter.  All of the plans to move water out of L.A. are forgotten about, and then some contrived soap opera story line takes center stage. I will, however, admit that I did enjoy the scene when Dunaway tell Nicholson her big secret.  It was just so damn contrived and out of nowhere that I found myself laughing a little and with a small smile on my face. All though, that was the only brief amount of enjoyment I got out of it, because the rest was just so slow.  And its built up like we are supposed to be exposed to this great finale, but alas, we are not.  But it was all silly, contrived, out of the blue, and a great plot twist that makes no sense, so I'm sure all of you were breathless when it was all said and done. And I have news for those of you who are so impressed at how good the atmosphere in this film is.  Guess what?  This isn't the only film thats been shot half decently and has atmosphere, all though not much of one.  A lot of films have a great atmosphere.  'The Godfather' has a great atmosphere.  'Das Boot' has a great atmosphere.  But these also have better direction, better stories, and better characters that we can care about. Am I really asking for too much in wanting that.  Those two are great films. This is really more of an attack on the genre on the whole, but this movie is no better than any other ones.  Nicholson was fine, but thats about it.  I'll take a movie with characters I care about from now on, and maybe a cohesive plot and story.  Thats all I ask, and I don't think thats too much."
"garage5inc","Null","10","17","2 November 2002"," Overrated Mystery
","I had heard so much about this movie from word of mouth that it was one of the best films ever created and possibly the best film noir ever. I had extremely high expectations for this movie, and when it was over I considered it a piece of trash.<br/><br/>The story is about city curruption and making money by taking over the water for the growing city of Los Angeles in 1930. It doesn't even sound interesting. Jack Nicholson is great as his role and it's fun to watch him in any movie, but that didn't make up for the screenplay. The biggest shocker in the movie was that Faye Dunaway's daughter was her sister as well, and her father, the man who was racketeering the water was the father. I could absoluetely care less, the child could have been anyone's and still had a zero effect. Nicholson is repedeatly chased by his old partner who secretly wants to arrest him because he thinks he murdered Faye Dunaway's wife, who was a city worker in charge of water, although Nicholson had absoluetely no motive, because he didn't know Dunaway before he took the case. The ending is horrible as well, it doesn't really matter.<br/><br/>
If you want to see a good movie made in 1974 see Godfather Part II, it made Chinatown look like a pile of sh*t. Very overrated movie, doesn't deserve to be anywhere near it's place (#19) on AFI's top films of all time."
"Horror-yo","3","14","26","1 December 2017"," Tedious, cliché, wildly overrated, cold, and trite
","*NO SPOILER YET* In case you're wondering why the incredibly high ratings, bear in mind this is a Polanski (all the cinema lovers, ""intellectuals"" and critics' favorite) starring now classic Jack Nicholson in a typical film noir that takes itself so very seriously it's almost telling you you have to love it or else you're not a true cinema purist.<br/><br/>To be honest, Nicholson as the other actors put in a good performance. Dunaway is alright but not nearly brilliant, but anyways the point is even incredibly talented actors couldn't make mediocrity into greatness. The script is fine if you're a fanatic of crime films, but if you just so happen not to be particularly this is the slowest 2hrs10min you've seen in a long time. In a long time. The pacing is S-L-O-W, you couldn't quite call this piece exactly ""stimulating"". The very plot is completely ordinary - big powerful bad guy covers up his horrible crimes and wants more money more power, complicated story about L.A.'s water and who owns it (wow no fascinating) - and has no edge to it whatsoever for the genre. What is considered ""superb structure"" can just as easily feel like a ton of events that pile up and further sinks the film into a delirium of enduring boredom where instead of being uneventful, it is full of stuff happening, but all of which are dull and typical.<br/><br/>What's more, there's nothing else about the film that helps lift the bland quality of the whole: dialog has no particular wit and also subscribes to the typical formula, the humor is corny, there's no real moral or actual greater point, the emotional dimension is fake and cold, the cinematography is flat and linear, and there isn't even that big old ending at the end that could've perhaps given legitimacy to the darn thing.<br/><br/>*SPOILER* - the Dunaway mother/sister thing is ridiculous and unnecessary and brings no strength to the plot, the fact she dies in the end right in front of that poor traumatized kid is senseless and also with no worth, how it's strongly implied the grandfather wants to sexually abuse her too and grabs her and takes her away is just insanely unnecessary and anti-climactic. And the clues towards the end are technically ridiculous: so of all places he drowns the guy in his pool in his backyard (conveniently the only place with salt water in the whole entire perimeter), of course drops his glasses in there and in order to read that paper at the end he pulls out and wears the exact same pair...<br/><br/>Lots of flaws there. You can like it and all, but the flaws are certainly there."
"ccthemovieman-1","9","17","33","3 April 2006"," A Bit Confusing But Always Fascinating
","No sense going into a detailed review describing what this film is about because there are enough reviews already. I'll just say it took me several viewings to finally figure out what was going on. It's not an easy to story to follow. It's also unusual: a crime story dealing with rights to water. To many people, that's odd but water has always been a precious commodity in southern California.<br/><br/>There is nothing confusing about how this film looks. It's a treat for one's eyes, especially if you love that 1940s look, which I do. This movie just drips with Los Angeles film noir atmosphere: a rich-looking piece of cinema with great period detail.<br/><br/>What stands out in most people's memory of this film is another odd thing: a man's nose getting sliced. Here, it's Jack Nicholson getting a ""nose job"" courtesy of some thugs. Jack, playing ""Jake Gittes,"" will forever be known (among wild roles) as the guy with a bandage on his nose, thanks to this movie. As interesting as he is, along with Faye Dunaway and the rest of the cast, I always get a kick out of seeing John Huston in here. I love the way he sounds and acts, and I'm sorry he had such a short role.<br/><br/>Overall, an always-fascinating film no matter how many times you watch it or how well you understand it."
"Euphorbia","6","15","29","25 November 2002"," Pretentious and over-rated
","Spoiler follows. <br/><br/>Actually, the movie is its own spoiler. I just point it out.<br/><br/>
On the DVD are comments by writer, director, and producer. The writer says he wrote the screenplay with a happy ending, I suppose like the much superior L.A. Confidential, or like the sublimely weird Wild Side. But the director -- an artiste of insufferable pomposity -- would have none of it. A happy ending was not literary enough for his effete sensibilities, or maybe it would have hurt too much, after the recent brutal murder of his own wife. In any case, he insisted on killing the heroine, and thereby killed his movie for me. R.I.P. <br/><br/>Chinatown is a handsome production, with a great look, and mostly good performances. John Huston is eerily accurate as the evil political boss -- compare his performance to the real-life drug lord in the Colombia segment of Michael Palin's documentary, Full Circle, filmed about 25 years later. But it takes more than isolated elements to make a memorable movie, one worth watching more than once. This film falls apart with a 'thud' at the end, making it an experience I would not want to repeat. 6/10"
"secondtake","7","14","27","15 February 2010"," Prettied up, lots of familiar twists, but well done, surely, and with Nicholson in top top form
","Chinatown (1974)<br/><br/>Not so much a film noir in style or character, but a period crime drama, set in the familiar 1930s of many noir films, and featuring a noir fixture, the loner detective.<br/><br/>I say this right away because Chinatown is sometimes called the last great film noir. After this point, noir films (or pseudo-noir, whatever your definition) become either thoroughly modern or openly derivative. The term ""film noir"" has itself loosened up to include almost any moody 1940s-style film with crime in it, which starts lose it's descriptive usefulness.<br/><br/>But Jack Nicholson is, really, a great detective in the Raymond Chandler mode--sassy, fearless on the surface but actually wary and a little scared in the end, playing by his own set of rules, and working mostly alone. As well made as this movie is in many ways, it's Nicholson's physical presence that makes his scenes really work. He's such a natural actor for the camera, hesitating just long enough to demand attention but not so long it becomes affected, he becomes definitive. And that's enough to make Chinatown classic.<br/><br/>The plot, too, is great dramatic stuff. Based in L.A., with lots of night scenes and period interiors, it circles around pretty women and rich men and corrupt politicos and dubious cops. And around water. In a way, this makes the movie prescient, almost--water being no new topic for Los Angeles but increasingly pertinent in the 1970s. Water is also a MacGuffin in the plot, a device we don't care deeply about compared to the interpersonal intrigues, the incest, the murders. All this other stuff keeps the movie, and Nicholson, going, and it's snappy and well done. It isn't exactly brilliant, though, and anyone really looking at the screenplay and following the plot might raise an eyebrow now and then, or question some of the hyperbole around the movie.<br/><br/>It's fun seeing director Roman Polanski appear as a jerky, power-hungry kind of thug, because maybe it fits him (though his friends say otherwise). He has confessed to raping of a young teenager long ago, but I have never heard of him actually apologizing for it. (I know that's supposed to stay outside of the analysis of the movie, and he did do 42 days in jail.) Digging further in, you can maybe see John Huston's role as a little strained (though I love Huston in general, and his presence is meant to let us connect to a previous generation of Hollywood) and Faye Dunawaye, for all her fame, is slightly cold at times, a little decorative. The movie has lots of strong effects this way, and you know that Polanski is a movie lover, and the result taken whole is a kind of bowing down to this kind of crime film from earlier on. And in that sense, every doubt I have for the movie above could be countered with a simple, ""It was intended that way."" And the clichés and familiar plot twists are part of an homage to the medium.<br/><br/>Which then begs the question--why isn't it filmed with more energy, with less prettiness? It doesn't in fact, adapt to a rigorous, stark, shadowy film noir aesthetic, but instead layers a very well done but slightly 1970s perfect, technically excellent color. Not that it should have been black and white, and not that Farewell My Lovely (filmed the next year in a really vivid, visual, film noir style in color, in L.A.) is the only way to go. But there were options to avoid making it actually too pretty, and too tame.<br/><br/>All of this is relative nitpicking. I go back to Nicholson. If you can focus on his role, his lines, his performance, capital P, you will be mesmerized and impressed, again and again. It is a strong movie, and an interesting one, which is a lot."
"Eumenides_0","10","12","23","14 February 2010"," The Most Perfect Movie Ever Made
","Chinatown is one of the few movies I consider perfect. I've seen it several times and when I start thinking about it, dismantling the several aspects that constitute it, I don't find anything wrong about it. Perhaps only Lawrence of Arabia has such an equal perfect synthesis of acting, writing, cinematography, editing, story, pacing, music and atmosphere.<br/><br/>The movie starts with private investigator J. J. Gittes following a man named Mulwray, whose wife thinks is cheating on her. Gittes takes photos and they make their way into a newspaper. Gittes unknowingly became a pawn in a smear campaign. Furthermore, he discovers that Mulwray's real wife, Evelyn, wasn't the person that hired him. And then Mulwray shows up dead.<br/><br/>Chinatown is a movie that simultaneously draws inspiration from the source of film noir and changes this genre. It is not a coincidence that John Huston, the director considered the father of film noir (The Maltese Falcon), plays a supporting role here. Roman Polanski knows his film history and knows how to give credit where credit is due. But Huston was also a good actor so his role here is more than deserved, indeed I could not conceive this movie without his performance: he plays an odious, disgusting, unrepentant bastard with such conviction it's difficult to see where the performance ends and the person begins.<br/><br/>And then we have Faye Dunaway, playing one of the greatest femme fatales in history. She's a mix of untouchable angel and demonic temptress; she displays a cold reservation about the people around her, a misleading fragility that hides a dangerous mind. Although I've never liked Dunaway much, I think no one has come close to portraying hopeless despair and dread as she does in this movie.<br/><br/>But Chinatown also modernises the genre. Not that film noir was ever bad, but the conception of realism is something that changes with time, and what was realistic in Out of the Past or The Maltese Falcon seems unconvincing nowadays. The tough Sam Spade gives way to J.J. Gittes, a down-to-earth private eye who worries if his involvement with murder suspects and his tinkering with evidence won't make him lose his license; and who wears a bandage in his face almost the entire movie after a knife cut. This frailty, this concern with mundane details was unthinkable in noir before Jack Nicholson. The '70s have my favourite performances by Nicholson – One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest; the movie he made with Antonionni, Professione: Reporter; The Last Detail – and my absolutely favourite is his role as Gittes, an otherwise good-intentioned detective who gets involved in something that's too much for someone as insignificant as him to handle. For although he's the hero of the movie, he's that modern type of hero that achieves nothing.<br/><br/>Chinatown is a movie where nobility and heroism meet a dead end. Fatalism, that other gift from classic noir, is much present here. Gittes is a man trying to do good in a world that has no conception of goodness anymore, and he only makes things worse, little by little, until the unforgettable (foretold) ending where everything is tied up. Few movie endings carry such a punch as Chinatown, but it's the only ending suitable.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski and Robert Towne, the original screenwriter, deserve all the praise in the world for having created this masterpiece. So do the three main actors. And on a final note, Jerry Goldsmith also deserves recognition for his beautiful score, so beautiful and delicate in its melancholy, that it feels like the movie translated into musical notes. They all deserve to be forever remembered for one of cinema's masterworks."
"patryk-czekaj","8","7","12","25 May 2012"," Polanski's brilliance strikes again
","Roman Polanski's Chinatown is definitely one of the best crime thrillers when it comes to both its fantastic structure and complex character study. It's his fascinating take on the corruption, greed and violence that lead people to become inhumane and brutal towards one another. It's like this real, and metaphorical 'Chinatown' in every bigger town in the USA – a place where everything happens on its own rules. Or even better, there aren't actually any rules, just the law of the jungle, one might say. Of course the rule applies as much to a single district, as to a whole city, or even country.<br/><br/>J. J. Gittes has to cope with one of the hardest cases that he had ever encountered. Normally, it all comes down to a few pictures of a cheating spouse (that's his business all right) to end a chapter. But this time it's something much bigger and more dangerous. He embarks on a path, which heads toward the discovery of a scheme that concerns the whole city of Los Angeles and its huge water supply. What's more, in all this crazy, dizzying mess Gittes meets a very fascinating and troubled woman, with a difficult mystery attached to herself.<br/><br/>After spending time with her Gittes is able to realize how pathological her family really is. And pathology is a right word in this context, as the amount of incest and other closely related themes is enormous. <br/><br/>The uncontested brilliance that Polanski has shown in Chinatown is contained in its complicated storyline and great use of symbolism, connected to every thing water-y. Almost everywhere you can sense the impact put on various connotations regarding water, not only in dialogues but also in the aspect of sensual experiences. For example, tapping water in the sink plays great with the overwhelming silence in the scene, where J. J. discovers a dead body on the floor. <br/><br/>I really admire Jack Nicholson for his marvelous work in every picture that he stars in, but his role in Chinatown is for me the definition of his career. The way he plays Gittes just makes you want more of his on-screen time (even though he is the main character). He sometimes shows a very serious side of his nature, but he can also come up with a fine amount of great jokes and insults. He is sacrificing his own life to terminate a case, which he wasn't even supposed to be involved in. Nicholson shows a bunch of acting skills that make his act very believable and entertaining. Faye Dunaway gives a decent performance as this classy, but very disturbed woman trying to help herself cope with the peculiar problems of her strange family. Note: Don't miss the very funny cameo by Polanski, who plays this scary, tiny man with a knife. Many laughs assured!<br/><br/>Polanski also makes a great use of the plot device known as a MacGuffin. The murder, which occurs in the beginning of the film isn't actually the thing that drives the plot later on. Even though Gittes is trying to find the killer, the picture is more about an insight into the characters and their profiles to provide a definitive explanation of this gruesome story.<br/><br/>All in all, I highly recommend Chinatown as one the best avant-garde crime movies ever directed and one of the finest, freshest takes on the pristine noir genre. Great directing, thrilling storyline and many detailed puzzles hidden in it account for a most memorable experience."

Reminds me of The Big Sleep, starring Humphrey Bogart. I watched that movie twice and really never understood what it was about. That was an overrated movie, just like this one. Although, I watched Chinatown just last weekend and I already forgotten nearly everything about it. It's so slow, that I lost the gist of the what story is even about. The storyline is just too convoluted. It is too dialogue heavy. Had the dialog been interesting, I could forgive that. The setting of Chinatown is the 1930s and it feels like it was filmed in the 30s. There are lot of 30s clichés. There's some suspense and ironic twists. But overall just too bland and boring.

","You have to get a little depressed when people with so much money are dreadfully unhappy!! ""Chinatown"" is a movie which ends up being an indelible display of how egocentric megalomania supersedes all other emotions! Such abominable behavior reflects a myriad of despicable qualities of many individuals which pertain to the abhorrent aspects of human nature. The director of this film, Roman Polanski, has had a tenuously depraved life. (Including his tragic marriage to Sharon Tate). This movie is considered to be Polanski's best film ever! ""Chinatown"" is based on a true story, one which inflicted a lot of suffering for the city of Los Angeles, and, the vast majority of it's citizens sometime back in the 1930's!! The intensity of agitation in this film is astounding!! Jack Nicholson's performance in this film is remarkable!! Faye Dunaway's performance as Evelyn Mulray is considered by some prominent movie critics, to be the 36th best acting performance in the history of movie making!! This does not surprise me, I felt that Faye Dunaway's performance in ""Network"" was the best acting performance I have ever seen!! The movie, ""Chinatown"" is about people who are unscrupulous and miserable!! Often times, character portrayals about people who are victims of their environment are usually depicted with the indigent or the oppressed, in the movie ""Chinatown"", the environmental victims were the wealthy and the powerful!! Hatefulness, callousness, not to mention the blatant disregard for hard working individuals, as well as their overall well being, all became second nature reactions with the hegemony of Los Angeles. (i.e. Noah Cross and a handful of pork barrel politicians). ""Chinatown"" emanates a subtle tolerance for lethal chicanery by making conspiracy, cover ups, and collusion complete and utter masterpieces of understatement. This film evokes a repugnant display of human intuition by merely divulging some simple, yet, clinically ruthless facts!! Accommodating plausibility translated to dollar signs with everyone in the film. Vindictiveness with all of these plutocratic and nefarious scoundrels in ""Chinatown"" ultimately relegated them to the precarious plight of having to reap what they've sown. Their recriminations became a proverbial case of too little too late. What wound up being the single most appropriate adjective for describing this film, was the cogently riveting one of POWERFUL!! At the end of this film all negative behavioral ugliness patterns propagated a disconcerting state of resonating despair. The directing in this movie is unbelievable. The acting is sensational. The cinematography and melodic genre in ""Chinatown"" is unprecedented, basically second to none!! Most critics rate ""Chinatown"" as one of the top twenty American films ever made, I agree!! One of Hollywood's best efforts to ever hit the silver screen!! Especially on account of itemizing the aggregate character assassinations of every main character in the film!!The movie ""Chinatown"" is AN ABSOLUTELY MARVELOUS CLASSIC OF ALL TIME!!"
"Gambitt","6","8","16","16 January 2003"," Decent Noir, but not great
","I've been trying to catch up on classics, and ""Chinatown"" was available at my local library so why not?<br/><br/>To be honest, I wasn't really impressed.  What ""Chinatown"" has going for it is good cinematography and a decent cast.  I found the plot disappointing. It was okay, but really not much better than mystery movies coming out of Hollywood today.  Just weave a complicated web of deceit and then slowly unravel it.  It's a tried and true formula, and I don't think that ""Chinatown"" did it particularly better or different.<br/><br/>I know I could get flamed for this, but I didn't really appreciate the harsh treatment of the Chinese in this movie.  Most of the recurring Chinese characters are menial servants, and of course Chinatown itself is a metaphor for the scum of humanity.  Now I know that most Chinatowns are or were at some point the red-light districts for their respective metro areas, but, ""Forget it, it's Chinatown.""  Can you blame an Asian for being slightly offended by this flick?<br/><br/>****Spoiler****<br/><br/>Finally I didn't particularly enjoy the sleezy, pedophilic twist towards the end regarding the incestuous nature of Cross and Katherine.  Perhaps my perspective is affected by my knowing that Polanski himself was charged with raping a minor and consequently fled the U.S.  To me, this taints the movie and makes me feel that this particular plot twist was more than just a step to move the plot on.<br/><br/>***end Spoiler ***<br/><br/>Overall, I give Chinatown a 6/10.  It has great style but average substance, and in my mind it doesn't stand the test of time.   It wouldn't make my top 100."

In Polanski's masterpiece of disillusion, nothing and nobody is what they seem. Names are false, motives are false or never understood. Gittes, who at first seems like a sleazeball, is in fact a white knight seeking after truth. The cool blonde is anything but. Other film makers would pull close-ups on the clues that are dropped in plain view throughout the movie, but with Polanski, they are there but you just don't see them, any more than Gittes, until it all comes together at the end. A truly wonderful movie that only gets better with repeated viewing"

","Roman Polanski's 1974 Neo-Noir Chinatown is a film that helped define both the genre and the era in which it was made.<br/><br/>Chinatown centers on a '30s Los Angeles private investigator, Jake Gittes (who turned to the profession after being unable to work as a police officer in the corrupt environment present in his assigned district of Chinatown), who is tricked into digging up dirt on the head of the department in charge of the city's water (a hot issue as Los Angeles was experiencing a drought). When the man soon turns up dead, Jake's investigation reveals a conspiracy much larger than he had imagined. Though the conspiracy itself is intricate and intriguing, and the characters are very compelling, the real draw of the plot is in its themes. Do not go into this film too focused on the minutiae of the plot, but rather look at what the picture as a whole, and particularly its ending, is trying to say about American greed.<br/><br/>The acting is terrific, with three great performances by Nicholson, Dunaway, and Huston. The direction is precise and tight yet patient, allowing scenes to develop naturally while always driving the plot along. The filming feels rather restrained and almost classical for the most part, and many shots feel like they could have easily have been from a film from several decades earlier. The music too feels this way, the Jerry Goldsmith composed score evokes instantly evokes the noir films which Chinatown takes most of its cues from.<br/><br/>A cynical look at the greed and corruption that shaped America, Chinatown is a classic of '70s American cinema, and a must watch for any fan of film."

The mise-en-scene of this film is really unmatched. Everything comes together to give the audience the amazing experience of the movie. The scenery of the desert is perfect for this film. Everything about this movie leads up to the final scene, where you realize that even if you do everything right, and try as hard as you can to do the right thing it does not work out. This film is sometimes categorized as a neo-noir, and the ending satisfies that classification."
"Hey_Sweden","10","4","7","2 November 2012"," One of the best for both Polanski and Nicholson.
","""Chinatown"" is an absolutely intoxicating mystery set in 1930s Los Angeles where private detective Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is hired to keep an eye on a water and power executive and finds much more going on than he'd anticipated. Faye Dunaway is his femme fatale, aloof socialite Evelyn Mulwray, in screenwriter Robert Townes' delicious ode to the crime fiction of authors like Hammett and Chandler.<br/><br/>Many details add to the enjoyment of this intricately plotted story; what's so great about it is that we discover things along with Jake and aren't able to figure out where it's going next. The story also has a very grim quality to it, one that's actually cyclical in nature as it's suggested that actions that had previously resulted in tragedy are being repeated. Then again, people may not expect just how grim this gets in the end. Additionally, it features some revelations that are particularly twisted and which the viewer is not likely to forget. There's one character who will especially make ones' skin crawl.<br/><br/>Many riveting scenes and confrontations play out while everything gets lovingly and beautifully lit and photographed; period recreation is also strong. Director Roman Polanski guides all of it with a sure hand, getting superb performances out of his well chosen cast. A large amount of familiar faces appear - Perry Lopez, Dick Bakalyan, Joe Mantell, Bruce Glover, Diane Ladd, John Hillerman, James Hong, Beulah Quo, Roy Roberts, Noble Willingham, Rance Howard, Jesse Vint, Burt Young, and Lee de Broux, but standing out and delivering a very grandiose performance is the always welcome John Huston. Polanskis' cameo as the hood who slashes Jakes' nose is also a treat.<br/><br/>By the end, the separate threads are tied together and Jake realizes that all of his best efforts don't amount to that much; he's unable to prevent the worst from happening. Still, this film offers a compulsively watchable journey on the way to its destination, remaining believable and interesting all the way. Even as it gets very serious, it doesn't miss opportunities for humour, and it entertains solidly for two hours and 11 minutes, rating as one of the most potent examples of the ""neo noir"" genre.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."
"seymourblack-1","10","4","7","7 March 2012"," The Enduring Power Of Evil And Corruption
","""Chinatown"" begins in a deceptively straightforward manner but soon develops into a complex mystery which involves deception, murder and corruption. The action is set in drought stricken L.A. during the 1930s and the stylish way in which the atmosphere and look of the period are evoked is just one of the many strengths of this exceptional movie. Ironically, its story, which conveys such a great sense of time and place, actually deals with various forms of evil that are utterly timeless and leads to a grim denouement in which evil is seen to prevail and corruption continues unabated. The sheer power and reality of this conclusion is, no doubt, one of the elements that makes ""Chinatown"" so memorable and contributes so strongly to its enduring appeal.<br/><br/>Having been hired by a client who presented herself as Mrs Evelyn Mulwray, private eye J.J. ""Jake"" Gittes (Jack Nicholson) tails Mr Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling) who's suspected of being involved in an adulterous relationship and photographs him with his young mistress. When the photos appear in the newspapers, a little while later, Mr Mulwray (who's the Chief Engineer in the L.A. Water and Power Department) finds that his reputation is damaged and when the real Mrs Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) turns up at Gittes' office and threatens him with a lawsuit, he becomes determined to find out who was behind the scheme to use him to discredit Mulwray.<br/><br/>Mulwray is found dead and is believed to have drowned but Gittes suspects that he's been murdered. The investigation he then embarks on, leads to the discovery of a conspiracy to use phony names and the city's water supply to manipulate land prices in the northwest valley. A number of surprising complications also then come to light in the relationships between Evelyn, her husband, her daughter and her father who's a wealthy and seriously corrupt businessman called Noah Cross (John Huston).<br/><br/>When the police begin to suspect that Evelyn may have been involved in Mulwray's murder, Gittes tries to protect her and her daughter by arranging a means of escape for them, but things don't go according to plan.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski directs ""Chinatown"" with great skill and some moments of conspicuous flair and the pace of the movie is perfect for the period in which it's set and the nature of its characters. It's exceptionally well written by Oscar winning Robert Towne who times the various developments to perfection and the technique of putting the audience in Gittes' shoes makes the whole journey a riveting experience.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson successfully balances Gittes' cynicism, glibness and sarcasm with his sensitive side in a portrayal which is extremely effective and, by his standards, rather reined in. Faye Dunaway is wonderfully inscrutable as a woman who turns out to be much more vulnerable and damaged than one first suspects and John Huston brings immense power to his role as an incredibly evil and dangerous villain who tries to rationalise his own depravity by suggesting that it's merely the result of unfortunate circumstances.<br/><br/>Gittes' experience of working in Chinatown before he became a private eye taught him that in that area, you can't always tell what's going on and that trying to help someone could actually wind up with them suffering as a consequence. Bearing in mind what Gittes learns and feels at the end of this movie, the metaphorical significance of Chinatown is self-evident."
"mike_elston","9","4","7","21 November 2010"," a classic film noir from the '70s
","The moment you see those opening credits in monochrome brown-sepia, you know you are in for a treat. This is a film by someone steeped in the tradition of the best film noir, and though not a style one associates with Polanski, his sense of drama and of pacing, and his painstaking care to make every shot add to the overall atmosphere, is perfectly suited. Though lacking the distinctive low viewpoints, close-ups and heavy shadows of traditional film noir, this is one of the few later films which manage perfectly to capture the atmosphere and the understated tension of the genre.<br/><br/>The writing and the acting, too, is straight out of the best tradition of film noir. Robert Towne's excellent Oscar-winning script, written with Jack Nicholson in mind for the central character of LA private detective J.J.Gittes, is written entirely from Gittes' perspective (I don't believe there's a single scene in which he doesn't figure). If Bogart was the epitome of Chandler's Marlowe in the 40's, then Nicholson is a worthy successor, and I wonder whether Towne ever considered writing another screenplay around the same character. When I first saw this film when it came out, I hadn't seen Nicholson before, and I remember being just blown away (I didn't see Easy Rider until a couple of years later). Faye Dunaway and the superbly cast John Huston complete the triangle, and we only discover their relative roles in the mystery as Gittes gradually pieces the complex jigsaw together, which of course is just how it should be. The supporting actors are more than adequate, secondary to the story but never detracting from it, with Perry Lopez doing a great job as the struggling but confident lieutenant (who of course is a former colleague of Gittes).<br/><br/>But for me, Polanski himself is the star of this film (and I don't mean his nice little cameo part). I'm glad he wasn't tempted to shoot in black-and-white, though it wouldn't have been out of place -- the consistently washed-out colour so well delivers the sense of the heat and the desert (only the blue of the ocean and the bright lights of Chinatown itself stand out), and his choice of shot, variety of speed, and attention to detail never distract the viewer, nor detract from the acting and the unfolding tale. It's only after the film is over, when you sit back in admiration, that you realise there really wasn't a single moment when you were impatient to move on, or lost track of the plot, or felt a wrong note had been hit. I regard this, along with his recent superb version of Oliver Twist, to be his best works. And that's not an easy choice to make."
"nixskits","10","4","7","13 December 2009"," This is the writer's film, not the director's!
","It has always annoyed me when a screenwriter's contribution is overlooked so the director can jump to the front of the credit parade, as far as importance to the project is determined. In his book ""Hollywood Animal"", Joe (Basic Instinct) Eszterhas describes how the man who lensed two of his scripts, Costa Gavras, was talking at a college and the so called film students, who've bought into this auteur theory, didn't really get it that somebody else conceived and wrote the piece in the first place.<br/><br/>Robert Towne is a man who apparently is very fast with doctoring others' stories and very slow with the completion of his own scripts. If it really took him seven years to write ""Chinatown"" (as Robert Evans claimed in ""The Kid Stays In The Picture""), then it was worth it for the whole world out there. This is an original work which should be judged differently than adapted projects. In ""Premiere"" magazine a few years ago, there was a list of the best screenplays ever. Well, to be fair, one should separate the ""Chinatown""s of the industry from films that turn plays, TV shows, video games and novels into big screen transformations.<br/><br/>Towne's reputation as the guy most young writers look up to is secure, even if he never wrote anything else again. On the commentary for ""Wonderland"", James Cox and Captain Mauzner are practically jumping up and down recalling a meeting they had with Towne, at which he lauded praise on their John Holmes based investigation/exploration.<br/><br/>Yes, Towne can create indelible characters and scenarios which actors and even in this case, directors, should kiss his hand for. I see there is a disc out now with a commentary track featuring David Fincher and Towne. Can't wait to hear that!<br/><br/>""Chinatown"" was vintage before the recalling of the past was just another cinematic cliché and excuse for young men to wear their grand pappy's old suits. The 1930s are beaming with some promise here and the unscrupulous moguls have a plan to get really rich (as if they weren't already) by screwing whoever they have to out of their fair share of nature's resources.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson and his almost father in law, John Huston, are both perfect in their roles as the detective and the crusty bastard whose evil lies at the heart of this whole display of an era when shame had much more power than it does in today's tell all society. <br/><br/>Faye Dunaway has her finest moments in a terrific career in this epic. She shows (and doesn't at key moments) the full range of emotions this resilient lady is always going through and that a woman's world seventy plus years ago was radically different than today's.<br/><br/>""Chinatown"" is certainly one of the great works of art from film's first century. Let's hope some other rich in spirit and plotting screenwriter watches this, for the first or hundredth time, and pens something worth being in the same category of quality."

Robert Towne's brilliant script is the baseline for this fascinating story of the Los Angeles and environs of the 1930s, a time when power was wedded to corruption, greed, family secrets of aberrant stature, and manipulation of resources (here the Department of Water and Power, the police, and entrepreneurs). Using the inimitable Jack Nicholson as the smart and daring private detective who pries open a conspiracy in the family of John Huston and his daughter Faye Dunaway whose private life secret is as huge as the water stealing crimes that are at the basis of the story was a stroke of genius that has rarely been matched since. And tying all of this together with one of Jerry Goldsmith's finest musical scores and cinematography that is liquid and redolent of the wastes that were the at the core of Los Angeles' prostitution of sunlight and shadow - the desert by the sea - was part of Polanski's genius for direction.<br/><br/>For viewing an example of the finest in film-making, CHINATOWN remains at the top of the list. Grady Harp"
"bkoganbing","10","4","7","6 December 2006"," Jake Gittes, Right Up There With Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe
","In Chinatown, Jack Nicholson gets one of his best roles, definitely in the top five as Jake Gittes, a throwback private eye to the forties of Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe. Had Chinatown been made in the Forties Humphrey Bogart who played definitive versions of Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe would definitely have been cast in the role of Jake Gittes. Nicholson however is one worthy successor to Bogey.<br/><br/>Very little action takes place in Chinatown in Los Angeles and only some peripheral characters are oriental. What Chinatown is here is a metaphor for a place you don't want to go and a culture and way of life you cannot penetrate or understand. Back when Gittes was a cop he was stationed in Chinatown and always felt alien there. He couldn't do his job because he didn't understand the people.<br/><br/>Gittes goes back to Chinatown so to speak when he's hired by Diane Ladd to shadow her husband. It's the kind of peep job Nicholson is used to and he does. Later the husband turns up dead and it turns out Ladd was posing as the wife. The real wife Faye Dunaway shows up and threatens to sue him.<br/><br/>Nicholson keeps on digging and he comes up with a juicy political scandal involving a scheme to defraud essentially the whole city of Los Angeles with their water supply. But he comes up with far more than that involving Faye Dunaway's personal life.<br/><br/>The lead villain here is John Huston in probably his greatest role before the camera with only The Cardinal as a rival. Huston is Dunaway's father, a rich gazillionaire who can just about buy everything and everybody and usually does. But as it turns out he's far more malevolent than that, a truly terrifying evil soul.<br/><br/>Faye Dunaway does a great job playing a woman carrying one huge burden on her soul. Look for good performances by Perry Lopez as the dogged police lieutenant trying to keep everyone happy and Diane Ladd as the hapless fake Dunaway.<br/><br/>Chinatown is one timeless film and will be getting raves centuries from now."

","This is where Jake Gittes once worked for the Los Angeles DA's office, before becoming a private eye. His job there: to do ""as little as possible,"" because, as everyone eventually learns, everything is a mystery, and nothing is as it seems.<br/><br/>But now Jake is a successful PI doing ""matrimonial work"" for the city's elites. The wife of the city water commissioner hires him to catch her husband cheating, when suddenly the commissioner drowns under suspicious circumstances, and his supposed mistress disappears. A few twists later, Jake becomes involved with the widow, as he tries to find out what her sinister father may have to do with the case, and why everything seems to be about water.<br/><br/>But this is a Chinatown case, metaphorically at least. He is told quite directly that ""You may think you know what's going on, but, believe me, you don't,"" but this warning is unheeded. Jake is good at what he does, and we can see his skill as he slowly untangles the mystery. But just like Jake, we see that at every turn the evidence has misled us, and all our intuitions were wrong. This is the story of a smart, competent man utterly confounded by events and people, leading to a tragedy that we could somehow feel coming, even if we couldn't quite see how. And all he's left with at the end are his assistant's consoling words, ""Forget it, Jake, it's ... Chinatown.""<br/><br/>This movie works on so many levels. The acting is superb, especially John Huston as the quite realistically creepy villain. The casting is inspired, with Faye Dunaway's slightly stiff acting perfectly conveying the widow's simmering neurosis. Other characters populate the scene, striking just the right notes: the two plainclothes cops, one more corrupt than the other, the fat coroner with the cigarette and cough to match, the annoying clerk at the hall of records, the Okie farmers struggling to keep their land, the Chinese servants who know more than they're telling, and even director Roman Polanski as a punk with a switchblade.<br/><br/>Jerry Goldsmith's music is flawless, and even the mysterious incidental sounds plucked on the harp of a piano are unforgettable. The cinematography captures the feel of 1930's Los Angeles through a slight orange filter, like a faded color photograph, the costumes and props are true, the neighborhoods seem real, and the history reflects the actual controversies of the day. The plot itself seems to wind around with all the natural grace of an octopus. This is great film-making."

","To me Chinatown is a mediocre film noir. I love mistery, I love dark films, and I love tragic endings, but this film contains nothing of these. The only real surprise of the movie is the fact that salt water is not good for grass, all other twists (and there are many) are either hinted at too early in too obvious a way, or they come completely unprepared in a way which is meant to shock, which usually fails. This holds in particular for the daughter-sister-scene - on one hand hand I expect her to say something horrible, on the other hand, I have no clue what exactly she will say. So I am neither surprised, for I had no expectations which could be shaken, nor shocked, because the scene and its aim to shock has been heralded far too early. The ending is logical and would be nice, if Gittes wouldn't have talked to much before. So chinatown was already known as the symbol of ""we destroy what we love while trying to protect it"", and we can only wait and see how exactly destruction will take place.<br/><br/>The film is somewhat saved by the superb acting of whole cast, nice lighting and the nose scene.

","Polanski's cynical noir-ish tale, CHINATOWN forces himself to retread the sad place of Los Angeles, where her pregnant wife Sharon Tate (along with several other friends) was brutally murdered in 1969. Ever so unfalteringly, he sticks to his guns, renders the whodunit mystery with an unadulterated tragic ending, as an acerbic retort to a patriarch society inundated with dyed-in- the-wool corruption both morally and economically, in memory of those innocently victimised.<br/><br/>J.J. Gittes (Nicholson), a copper-turned-private-eye, is swindled to investigate the hanky-panky of Hollis Mulwray (Zwerling), the chief engineer of L.A. Department of Water and Power, will soon discover something much bigger and sinister than that, after Hollis' sudden death and the involvement of Hollis' wife Evelyn (Dunaway), Gittes is intrigued to unearth the truth, which also implicates Evelyn's father Noah Cross (Huston), a magnate once was the business partner of Hollis. But, sometimes, human vice is so unspeakable and rotten-to-the-core, having almost lost his nose, Gittes would finally realise that he is still wet behind the ears in his profession, his heroic act seems astute and intrepid, but in the end of the day, it can not tip the scale, like his unspecified past in Chinatown, where he was an officer of the law, he again miserably fails to save the good and innocent from the hands of death and evil. The soul-shattering upshot is a rarely seen defiance in the mainstream cinema where a director holds sway of the final say, and its aftershock hangs around, that's why CHINATOWN is so unique and groundbreaking.<br/><br/>Uniformly, the film is hailed as one of the finest productions out of Hollywood, Robert Towne's Oscar-winning script delineates a conspiracy theory based on the true story which grants the story a tangible relevance, but also dives into a more personal matter of shocking taboo, to establish cinema is really a voyeuristic projector of all the dirty corners in our universe, A minor bellyaching is that, Gittes' function in the plot feels somewhat contrived, if Noah is so intent on locating what he is looking for, why on earth he would leave Evelyn out of his sight? Which is only for the benefit of storytelling that Gittes can always precede everyone else, he remains the sole source to tell audience what is the truth, that's something may or may not bother you.<br/><br/>There are plenty of memorable shots with distinctive flair, whether it is shot from a telescope lens, or a rearview mirror, the camera extends as a furtive, ambiguous onlooker with no further engagement, brooding and spying. Jerry Goldsmith's iconic score (made only in 10 days) lures viewers into that vintage era and then entraps them in the melancholy, suspense and thrill.<br/><br/>Nicholson's Gittes, who appears so competent and sharp-witted most of the time, conceals the star's smug persona and conveys a engaging commitment of the happening as the plot thickens, one of my personal favourite performance from him, simply because one literally sympathises for his vulnerability and powerlessness when he is held to face the bleak music; Dunaway, whose inscrutable mien reveals a little bit of something, each time her Evelyn comes under the spotlight, is she a femme fatale? a partner-in-crime? an insider? or just a victim? She keeps her secrecy until the big moment, the astonishing no-sham-slapping spectacles, what can one say? It just blows you away, both the revelation and the two-hander.<br/><br/>John Huston, perhaps in his most well-known role in front of a camera, leaves an indelible impression as a seemingly harmless wealthy old man, but actually is a metaphor of what is sickly wrong in our modern society, self-seeking, double-faced, incestuous, callous, unrepentant, with an unhealthy attachment of his own bloodline, a high-profile addition along with the two excellent leads.<br/><br/>In all frankness, normally, the blunt exploitation of woman as an easy prey is a big turn-down for my taste, but in this case, Polanski's free pass is too big to fail and the film survives as his most renowned work ever since."

These kinds of films require you to pay as close attention to the details as the detective who's the protagonist of the story, in order to fit all the pieces together. The mystery of what's going on has several layers that are slowly revealed as the story unfolds, Dunaway and Nicholson are brilliant playing off one another, and the ending is truly memorable and perfectly reinforces the theme of the movie. This is a flick that almost any fan of the genre will enjoy."

","A boatload of major Hollywood talent is on their game in this intricately complex tale of murder and corruption in 30s LA. Featuring a multi layered script of sub plot and deception by Robert Towne, impeccably translated by the florid cinema syntax of director Roman Polanski.<br/><br/>JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a successful snoop dealing mainly in marital discord. When he's hired by a woman posing as the wife of the Water Commissioner, things immediately get ugly as prevarication runs rampant and people get hurt.<br/><br/>Chinatown is a perfect blend of form and content. Every shot counts, every camera movement precise and for a reason. All characters resonate no matter how insignificant they may seem. For two hours he keeps both the audience and protagonist Gittes in the dark as he offers up one outstanding set piece after the next in a park, restaurant or a morgue brilliantly transitioning both place and mood as he does in one that starts out in a barbershop. Bloodletting is brief and minimal but about as brutal and jolting as any you will find in film. Leads and misleads are subtle as we literally in some cases tale Jake throughout the whole film since he is in every scene allowing us to watch things unravel in real time.<br/><br/>The sardonic Nicholson is tailor made for the role, his smart ass remarks fitting like a glove as he takes his lumps and stumbles upon evidence inadvertently doing more harm than good. Faye Dunaway's fatale is magnificently ambiguous, her icy exterior deceptive enough to allow the mystery to deepen even further into the film's running time. John Huston is tour de force avuncular creepy and Polanski in a cameo an imposing diminutive gimp with a blade.<br/><br/>John Alton's cinematography, Richard Sylbert's production design, Sam O'Steen's editing, Anthea Sylbert's costume design and especially Jerry Goldsmith's plaintive moody score all rise in compliment to Polanski's dark polished vision.<br/><br/>Arguably the finest American film of the last half century no amount of superlatives can convey the challenge, demand and awe to be found in one's first viewing of this cinematic masterpiece. Subsequent viewings will be void of the mystery that is perfectly shadowed from end to end yet the edifying moments of repeated showings will make the experience no less satisfying. Chinatown easily ranks with The Maltese Falcon and The Big Sleep as the best detective film in history. It's eloquent masterful telling by Polanski as graceful and well spoken as cinema language gets. Chinatown is film done perfect."

","What we have here today is truly a powerhouse of a film. Chinatown is a drama about a private investigator Jake (Jack Nicholson) who gets hired by a Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) because she believes her husband is having an affair. Jake quickly gets to work, but when Mr. Mulwray turns up dead and Evelyn not possibly actually being Evelyn, the movie starts messing with you in the best possible way.<br/><br/> Before I discuss anything further, I have to talk about the script. It's truly amazing just how good the writing is. It kills me not to discuss any spoilers, and I won't, but you learn just the right amount of details from every scene as the depth to the complexity of the story and the characters slowly unwinds in metaphorical wonder. If there aren't classes that already do this, then scriptwriting classes should always point to this movie when discussing how to essentially write a perfect script. No joke, as experienced of a writer I am, this script is almost as well-written as these reviews.<br/><br/> Anyways, Roman Polanski directs this film, and one of his most notable contributions is the tone. The dude had a rough past, especially with where they shot the film, and admittedly this is a formula that does not equal out to a rainbow and smiles kind of movie. And this has got to be the most normal character Jack Nicholson has ever played, and the best thing to say is that it's just a joy to watch an actor take the protagonist and make it his own. The supporting cast shines-I shouldn't even have to say it, but this obviously includes the brilliantly complex performance from Faye Dunaway.<br/><br/> Obviously, the most famous line is the one I reference in the title; however, that's not actually my favorite line of the film. What's so much fun is that I actually can't tell you what it is because it'd be too much of a spoiler, so all I will say is that the line is a big reveal I did not by any means expect in the latter half of the movie. It's some deep subject matter, and I say with a smirk that you have to watch the film to understand what I'm talking about.<br/><br/><br/><br/> I understand that some movies I review and recommend will not exactly put you in a good mood after watching them... And yeah, this movie isn't different. But if you're prepared for a slow-burner that will shock and entertain you (but not put a smile on your face), then watch Chinatown. Well, that's all from me.

","Chinatown is supposedly one of the best films of all time and of the 70s. Maybe it is, but it's not for me. You really need to have a taste for 70s filmmaking and noir to appreciate this in its' fullest. I grew up in the 80s and 90s and always had a tough time praising movies of the 70s.<br/><br/>The movie has plenty of good qualities such as the style, acting, intricate story lines, surprises, dialogue, and mystery. It's a good film, but I couldn't see all the universal praise it gets unless it's from people who grew up in the 60s or 70s.<br/><br/>I fell asleep on consecutive nights while trying to get through it and finally finished it on the third try. While it is interesting and very intriguing, it didn't necessarily ""grip"" me the way that a mystery/crime drama/thriller would be expected to. The most gripped I was during the whole movie came on my third try to finish it when Nicholson basically domestically abuses Mrs. Mulwray and she reveals something very disturbing. Shocks like this are always riveting, but I was more disturbed than impressed with the reveal. Maybe this was gratifyingly controversial and provocative for 1974? It didn't really work for me.<br/><br/>While the film has classic qualities, without a doubt, by the end, for all the light it had shown at times for me, it sort of dimmed down a few points and I'll settle for a solid 7/10. It's a classic crime drama story and film that I highly recommend for that genre's list of originals, but outside of the hype, which by now appears to be bandwagon, I don't see how it's considered one of the best movies of all time.

"dom-lerose-8","Null","3","5","21 November 2014"," ""Chinatown"" has too many flaws, making it one of the most overrated films of all time.
","Crime films tend to cast the largest spells on viewers who seek a compilation of many gritty, lurid, enthralling emotions and characters. ""Chinatown"" is one of the most highly praised films of all time. I couldn't tell you why. I must have looked at my clock ten times every thirty minutes to count down when this dry, low- energy crime film would end. Many film ""experts"" state that some of the greatest films of all time I will go as forth to say that this is one of the most wasted talent examples in cinematic history. The plot writer Robert Towne has created contains all the ingredients for a perfect neo-noir mind-bender. Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a private detective who is hired by Evelyn Mulwray when she suspects her husband Hollis, builder of the city's water supply system, of having an affair. Gittes does what he does best and photographs him with a young girl but in the ensuing scandal, it seems he was hired by an impersonator and not the real Mrs. Mulwray. Jake is plunged into a complex web of deceit involving murder and municipal corruption all related to the city's water supply. If this film had strong energy we would be dazzled. Instead, Roman Polanski directs this in a very bland fashion. We get no soothing music to fit the setting that could have shined if we weren't stuck with minimalist costumes and production. There's a couple cool cars, that's it in terms of production design. Every actor barely locks into their characters. We get dragged out performances with out any spice. With so much mystery, deceit, and complexity, we would assume that being at the edge of our seats would be easy with this classic. Sadly you have to pay extremely close attention to absorb every tiny detail Polanski throws at you. It gets too confusing and not thrilling enough. There's nothing noir about it. All ""Chinatown"" does is show an early example of underachieving crime filmmaking with barely any focus on it's main idea- corruption."

It turns out he is, but things take a strange turn when the husband is found dead, and the woman who hired him was an impostor. The real Evelyn Mulwray(played by Faye Dunaway) claims to know nothing of the affair, but Gittes continues to investigate, which leads him to wealthy land owner Noah Cross(played by John Houston) who has shady dealings going on, and also wants to find his granddaughter, which Evelyn knows something about...

The serpentine labyrinth of corruption uncovered by tough but intelligent private eye Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) involves nothing less than the consolidation of greater Los Angeles itself, where the most tainted currency of thieves isn't money, but water. This is one of those rare productions where every element seems to fall into place, from Robert Towne's exciting, original screenplay to a definitive performance by Nicholson to John Huston's unlikely but effective portrayal of what must be one of the most depraved villains in screen memory, a man who, by his own chilling admission, ""is capable of anything."" Music, art direction, editing and photography are all first class, but the true test of any classic is longevity, and in this regard the film passes with flying colors by actually improving with each viewing."

It is so fresh and appealing; it might have been filmed yesterday.<br/><br/>Polanski has given a Technicolour take on the noir genre and come up trumps. There are no technical aspects with which I can take issue.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson turns in a splendid performance for a Hammeresque gumshoe of the period, easily as good as Bogey or Mitchum - Sardonic, cynical, unafraid but still very human. I'm surprised he didn't do more. Whilst Faye Dunawaye makes an equally plausible take on the 'broad who is damaged goods'.<br/><br/>It's the usually convoluted tale of a private dick retained to investigate a missing person and then finding himself in a whole mess of hot (read cold) water. An especial challenge for Nicholson is that less than halfway through the movie, a switch-blade thug (played by Polanski himself) opens his nostril. For most of the rest of the time he is forced to play his part with this clownish, carbuncular dressing on his nose. That he still continues to offer an entirely believable performance is a measure of the great man's talent. A lot of actors would simply have refused a role that so obviously disfigured their pretty faces.<br/><br/>All of the other ensemble turn in sterling performances, too.<br/><br/>The vintage period is captured extremely well. There are some wonderful choices in motorcars.<br/><br/>Script is slick, witty and hard-edged, just like a good noir should be. It certainly pays to listen.<br/><br/>And finally, no movie is complete and many are spoiled by an inappropriate or unmemorable music score. Here again, 'Chinatown' hits just the right spot with a slow jazz number, headed by a maudlin trumpet lead. You won't forget it.<br/><br/>Thoroughly gripping entertainment in every aspect, no technical issues to criticise; what can I do but give it 10 stars?"

","Roman Polanski's CHINATOWN has classical film-noir elements, but the beating heart of the movie lies in Polanski's own bag of tricks and oddity; he twists schoolbook-stuff around and adds misguiding, bizarre moments and characters, adding to the movie's intelligent narrative. Because anyhow, Jack Nicholson as Jake Gittes is a gritty feature, he's experienced failure from back when he was a policeman in Chinatown, something that we only get through mysterious hints. Ad Jake's a well-dressed, humorous and classy man, but also cynical and impulsive and doesn't affect by walking around with a bandaged-nose most parts of the film. This is a hard-boiled detective-mystery which spins its complicated puzzle into something disturbingly dark, in which Faye Dunaway's terrific performance as the elegant Evelyn holds the movie's dark core as she acts like a classy femme fatale, with suspicious motives. CHINATOWN is one of those conspiracy-thrillers that demands a revisit, not only because its twirled plot is so intriguing, but because of Polanski creating a unforgettable, dark atmosphere of originals and one of Nicholson's greatest performances as he investigates his way down through greed, murder and incest."

His wise guy determination not to be screwed over makes the perfect foil for Dunaway's worldly innocence. All of the supporting actors pitch their tents on this base and none come up wanting.

Dealing with his own internal turmoil near the time of filming, Polanski opted not for the happy ending screenwriter Robert Towne wanted and fought for, but instead the brutality of real life. Sometimes people die who are not supposed to, and oftentimes, things don't work out as they should and people are worse off than they began. I'm a humanist and a fan of humanistic films (I'm gazing at you, Francois Truffaut) so I appreciate when a film forgoes the ending tying everything up with a bow and opts for the realism that often leaves life less neat than we would like. Chinatown takes place in Los Angeles in 1937 where J.J. Gittes, a private eye is hired to find out if a husband is cheating on his wife. Jake soon realizes he is tailing a powerful man and gets pulled into a web of money and politics he could never have anticipated. Starring Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, and legendary John Huston, Chinatown is a perfect neo-noir, so perfect in fact that lines are often blurred and the film is often referred to as a noir rather than a neo-noir. Chinatown came out over 40 years ago in one of the very best years of American cinema and has persisted as a pinnacle of cinematic art.<br/><br/>J.J. Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a private eye in L.A. who usually handles cases regarding philandering spouses and uses any means necessary to close his cases. Gittes also gains most of his business via what's printed about him in the newspapers, so he's no stranger to bringing publicity upon himself. Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) seeks the help of Gittes due to her fear that her husband Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling) is having an affair. Hollis is the Commissioner and Chief Engineer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power which means he has quickly become one of the most powerful and influential politicians in the area due to the chronic drought experienced in the Los Angeles area. Gittes doesn't let Mulwray get too far away from him following him as he attends commission meetings and to various reservoirs, aqueducts, dams and waterways. Jake does eventually snap a photo of Hollis Mulwray with another woman. When the story makes the front page of the paper, Gittes is visited by the real Mrs. Mulwray threatening to sue Gittes. With his reputation at stake, Gittes is eager to talk to the real Mr. Mulwray but the Mulwrays are reluctant to talk to him until Mrs. Mulwray finally talks to Gittes and agrees to drop the lawsuit. When Gittes is persistent in speaking to Hollis, Evelyn finally suggests that Gittes tries to locate him at the Oak Pass at Stone Canyon Reservoir. Gittes does find him there, along with the police as he has been killed. Evelyn covers for Jake being at the reservoir so he is not implicated in Hollis's murder. Jake's interest in Evelyn has been piqued, and she is strongly drawn to him, as well. The relationship between the pair grows and leads them down roads of scandal and corruption Jake could have never imagined. <br/><br/>From the beginning, Chinatown is a perfect noir. From the font of the credits to the emanating score, Chinatown proves its roots in neo- noir. Polanski's brilliant direction is clear from the beginning as he pays brilliant homage to classic noir films with his apt camera work. There is a zoom shot into the rear-view mirror of Jakes car that is the stuff dreams are made of. We also see a brilliant shot through a pair of binoculars Jake is gazing through creating a captivating view into Jake's work. The perfectly haunting score throughout the film is only eclipsed by the brilliant flawless camera movement. Dunaway leaves no doubt that she is the film's siren as she clumsily reaches for a cigarette only to be reminded by Jake that she's ""already got one going"". The screenplay is incredible, and the interactions between characters are truly divine to experience. John Huston, screen legend, is intensely engaging in his role as land baron Noah Cross. Despite the biblical inspiration of his name, Noah seeks to keep water from surrounding land in order to irrigate it and sell the land he buys at a reduced rate; Huston encapsulates an evil in the guise of overt niceness like no one else could have done. The isolation and loneliness of Gittes are the film's shining takeaway. Reminiscent, probably, of the isolation director Roman Polanski felt just before he fled the country, Gittes is always searching for truth, but even when he finds it, nothing can be done because corruption rules the city. Gittes is no angel, of course, often employing illegal means to close his cases, really drives home the idea that the world is full of gray areas and we are but mere pawns to a system few of us get to actively participate in."

","Chinatown, 1974<br/><br/>I wish I was better at writing these movie reviews, because I honestly cannot say enough about this movie. I grew up watching old gangster movies, especially The Godfather trilogy, so in my heart nothing can ever ""beat"" them (part one and two) but if there was a film right behind them, it's this. This movie is so amazing in so many ways. The story is awesome. Every scene gets deeper and deeper in to the core of this eerie plot, and there's never a dull moment. Polanski does an incredible job with this movie. The 1940s LA setting is so perfect for this film and the jazzy noir-ish soundtrack is incredible. Another amazing aspect of this movie is the colors. The pastel-ish colors add to the tone and mood and style of this amazing film. And my favorite aspect of it is that its called Chinatown yet we only see Los Angeles' Chinatown for the final few minutes of the movie. I just loved that aspect of it and instantly fell in love with this movie. Not to mention Jack's performance. Incredible. I give it a 77 out of 10."

","I loved this film, the story line was brilliant, it kept you on the edge of your seat the whole entire time, and the end was a genuine surprise. I thought that the cinematography was so well done, the use of lighting and camera angles had this awesome effect that drew you in and set the tone for every scene. The acting was marvelous too, Dunaway and Nicholson were brilliant together and had an edgy feel that kept a mysterious and hidden evil to both of them that kept the viewer questioning at all times. They also had awesome chemistry that made them so convincing together! Over all I loved this film and would recommend it!"

","Hollywood is one city which often wears more faces than the two it's noted for. Naturally, one face is more acceptable than the other. That face is innocence. Its hardly an innocent place, but to judge by its heavenly celluloid stories, it continues because audiences are suckers for them. Those faces are found in every splendid tale it creates. This movie is one of them. The film is called ""Chinatown."" It has been seen by many audiences because of is star. Jack Nicholson plays J.J. 'Jake' Gittes, a modest, but serious private eye who's every bit an old style gumshoe. In this episode he is hired by the wife (Faye Dunaway) of a city government employee to find out if her husband is cheating. With the help of his associates, he not only discovers the husband is not cheating, but also learns she is not really the man's wife. The real Mrs. Evelyn Mulray (Faye Dunaway) sues Gittes and promises legal action. Gittes begins to investigate and finds more than he sought, including murder, political corruption and a powerful organization, led by millionaire Noah Cross, (John Huston). His friend on the police force, Lieutenant Lou Escobar (Perry Lopez) warns him of the dangerous elements arrayed against him. One for instance is Roman Polanski who plays a vicious gangster, and is also the movie's director. Dunaway proves fantastic when cross examined and reveals a secret which should have remained undisturbed. In the end, we conclude that innocence is covered in a thin veneer for a reason. You don't really want to know the truth. Now where have we heard that before? ****"

","Chinatown is in my opinion the greatest movie ever made. It has absolutely everything!<br/><br/>It draws influences from classic 40s film noir such as The Big Sleep and the Maltese Falcon and somehow manages to surpass them on every level. In Chinatown too we have the cocky gumshoe, the femme fatale (for once working out of the best of intentions) and of course the labyrinthine plot. We also have a number of other characters who either, act as vehicles or obstructions to help and hinder Gittes on his journey. However, there is also a certain vulnerability to Nicholson's character underneath that confident exterior that isn't as obvious in say Phillip Marlow or Sam Spade.<br/><br/>The plot is highly absorbing and Robert Towne deservedly won an Oscar for his screen writing. He somehow manages to make a seemingly mundane political scandal seem interesting by meshing it with a private scandal of the most disturbing kind and every word uttered seems to have major significance in terms of plot and character development.<br/><br/>The ending is now legendary and Polanski deserves huge recognition for this. It was he who demanded that it was changed from Towne's original and the pair famously fell out over it. However, Towne has since rightly conceded that Polanski's ending, shocking and tragic though it is, ensures that this film lives long in the memory.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the casting and performances are of the highest quality. Nicholson gives a world beating performance as JJ Gittes, while Dunaway plays the classic Femme Fatale to perfection. And lets not forget the legendary John Huston whose rich, charming Noah Cross has a dark hidden secret.<br/><br/>Polanski's mainly subjective camera-work deserves admiration as he captures a sun-drenched 1940s Los Angeles to perfection, and his appearance as the ""Midget"" with the knife pre-empts one of the most memorable scenes in movie history.<br/><br/>On the whole Chinatown to me represents what constitutes a great film - believable characters with depth and feeling, a great plot-line and magnificent direction.<br/><br/>The film, had it not been up against The Godfather Part II, would surely have taken the Oscars by storm.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it - do so immediately and if you have then watch it again and witness a bonafide masterpiece."

","Before any of you movie buffs assault me in your minds for wanting a happy ending, I want to say I don't. I want AN ending. Any ending. The ending is the most important part of a film. It sticks with you in ways the rest of the film doesn't.<br/><br/>Chinatown's ending sticks with me, but it does so for the wrong reason. I have the same problem with 'The French Connection.' It WASN'T an ending! It just went along, then stopped. Like the editor sneezed while splicing film.<br/><br/>Nicholson's character persists in the investigation even when he doesn't need to. I'm sorry, but there's no chance he wouldn't have persisted after the events in the last scenes. The movie failed to end. It just stopped two or three scenes before the actual end. It annoyed me to the point of growling.<br/><br/>Is the movie brilliant? Yes. Is the movie a classic? Yes. Is the movie annoying? Hell yes! I don't care if everyone ends up dead and LA burns to the ground and the last shot is of crying babies burning on spikes, it's at least a real ending with no loose ends.<br/><br/>Loose ends in a bad movie are derided, loose ends in this movie and it's called a masterpiece? No. It doesn't work that way. I adored every frame until the last scene, when the loose ends burned like fiery wicks into my soul.<br/><br/>I want to give the movie a much lower score... but... I... can't. The rest of the movie is just too damned good. But the ending killed it for me. I could never watch it again."

","I'm 46, so obviously I have seen ""Chinatown"" many times over the years. It IS an excellent film, beautifully plotted and paced (a la the ""old styles"" of 30's film noirs), and the sad storyline is only ""highlighted"" throughout the movie by the ""HAUNTING TRUMPET SOLOS"", which I will often ""hear"" in my mind when recalling this particular film.<br/><br/>As with most good films, the music ebbs and flows throughout the movie with resonances of the trumpet solos, reminding us in places of further trouble to come, or of ""romance"" amidst all the turmoil between Evelyn Mulray (great-sounding ""old money"" name) and ""Mr. Gittes"", the Jack Nicholson character.<br/><br/>I plan to go on for the rest of my life seeing this particular movie over and over again (with breaks, of course, in-between just to allow a little bit of ""amnesia"" to settle in, and thus finding the story ""fresh"" again). Again, the music is what really makes this movie memorable for me. Faye Dunaway is a great actress, and much underutilized in the overly-competitive SHOW BIZ ATMOSPHERE. She's older now, but so what ? Talent doesn't age, it only gets better !!"
"keiran-75504","9","2","3","16 August 2019"," Great acting, even better story
","Jack Nicholson is an incredible actor his portrayal of a typical anti hero detective from the noir era is perfect. That's the first thing that I love about this movie. Nicholson is a bad guy with a good heart determined to uncover the corruption relating to the drought in LA. He uses threatening techniques to find details and figure out why he was tricked and what is going on. Along with Nicholson's spectacular acting the plot of the movie follows his perfection in stride. Watching Noah cross grab his granddaughter out of the car after her mother was shot is defeating enough, but knowing that our hero is unable to do anything about it is even worse. Throughout the movie Nicholson shines a light on the rich and power controlling the water in Los Angeles only to be stopped short in the end because the rich are too powerful. It's sad and symbolic at the same time, sometimes in life we can experience a problem but there's nothing in our power that we can do. It's a gritty and realistic story that lets audiences know things won't always work out, and that with enough money comes influence, and influence allows people to do what they want."

The story is original, we get to see it through Gittes point of view and follow him through the case and it's just everything a detective story should have, a really slow pacing. The characters are well written, realistic and overall great. The soundtrack was perfect, mixing some suspenseful music with some jazz that fits the Era. The filming technique in the movie is truly remarkable, all the shots are beautiful and extraordinary.<br/><br/>There is so many famous actors in this movie and everyone in the cast does an incredible job but Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, John Huston and Perry Lopez are the ones that stands out.

","Roman Polanski's Chinatown is one of the most amazing screenplays ever penned, one of the most gorgeously photographed film ever made and one of the best examples of a finely paced puzzle movie that doesn't fully unfold until the very last frame. Jack Nicholson plays JJ Gittes a private investigator in Los Angeles who gets embroiled in a case that includes big figures and the entire cities drainage system! The pacing is excellent- so good that despite being a long movie it never feels such. Nicholson and Dunaway are excellent and have such good chemistry they wouldn't look out of place in a classic film. Playing the villain Noah Cross is the great director John Huston, and he is menacing, scary and the stuff of nightmares. The film looks great with every scene bathed in gorgeous sun-drenched light that gives this noir an edge. The script is practically a bible for film students. Roman Polanski's Chinatown is worthy of all the praise it has received."

","""Chinatown"" is an unforgettable film. It is masterfully told and brilliantly acted. It is truly a must-see.<br/><br/>-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: This film boasts a script that is never dull and rarely predictable. It twists our expectations but not just for the sake of a twist. Each moment in the film is motivated. Roman Polanski directs with such great authority and understanding of the audience. Every moment is crafted beautifully. *Cinematography/Editing: John A. Alonzo is credited with the cinematography work on this film (Stanley Cortez was originally supposed to shoot the film). He does amazing work and plays brilliantly with camera moves and dynamic lighting. There is an air of mystery just within the visuals that really advances the story. The editing is perfectly paced and never hangs on anyone too long or too short. *Dialogue/Acting: Strong aspects of the film here. Exposition in all the right places and never given too quickly. Jack Nicholson could have carried the movie by himself if he needed too, but luckily everyone else gives impressive performances alongside him. *Music/Sound: Mysterious and intriguing sound design combined with the score make this an audio pleasure of a film. *Production Design/Special Effects: Nothing lacking in these departments. Excellent locations and sets with wonderful color tones and costumes. The few moments that require special effects are authentic and pull the audience in more. Nothing to complain about.<br/><br/>*Conclusion: ""Chinatown"" is a film that will not soon be forgotten. It refused to fall into cliches of its time and instead took its own journey, and that is why it has become so well respected over the years."

When you realize how important it is to have the best script and dialogue with strong character actors...you'll understand why 'Chinatown' is a must see for any film director, writer, film lover, and actor.
Although it's remembered as a Jack Nicholson vehicle..check out the amazing performance by Faye Dunaway, or the sinister superb performance of John Huston.
Let's just say when the director, Roman Polanski, gives a strong credible cameo as a gang member roughin' up Nicholson's character, you know it's a good movie."

","Every movie lover knows about the brilliance of Roman Polanski's ""Chinatown"". If you are reading these reviews you havent seen it yet, which positions you in a place at the gates of heaven. You have not entered heaven yet, but you will once you decide to walk through the gates and watch ""Chinatown"". I am rather jealous of you, because the first time is special, although the great thing about movies is, that the most wonderful stories CAN be relived time and again. ""Chinatown¨ is up there with the all time greatest movies of american cinema history. The absolute pinnacle of genius.<br/><br/>That must be enough praise to get you curious. My real advice would be not to read any further. Not my review, nor anyone elses. I just wanted to make sure with my first paragraph that you wont make the unforgivable mistake of passing this movie by. You havent lived without having seen it...<br/><br/>The story takes place in L.A. in the thirties, in the middle of a period of drought there is a big conflict about how to get more water to the city. A previous water reservoir had collapsed and killed 500 innocent L.A. citizens and now they plan to built another one with the same faults that were present in the earlier disaster. Enter Jack Nicholson as a private investigator who at first gets an assignment that seemingly has nothing to do at all with this disaster which cost so many people's lives. He just has to research if a husband is cheating on his wife. What seems an innocent and tedious job, soon becomes a life threatening case, when Jack Nicholson finds out more than he is supposed to know about the powers that be, that want to build this risky dam, come hell or high water...<br/><br/>The story truly is very intelligent, suspenseful and emotionally devastating and has won many awards. The number of awards is mindboggling so I wont start listing them here, but it suffices to say that everything, and I truly mean everything, could be and has been awarded about this movie. I just want to restrain myself, in order to limit the length of this review. No I cant. I just GOT TO mention everything. I'll keep it ""short"". <br/><br/>The acting. Let's start with that. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway and John Huston truly play the roles of their lives. Images so pure and intense that I can see them by just mentioning the name ""Chinatown"". The photography by John A. Alonzo (Scarface) is breathtaking. Almost every scene is shot in the magic hours, when the sun rises or sets and delivers shadows and golden colors that only last for some 30 minutes every day. All the images are bathing in this glow of early sunset. Almost every scene could be a poster, that is how gorgeous the photography is. Finally the music score by Jerry Goldsmith, who is a music genius. With a minimum of instruments he creates another ""leading role"", because his music is intertwined with the heart of this movie. Yes, his music score is so powerful and sublime that it is unimaginable to think of ""Chinatown"" without these dissonant piano string chords and gorgeous dreamlike trumpet themes. Jerry Goldsmith's music scores are even being used after his passing, every year till this very day, movies are released with themes from earlier scores by this brilliant composer.<br/><br/>In the end we have to thank Director Roman Polanski for his genius in bringing all these talents together and creating something which will be seen by generations to come. In a time capsule of movie history Roman Polanski's masterpiece will shine as a star among the very greatest that american cinema has ever achieved."
"teslacoil-54245","10","2","3","12 February 2018"," More of a boxing match than a film.
","Just like the plot within, this film is deceptive. You go into it thinking that you'll get just another crime drama, and from the beginning it feels like one. Then you see Hollis Mulwray dead in the reservoir, and all of a sudden it feels like you've gotten a body shot from boxing legend Joe Frazier. <br/><br/>The rest of the film is more of a boxing match between you and the film. You think you've got it figured out, you think you're starting to get some shots on it, but then it gives you another body shot that throws all your conceptions out the window.<br/><br/>And the film never lets up, it just keeps going and going and going. The conspiracy and plot gets thicker and deeper, thicker and deeper. Is it Cross? Is is the real Mrs. Mulwray? The only form of relief, of closure you get from the film is from a scene where Mrs. Mulwray describes a girl who she's keeping away from everyone else as both her ""daughter and sister"" - I'll let you do the math yourself on that one. I personally don't want to think about it.<br/><br/>Not even the end provides closure. Just as you've started to hope for Mrs. Mulwray and start to relax knowing she's gotten away from a seemingly mentally deranged Mr. Cross, a pistol report rings out and the horn of her car starts to sound.<br/><br/>""Forget about it, it's Chinatown"" Jake Gittes is told by his partner as they walk away into the darkness of the night.

","What a gem from 1974. A film I had never heard of apart from its listing in Steven Schneider's 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die.<br/><br/>Directed by Roman Polanski and starring Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway it was made in the pre-blockbuster era and really shows the brilliance of the director rather than a few gimmicky CGI effects and laser beams!<br/><br/>The film noir genre is epitomised by films from the forties shot in black and white and sort of detective thrillers. Here we have a Technicolor film from 1974 revisiting the genre. The performance of Nicholson as private detective Jake Gittes is mesmerising and up there with his other great roles. Gittes is an ex-policeman who worked in the Chinatown district of Los Angeles. Now a private detective in 1930s LA. He becomes embroiled in the private life of the chief engineer of LA's water and power department. Hired by his so called wife at the films beginning he later discovers it wasn't actually who she claimed. Investigating further what turns out to be so called adultery actually becomes a murder, greed and intimidation case involving the local water supply!<br/><br/>The story could actually have been a screenplay for an episode of Murder, She Wrote but the performances of the cast and ultimately its direction by Polanski are wonderful to watch. It's the camera angles, the screenplay, photography that all come to the fore.<br/><br/>No doubt you will never have heard of it but I would highly recommended it over the modern multiplex trash."
"joshuafagan-64214","9","2","3","8 October 2016"," A Dark, Twisted Trailblazer
","A film that is more talked about than seen these days, Chinatown is nonetheless one of the most significant films ever made, and it sits at a unique precipice in cinematic culture. Starring Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, and somewhat hilariously, John Huston, it is the story of a private investigator sent to snoop on a cheating husband only to later find that husband turned up dead, setting off a chain of events that leads to the top being blown off a major conspiracy that runs deep into the roots of early 20th century Los Angeles.   It's a shame that the only part of the film the average film-goer knows about is the most famous line, ""Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown."" That's a wonderful line, but out of context, what does it mean? Nothing. You could guess or even infer, but unless you've seen the film, it might as well be sitting out on an island. Even you know the general plot of the film, as I did before watching it, you don't get the full impact of the line.<br/><br/>Film quotes stick in the meat of popular culture not just because they're fun to stay or because they role off the tongue, but because they're built up to beautifully and because they hit with a force that sums up the emotions of the moment. Quoting them only works if those present know the film itself. Imagine how absurd it would sound to say, ""May the Force be with you,"" to someone who's never seen Star Wars. They would get the gist of what you're saying, but they wouldn't get the reference or the connotations.<br/><br/>The ""Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown"" line works much the same way. There are situations when it would be appropriate to say this, but there's no point if no one in your party has seen Chinatown. For those who have, that line conjures up so much rage, frustration, despair, cynicism and tragedy. It carries a lot of weight.<br/><br/>Neo-noir films are rarely happy affairs (the word noir even means black in French), but this film goes the extra mile. Back in 1974, the neo-noir film was rare. Traditional noir films had not been popular for some several decades, and even those were limited were the Hays Code and the culture of the time. This was a new animal altogether, and so as the film gets darker and the situation more disturbing, you end up feeling as revolted as Jack by the end. When the last night falls and you see the lights of Chinatown for the first time, you feel like you've come the end of an exhilarating, hideous, psychotic day and want it all to be swept away.<br/><br/>A lot of influences went into this film. There were old school noir influences, of course, but there were also influences from the then-cutting edge crime films of the day, as well as the psychological thrillers that had started to proliferate in the late 60's and early 70's. There are also literary influences; I was surprised to learn this was not based off a novel. It is very much a novelist's film.<br/><br/>But the most startling influence is that of Westerns. This works in two ways. First, the film takes place close to the turn of the century, a time not too far away from the settings of Westerns. The dark, cynical Westerns this film is most like took place in the 1880's, in the twilight of the West, after the land had been tamed. Second, the noir film had- at least from an American perspective- grown out of the Western: many of the same ideas, concepts, and perspectives are present. The noir was 'replaced' by the second wave of Westerns that came up during the 50s and 60's: Sergio Leone and like. In the 70's, the Western was in a Golden Age. Heaven's Gate had not yet come out. The genre was booming. America still had use for it, particularly in an era when we as a people were feeling rather lost and alone. Chinatown is neo-noir springing up from the second wave of Westerns, just like that second wave sprang up from original noir flicks.<br/><br/>The characters and acting in this film are first class, and despite some strange choices here and there, the plot pulls you in deeper into its black heart. This is a mystery in the truest sense of the word. There are so many layers to pull back in the seedy L.A. streets, so many secrets to carve out. The titular Chinatown is used to great effect, first as an idea, then as a place. The characters, particularly Nicolson, are perfectly cast.<br/><br/>This is a film that puts its competition to shame. It digs its claws into you and doesn't take them out. It's a definite must-watch."

Intrigued, Gittes investigates further. Then Mr Mulwray turns up dead...<br/><br/>A clever, slow-burning thriller from director Roman Polanski. Information is gained slowly, heightening the intrigue.

The movie loses momentum in the last third or so, focusing on a lesser plot and amplifying the detour by an extended wild goosechase. Ultimately this sub-plot is necessary, to an extent, but it needn't have had so much time devoted to it. Just when the movie was ready to kick up a gear, having idled along previously, it went sideways rather than forward."

I learned about a few of the ways they took the advancement in technology in the 70's and used it in this movie, it all fit the time period though very well, like nothing to fancy all of it was just right. For example one of the techniques was using a hand-held camera to really get in on tight spots so you could feel as if you were with the characters as they experienced some moment. The acting by Faye Dunaway and Jack Nicholson was really great and the chemistry they had on screen was flawless. And the movie was supposed to take place in the thirties so you'd think they wanted to go artistic and make it black and white, but the color looked really good and suited the movie just fine. A really good movie overall."
"Cd1083","10","2","3","12 May 2015"," To tell you the truth, I lied a little.
","Film Noir is my favorite genre and I'm ashamed to admit that until now I have never seen Chinatown. The fact that it's not technically a Film-Noir and more accurately defined a Neo-Noir is irrelevant because had this exact film been released in 1954 instead of 1974 nobody would have argued its classifications. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed Chinatown. Jack Nicholson did an excellent job playing Jake Gittes and got me vested in a story that could have bored me to tears if not executed just right. Too many melodramas rely so much on their characters being over the top that they neglect to give them depth and make them interesting and make the audience care about the same things they care about. This is where Chinatown really succeeds. The dialog was overdone and outside of the remembered film closure, unforgettable, however the characters throughout make this film legendary.<br/><br/>Visually, Chinatown looks amazing. It doesn't physically look like your prototypical noir film because there are so many bright scenes, but the mood is there even when the contrast is not. The lighting does not prevent this film from feeling dark throughout.<br/><br/>Upon the film's conclusion, my first thought was that I needed to watch it again. I know I missed subtleties and that my first viewing was only a primer to prepare myself for the second go around. It's easy to see why Chinatown is always on best films of all-time lists. It doesn't disappoint."

","A neo noir classic set in the 1940s, Jack Nicholson delivers a great performance as a detective that is out to solve a murder that could possibly be a suicide. Just like other Polanski films the scenes are a tad long and go into great depth however i believe that this only add more tension to the film leaving the audience begging for more. The film is very minimal as far as sex or violence goes, this i feel is refreshing and cannot be said for many contemporary titles currently being turned out. This film portrays a 1940's LA like no other with a killer jazz soundtrack to back it up.<br/><br/>All in all the film deliver a great story, acted out by an all star case with a very cool washed out 40's vibe to accompany it all."
"sandnair87","9","2","3","4 May 2015"," Roman Polanski's Caustic Neo-Noir is So Compelling that ""You Can't Forget It""!
","It's Los Angeles, 1937. Jack Nicholson's private detective Jake J. Gittes is not a primal masculine archetype, but rather a complicated protagonist. Far from cool and collected, he is simply self- possessed, with a sense of control that's highly illusory and much of the film pivots on undercutting his misplaced self-confidence. The film immediately establishes his less-than-ideal persona via his work snapping pictures of adulterous spouses, a lowbrow form of detective work that is typically beneath the more admirable private eyes. He's looked down on by the law and treated as something of a sordid but necessary evil by his clients, but Jake realizes that's just how the game is played. Soon enough, though, one of those clients, a mysterious woman named Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray finds a way to use Jake's scurrilous reputation to set him up for a fall. His ensuing attempts to clear his name put him on the trail of a case that's bigger, more complex and wide-ranging than anything he's used to, coming up with more rot than he bargained for. One that goes, as they say, all the way to the top!<br/><br/>A convoluted mystery that begins with a visit from a femme-fatale, an ironclad cynical detective with a code of honor, and a spider- like villain weaving a web at the center of the story are all familiar elements of a hard-boiled detective film. But trust Roman Polanski to make disillusionment seductive and resurrect the almost dead format! What he does so brilliantly in Chinatown is import the soul-sick paranoia of 1930s Los Angeles into its depiction: the eponymous Chinatown is less of a physical presence than a state of mind - it's a lurid fantasy, an idea that hovers constantly around the fringes of the movie making it an ultimately intangible maelstrom of deceit, regret and confusion in which the only thing you can be sure of is that everything you know is - to one degree or another - wrong. Robert Towne's labyrinthine script keeps the proceedings thrilling, humorous and disturbing at the same time, pepped up greatly by the crackling dialogues.<br/><br/>The film also boasts career best turns from its star-cast led by Jack Nicholson, who is absolutely charismatic as Jake Gittes, as we find ourselves solve the mystery alongside him as he follows lead after lead through a labyrinth of sticky situations. His Gittes is a layered character and Nicholson makes his depth visible to the audience. Faye Dunaway's vulnerability constantly tempts us with the notion that she is the victim, rather than the villain, in a performance that still has the power to shock. Outright villainy is instead embodied by Noah Cross, an incredibly vile portrayal by John Huston. He gives Noah a false air of courtly manners that, if anything, only adds to the character's sense of debauchery.<br/><br/>Notoriously bleak, yet utterly compelling, Chinatown remains a magnificent dissection of corruption right up to its enigmatic finale. The brute force of its ugly truth is the heart of the film's artistry, and it sticks with us. And it might be just a state of mind, but Chinatown still retains the power to bruise and scar to this day."

","Roman Polanski's decision to take on the film noir genre after it had given birth to so many timeless classics was a bold choice. He was diving in to a deep sea of talent and ingenuity decades after the grandmasters of film had sold their souls to Satan for the black magic necessary to take the limited and restrictive technology available at the time and make the delicious oreo visuals that made great films even greater despite something like technicolor visuals still being the fever dream of a schizophrenic whisper. But despite the Vesuvian challenge lain out before them, the people responsible for Chinatown managed to make a film so great that there's no doubt in my mind it could go toe to toe with any of the classics and end up absolutely busting its sorry face. I'm talking a good old fashioned jaw- ripping, tooth necklace making face busting. That is to say if Chinatown were faced with a ""Two films enter, one film leaves"" type situation, my money's on Chinatown.<br/><br/>First of all, you cannot deny that Chinatown's screenplay is absolutely immaculate. It's a known fact that when da Vinci painted The Last Supper, he had looked into the future and found his inspiration in Chinatown. By the time I reached the credits I couldn't even handle how totally and completely impressed I was by how excellent the story had been. The events were so cinematic, yet it never stopped being believable for a single solitary moment. This was a story that spent the film's entire 130 minute runtime twisting and gnarling into an incredible mystery. It was like a political thriller mixed with a horror movie. J.J. Gitties was sent through a labyrinth of despair. The man was so broken and beaten when the credits started rolling, if he was a real person I wouldn't be surprised at all to hear he had collaspsed and died from the mental exhaustion. This brings me to the ending. I wouldn't even hesitate to say this film has the best ending in the history of film. It's so satisfyingly tragic I felt like all my emotions had been emulsified into a gray caustic sludge and tossed into the ocean. The look on Jack Nicholson's face when Walsh tells him ""Forget it Jake, it's Chinatown."" is going to be burned into my mind forever. I thought his performance in Cuckoo's Nest was amazing, but he was just perfect in this role. This movie is the juice. The juicy juice."

","***User reviewer Sergio_Falco (""What to say?"", Sergio_Falco from Australia, May 2012) has an interesting commentary that mentions the layers of evil. Mr Ghostface (""A wonderful, classic film"", Mr Ghostface from London, England, 8 October 1999) has good background info.***<br/><br/>Chinatown (1974, Roman Polanski), a homage to Film noir, is one of the world's great film treasures. Many reviewers describe it as one of the elite film noirs. (I would disqualify it for not belonging to the genre well enough.) ""Chinatown"" is often used as curriculum in film schools. This is high art, and is particularly great fun to view it on the big screen when the opportunity exists.<br/><br/>Robert Towne is credited with the original screenplay. Although it was inspired by the water wars that occurred in LA in the early twentieth century, it is set decades later (1937). The director, Roman Polanski, changed Towne's desired ending. The plot meanders and has holes, but there isn't a dull scene. The entire cast functions very well. Polanski makes a director's cameo that rivals any other. The supporting characters fit in effortlessly. (My favorite is John Hillerman as Yelburton.)<br/><br/>The principal three characters are all at a high level. I am fond of Faye Dunaway as Evelyn Mulray; same with John Houston as Noah Cross. However, Jack Nicholson is masterful as J. J. Gittes. Towne wrote the screenplay for Nicholson, and Gittes appears in every scene. Nicholson's Gittes is a smart, acerbic, dogged private investigator who breaks rules without hesitation while making his share of blunders. He is also a magnet (i.e., almost always the center of attention). <br/><br/>The acid-tongued Gittes is haunted by an event that is never revealed to the audience. It occurred when he was a beat cop in Chinatown. While Gittes is irked with civil servants generally (e.g., the man at the Hall of Records), he has obvious contempt for his former police colleagues. There seems to be a connection between the intensity of Gittes's loathing of each cop with that character's contribution to the conclusion. So, there's no need for us to know what happened in Chinatown previously because it is the same destination as the future.<br/><br/>Personally, I can't respect Towne's decision to have Gittes slapping Evelyn around before she reveals her secret. I don't think it is very challenging for a filmmaker to show a stronger man beating up a woman. On an unrelated note, it is also kind of hilarious to imagine people nonchalantly smoking everywhere in 1937, including government offices. <br/><br/>(BTW, ""Chinatown"" repeats the phrase, ""as little as possible."" This is in response to the question, ""what did you do there?"" This line can be explained by making what today is likely construed as a racist statement: A white policeman working Chinatown will find the locals so inscrutable it is impossible to know whether law enforcement is causing or preventing a crime. So, the beat cops do the least amount of policing that is required of them.)<br/><br/>Above all else, ""Chinatown"" is dazzling because of Polanski's vision. He uses the entire frame, and is conveying point of view. (My favorite image is probably the final one of Yelburton; Gittes suggests he is due for a great future and it appears the reverse is in store.) Polanski is expert level at varying the size and position of Gittes, while employing a very precise focal length. (It is worth noticing when the background is blurry.) <br/><br/>Polanski also employs a visual leitmotif. He frequently shoots Gittes from the back while Gittes is spying on someone else. The frequency of watching Gittes from behind, with Gittes seemingly making no effort to be discrete, makes the audience feel like a voyeur. Considering the film's pivotal surprise, the voyeur feeling takes us closer to experiencing the sordid details.<br/><br/>""Chinatown"" is too good to miss. Cinephiles are encouraged to head over to the nearest revival theater to see it again, steering clear of whatever diminutive, maniacal, switchblade-bearing directors that are encountered."
"PWNYCNY","10","2","3","7 May 2014"," There is no justice.
","Chinatown is an excellent movie. It earned eleven Academy Award nominations and is still discussed almost with reverence decades after its initial release. Such acclaim gives cause to comment on the person most popularly associated with creating the movie – the director, Roman Polanski. Polanski is a controversial figure. But then, the same can also be said for the character in Chinatown, Noah Cross. In the movie Cross, a sexual deviant and predator, and someone who is obviously troubled and disturbed, goes unpunished. That an injustice has occurred is undeniable. Even the hard-boiled detective in the movie who investigates Cross is shocked. The theme: there is no justice."

","An LA p.i. gets caught up with a spider woman and a land stealing scheme that uses water diversion during a drought.<br/><br/>In short, the movie's the best noir since the genre's golden age. From muted colors to shaded performances to uncompromised ending, the movie's a worthy successor to the 40's classics. And that's despite the 130-minute length, twice the average. Plus, director Polanski doesn't have to meet Code requirements that compromised many a 40's feature. Thus, we get an ending that befits the general storyline, no matter how much of a downer it is for the audience.<br/><br/>Note that amidst a prevaricating world, Nicholson's J.J. Gittes is no noble truth-seeker in the manner of a Marlowe or a Spade. Instead, he's in it strictly for the money. So when he's trapped in the spider woman's (Dunaway) little web of deceit, it's hard to feel sympathy. In fact, Gittes is neither very likable in personality, methods or ethics. Thus, it's a tribute to screenwriter Towne that we stay involved with the storyline, despite the general absence of anybody to identify with. Then too, the plot is not so much a mystery or whodunit as it is a web of intrigue leading to someone or somewhere. That central referent of 'Chinatown' remains something of a puzzler. I interpret it as a place where bad things are done in the name of the good while everyone ignores the discrepancy. Thus, the ironical ending.<br/><br/>Anyhow, the movie's a first-rate noir that makes a lasting impression, and as an LA resident I'm reminded to check my lawn. I think it needs water."

","Robert Townes scripts probably the finest ever screenplay to emerge from Hollywood, once again reaffirming America's choke hold on the summit of film. An unforgettable narrative achievement that gives us something different every time we have the pleasure of sitting down and re-watch Roman Polanski's (Rosemary's Baby) seminal noir pastiche to the 30's made popular by the like of the Maltese Falcon, but still in its own rights; Polanski architects a detective film masterpiece. It was even placed 3rd greatest screenplay of all time, by the Writers Guild of America (WGA) amongst such titles as Casablanca, The Godfather and Anne Hall, which arguably I feel is the greatest of them all. Starring Jack Nicholson in what I believe to be a career defining performance, even surpassing his Oscar winning exploits with One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest and even his ever chilling performance in The Shining. Chinatown starts off as just another mundane detective TV drama, as a distraught wife; appear in Jake Gittes office requesting a private eye to solidify her suspicions of her husband's infidelity.<br/><br/>But just like in life, nothing is ever what it seems, and just like life, Chinatown is as unpredictable as the English weather, as from that moment in the office, we suddenly swept up in a whirlwind of excitement, tensions, laughs and shocks; as we find ourselves in a ever engulfing circle, consisting of millionaire corruption, murder, sheep, farmers. But when you thought that was it we sprinkled in some incest and water scandals for good measure. As we are placed side by side with Jake on his roller coaster ride through kicks to the head, cuts to the nose and a steamy love affair with a woman Fane Dunaway also from Bonnie and Clyde) who may just be the key to his eventual downfall, helping in laying down the foundation to one of the most ironic ends in film history. <br/><br/>They said Michelangelo had a hard time painting the sixteenth carpel in a lifetime; imagine trying to keep a piece of art like Chinatown in a review of 500 words or less, now that is a miracle. Because Chinatown is a magnificent cinematic and technical achievement that may never again be rivalled in American cinema. The film is so good, I feel that it should be compulsive watching in all film schools for all young writers and directors with dreams of a career in the film – actually better yet forget film school, just sit at home and watch Chinatown, that's the only film education you really need. So don't be a feel, stay out of school and watch Chinatown."

"Lejink","8","2","3","1 December 2012"," Jack and kill
","I have to confess I absolutely hate Jack Nicholson as an actor. Everyone has their bÃªte- noire I suppose and he's mine, I just see him overacting in everything instead of acting. That goes for ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", ""The Shining"", ""The Departed"", you name it, for me he ruins it. All that is, except this. <br/><br/>In Roman Polanski's superb revision of the 40's 'tec thriller, Nicholson is, and I really hate to say it, believe me, nothing short of brilliant. His character is a workaday private investigator, small-fry, but smart and persistent and Nicholson has you following in Jake Gittes every step from the first, which of course is director Polanski's methodology here, to draw in the viewer and hand us the problem, almost at first-hand, of trying to solve the labyrinthine plot, which gets deeper and darker as it progresses.<br/><br/>Of course there has to be a femme fatale and here Faye Dunaway is entrusted the Mary Astor/Lauren Bacall role. However I wasn't completely convinced by her, for me she lacked the sexy allure and depths of mystery the part demands. Thus it was that at the famous expository ""Mother! Sister!"" scene, I almost burst out laughing at the fake sincerity (or should that be sincere fakery?) she employs. It was John Huston who got the acting Oscar in the movie, well deserved for his sleazy portrayal of the monstrous megalomaniacal father to Dunaway.<br/><br/>Polanski's stylish direction is pace-perfect, unhurriedly but assuredly unfolding and then folding in again the action. The cinematography and depiction of the age couldn't be more accurate at least to these eyes and ears while the rhythmic vernacular of the dialogue is a pleasure to hear. By the time the movie reaches its bloody, tragic, but inevitable climax, you feel like one of the bystanders shooed away by the police at the end, so close have you been to the action.<br/><br/>At one point Gittes asks the question ""How do you like them apples?"" I liked them fine, just fine."

This is also the film that gave Jack Nicholson a long career in the movie business.<br/><br/>This film is pretty much a private detective who thinks he is investigating with an adultery case.

Jack Nicholson gives a tour-de-force performance as private eye J.J. Gittes who literally sticks his nose where it doesn't belong. As we are given a tour around the historic sites of the City of Angels, Nicholson falls into a quagmire of deception, devastating betrayal, and corporate politics involving the Department of Water and Power. Faye Dunaway gives one of her last great performances as the late chief engineer's wife Evelyn Mulwray with a secret that would lead to the film's shocking twist. The legendary actor/director John Huston is an unforgettable screen presence as Noah Cross, the unscrupulous man behind Water and Power.

"SeaHorseMafia","10","2","3","4 May 2012"," Everybody should see this.
","This is possibly my favorite movie of all time. It's no doubt the greatest neo-noir ever, and it's one of the best movies ever made. I have seen something like 10 times by now, and I can't find a single bad thing about it. Even though I have seen it many times, I still don't get the Chinamen joke... I'm going to talk about this is 4 segments, the performances/characters, direction/mood/atmosphere, script and last words kinda thing.<br/><br/>The performances: Jack Nicholson plays the main character, J.J ""Jake"" Gittes. He's a private detective, who's very nosy, most of people hate him and he's a rising star. He's acts like he's somebody important, he wears nice clothes, he tries to be polite, but he still has a short temper, tells bad jokes, is quite rude and isn't that smart neither. You know private detectives in the past like Phillip Marlowe and Sam Spade. While those guys were smart and witty, Gittes is not. Don't get me wrong, he's street-smart, he's knows a lot of people and knows how to get out of trouble. But let's look at the barber scene. In this scene, a banker starts to criticism his work. Marlowe would probably talk his way out of this, but Gittes wants to fight the guy. That's kinda funny as well. While he probably has some anger issues, Nicholson is still so goddamn cool. Not Alain Delon cool, but you wouldn't fck with him. The character is written pretty seriously, but Nicholson brings some comedy in to his character, making him more human. Nicholson should have won an Oscar IMO, but I will talk about that more later...<br/><br/>Faye Dunaway plays the biggest supporting character, Evelyn Mulwray. She is the film's femme fatale. The sexy, upper-class dame who has a secret. In her case a very, very, very disturbing secret. Don't worry, I won't spoil it. She is pretty amazing as well. She acts a lot of the time cool and elegant, but Gitter makes her nervous and uncomfortable. She seems lost a lot of the time, but trying to act like she's not. It's not like the moments you see her your thinking she has a deep dark secret, but you start to suspect that at some point. Also John Huston plays her father. And isn't just me or does Polanski really think elderly people are that scary and creepy. I mean look at his work, Rosemary's Baby, old people come off scare in that, same with The Tenant... Anyways, he's so damn good in this. Who can't love the sound of his voice! And he comes off as a good guy at first and he's acts like he's the good guy all the way through.<br/><br/>Direction/mood/atmosphere. It's directed by Roman Polanski, one of my favorite directors ever. This is one of his darkest films and also one of his most atmospheric. The way he directs this is with a reasonable slow pace, a lot of classic film-noir mood and he keeps you guessing all the way through. He puts the camera behind Gittes, so what he sees, we see. Gittes never knows more than we do and we never know more than he does. Also there is a touch desperation and fatalism in this. You know that this sin't going to end well, it's just so dark movie. I think Polanski wanted to create that classic film-noir feel and shatter it with the films themes (which I'm don't want to say, because I would spoiling a lot). And BTW, he makes a cameo in this, he's the guy who cuts Gitte's nose open.<br/><br/>Script. This was written by Robert Town. IMO, this is the greatest screenplay ever. It's complex, but subtle, keeps you guessing and doesn't disappoint you and it has great characters. Really it has everything, a great script needs. And his dialog is so wonderful. I think Chinatown is one of the best mysteries ever. And it's very unconventional noir, because it's not as simple as something the Maltese Falcon (which I love). It's not a case of a missing statue, it has something to do with water and corruption. What other noir has dealt with water and corruption other than Chinatown? The greatest screenplay ever, IMO.<br/><br/>To sum it up or last words or what ever you want to call this. This is a movie about a mood and atmosphere. When you want to watch a cool movie, look no further. It my favorite movie, but it would probably be tied with Badlands (Malick, 1973). But I would say this is technically a better film.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Sergio_Falco","10","2","3","4 May 2012"," What to say?
","Is there much to say about Chinatown that hasn't already been said? The screenplay is brilliant, the casting and performances are superlative. The art direction, costumes, style, and feel of the visuals are impeccable. The new blu ray release has a great commentary by Robert Towne and David Fincher, and if you're a fan of the film, this is a must. A few thoughts were provoked from this commentary. Firstly, it's interesting just how many times the camera is behind Jack Nicholson's shoulder, forming a not-quite-POV shot, and allowing the audience a voyeuristic entrance into many of the scenes and physical spaces. It's also intriguing how there are three levels of crime in the film; the major crime of the land grab and the rape of the valley; the personal crime committed by Noah Cross on his daughter; and a third level, which is in a sense a 'crime' committed by Jake Gittes. The Oedipus myth is much discussed when it comes to detective stories, and as Towne readily admits in the commentary, it plays a part in Chinatown. Gittes has tried to help a woman in his past and only ended up hurting her. Throughout Chinatown, he hunts for the solution to the mystery, hunts for the villain, confident in his ability to ultimately triumph. But this near hubris on his part will finally lead to the death of yet another woman he tried to help. If he had just stayed out of it, just tried to do as little as possible, then maybe she would have been saved. In a sense, the criminal he is looking for is ultimately revealed to be Jake himself... To work this level of complexity into a screenplay, and yet to make it unfold in such a way that everything is clearly understandable as you watch it, is true mastery of the art of screen writing and film-making."

"freemantle_uk","10","2","3","21 February 2012"," A classic thriller
","Chinatown is easily recognised as a classic film, being one of Jack Nicholson and Roman Polanski's best films. This film came from a golden age of American age and can easily hold it's own against other classics from that period.<br/><br/>Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a private investigator in 1930s Los Angeles in the middle of a drought. He is hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Diane Ladd) to follow her husband, the Chief Engineer of the city's Power and Water Department, who she suspects is having an affair. Gittes photographs with a young woman it gets leaked to the press. But the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) shows up in Gittes' office, threatening to sue him. Soon Gittes is thrown into a big mystery when Mr. Mulwray is found dead and Gittes uncovers a web involving the water department, real estate deals, political corruption and a dirty family secret.<br/><br/>Chinatown has a film noir visual, style and storytelling but does not suffer the restrictions that though films had to go through. Robert Towne was deserving of his Oscar win for Best Screenplay, delivering a complex story, real characters and combined with the acting and subtle direction makes for a very compelling thriller. Polanski keeps the film going at a fast pace and it also feels episodic because of the way the narrative shows how Gittes solves the mystery and uncovers clubs. It could have worked as a TV miniseries, but of course it is a great film anyway. This is a film that is allowed to be a more darker with it storytelling, the type of story it can tell (particularly with the twist) and be able to show more violence.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent, Nicholson is great playing a sleazy anti-hero who has a charm about him, willing to use underhand methods but still at heart not evil, a man with some morals and just wants to get his job done. Dunaway starts off as a confidence woman, who personae is slowly eroded as more of her past is revealed, starting with her change of personality because of the mention of her father. John Huston has a real sense of menace every time of he was on screen.<br/><br/>Chinatown is a glorious looking film, from the cars, to the art direction and to the costumes. The simple score by Jerry Goldsmith is able to soak you into the story and everything had the feel of film noir, but with the twist of being alike a 70s thriller. It is a perfect blend.<br/><br/>Chinatown is an essential film, a well made thriller that should please fans of 70s cinema."
"seanwilson556","10","2","3","2 January 2012"," Film Noir wishes it was like Chinatown
","Every now and then there are some truly perfect films that shine with every scene, every action, line, camera shot... Chinatown is one of them. Wonderfully directed by Roman Polanski showing us the brightly lit but disturbing look at late 30's Los Angeles.<br/><br/>One of the greatest performances of all time goes to Jack Nicholson as private investigator Jake Gittes. Think of him as a more laid back Philip Marlowe from the Raymond Chandler books. Nicholson appears in every scene of the film and oozes with intensity and suaveness. Words cannot describe how amazing he is in the film. But it isn't just a Jack Nicholson vehicle. Noteworthy supporting performances include the wonderful Faye Dunaway as Evelyn Mulwray; an incredible femme fatale and film noir innovator John Huston as Noah Cross who is one right evil bastard and also Perry Lopez as Lieutenant Escobar is terrific.<br/><br/>One can't just say the performances made Chinatown legendary without mentioning the outstanding cinematography and view of Los Angeles. Never have I seen such a hauntingly beautiful look at L.A. Some films have done it (Lynch's Mulholland Drive, Wilder's Sunset Blvd...) but Chinatown's look and feel really delves you into 1937 and doesn't stop for over two hours.<br/><br/>It's a hard-boiled, dark detective story featuring Oscar-worthy performances, splendid direction and an ending 40's and 50's film noirs wouldn't dream off. Prepare for a bleak but amazing work of art."
"Red_Identity","Null","2","3","31 October 2011"," Very impressive
","So I finally watched one of the most iconic films ever made. The mystery and suspense in Chinatown is fully-blown as a neo-noir film. It perfectly captures the time period in which it takes place, and its central story is very well-written. The performances are fantastic, the highlight being Faye Dunaway, whose only other performance I have seen is Network and she plays both characters with such precise distinction and force. The cinematography, art direction, and music give it the right mood as well, and the ending is quite brilliant, in fact, perfect. Overall, I don't know if I would say I loved it, but this is a film I can see revisiting in the future no doubt about it."

","Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown. One of the most iconic lines in cinematic history can be found in Roman Polanski's 1974 masterpiece Chinatown.<br/><br/>Chinatown is almost the perfect movie. The direction is outstanding. Polanski knows how to tell a story as good as anyone. The perfect camera angles and the perfect shots are taken as we take a dive in two the mind of J.J. Gittes a private detective who reiterates that he makes a fair living. He is masterfully played by none other that Jack Nicholson who gives one of his best performance that can be ranked alongside his performances in 'The Shining' and 'Cuckoo's Nest' Nicholson gives a very controlled performance. There is no unnecessary shouting or going over the top. He begins to uncover a terrible plot over in L.A. that involves the water department,incest,adultery and Chinatown. Robert Towne wrote this script in the traditional noir way with voice-over and the like but Polanski eliminated all the voice-over so the audience would uncover the mystery as Gittes would and was that a good decision. The movie is an absorbing 2 hour experience as you get completely lost as the plot unravels and more of the mystery unfolds. It is tremendously quotable movie. It has a noir touch to it that is obvious from the overture but the touch is so light that the movie simply floats on this delightful little script. Recently the movie was named on a list of the seven films to see before you die. Well I generally disagree with such lists because it's the apples over oranges thing isn't it. But Chinatown is a brilliant film. The ending is so powerful that it can knock most films out of the water with just that. It leaves you feeling frightened, challenged and with so many questions that you can debate about it for hours on end. And that is what Art really should accomplish. It should encourage discussion and that is what Chinatown does. You can call the movie anything you want but it sure as hell is a piece of art."

","OK everyone, this film is definitely in my top 5 favorite movies ever made, and for many reasons. To begin with, the storyline of this film is absolutely genius (although very complex as well). Which is why writer Robert Towne deservedly won an Oscar for it. The director Roman Polanski did a magnificent job on this film, which is why he got nominated for an Oscar. Jack Nicholson is perfect as the private eye, JJ Gittes, this is definitely one of his greatest roles in his whole career, he also got nominated for an Oscar. Faye Dunaway did an incredible job as well as the mysterious, Evelyn Mulwray, she also got nominated for an Oscar. And finally, the hauntingly beautiful music by Jerry Goldsmith, which is my favorite composer ever, and, he also got nominated for an Oscar. The only reason I did not give this film a ten was because of the length of the film, and it is very difficult to give a movie a ten, but other then that, this film is perfect."
"badgernmole","10","2","3","7 June 2009"," Utter brilliance
","Now my top 5 would consist of godfather 2 and pulp fiction with city of god sneaking in there....<br/><br/>But Chinatown is definitely my favourite movie ever... And not because its the best. I watched it when I was eight and it was my dads first DVD. I sat there secretly in the living room as this layed back Jack Nicholson came on to the screen with pictures of a act of sex soon to follow. <br/><br/>I was encapsulated by the sleek way in which he deals with the matter and proceed's with his life until the story unfolds.<br/><br/>It moves slowly at first mainly focusing on Jake and his relationship with clients and his work colleagues and the manor in which he investigates crimes... It has slow dynamic music which lulls you into a relaxed state. So when the first twists come to you its a kind of shock... The mood gets more pacey and pacey dynamically showing the pace in which Jake now has to move.<br/><br/>It pivots on not having complete control only getting half answers. Running after the truth as it smiles back at you. The movie then moves onto the main crime of incest in which Jake ( now so enthralled with the affairs of his clients) takes personal action. <br/><br/>The police follow him with a un-nerving hand of justice. You will Jake on as he tries desperately to get round them every trick he has every favour he tries to pull to get them out. But the police are just to quick and the final scene closes with a unbearable scene of Jake desperately trying to say the truth but the words cant come out fast enough...<br/><br/>He just isn't that smooth. And with being chained to a car has no way of stopping the shocking final act.<br/><br/>It is a movie which is extremely depressing because you have loved these people to just have the cold ""Thats Chinatown"" but in front of you.. The bitter truth of prejudice and class. <br/><br/>This will always be number 1 on my list for personal reasons but it is a superb tour De force that EVERYONE must see..."
"HorrorFan112490","10","2","3","1 April 2009"," Pure Cinema
","Chinatown is a masterpiece...plain and simple. It is a one of a kind film that is without flaw. I'm sure some would argue with me, but in my honest opinion it is a perfect work of art. The direction by master-class helmsman Roman Polanski is incredible, creating demanding images and performances by those involved. Jack Nicholson as the against-type private detective Jake J. Gittes depicts a hero that none have seen before or after. Faye Dunaway is in an unrivaled performance as Evelyn Mulwray, a mysterious beauty who hides a lot more than she can handle. Really, though, John Huston manages to become a scene-stealer as the vile aristocrat Noah Cross, who creates a villain so memorable, it puts so many to shame. The story by Robert Towne is crafted with great precision and pacing, using the water scandal of Los Angeles in the 1910's and 20's as a backdrop to the main story. Gittes is approached by a woman claiming to be Evelyn Mulwray (Diane Ladd) and asks him to investigate her husband, Hollis Mulwray, the city's chief engineer of the water department. After a bit of small sleuthing and following Mulwray, he catches him with a blonde and the photographs he's taken become a treasure for the press. In steps the real Evelyn Mulwray (Dunaway), who threatens to sue Gittes for his investigation into her husband, which she didn't warrant. Unfortunately several days later, Hollis is found dead in the reservoir and thus begins the investigation as to who framed him and killed Hollis Mulwray. Usually in the hands of any other director or writer, this could've turned into a run-of-the-mill whodunit, but Towne's scripts adds so many unexpected twists and turns throughout the story, leading the audience to unexpected places. Evelyn's shocking revelation is just one of the great surprises that bombards the viewer. The thing that really brings the film together, though, is the ending. Towne had something much more upbeat in mind, but Polanski, who had gone through a great trauma 5 years before the film's production, decided a more human ending was necessary, which makes the film so much greater. ""Forget it Jake, it's Chinatown,"" will ring in the viewers ears even after the credits have rolled. Ah, I almost forgot to mention Jerry Goldsmith's score, which brings the film a great atmosphere, much akin to that of The Maltese Falcon, another great crime-noir (which was directed by John Huston.). In concluding I say that Chinatown is pure cinema. And I mean PURE CINEMA. You just can't get any better with Chinatown."
"jakespick","10","2","3","26 February 2009"," Noir Transcending Noir: Chinatown Review
","The title of this review was inspired by a previous comment by Jason Berkley. I believe the phrase ""noir transcending noir"" is the perfect way to describe a film like this.<br/><br/>So rarely does a film come along like Chinatown. A seemingly mainstream, yet utterly cult-like tale of the mystical human psyche. Yes, of course, when you hear those words you immediately think of the Ridley Scott film Blade Runner. Both that and this film, to me, are very close in relation. They both are films of perfection, while Chinatown captures the pure essence of a very strange time, and in that you can only do so by caging the audience's ability to have open opinion. This film gives no room for anything of that manner. Chinatown catches something very humane that hasn't been perfected yet - the ""robot"" side of man. This film tells the story of real humans, and real men. A human isn't someone who is free, or truly happy with what they have, or what they'll be given - everyone is flawed, everything is flawed. Human's are robots - and robots are the true summation of what we describe as the human mind. It is said that us, as people, only use 10% of our true brain functions, abilities, and on and on. This is definitely true.<br/><br/>Examples of other films that ""get"" what I'm saying, are films like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Citizen Kane, The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Magnolia, Full Metal Jacket, The Deer Hunter, The Shining, Sunset Blvd. and Apocalypse Now. They all pick apart the human anatomy in such a way that is completely mystical - unashamedly mystical. Instead of explaining what is going on around the characters, or why, we are instead tricked into thinking we've missed something very important, and complex - when, really, we are just seeing a very descriptive and almost horrifying declination into what is really happening in the story. Movies like those which I've listed, have always given me hope for as far back as I can remember. They give me hope in film, however, on the other end of the spectrum, they frighten my deeply. Cinematically, they are astonishing and masterful - however, they are a bit too perfect. Instead of making you feel good, bad, sad, suspended, etcetera, they make you feel alone and truly helpless... as if you're watching a tragedy unfold before you, which you are.<br/><br/>The human mind doesn't expand, it condenses, alienates. We cannot stop this, unless we spend our entire life living as a different person, with a different family, and different friends, everyday... and we remember this and are aware of it. The human mind raises itself based on it's environment - therefor, instead of taking advantage of it's surroundings, it attempts to avoid complication by hiding behind it's surroundings thus causing confusion, which (I believe) is to be the main point of films like Chinatown or any of th others that I've listed. Then, comes the ending... of course. This, next to the beginning, is the most skeptical and the most pivotal point in the film....<br/><br/>...the ending line or action is the one that defines the film and it's purpose. For example, Apocalypse Now: ""the horror"" / Sunset Blvd: ""Okay, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my closeup..."" and on. This film's last words are so powerful, it seems like the entire film was revolving around those last 5 seconds - which it should. But truly, this film transcends it's own genre... in those last words, heard from the voice of Walsh, ""Forget it Jake -- it's Chinatown."""
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","2","3","25 December 2008"," More multifariously tricky, you die.
","This film is a masterpiece because it is nothing but what we expect and we expect something different at every single moment of it, so that we are disappointed and surprised and held breathless every fifteen minutes when one of our expectations goes down the chute. At first we think it is one more private eye's business or investigation in some kind of affair with some married man. But it does not fit at all with the professional dedication of the suspected unfaithful man. He is obviously looking for something fishy in the water supply of Los Angeles he is responsible for. But then he does meet with a girl, doesn't he after all. And yet there is something fishy in that water supply. So it might be a big embezzlement case. Let Los Angeles pay for the water they will never get and then let Los Angeles get to the water where it will be, and let them pay again. The point is it does not explain everything, and especially why the thieving contractor is so keen on getting the hooker his son in law was seeing. Too keen to be honest. Is she a hooker after all? And we go on doubting, hoping, being disappointed and never getting to the truth of the business. Who the killer really is? Who the police really work for? Who the police tries to protect and cover? Why do the police do that unprofessional act? There is just no good enough answer, and even at the end, when the tycoon contracting embezzler gets the last word we know we are off the point and losing all footing in too deep water. That's probably the best part of this film. You just have to accept the situation the way it is and do nothing just because some people are big enough, rich enough or powerful enough to do exactly what they want and everyone else has only one choice, die or say yes-sir-mister-master-sir-boss. Even killing his own child is not a no-go option for such a greedy person. Remember, change we can, but change these tycoons cannot. So better change them than expect them to change. Why not send them on a perpetual vacation in some desert island that has absolutely no connection with the outside world, But dummy, that's just the point, such a place does not exist. So better put them to death, put them to sleep or deep freeze them if you don't want to deep fry them, which stinks a little bit. But any other way will let them go on with their shaggy and dirty business. But gosh it reaps a lot of profit in.

","With the possible exception of CASABLANCA, this my all-time favorite movie. I am a big fan of the genre (Phillip Marlowe, Sam Spade . . . you get the idea).  Jake Gittes is a really great character and I couldn't imagine anyone else BUT Jack Nicholson playing him.  In fact, I couldn't imagine anyone else in the whole cast as their characters (including Polanski). CHINATOWN can hold its own along with such classics as THE BIG SLEEP, FAREWELL MY LOVELY (or MURDER MY SWEET) and THE MALTESE FALCON. I remember reading that writer Towne and director Polanski fought over the ending.  I'd have to say that Polanski, though still reeling from the murder of wife Sharon Tate, had the right idea.  I could not imagine this film having a happy ending.  It certainly wouldn't have been as memorable. I was surprised that John Huston wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his performance as evil incarnate. Noah Cross is truly one of the cinema's greatest villains.  As much as I like Art Carney, there is no way he should have won the Best Actor Oscar over Nicholson's work here.  At least the screenplay deservedly won.  Forget it, Jake . . ."

It's one of the few Hollywood detective stories that I not only can sit through but can watch several times.  My theory is that good detective movies come around about every 20-30 years. Think about it: Maltese Falcon 1941, Chinatown 1974 and LA Confidential 1997.  They all share great actors, great directors and great writers.

","There is always more to ""Chinatown"" than meets the eye on the first viewing. Like the proverbial onion, one discovers more and more as one peels the outer layers.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson was first-rate as a private eye, and Dunaway provided sufficient support for the acting to be termed ""memorable"". That is till you consider John Huston. He was absolutely magnificent in his portrayal of a crooked father. And with Polanski directing the film with his usual aplomb, it comes up real trumps.<br/><br/>The story is quite complex, but you never get the feeling that someone has gone over the board, as you often do with some of the other films of its genre. The tragic ending is chilling, and leaves you feeling vaguely bitter about our world. Nicholson's character makes you feel sad, but you never pity him. You might dislike Evelyn, but will never despise her.<br/><br/>Overall great cinema - timeless in its appeal (even if you miss the director's brief appearance as a toughie in a superbly shot scene). 9/10."

","Chinatown is undoubtedly one of the finest films to emerge from the 1970's, starring Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunnaway, Roman Polanski has delivered a Noir masterpiece for the ages. Detective Jake Gittes, played by Nicholson, is at a glance, your average private eye snoop. He's sneering, untrustworthy and his reputation in and around Los Angeles is much worse. LA is in the midst of a severe drought, and Gittes, during one of his daily endeavours, has uncovered sinister activity by the Department of Water & Power that has the company reaping unfair financial rewards at the cost of unsuspecting landowners. Then there is the mysterious wealthy socialite, Evelyn Mulwray, played by Faye Dunaway, that comes to Gittes for help, but never quite reveals the full length of her troubles. She's elusive, seductive and tangled up in Chinatowns puzzle more than what she's willing to own up to. The drought of course is public knowledge, but when the Boss of Water & Power turns up dead in a reservoir, the LA community soon learn that foul play runs far beyond the boardroom. One of Chinatown's charms is the audience never knows more than Gittes at that certain point. Our detective is never one step ahead, and neither is the audience. Chinatown is not only a noir mystery film, but it's a superior thriller that keeps the viewer deeply involved from the start, to its tragic end."

","""Chinatown"" is currently #42 in the IMDb rank list, and based on that I had expected it to be a great movie. While I found it good and interesting, to me it was nothing more than that. My rating is ""7"" of 10. I can think of a number of ""detective/whodunnit"" films that are much better.  Reading many user reviews, it seems that many give it bonus points for having an unexpected, and dark, ending. So, maybe if in ""Crossroads"" the Britney Spears character had fallen off the stage and died right before her first concert, then it too might have been one of the best of all time!?  I watch films to be entertained and for me a good, uplifting conclusion usually works. ""Chinatown"" does not have that, so for me it just becomes another uninteresting story, although a fictional one, about bad people getting their way.<br/><br/>I have always thought Jack Nicholson to be one of the better modern actors, and his performance here is one of his better ones. I don't normally like Dunnaway but I found her performance also to be very good. But Polanski never has been a favorite of mine and perhaps that's why I think ""Chinatown"" is closer to ordinary than great.<br/><br/>SPOILERS - don't read any further<br/><br/>The apparent affair with the young girl is just a red herring. She is in fact the daughter/sister of Dunnaway's character, a product of incest. Jake (Nicholson) is an innocent pawn, his investigation is there to divert attention and make it look like the husband is murdered for cause. In the end, the evil father (Huston) who also has the police in his hip pocket gets away with murder, and has his police pawn kill his own daughter. Long live corruption in Los Angeles."

","So, in my journey through the IMDb top 250 I think that outside of planet Ingmar Bergman I have never encountered a less engaging film than this one: it was truly hard to take on this film, which is different than actually hating it: it is just that I think a film should be more driven by audio-visual processes rather than dialogue: 2001: A Space Odyssey, for instance, is one of such films, another is Apocalypse Now, but this is not one of such films: it seems to last forever and the whole film feels like it was made in the 1930's.<br/><br/>Indeed, this Neo-Noir style of film making does not appeal to me. My grandma, though, would probably like this film. But young people (people under 35) of the Star Wars generation will probably not like this film very much. I recommend this film to those that love 1930's and 1940's flicks, such as Casablanca (which also did not impress me)."

","I was so glad to see that this great film of almost forty years ago is still being reviewed at the IMDb site. Great film critics have given this film its due credit over the years. I saw it when it first came out in 1974 and then again recently on a friend's home theater screen. And many times in between. Viewers should read what else they can about Chinatown to gain further insights to its mastery, but one of the great masterstrokes is the way the script weaves ""water"" into the film...and water is what the key crime is all about...the one Jake Gittes has to solve. Lack of water (an L.A. drought) is the setting; one of the characters is named Noah; water is the murder weapon; and water is characterized as the builder of a great city. Shaping a key image like this is just one of the ways this script excels. A great film."

"tpion","3","12","39","9 March 2006"," Chinatown = Two Thumbs Down
","The film Chinatown was made in 1974 and was directed by Roman Polanksi and written by Robert Towne. This movie was supposed to portray a crime thriller pact with action and adventure. Unfortunately I did not care for this movie all that much for a couple of reasons. One being that I thought that the movie was very drawn out and quite frankly I thought it was a little long. Jack Nicholson plays the main character J.J Gittes who is a private investigator who is usually hired to see if the spouse is cheating on another. I thought that he did fine job acting but I felt as if I knew almost every curve or bend that was around the corner. <br/><br/>From the start of the movie you could almost tell it was going to be a Hollywood type movie. It seems like the classic movie where the chump guy falls for the hot girl and believes her little sob story, when all in all it comes back to her in the end. Evelyn Mulwray who was played by Faye Dunaway kept on giving Mr. Gittes false information or would make up another story until she had him believing her in the end. J.J. who is suppose to be a good private eye never really fully comprehends what is going on until Evelyn tells him about her daughter/sister that she has. After being given the run around one to many times Mr. Gittes goes over to the house where Evelyn was holding the child and confronts her. He gets so impatient and frustrated that he slapped Evelyn until she spit out the truth to him. We then come to find out that she was raped as a little girl by her father and have become pregnant and birthed a girl and that girl was the one upstairs in the house. Evelyn was trying to hide her from her dreaded father who wanted to have the child to himself. Out of all the movies that I've see with Jack Nicholson I would have to say that this would rank among one of the weakest thrillers to date. Though I think that it being a classic it is a must see for someone who really wants to get a background of films done in the 70's and how they broke the trend that most movies were being filmed and because of that we have the type of movies we have today."

"highkite","10","4","10","19 June 2006"," An unforgettable masterpiece
","Though in my opinion ""Chinatown"" deserved both director and picture Oscars over ""Godfather II,"" the movie still remains one of the most memorable and cinematic movies ever created. Director Roman Polanski (who makes a cameo in the movie as a short mobster who cuts Jack Nicholson's nose) creates a film noir so tense and so brilliant, that it makes any 70s detective drama pale in comparison. ""Chinatown"" paved way for a tremendous respect for Roman Polanski, Faye Dunaway and Jack Nicholson.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in the 1940s where detectives and private investigators were the biggest thing. Jack Nicholson plays Jake Gittes (pronounced Git-teas) who takes on a job for a woman by the name of Mrs. Mulwray. The job is to find out if her husband is cheating on her. As Gittes spies on her husband he soon realizes that there is much more to the story than just an affair as he finds Mr. Mulwray dead and Mrs. Mulwray is not really his wife. Faye Dunaway shows up as Mr. Mulwray's real wife, Evelyn Mulwray, in one of the best femme fatale characters ever put on the screen. Gittes soon finds himself in a mayhem of murder, betrayal, incest, and greed while uncovering Mr. Mulwray's suspicious death in a backtrack of a place in Los Angeles called Chinatown.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski beautifully directs this film to portray the character of Gittes as both ambitious, charming and unafraid. He designs an ongoing feud between the law and criminals to show the life in the '40s. Showing just how brilliantly creepy a storyline can turn out, Polanski sways us into a subtle affair of wrongdoings by carefully illustrating a step-by-step process of a film noir terror. He chooses a brilliant score for the film that helps us feel both the 1940s and the '70s film noir. The cinematography is also great. Each scene is lit with subtle coloring, making it both cinematic and dark.<br/><br/>""Chinatown"" represents a typical classic film noir at its finest. Every minute of the movie keeps you in complete suspense and challenges your values and ideas about society. More than just a detective story, ""Chinatown"" digs deep into the political and social agenda and picks out what seems to be a masterpiece."

","Yes this is meant to be one of the best Jack Nicholson's movie but I think I'm probably the only one in the world that doesn't approve of the movie. I didn't seem to see enough action going around and I think Jack Nicholson playing a good guy doesn't suit him. He's mostly better off playing crazy funny characters or a evil beast. I really like him a lot as an actor but I think this is one of the worst in my personal opinion that he has ever done in his film career!<br/><br/>I also thought the movie title was a really wrong idea to advertise since it makes you think that a lot of things could happen in this film but it honestly didn't!

","Chinatown is a thinking man's noir that completely surpasses expectation. Nicholson is at his conniving best as Jake Gittes and there are perhaps no greater villains than Hollis Mulray.<br/><br/>Chinatown casts a spell with a tone that is both forlorn and mysterious - the film starts slow and builds an incredible tension that wraps you up until its overwhelming conclusion.<br/><br/>Be prepared for raw nerves and the feeling that every character is putting on a show, facade driven like the town itself. <br/><br/>The many supporting actors are amazing! Everyone is so well cast and totally believable in their roles, including Polanksi himself, who plays a brief but unforgettable mini-thug who knows how to wield a blade. Every roll is a kind of character study, a breakdown of morality in its varying forms and often the best characters turn out to be the most corrupt or deceitful while the worst characters surprise you with traits that are more noble than expected.<br/><br/>Jerry Goldsmith's work on the soundtrack really evokes the era in both its polish and seediness. It drives home the film-noir tone and reinforces the films variation of themes.<br/><br/>The first time I saw this movie I was living in Alabama and LA seemed like a distant and foreign place. But a few years later there was a big scandal in the state over parks and wildlife and I suddenly felt this immense connection between the way it was playing out and the feeling I had while watching Chinatown, proving to me how effective this film is from start to finish."
"moviefreakgirl","Null","3","7","24 December 2006"," Amazing Film Noir
","This is a noir mystery, with a dark, haunting story, great acting and a brilliant direction. Its ambiance is just perfect. In this story, every character has complicated issues that can't be solved, a troubled past and sins they can't atone for. It's all very dark and mysterious, and it gets you in the edge of your seat. The political part of the mystery keeps you guessing and it's incredibly competent, but the character development and their personal issues are even better.<br/><br/>The screenplay is mind-blowing. All of its subplots are perfectly developed and are understood just at the right time, they keep you guessing. The characters are all believable and interesting: Gittes (Jack Nicholson) and his obsession, Evelyn (Faye Dunaway) trying to get her life back together and, Noah Cross, the personification of evil, have a convincing, elaborated relationship with each other. They are all, in a way or another, trying to atone but in Chinatown there's no redemption. The dialogs have a lot of meaning and are thought provoking. Some show the hypocrisy of people and others just their weakness, always in a tense, disguised way. There are a bunch of quotable lines too. The ending is surprising but well done and very fitting. The themes are spoke of with maturity and sensibility.<br/><br/>The acting is great. Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway and John Huston have a very believable, amazing chemistry between them, they seem to be always messing with the other's mind, trying to mistake him and convince him. All this is noticed just by a gaze, a movement or a blink. It's very subtle, but it makes the performances outstanding. Jack Nicholson creates a haunted character, strong but human. Faye Dunaway makes her character remarkably vulnerable and sad, even if at the same time a bit of a femme fatale. John Huston is evil, in his two scenes he's just perfect. All the secondary actors are talented and they make this movie better.<br/><br/>I highly enjoy Polanski's way of shooting, all the angles and camera movements he tends to use. He does a great job once again. The movie never gets tiring and some of the shots are breathtaking. They are a beautiful homage to older noir movies, even if still have their originality.<br/><br/>The music is haunting and it gives a movie a touch of originality. The editing pays homage to the noir movies from the 40's, showing the many layers of the story slowly and there's not one minute tat shouldn't be there. The cinematography, glossy but dirty, with an harsh, dark lighting creates the right ambiance. Just brilliant and unmissable."
"Sylviastel","9","3","7","5 June 2006"," Except for the Ending, this is a classic film!
","This film follows Roman Polanski's mindset. By the time, he directed Chinatown, Polanski had survived the Holocaust in Poland and survived the Manson trial. I know Polanski is guilty of molesting a young girl and fled the country. Those events occurred after this film. For the record, Jack Nicholson is brilliant as Jake, a man with a conscious. Fay Dunaway is brilliant as Mrs. Mulray and the legendary John Huston acting as her father is bone-chilling. The film is the story about life in Los Angeles during the great depression when it was nothing at the time before all the development. It's hard to believe that Los Angeles was once a small town that prospered into the entertainment capital of the world. It has become one of the world's priciest places to live in or around. The story is well-known especially about the relationship between Mrs. Mulray and her father, Mr. Cross. But in 1974, they never would have revealed such truths. After all, Huston plays a powerful wealthy businessman and investor. I am giving it a nine because I dislike the ending. It's chilling for me to see the wrong person to be killed and another character on the way to be victimized."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","3","7","9 August 2005"," A 70s masterpiece (spoilers throughout)
","Probably the most famous scene in Chinatown is the one where Jake Gittes gets his nose sliced. The punishment is poetic justice for a nosey private detective and one which serves as a stark warning for the character to keep his nose out of other people's business in the future. But of course Jake does nothing of the kind. His investigation becomes more determined. However, what he doesn't know is that by poking his nose in it, he'll destroy the woman he loves and help a corrupt millionaire.<br/><br/>If there's a lesson to be learned from Chinatown it's that ordinary people are powerless against the greed and corruption of the wealthy. Powerful men can break the law with impunity, hold cities to ransom, destroy lives and never be held accountable. Ordinary people, on the other hand, are easily intimidated and powerless against petty bureaucracy. That's the way capitalism works. That's the system. Jake knows this. And he tries his best to keep out of it. Just take the Chinatown motif. There, in that community, it's best to keep your nose out of things because you don't know what's going on. And it's the same higher up in the system. To poke your nose into things is to open a can of worms and expose your ignorance. The only possible response to meddling is one of great hostility. But like all film noir, Jake just can't help getting involved. And like all film noir, a woman rouses Jake's interest.<br/><br/>Mrs Mulwray is an interesting character because she goes against film noir tradition. She's introduced as the typical black widow, a cool, icy woman who will knowingly destroy the hero. But in actuality Mrs Mulwray is a sad, vulnerable woman. One who's forced to create a harsh façade to keep her dark secret under wraps. But underneath it she's a much warmer female character than you usually find in film noir. She's almost motherly. The way that she dresses Jake's nose certainly illustrates this, as does the lengths she goes to in order to protect her daughter. However, despite all this, she is a femme fatale. She certainly leads Jake to emotional ruin. But like much of the film, a mixture of crossed wires and blind ignorance drives events.<br/><br/>It's a genre convention of film noir that the hero knows nothing and ends up ruining everything with his quest for the truth. And so it is with Chinatown. It's Jake who destroys Mrs Mulwray and it's Jake who unwittingly helps Noah Cross. By trying to find out of the truth of their lives he reconnects these two estranged individuals and instigates the inevitable conclusion. And as always in life, it's the powerful person who ends up winning.<br/><br/>However, Mrs Mulwray has a part to play in her fate. It's Jake who reconnects her with her father, but it's her secrecy that fires his passion to discover the truth. If she'd told him everything earlier, such a tragic ending would have been avoided. But that's noir for you. Everyone's got their secrets and everyone holds onto them tightly. That's the fun of the genre. But even though the ending is inevitable, it's absolutely perfect. It couldn't have ended any other way. But although the ending is perfect in the sense that everything feels right about it, it's not filmed perfectly. The choreography between Nicholson and the cops before they shoot Mrs Mulwray should have been a lot better. If you watch it, it seems as if Lopez (playing Escobar) is waiting for Jack to tackle him. The timing is off. And the cop that steps forward to shoot at the car does it rather too theatrically in my opinion. It's a shame because it's the only mistake in the film. I really can't find any other faults. The story is magnificent, the dialogue is great, the acting is superb, the photography is luscious and I love the musical score and the production design. I just wish the choreography at the end were tighter and more natural.<br/><br/>Another thing that I love about Chinatown is John Huston. He's such a perfect embodiment of evil. He's good company and extremely charming, but he has malevolence running through his veins. And I like the subtly insulting way that he pronounces Jake's surname. He wants to come across as a harmless, perhaps slightly barmy old man, but he knows exactly what he's doing. Everything is coldly calculated. And he also captures the attitude of corporate America. Why spend a lot of money building a safe dam when you can shave costs at the expense of safety and lives? Everything is about money. Well, money and power. Oh, and the future too. He wants to shape the new Los Angeles. He wants to control it. Unlike his former partner Hollis Mulwray, who's attitude, if anything, was socialist. He wanted the people to own the water, and therefore the new city. But that sort of idea is abhorrent to Cross. He represents the ethos that won the battle to control America. The capitalists took everything. And as the argument in the barbershop shows, there's a perverse respectability to greed in America. A banker is respectable, but a private detective isn't. In essence people aren't interested in the truth. They certainly don't want it plastered across the newspaper while they're having their breakfast. All they want is to make money and be left alone. Jake should have known that when he begun his investigation."

","I've often said that if I had the use of a time machine that probably the first place I would go would be California in the 1970's, when filmmakers like Polanski, Altman, Spielberg and even George Lucas were in full swing in their crafts. The 1970's was possibly the last fantastic decade of cinema, where the films were adventurous and the directors were iconoclastic. One of the most revered and famous films from this great decade is Roman Polanski's 1974 crime thriller ""Chinatown"".<br/><br/>Set in the 1930's, ""Chinatown"" stars Jack Nicholson as Jake Gittes, a private detective who with two associates, seems to specialize mostly in adultery cases. When a woman comes into his offices and introduces herself as Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray, he initially turns down her request to tail her husband. He finally gives in, however, and begins to look into Mulwray's deal. It turns out that he is the chief engineer of the water department, and times are tough right now because of a drought. Jake is confused when he sees Mulwray looking at several parcels of land, but finally meets his objective when he is able to photograph Mulwray with another woman. When the story breaks that Mulwray (currently a controversial figure because he refuses to build an unsafe structure that the public at large thinks is a good idea) is stepping out on his wife, Jake gets a visit from Evelyn Mulwray threatening to sue. Except this Mrs. Mulwray (Dunaway) is completely different, and is the ""real Mrs. Mulwray"". When Mr. Mulwray turns up dead shortly thereafter, Jake finds himself in the middle of several mysteries, all which seem to point toward the direction of Evelyn and her father, one of the city's richest and most corrupt businessmen, Noah Cross. (John Huston) The greatest element of ""Chinatown"" is in my opinion, also something that could serve as a deterrent to some. I really liked the slow, drawn out plot. Polanski and Towne did not seem to have a problem taking their time with the pacing on the film, something that I personally found to be refreshing. Instead of rushing to the conclusion, or having fantastic fillers, it is clear how comfortable Polanski is with the material and his actors in that he takes as much time as needed to provide pertinent backgrounds and details. The decision to remove Nicholson's narration and simply have the audience discovering all of the clues along with him was brilliant. Though narration can be a very effective tool, unfortunately it is a device that was done to perfection in the 1940's (and some of the films of the 50's) and emulators don't always do the best job with it. Anyone who is looking for flash and rapid-fire cuts are not going to get that with this film. What one gets is a bright and colorful California setting, where some scenes look like Hockney paintings if they were set in the 1930's. It is hard to describe how lush the cinematography is, but if I had to put it into words, non-sensically I would compare it to butter; that everything looks velvety and soft. Only at night does the scenery turn sharp and slightly harsh.<br/><br/>The acting in ""Chinatown"" was as good as I expected, and that is to say superior. Nicholson, one of the greatest actors of the past four decades, put together a low key, almost introspective performance as Gittes. Though he is indeed mischievous (how could he not be with those eyebrows and that grin, used to full effect in this film) Nicholson seems to temper his normally explosive style. Faye Dunaway, an incredibly talented actress, who, even if she hadn't played her in an infamous film, evokes the memory of Joan Crawford before she started doing her weird films in the 1950's & 1960's, was the perfect counterpart to Gittes. At times icy enough that you would expect her to spit cubes, and other times violently passionate, she shows some of her best work in this film and is achingly gorgeous to boot. The third main figure is probably the best because his performance was most surprising, and that was John Huston's. He not only directed one of the greatest early noir films (""The Maltese Falcon"") and is one of the greatest directors of the 20th century, but he really puts in a dark and gritty performance as Noah Cross; and he's REALLY convincing. I was absolutely delighted in the choice to cast him, because while there are admittedly a lot of actors who could have done this role, it was still really cool to see Huston do it.<br/><br/>All of this is not to say that I adored ""Chinatown"". Frankly, I thought it was a good movie, but probably in the same way that people scratch their head at why ""Citizen Kane"" is often called the best film of all time, I kind of did the same in terms of why say, Entertainment Weekly would name it the #4 film of all time. However, even though I definitely liked it, despite not loving it, I can see its importance in film history and I can really appreciate the technical aspects that made up the film. That is why I have no problem rating it a 7/10.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

","After masterpieces like ""Knife in the water"", ""Repulsion"" and ""Rosemary's Baby"". Roman Polanski (one of the best directors who ever lived, and lives), proved to be a competent director and screenwriter in various genres, decided to make a tribute to the genre that he grew up watching, ""Noir"", in the best way possible. Doing in my opinion his ultimate masterpiece! <br/><br/>""Chinatown"" tells the story of J.J. ""Jake"" Gittes (Jack Nicholson), a private detective in L.A., specialized in cases of marriage. One day, he is hired by Evelyn Mulwray, who suspect's of her husband Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling), the builder of the water supply system of the city, thinking that he is having an affair. Jake then does what he does best with his assistants and follows and takes photos of Hollis with his young lover, inadvertently causing a huge scandal in the press. Later after a job well done, Jake gets into his office the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) putting a process in Jake accusing him of fraud. Jake knowing that he was set-up, he begins to investigate who was the fake Mrs. Mulwray, and trying to get in touch with Hollis Mulwray, because he believe that who cheated him wanted to hurt Mr. Mulwray. Only when Jake tries to contact Mulwray, he is found dead in a channeling of the water system of the city. Now Jake asks the help of the real Mrs. Mulwray to help him in his investigation of those responsible for the death of the poor man, but this will take him into a web of lies and corruption, keeping horrible secrets of the city.<br/><br/>Polanski from the beginning wanted to do a tribute to the films noir of the '40s and '50s, and he did it ""perfectly"". First unite the types of cases and scandals of a usual noir film: policy; familial cases; xenophobia and racism; corruption; and of course murder. Mixing humor, and also dark and thrilling moments to the history. Thanks to a superb direction of Polanski, and also the strongest point of the film (and surprisingly the only Oscar that the film received), the script.<br/><br/>The script by Robert Towne, who was initially written by Polanski, is superb in every possible detail. Very well written from start to finish, giving the film a wonderful narrative that flows perfectly without ever getting boring and also, thanks to the influence of Polanski, is full of humor. But it also never ceases to be serious and dark when needs to be, giving superb dialogs to the film, adding a lot to the history. Not only long conversations about the case, but also on the definition of what is justice, spread all over the film.

","A classic example of its genre(s) that packs in a taut screenplay which is transitioned on the film canvas in a seamless manner by a skilled filmmaker in complete control of his craft and is further bolstered by strong performances from its entire cast, Chinatown is considered by many to be one of the best offerings in the mystery genre and it is indeed difficult to dispute its legacy.<br/><br/>Inspired from true events, the story of Chinatown is set in Los Angeles and follows a private detective specialising in matrimonial cases who's hired by a woman to investigate & confirm her suspicion of her husband having an affair but soon finds himself caught in a bigger web when the client turns out to be an impersonator. As he digs deeper into the case to find out who set him up, he uncovers a plot involving deceit, corruption & murder.<br/><br/>Directed by Roman Polanski (best known for Rosemary's Baby & The Pianist), Chinatown is expertly crafted with thorough attention given to its setting & timeline, and the story unfolds in a controlled manner. Robert Town's script is a highlight too that's completely focused on its lead character without discarding the secondary ones. The technical aspects are skilfully carried out while Jerry Goldsmith's score is beautiful, poignant & haunting at the same time.<br/><br/>The cast comprises of Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, John Hillerman & others, with all of them turning in a committed performance in their given roles. Nicholson is excellent as the private investigator, plays his character with finesse, and is present in virtually every single scene. Dunaway also puts up a strong show that goes neck to neck with Nicholson's work. But the film is at its best when the screen is shared by Nicholson & Dunaway for their spot- on chemistry just works.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Chinatown doesn't seem to do much wrong with its narrative over the course of its runtime and yet I have no clue to why it didn't work out for me. Polanski's no- nonsense direction, Towne's polished screenplay & Nicholson's brilliant work are no doubt admirable but the whole experience of sitting through it was pretty stale, even in moments of big reveal including the soul-shattering climax. One of those films that I admire but feel no love for it, Chinatown is still full of surprises for newcomers and is highly recommended."
"kylebristol12","10","2","4","24 April 2013"," Chinatown
","Roman Polanski's ""Chinatown"" is one of the greatest films of the 1970s for a couple of reasons:<br/><br/>Firstly, it stars two of New Hollywood's biggest actors, Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway, in the leading roles. Dunaway played Bonnie Parker, the infamous bank robber, in Arthur Penn's ""Bonnie and Clyde"", a film that hearkened back to the gangster films of the thirties. Nicholson starred in ""Easy Rider"" (1969) and ""Five Easy Pieces"" (1970), two central films in the counterculture movement of the sixties that also cemented his status as a A-list star. These two actors have perfect chemistry on screen. <br/><br/>Secondly, in the same way ""Bonnie and Clyde"" was molded after classic gangster films, ""Chinatown"" is modeled after film noirs of the forties and fifties. Nicholson plays Private Investigator Jack Gittes, a man whose job it is to spy on other peoples' social lives. This theme of voyeurism is consistent throughout the film, from the opening scene where one of Gittes' customers looks at photos that Gittes has taken of his wife with another man, to later shots of Gittes spying on a man from faraway through binoculars. The lens of the binoculars forms the frame. In scenes such as this, Polanski uses depth within the frame much the same as film noir utilized lighting. In many scenes throughout the film, the camera is placed far back from the characters and the action to create a feeling of suspense. This is what the old film noirs would have looked like in color.<br/><br/>Nicholson's character in ""Chinatown"" is an embodiment of the troubled male hero in countless film noirs. Something that happened in his past as a cop working in Chinatown haunts him day and night; he isn't comfortable talking about it. Chinatown itself is an enigmatic place that represents Gittes past, and it back to Chinatown where the story ultimately takes him. All of this aside, the film's story is an ingenious mystery that will have anyone holding their breath until the very last moments."

","Less a gushing homage to noir than part of a wave of 1970s conspiracy thrillers, Roman Polanski's ""Chinatown"" is one of the best (and few) examples of a film revitalizing and expanding conventions of past Hollywood.<br/><br/>The early noirs of the 1940s and 50s used rapid-fire dialogue, claustrophobic sets, shadowy cinematography, canted angles, convoluted plots and various shady characters to construct an impenetrable web of conspiracy and betrayal. Within this web our heroes find themselves trapped, helpless, confused and yanked about like a puppet on a string.<br/><br/>The very cinematic language of these films was oppressive, every detail actively scheming against both off-screen audience and on-screen hero (frequently a private investigator or police detective), both attempting to hack their way through the film's conspiratorial universe, often to no avail.<br/><br/>Of course these early noir directors didn't know they were making noirs. The term hadn't been invented and these artists were simply responding, intuitively, to the anxieties of the time: the trendiness of existentialism, expressionism, the onset of war, urban sprawl etc.<br/><br/>The last of the noirs made in the classic mould was, arguably, ""Blast of Silence"", a film which anticipates both Antonioni (where space and self disconnect) and Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" (loners in oppressive urban jungles) and provides clues as to which direction the genre was heading. From this point onwards, classical noirs ceased and noir then branched off into two directions, ""neo noirs"" and a whole mass of films which are noirs but are never classified as such.<br/><br/>Neo noir was born under the sway of postmodernism, and so these films tended to be formalist games and vapid exercises in aesthetics. Concurrently with their rise came wave after wave of genuine noirs which, like the noirs of the 1930s and 40s, consciously or unconsciously reflected a changing world. And so whilst early noirs gave us noirs confined to tiny rooms, their characters battling their way from one small sound-stage to the next, these noirs expanded and began to take into account the growing consciousness of its post war audience.<br/><br/>So we have such widely divergent films as ""The Parallax View"", ""Marathon Man"", ""Capricorn One"", ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""Manchurian Candidate"", ""Z"", ""Three Days of the Condor"", ""The Spy Who Came In From The Cold"", ""The Conformist"", ""Cutter's Way"", ""All The President's Men (In ""Perspectves on Film Noir"", Raymond Durgnat even calls a science fiction film like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" a film noir) etc etc, all films influenced by Vietnam, Watergate, whistle-blowing and a growing suspicion of any and all leaders. The existentialist's web of fate, in which a malevolent universe ""naturally"" conspires against man (""The Killing"", ""Wrath of God"" etc), thus increasingly gave way to more politically charged plots. <br/><br/>The genre remained quiet in the 1980s, aside from a subset of ""tech noir"" films like ""Blade Runner"" and ""Terminator"". Both films are about hunters, noir fate personified as relentless source code (man as machine, his future engineered). The Coens and Lynch then came along, the former neo-noirists largely interested in parlour tricks. Around this time neo noir also intersected with nudity, films like ""Basic Instinct"", ""Body Heat"", ""Last Seduction"", and ""Jade"" serving up femme fatales as figures to fear and salivate over.<br/><br/>The 1990s saw noir seeping into television (""The X-Files"", ""Twin Peaks"" etc). With zeitgeist tapping tag-lines such as ""The Truth Is Out There"" and ""Trust No One"", such shows posited a world of vast conspiracies, the common man at the mercy of all manners of ridiculously elaborate forces (religion, genetics, government plots, class, economics, monsters etc). It was now man's duty to trawl through these labyrinths of information, discovering some elusive ""truth"" that ensured his own freedom. In the mid 1990s the puppet masters then took the form of diseases and genetic disorders. Then with the internet age came the ""conspiracy documentary"", which proliferate on websites and peer-to-peer networks.<br/><br/>Nowadays, noirs have the expansiveness of such shows as ""The Wire"", their characters at the mercy of a far wider range of forces (politics, science, sex, religion, globalization, capital, mysticism, Hollywood, genetics, technology, screenwriters, family, fate, bureaucracy etc). The best of these take place in a forever un-mappable universe, conflicts never resolved, characters trapped in the global flux, their heroes increasingly rootless, set adrift in a world of influences so vast that the human mind can do nothing but succumb. These noirs are such widely divergent fare as ""Ran"", ""Inland Empire"", ""Demonlover"", ""Mulholland Drive"", ""The Wire"", ""Code 46"", ""Boarding Gate"", ""Platform"", ""Eyes Wide Shut"", ""Miami Vice"", ""Girlfriend Experience"" etc etc. Of course nobody thinks of these films as ""film noirs"". They much rather champion self-consciously emulative fare.<br/><br/>In any case, if ""Chinatown"" doesn't have the scope of later noirs (""Chinatown"", unlike modern noirs, firmly believes its conspiracies can be uncovered), it's nevertheless one of cinema's most elegantly written tales. Elsewhere the film is brimming with neat details; consider the way Polanski constantly jumps from arid landscapes to fertile orchards (Chinatown's ""conspiracy"" revolves around land, water and agricultural property), the ""water motifs"" inserted into virtually every sequence (ponds, stuffed fish, paintings of lakes, swordfish etc) and the way Polanski aptly casts John Huston as the film's villain, Huston's ""Maltese Falcon"" being one of the first films to bring together all the tropes that we now commonly associate with ""noir"".<br/><br/>9.5/10 - Masterpiece."

","Chinatown is not so much a movie as it is an experience. To date, it is probably my favorite film. I've always enjoyed film noir, especially the old Bogart films. Chinatown draws strongly from that tradition, but comes from a European director's (Polanski) perspective. The film is highly stylized and seems to draw the classic old detective formula perfectly into the downbeat, sometimes depressing, but artistic style of the 1970s.<br/><br/>The story is that Jake Gittes (Nicholson) is an LA private investigator hired by Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray to investigate whether her husband, the head of Water and Power for the city, is having an affair. Mulwray is already the subject of controversy due to his reluctance to build a new dam during a city water shortage. After Gittes uncovers what appears to be an affair, the real Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) comes forward and sues Gittes. Gittes quickly tries to persuade her that he was set up and wants to warn Mulwray. However, before he can do so, Mulwray is found dead at a reservoir. Mrs. Mulwray hires Gittes to investigate her husband's death after he convinces her that her husband was murdered.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the interplay between the actors. Nicholson and Dunaway play very well off of each other, but John Huston, who plays Noah Cross, gives a fantastic performance. Mr. Cross is Evelyn's father who hires Gittes to find Mulwray's girlfriend. Huston walks a fine line perfectly of being both charming and brutally dangerous at the same time. Throughout the film, Gittes has to evade goons trying to do him some harm over his investigation into Mulwray's murder and police Lieutentant Escobar (Perry Lopez) who he worked with in Chinatown. Escobar's demeanor towards Gittes definitely indicates that Gittes has a bad past. I also really enjoyed Roman Polanski's cameo as a knife wielding thug, which is a brief but memorable appearance for Gittes.<br/><br/>The style of the film adds greatly to its effectiveness. Rather than use voice-over narration, as is often done in detective films, the audience discovers clues at the same time Gittes does. In addition, the richness of the plot keeps the viewer guessing, but does not get distracting as some detective films would. However, to really understand the title, you have to watch the whole film. <br/><br/>This film was really a sleeper for everyone involved. Roman Polanski (director), Robert Towne (writer), and Robert Evans (producer) had prior to its release believed they had a colossal flop. However, the film came together beautifully. The cast was excellent, from the lead roles down to the extras. The direction was great and the story, although altered by Polanski from the original script, really put emphasized the downbeat nature of the subject material.<br/><br/>This is a must watch for anyone."

","What is it about this movie? Is it the excellent storytelling? Is it the excellent acting? (Nicholson!Dunaway!Huston!) Is it the beautiful California 40's scenery? Is it the grim atmosphere, the drought, the sweat in 'orange county'? Of course; a combination of all of these ingredients. In this beautiful 70's film noir Nicholson doesn't just deliver a Humphrey B.-rip-off performance, but something darker, more cynical even. Faye Dunaway delivers a glorious two-faced femme fatale and John Huston is both subtle and blunt: evil incarnated. Polanski's filming and his pace are both sublime; cool, distant and reminiscent in every way of the noir-era. Watching the movie makes you feel sort of guilty, as though the filming-crew has washed its hands in blood. 70's movies will do that to you (Taxi Driver, the Godfather, etc). I don't want to be a cynic, claiming this type of film couldn't possibly be produced today. But it is a fact that Spielberg and Lucas and, heck, the eighties with their 'smooth cinema' corrupted the industry in a way, that makes this type of film something of a different era. Let's be thankfull for that era and go watch it one more time. And if you haven't yet: take pity on yourself or haste!"

And the way that they weave real history into it as well makes the story that much more intriguing. The mystery is layered and involving and realistic, and the dialogue is fresh and witty without seeming too stylized.

Yes, I know Citizen Kane and Casablanca are the top favorites of film historians, but I still hold my ground here. Superb in every aspect of film making -- acting, editing, direction, musical score, cinematography and on and on. Polanski captures the 1930's film noir in color, and pulls it off beautifully. Robert Towne's screenplay is used at the USC school of film making as an example of how to write. His work is simply astounding. Nicholson gives his finest performance -- even better than his superb offering in On Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. His Jake Gittes character is at the same time cynical and sympathetic. Dunaway has never been more mysterious, Huston has never been more ominous, and every supporting member of the cast is perfection personified. The closest any film maker has come to capturing such a mood and theme since has been the fine work of L A Confidential. Even if you don't like period pieces, mysteries, private eyes and conspiracy films, this movie deserves your accolades as an example of how films can and should be produced. There are only 50 or so American films that have reached perfection, and Chinatown is at the top of the list."

","With ""Chinatown,"" Roman Polanski did for the detective crime genre what Todd Haynes did for the Douglas Sirk melodrama in ""Far from Heaven."" Polanski created something that was partly an homage to all of those delightfully atmospheric noirs of the 1940s, but went beyond that to deconstruct some of the genre's conventions. Rather than simply making a 1974 film that imitated a film noir from the 40s, Polanski instead made a 1940s film noir infused with the cultural demons of 1974 America.<br/><br/>The plot is byzantine and confusing, as any good crime thriller plot should be. But true to the genre, the plot doesn't matter as much as the rotten underbelly of corruption and violence that the plot exposes. No director can do atmosphere (especially rotten atmosphere) as well as Polanski, and he's at his best here. Jack Nicholson gives maybe the best performance of his career as detective Jake Gittes, a hard-boiled seen-it-all tough guy who isn't quite tough enough for the nastiness he uncovers; Faye Dunaway is the elusive and beautiful object of his obsession; and John Huston gives a frightening performance as a monster in everyday clothing.

","""Chinatown"" is certainly one of the better films of the 1970's, though the plot is at first a little hidden causing the viewer to search for it. Only this ends up being a pretty dark and clever mystery. ""Chinatown"" is set in bright and sunny Los Angeles, California during the 1930's, and many scenes are memorable from the sets used like the houses, and the backdrop of the California skyline and desert. Jack Nicholson is Jake Gittes a veteran private eye who takes cases of people who believe that their significant other has cheated. Only one day he finds a funny thing is about to happen when he receives a report from a Mrs. Mulwray that her husband is cheating. Only later Gittes finds out that this wasn't the real Mrs. Mulwray! And soon upon investigating this claim, he learns that Mr. Mulwray is tied to a dispute over land and water in the L.A. valley, and as was so common in the 1970's this is tied to political corruption and civil servant scandal. More light is shed after Gittes finds the real Mrs. Mulwray(Faye Dunaway) and the discovery of Mr. Mulwray dead only deepens the mystery. Just when the plot seems to be clear the film throws the viewer off again showing that Mrs. Mulwray's father is playing a clear role in this torrid land and water mess as John Huston gives a fine performance as Noah Cross. Mostly ""Chinatown"" is a film of secrets, and political corruption with a plot that keeps the viewer guessing, certainly one of the better and darker films of the 1970's. Jack Nicholson is fantastic as always making this a classic because his performance was straight to the point, and Roman Polanski did a fine job directing this it was well adapted from Robert Towne, and one of the memorable scenes of all time is when Polanski's character cuts Jack's nose with a knife!

","Seminal classic of '70s cinema, with Jack Nicholson excellent as a mostly-ethical former cop-turned-private detective in 1930s Los Angeles who believes he's been hired by the wife of the chief engineer of the Water and Power Department; she thinks her husband's cheating on her but, as it turns out, she's not the real Mrs. at all, and so propels Nicholson's Jake ""J.J."" Gittes into a tug-of-war between powerful ex-partners, with carnality and family secrets the key to unraveling the mystery. Oscar-winning screenplay by Robert Towne (who also penned the 1990 extension, ""The Two Jakes"") is filled with complicated story threads and characters with chequered pasts--lots of fun, though it is somewhat unfair the script is always two steps ahead of the audience (it would be nearly impossible for a first-time viewer to solve this case on his own; Towne sets up the game and ends up solving it for the rest of us). However, the picture is so deftly orchestrated by director Roman Polanski, one becomes engrossed in the proceedings even while being bombarded with both clues and extraneous matter. Faye Dunaway's performance, as the breathy, mysterious daughter of water-czar John Huston, walks a fine line between melodramatic and campy--still, she's entirely in the spirit of the piece, and an interesting screen-match for Nicholson. The film is assured and entertaining; it pulls the viewer in without giving out enough information concerning the milieu, though this lack of knowledge for our sake doesn't hurt the returns. A cannier, guessing-game approach to the plot may have made the film more commercial (it was a modest box-office hit); however, this presentation, messy though it may be, is still arresting.

","One of those bleak, brilliant 1970s movies, ""Chinatown"" draws inspiration from 1940s-style film noir, but is much more than just a homage to the genre. Though its excellent screenplay features the requisite snappy dialogue and tight, twisty plotting, its deeply cynical view of human nature takes the film beyond simple entertainment into near-tragedy. The glittering reservoirs and sun-baked deserts of Los Angeles turn out to be dangerous places, and a lush score helps set the movie's darkly romantic mood.<br/><br/>Private detective J. J. ""Jake"" Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is hired to investigate whether Hollis Mulwray, head of the Los Angeles water department, is cheating on his wife Evelyn (Faye Dunaway). Things are much more complicated than Jake can possibly imagine, though: not only does he dredge up secrets about Hollis, Evelyn, and Evelyn's millionaire father Noah Cross (John Huston), he also discovers massive corruption in the water department. Though one plot deals with individuals and the other plot deals with society at large, they're both equally fascinating, and tie together in surprising ways.<br/><br/>The role of Jake Gittes was written to take advantage of Jack Nicholson's sly, sarcastic persona and other trademark mannerisms. But Jake's not just the cool, clever guy we've come to expect from Nicholson, or from movie detectives in general. Instead, he's hardly ever in control of the situation, and vulnerable because of this. To Nicholson's great credit, he captures these nuances, rather than coasting on his persona.<br/><br/>Evelyn is an even more layered, mysterious character, and Dunaway plays her with the elegant coolness known to every film noir dame. But Dunaway makes clear that Evelyn is not really a femme fatale: her coolness does not reflect an inner heartlessness. Instead, Evelyn's self- possession is just an act, and internally she's wounded and fragile.<br/><br/>""Chinatown"" has been directed with superb attention to detailalways a good thing in a detective movie. Film noirs of the '40s, as good as they are, sometimes display hints that they were shot on a soundstage, but that's never the case with ""Chinatown."" Roman Polanski's camera enjoys following Jake Gittes as he examines the many clues and false leads, and there are some nice visual motifs, such as water and broken glass.<br/><br/>""Chinatown""'s ending is famously despairing, acknowledging that ordinary citizens with good intentions stand no chance against a corrupt bureaucracy. It would be unusual nowadays to have so many great talents collaborating on such a pessimistic story; fortunately, in 1974, the makers of ""Chinatown"" pooled their efforts and created a tragic, engaging, and outstanding movie."

As a native of southern California I grew up knowing something about Mulholland the Water Baron, on whom I assume aspects of both Hollis Mulwray and Noah Cross were based, and this fictionalization imparts the intrigues and era extremely well. Polanski was fortunate that -- when filming Chinatown -- there were still authentic locations in existence; someone would be harder- pressed to simulate 1930's L.A. now. Chinatown clearly has aspects of genuine Film Noir, but as translated by Roman Polanski it's darker and, well, creepier than almost any such film.

Luckily, Nicholson, Towne, and Evens all convinced him to come back to work on the project as he was the director they absolutely sought.<br/><br/>Now, for those folks who think a water kingpin is a pointless and silly villain, I would suggest highly looking into the real life William Mulholland, the man who 'allegedly' paid-off the State Supreme court of CA for the largest public works project in history to divert the Owens River to Los Angeles, and in the process ruined the entire Owens Valley, once called the 'Geneva of the West'. Farmers were bankrupted, lives were lost, people were killed. Mulholland became a vastly wealthy and respected man. The city named a street after him, Mulholland Drive, now an international landmark running along the top of the Hollywood Hills overlooking the San Fernando Valley, a valley his water (and yes, land speculation too) made developable. Mulholland is now considered the spiritual father of Los Angeles. Where is the true justice here? What is one honest farmer's life worth? How much power (and water) can one man have?<br/><br/>Chinatown, it is not a movie about a place, but a journey into a world that you and I as a people, don't, can't, and won't understand, and if we try to, those with the REAL power will swat us down like flies and not give a D@$N! Jake's last line is ""as little as possible"", repeating the quote he and Faye Dunaway say in bed much earlier that morning, ""What did you do in Chinatown? As little as possible.""<br/><br/>And I must also mention Jerry Goldsmith's stunning combination of Cowell/Cage avant guard piano techniques and Gershwin in the score. Remarkable!<br/><br/>Godfather (I, II), Network, All the Presidents Men, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, French Connection (I,II) and Chinatown...dark character studies all, probably the greatest American films ever made, and no, not a happy ending to be found. I read a transcript of an interview of Robert Towne where he said he couldn't make Chinatown today as the studios wouldn't put up the money thinking the public would get it. Sadly, judging from many of the comments here, this is accurate. For evidence look at LA Confidential. The film is the modern relative of Chinatown (but with lots of neat guns, fights, blood and a happy ending added) and it only grossed 60 million on a budget over 30 million; nearly a failure in today's Hollywood.<br/><br/>Oh, and Faye Dunaway's character losing an eye? Read Oedipus to understand the imagery. If not, go rent Shawshank Redemption, Titanic, Gladiator and various other 'modern classics' and leave Chinatown, with its bad ending, well alone."

In this gritty, complex, sad, disturbing<br/><br/>masterpiece from director Roman Polanski and stars Jack<br/><br/>Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, and an absolutely evil John Huston, we<br/><br/>take a glimpse at pre war Los Angeles through the eyes of Jake<br/><br/>Gittes (Nicholson), a private investigator who stumbles onto the<br/><br/>case of a lifetime. What he uncovers, a scheme to steal the water<br/><br/>of Los Angeles is only the tip of the iceberg. ""Chinatown"" as<br/><br/>screenwriter Robert Towne explains in the DVD intro is a place<br/><br/>where a policeman once told him that he didn't want to do<br/><br/>anything, because he could never tell if he was helping or hurting<br/><br/>someone, a grey area so to speak, where the law doesn't easily<br/><br/>reach. ""Chinatown"" is the ultimate metaphor of this movie, a place<br/><br/>where wrongs will not be set right.

It is one of the rare times in movie experience where the viewer is able to get a glimpse of what the characters are thinking. Besides character development, the plot of the movie is so intricate that it begs to be addressed. It's a movie about greed, ambition, deceit, and love.

","A strange, one-off film this one. A re-entry to the film noir genre twenty-five years on for Hollywood, that refines and extends the scope of the genre. Certainly up there with ""The Third Man"", ""Touch of Evil"" and ""Rear Window"" in the suspense and mystery stakes; ""Chinatown"" contains so much depth under the surface, and detail, that you'll feel cheated by the mediocrity of today's Hollywood output. A truly impressive script, coupled with vivid, disciplined direction from the skilled Roman Polanski, and ornate photography create a masterful, tangible atmosphere of rich dread. The performances rise to the occasion without being too OTT; Nicholson is a fine, laconic Gittes, Faye Dunaway is just right for this role; she has the right mixture of cold aloofness and tangible sensuality. Of course, the ""She's my sister..."" scene is wonderfully delivered by the wrought Dunaway. Ah yes, and John Huston, who has comparitively minimal screen time, makes a startling impression as Noah Cross; a thoroughly baneful figure. There is so much to savour in this masterpiece for those who can take in it at the correct, languid but progressive pace. The whole look of the film is immensely attractive and the dialogue is clever and often witty. On top of that, it is a serious film about moral and personal decadence, with the viewer left both doleful and exhilarated. The final scene is excellent, with a wonderful closing line, and direction to the close. One of the most ingenious, intoxicating of all films. Rating:- *****/*****"

","Almost everyone in China who has seen CHINATOWN has at least one question on their mind: why call it CHINATOWN and what does it have to do with it?<br/><br/>It doesn't matter. The story takes place in LA in the 1930s and 1940s. JAKE, a former police officer, experiences extraordinary things in Chinatown, which makes him have unbearable memories, reasons for leaving to become a private detective and a cynical character. At the end of the story, he returns to Chinatown, where JAKE experiences similar pain again. So on the surface of the story it does matter.<br/><br/>As you can imagine, JAKE was as inquisitive, conscientious and compassionate as he is now as a private detective. Try your best to help those in need, but when he was in Chinatown, his supervisor told him, ""As little As possible."" Because he would not do so, he tried to help some people, but in the end he could not avoid the fact that these people were hurt or died. And the reality still came round and round - the black forces, the powerful forces behind the eradication of the opposition, to protect their own interests, Chinatown is still tang street. JAKE thought there would be a cleaner sky when he left Chinatown, but in the end he was still covered by the cloud over Chinatown. There was no clean place, and he followed the same rules as in Chinatown. Finally, as he watches the woman he wants to protect die in the car, a morbid JAKE hears a cop say, ""Forget it, JAKE, it's Chinatown."" Perhaps he understood. But where does he go from here? No answer.<br/><br/>Tragic ending<br/><br/>The heroine dies in the car, shot in the eye, IMDB said, a metaphor for Greek mythology, and then presses her head on the steering wheel, making a horn sound, which was seen in a previous SCENE. When the heroine Mrs. Mo leaves her daughter/sister's room, just get in the car, JAKE is also in the car, to ask her the truth, this is Mrs. Mo's head is a little despair on the steering wheel, horn suddenly sounded at this time...<br/><br/>The future<br/><br/>Ask JAKE behind, is also The father of The heroine ""you have a lot of money, have no what you can't buy, why did you do it (part of water project, kill people)"" The old man a meaningful said ""The future of The future"" for him, know time is not much, also with my daughter for The child, and killed her husband rob water control of stockpiled The appreciation of land, in order to ""future"" is all this? Whose future? Is it the future of LA? The movie may not give a clear answer.<br/><br/>Kiding?<br/><br/>JAKE starts off as cynical and funny. His series of jokes gradually become ""puns"" as the plot deepens, and they have a deep meaning behind them.<br/><br/>The police found JAKE's phone number on the kitchen wall of the fake Mrs. MOE's house and accused him of being involved. ""isn't that your phone number?"" they asked. JAKE says breezily, ""really? I don't remember if it was my number, and I don't call myself very often.""<br/><br/>JAKE goes to the office of the deputy director of water. The director says, ""after working with someone for a long time, I will know his hobbies, etc., and whether he is a philandel or not."" JAKE raises his eyelids and asks, ""is Mr. Namo a philandel?"" The chief says, ""he doesn't even joke about it."" JAKE says, ""oh, maybe he's serious about it.""<br/><br/>One of the most interesting jokes I found was when the fake Mrs. MOE called JAKE in his office, wanting to tell him something, but worried about the number of people waiting, and asked, ""Are you alone?"" JAKE immediately interjected, ""Isn't everyone?""<br/><br/>Yes, Isn't everyone?"

","""Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.""<br/><br/>A true work of art. A classic that still holds up to this day. With Roman Polanski as the director, Jack Nicholson, and Faye Dunaway's performance, also its film noir approach was enough to hold my attention until the very end.
Chinatown is a mystery film. Jack Nicholson plays Jake Gittes, a private detective who is hired by a woman to investigate her husband's extra-marital affair, finds himself in the middle of the water scandal. Through the course of the film, he realizes that the situation he's in is full of mystery, murder, corruption, and deception.<br/><br/>What makes this film so great is its screenplay which is regarded as one of the greatest screenplays of all time. There isn't a single scene you'd find unnecessary. Every interaction, every choice, even the smallest details have their purposes of being there and do add to the whole of the film. As Jake Gittes figures out something, we as the audience learn about that information too. This isn't just about solving a murder mystery, it also focuses on the hero complex and the dark side of humanity.<br/><br/>You can see the influence of earlier film noir. The haunting and evocative music, the stylistic approach to the cinematography creates a peculiar atmosphere, also its captivating storytelling certainly makes it a genuine film classic that requires multiple viewing. Not that it's complex to understand but to appreciate it fully. As a fellow internet citizen said, ""It's got one of the most depressing endings to a movie, if not the most."" I was sort of in a hypnotic state after finishing the film. I can't talk about this enough. I love everything about this film."

","I won't watch the movie. I won't give you the spoiler of the movie, but I can say that it is a Fritzl noir film (incest) with everyone in the characters not giving key information from the detective which they paid him to hire. Imagine 3 clients from a related group of people hiring Gites. And each of them holding key information and a holds a conspiracy too big to handle. It is actually very easy to write a story with Fritzl type movie with a larger then life conspiracy and a detective who isn't too clear and have no plan. In fact I find it a child's play to write movies where it raises too many questions and nothing can be done about it just to overwhelm the senses. One was that mysterious Hal malfunction in Stanlely Kubrick, although no answer was provided, that was provided by the movie 2010, and 2001 remains somewhat of a mystery. And to make it appear complex is actually easy then to make it simple in any scriptwriting work. While critically acclaimed, because of the secrecy and mystery surrounds the movie, it could be a complete opaque. In any event I don't like the movie because it drags, too mysterious and there's nothing you can do about the crime in Los Angeles. The pass the movie as something you just have to accept. I believe can be done about it, but the veil of mystery is gone. The movie explains nothing and writing this style of movie won't get a blockbuster, audiences and just bore someone to tears. The writing style such as this is also easy to do or imitate and this is not the kind of story writing I like other people to emulate either. It's sloppy work to have any story without a clear story or actions by the characters. It makes for a very sloppy writing and is extremely easy to write. Hence, I find the movie bad.

","This movie is in my opinion the greatest mystery film of all time and also up there in the great films of all time. Easily in the top twenty. Polanski's directing is a masterwork for all time. The movie itself is a whole joy ride. To watch it has been one of the great experiences I have ever had in watching movies. I find it a pity that it had to compete with the Godfather Part II in the same year otherwise it would have gained so much more Oscars. However, Robert Towne couldn't be denied in the best original screenplay category.<br/><br/>As for the performances, they couldn't be any better. Jack gave an Oscar worthy performance and I'm not even sure who I would have picked between him and Al Pacino's equal performance in the second Godfather.

"RJBurke1942","9","2","5","2 January 2008"," You never know what's really going on, especially in Chinatown
","Philosophically, the story of J.J. 'Jake' Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is almost a tragedy: once he was a cop in Chinatown, and made a blunder that cost a woman her life. Now, in this narrative, he's a tough, cynical but fair-minded PI and is about to ignore history  and, as we know, those who ignore it are bound to repeat it...<br/><br/>You see, Jake was hired to expose the putative extra-marital affair of one Hollis Mulwray, a big wig with the water Board for the City of Los Angeles. Trouble is, Mulwray doesn't behave like a man on an affair, but more like one on a mission. So, Jake's intrigued, and even more so as the intrigue deepens when Mulwary turns up dead  drowned. And, as Jake discovers further, murdered.<br/><br/>Tangled up in the murder is, of course, Mrs Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) who, at first, tries to obstruct Jake but later engages his services to find out who killed Hollis. Along the tortuous way, Jake bumps into Noah Cross (John Huston), Mrs Mulwray's father, who just happened to have been partner to Hollis Mulwray years earlier. Cross, in turn, engages Jake to find the young woman who was supposed to be having an affair with Hollis. Why is Cross so interested in that young woman? Indeed...<br/><br/>That's what Jake wants to know too; and the only person he can ask is Mrs Mulwray who, as the story progresses, the LAPD suspect as being the killer of Hollis. But is she? Jake's determined to find out, and so sets an elaborate trap for the person he thinks did the dirty job of killing Hollis; and also devises a daring plan to get Mrs Mulwray to Mexico and beyond the reach of his one-time buddies at the LAPD. Why does Jake do the latter? Because he's in love with her, or so he thinks, and is willing to risk his career, jail, loss of PI license or whatever to make sure she stays free. Trouble is, Jake doesn't realize he's made a terrible blunder again...when he meets her in Chinatown.<br/><br/>In the great tradition of film-noir, Chinatown ranks with the best. The period mise-en-scene is picture perfect; the music soundtrack is quintessentially moody; the dialog is cracking with one-liners and irony; the femme fatale is disturbingly haunting, twice over, as you will discover.<br/><br/>The overall production testifies to the great expense and detail that brought the whole story and cast together. Add the standout performances from Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway and John Huston for the icing to a layer cake mystery that will stay with you for a long time.<br/><br/>Arguably Polanski's best directorial effort and one, in my opinion, that should have won the Oscar for that year. They just don't make movies like this any more. Pity.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

"J. Spurlin","Null","2","5","9 December 2006"," A good private eye film, even if too long and overpraised
","Despite its reputation, ""Chinatown"" lacks the wit, speed and economy of the best movies in the private eye genre: this is no ""Maltese Falcon"" or ""The Big Sleep."" It's not bad: Robert Towne gives us a cleverly convoluted script with some sharp lines; the color photography is seamy and compelling; the bluesy Jerry Goldsmith score is hypnotic; and Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway are the perfect 1970s choices for a 1930s private detective and femme fatale. But these things don't work as well if you're not made to suggest things. Censoring bad language, nudity and violence is not an activity just for prudes and moralists; it also forces filmmakers to work harder. Roman Polanski directs and makes room for his typical grotesquery. One scene in a morgue shows us a naked corpse as set decoration: it just lies there, almost out of sight. Why? If Polanski wanted to shock us, why didn't he give us a full view? Why distract the audience from the main action? Another scene is unintentionally campy. I can't describe it fully without spoiling a surprise, but it's the one where Nicholson repeatedly slaps Dunaway. Her line seems worthy of ""Mommie Dearest."""
"Flagrant-Baronessa","8","2","5","28 July 2006"," Elegantly expressed film noir
","Roman Polanski is one of those directors I just don't trust, much like Lars Von Trier. Controversial, reclusive, scary and you never know what kind of freaky surprise element they're about to present in one of their films. I realise this is not entirely fair but Polanski has just always freaked me out like hell--his attitude, his style. Well, Chinatown is his masterpiece and in spite of its initial controversy in the 1970s, I find it to be one of the 'safer' and more enjoyable films he has directed. This has a lot to do with the presence of Jack Nicholson who adds such a light-hearted, humorous tone to his performance, and it helps make Chinatown more colourful than the average film noir.<br/><br/>Nicholson is in fact wonderfully cocky--like James Bond without the campy one-liners--in a way that only he can be, and he brings this attitude to his character private detective Jake Gittes. He is hired by a woman claiming to be Mrs. Mulwray to spy on her husband, but there is a misunderstanding and suddenly the real Mrs Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) demands that Gittes drop the case immediately. Going against his better judgement, Gittes decides to pursue the investigation anyway and soon is on his way to unlock conspiracies, corruption and murders in the city of L.A.<br/><br/>Chinatown is film noir but it is sprinkled and enriched with colour and some truly spectacularly detailed set designs that capture the elegance of the 1940s America. The cast's performances also enrich the film, in particular Jack Nicholson. The only real flaw in the film is its occasionally extremely slow pace. Normally I wouldn't consider this a flaw, but in Chinatown it almost gets to the point when you stop being involved in the plot because it's moving so slowly. But if you ever get bored, you could always feast your eyes on the gorgeous backgrounds and style.<br/><br/>8/10"
"kwalsh2-1","10","2","5","14 March 2006"," Superb film
","Polanski made ""Chinatown"" in the midst of artistic films. They do not require happy endings or the perfect shots. ""Chinatown"" creates the L.A. scene for a marriage detective, Nicholson, who gets caught up in a murder case. His involvement instigates a relationship with the woman whose life is wrapped up in the murder. However, the movie ends tragically by having the woman die and the murderer runs free. There are signs that point to this ending such as when J.J. surprises Evelyn in her car, she drops her head on the steering wheel and beeps the horn shortly, and dogs barking in the distance follow the sound. The end has Evelyn's head falling into the steering wheel when she is shot, and silence overcomes the crowd as she falls in silence into the detective's hands. The simplistic plot continually develops into a larger, more complex plot. While the movie initially has Nicholson discovering an affair, it turns into a plot for murder, and every movement and sign in the movie points toward something bigger even from the start. The man in the barber tells him that he does not know what he is getting into. This is very accurate, because the plot then takes another twist with the wife coming in saying that the other girl was not the wife. The plot is extremely complex and yet simple enough for the audience to understand. While the plot is very dark, Polanski sets up the atmosphere to match. The offices of Nicholson and Dunaway's husband produce that eerie feeling that something more is going on behind the scenes. Meanwhile, the supporting casts do a superb job in subtly constructing a tone of intricate involvement between each other. Jack Nicholson is a tough detective who seems aloof, but his affection for Dunaway becomes clear as he stands in silence upon her death. Dunaway similarly has a character that the audience seems to think they have pinned down. However, as the film progresses, so does her character. The famous scene where Nicholson slaps her in the face as she says, ""daughter, sister, daughter, sister"" becomes a landmark for showing how confusing it becomes to understand her. Huston darkens her intricate personality, but we do not know the actual problem until that scene. Meanwhile, Huston effectively comes across as an innocent old man, when he is the darkest character in the film. The actors all did an amazing job of successfully attaining that complex role while making it look simplistic."
"andrew7","10","2","5","27 February 2002"," Brilliant Modern Noir
","Film noir doesn't get any better than this.  Gone are the cookie cutter cliches that litter the less imaginative of the genre.  Instead, we have a film propelled by a rare depth, attention to detail, and desire for realism. Thanks to the more permissive cultural environment surrounding filmmaking in the 1970s, we get a movie of haunting power which would be as impossible to make today as it would have been in the 40s.<br/><br/>All the elements of classic film noir are present.  We have a tough, gritty private detective.  On the outside, he's a cold man.  But we sense a great weight on his shoulders, and in the end we see that he is motivated more than he lets on by heroic qualities hidden in his own nature.  We have a beautiful, mysterious, and quite possibly dangerous ""femme fatale"".  We have a convoluted plot, which seems to kick off simply enough, but soon spirals out of all control.  We have color photography.<br/><br/>Wait a minute?  Black and white photography is a staple of film noir!  How you have film noir in color?  I don't know, but it works.  The film has a kind of dry, parched look to it.  The colors are very dull and muted. Everything is sort of drab and brown.  It's a wonderful look, and it's essential to the ambience of the film.<br/><br/>But what really makes this stand out from the crowd is the realism of the story.  J. J. Gittes is a far more real character than Phillip Marlowe or Sam Spade.  Like those who came before him, Gittes has a casual, relaxed demeanor, a sharp sense of humor, and a no-nonsense tough-guy persona. But he's not half as slick as those others.  His dialogue, every bit as colorful as Marlowe's or Spade's, has far less of the Hollywood polish and wit to it.<br/><br/>
The story is really remarkable.  Of course, the censors would have gone insane over this script back in the 40s.  I mean, not only is it a lot too sexually explicit, but the ending is all wrong.  This is what makes ""Chinatown"" such a great film in its own right, and not just another modern homage to great films of the past.  It takes full advantage of the tenor of the times to create a story that couldn't have been done before.<br/><br/>
The story is very complex and challenges the viewer to connect their own dots.  The big picture is easy enough to understand, but the details are easy to overlook.  Fortunately, ""Chinatown"" stays focused on the story, and never lets the stars get in the way.<br/><br/>I'm shocked to see people disapproving of the ending of this film.  I'm even more shocked to see that scriptwriter Bob Towne disagreed with Polanski over it during the production of the film.  How could this film end any differently?  The whole thing is constantly building up this idea of Chinatown, where the best thing to do is as little as possible.  In order for the film to hang together, to stay true to its thematic core, there must be a tragic ending.  This isn't Roman Polanski shooting a dark film to fit his dark mood, this is a capable and astute director filming the only ending that matters.  If the film had ended the other way, you could still say it was a very good film.  I mean, the cast would still be uniformly excellent. The story would still be fascinating and shocking.  The cinematography would have been the same.  But it's heart would have been cut out.  And it could never have been the classic that is today.<br/><br/>This is one of the very best films ever made."
"Celes","10","2","5","5 November 1998"," The best film ever.

","Having just viewed ""Chinatown"" for the second time, I can call it quite possibly the greatest film ever made--a model of cinematic perfection that may have never been equalled, at least as far as I have seen.  It took a brazenly ambitious concept--a film noir in color--and pulled it off masterfully, managing to incorporate sunlight into the noir milieu and creating a palette that reflected the parched, burned-out atmosphere.  And unlike many old noirs, it does not compromise its mood with a ridiculous happy ending, but rather one that completes its gloomy, desperate vision in a setting that makes perfect thematic sense.  The script, the acting, the music, the costumes--along with Polanski's direction these mesh perfectly together to create a whole and coherent artistic vision.  A masterpiece."

","I saw ""Chinatown"" for the first time just a few days ago, and I must say that it is one of the greatest films that I have ever had the pleasure to watch.  The plot is simply fascinating -- one cannot help but to be enthralled by the constantly unwravelling story.  Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, and John Huston all give brilliant performances which complement the flawless screenplay (which won an acadmey award, unlike the film itself, which lost to the sequel to ""The Godfather"").  The noir style of this film is not simply a throwback to the classics of the 1930s and 40s; it is noir at its best, something to be enjoyed on its own.  I've read some comments here by people who are afraid that today's generation will find this movie slow-moving or boring; I have to disagree with this assertion, as I, at the age of 18, was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time.  This is, quite simply, a masterpiece."
"alafolle","10","2","5","26 June 2000"," One of the very best...
","""Chinatown"" is the sort of film which could only have been made in the early 1970s--after the veil of censorship was lifted, allowing filmmakers to explore the dark, gritty side of life and address controversial topics, but before the major studios completely lost their old-fashioned class and style.  It is the link between the classic film-noir of the 1940s and the recent renaissance in the genre that has produced films like ""L.A. Confidential"".  It's also a damn good movie... one of my all-time favorites.<br/><br/>
Jack Nicholson is fantastic as Jake, the anti-hero gumshoe with a checkered past, who uncovers a dark conspiracy.  Faye Dunaway also gives a solid performance in a very complex role, and John Huston plays a wonderfully malevolent villain.  Director Roman Polanski brilliantly captures the atmosphere of 1930s LA, with its stark contrasts: sunshine and dark underworlds, personal freedom and powerful corrupt elites, beautiful people and ugly secrets.  The plot twists and turns wildly but not implausibly.  We follow Jake as he puts together a very complicated puzzle and runs afoul of the wrong people.  The action builds in a crescendo to one of the most unexpected and memorable endings in cinematic history.<br/><br/>It's no coincidence that this movie came out in 1974, the year in which the long and sordid Watergate scandal brought down a corrupt and dangerous President.  ""Chinatown"" reflects the mood of the times--the men in power are amoral and self-serving, the police are part of the problem, an individual has little chance against the system.  Yet, with its setting in the fondly-remembered past, ""Chinatown"" clearly carries the message that the American Dream has always had an ugly side...  the happy ending has always been a hollow lie.  Both groundbreaking and timeless, this is one of the truly great films."

"Steffi_P","9","2","6","27 October 2007"," ""Forget it Jake, it's Chinatown""
","Only fifteen or so years after the classic film noir cycle had run its course, and not really that long since film theorists began to universally recognise it as a genre, the film noir was back as a subject for stylish nostalgic homage. But Chinatown is no lazy bundle of clichés  it draws together everything that was great about film noir, and was put in the hands of one of the most talented directors and some of the greatest actors of the day.<br/><br/>Story-wise this is very much the archetypal film noir, reminiscent of The Maltese Falcon, The Big Heat, Kiss Me Deadly, Vertigo, Touch of Evil and many others, and with a plot equally as complex and skilfully woven as those classics. You have the political corruption, the cynical private eye hero and the femme fatale, not to mention the atmosphere of absolute despair, regret and the terrifying power of evil people. But Chinatown has much more than that  it was made in an era when cinema was shorn of many of its conventions and the burdens of censorship and is therefore more daring and more grown up. The characters are at once stylised references to film noir figures and at the same fully rounded and believable individuals. The dialogue is both memorable and realistic. Robert Towne's screenplay also had some invaluable modifications from director Roman Polanski, most notably a change to the ending, although I won't spoil that here.<br/><br/>Two things really stand out about Polanski's direction of Chinatown. First is his use of colour. The bulk of the film is composed in drab browns and greys, which evoke the era, as well as the theme of drought. Polanski had a great talent for being incredibly restrained when it came to colour, and really it's not so much about putting the right colours in, it's about keeping the wrong colours  the bold ones  out. He doesn't let so much as a brightly coloured button sneak into the shot, the exception to this being when he wants to draw attention to something or create a shift in mood. For example the blaring neon lights of the final sequence are a counterpoint to the rest of the film, and really help to ratchet up the power of the finale.<br/><br/>The second thing that stands out is Polanski's use of space. Just like Alfred Hitchcock could create suspense out of nothing, Polanski creates a sense of confinement out of nothing. A lot of Chinatown takes place outdoors and in wide open spaces, but by this point Polanski's skill and confidence was such that he didn't need cramped apartments or castles to create claustrophobic spaces. Here he creates the same feeling with shots through car windscreens, Venetian blinds or even just a few carefully chosen items in the foreground. Chinatown is bizarrely shot in scope ratio, but whereas normally the ratio is used to open out the shot widthways, in Polanski's hands it is almost as if it is compressing the image height-wise.<br/><br/>Also crucial to the mix is the spot-on casting. These were great roles for Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. This is perhaps Nicholson's career best  a deep, restrained performance in contrast to his comfort zone of playing energetic lunatics. The real masterstroke though was casting John Huston as Noah Cross. Obviously he was a major figure in classic film noir, but he also really gets his teeth into this role. It's also a nice touch to have someone who can make Jack Nicholson look small.<br/><br/>Chinatown comes from the beginning of the age in which cinema became more and more retrospective and nostalgic, but nostalgia rarely comes better than this. A lot of people, myself included, didn't like Chinatown upon first seeing it, but it tends to grow on people. It's a very impressive picture."

"jay4stein79-1","Null","2","6","3 November 2004"," Pitch-Perfect
","As a high school student, I grew enamored with the cult of Jack Nicholson. To me, he encapsulated everything I wanted to be: aloof, rebellious, and, above all, wicked cool. Of course, I was basing my perception of him on the roles he played on screen - not the best judge of a man, as he was 'acting.' Nevertheless, the idea of Jack appealed to me, even if it was mythic.<br/><br/>In any event, he represents the first actor over whom I became obsessed. I've seen, I think, all of his movies from Easy Rider on and have watched a handful of those old B-movies (The Terror, some random westerns) in which he appeared as well. Though my older self often finds his performances grating (sometime in the early 80s he decided to play each role the same way), I still find his work in the 1970s fantastic - among the greatest work by any American actor.<br/><br/>The apogee of his acting career, for me, has always been his portrayal of Jake Gittes in Chinatown. Yes, he's astounding in Easy Rider (in comparison to Peter Fonda's wooden performance it'd be difficult to appear otherwise), Five Easy Pieces, the Last Detail, Cuckoo's Nest, King of Marvin Gardens, Prizzi's Honor, and About Schmidt (his best performance since Prizzi's), but as J.J. he truly amazes.<br/><br/>He provides his detective the one thing Bogie never gave Marlowe or Spade - a softness. Yes, Jake Gittes is for the most part a sexist, violent, egotistical man (as all detective have been since the Black Mask started printing Hammett's stories), but there is a Romantic under-current to his character that hits the audience from the title screen onward.<br/><br/>Jake Gittes' machismo, unlike that of Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe (the filmed version - Chandler's Marlowe has more depth and is ), is a put-on - a cover that helps him ignore his pain, his emotions. Spade was a reprehensible womanizer and terrible friend. Marlowe wasn't much better. Neither of them, though, had a reason. Gittes does and Nicholson does a tremendous job showing the audience that below the masculine sheen something troubles Jake. He compensates for the pain of what happened in Chinatown by slapping Evelyn around and by taking on her father.<br/><br/>The look upon Nicholson's face in the famous 'sister/daughter' scene is priceless. As he slaps Ms. Mulwray, he grimaces and we see that Jake hates what he is doing - he loves Evelyn, can't bear to hurt her, but feels he must in order to conform to stereotypical gender behavior and hide away his pain. Jake Gittes is the most conflicted and tortured private eye in film history and, I think, only Nicholson could give that performance.<br/><br/>The other performances are equally memorable. Faye Dunaway is fantastic as Evelyn Mulwray, managing to make her sympathetic without allowing Mulwray to be cloying. John Huston, as her father, though, amazes nearly as much as Nicholson. In the film, Huston somehow manages to create one of the most terrifying villains of all time. His Noah Cross seems perfectly civilized on the surface but Huston gives Cross an edge. When he discusses eating fish with the heads still attached you cannot help but cringe; there's simply something so evil and slimy about him as he hunches over and eats the fish. We never see him act evil, but, through Huston's performance, we know.<br/><br/>However, wonderful performances never create a great movie; they are only part of a great movie. Chinatown contains every component that makes a great film. The script never misses a beat, paying homage to and updating the detective movie (not necessarily the film noir, though, but that's another story). It also creates a perfectly realized and fascinating world through its cinematography and set design. Watching Chinatown, the audience feels as if they are in 1930s Los Angeles and can taste the dusty streets and feel the grimy heat on its neck. Moreover, Polanski's direction infuses the film with a certain European, existential dread that only an Eastern European could concoct.<br/><br/>Chinatown would not be so fantastic, so perfect had another director helmed the project. No one else could have made a movie that is as paranoid and as pessimistic about our place in the world as Polanski did. It makes me happy that he made one great movie before being run out of town as a pedophile.<br/><br/>*Spoilers* I probably stand alone in the belief that Chinatown is the greatest movie ever made, but I do not stand alone in saying this film is absolutely brilliant. Some may find the sour ending too glum, but think for a moment - would a happy ending ever have worked? Doesn't the movie's tragic mode require Gittes to endure yet another Chinatown? I believe it does and therefore must ignore complaints about the movie's ending; it could not end any other way."

The ending itself is a brave one and something you will not see in today's Hollywood gloss."
"CharlieB-5","Null","2","6","19 October 2002"," Water and Power
","What makes Chinatown so good? It begins with Robert Towne's screenplay, which resonates on many levels. The story is about water,  ""Where life begins"", as wealthy businessman Noah Cross (John Huston) tells J.J. Gittes (Jack Nicholson), a private investigator with more moxie than polish. Who controls water has power. Water runs underground, its ebb and flow controlled by forces that we do not understand. <br/><br/>You can think of water as the unconscious, the id, capitalism, the government, the powers that be, insert your own symbolism and it works. It's the classic Noir cosmology: the hero is just a little man in the big city, and there are forces beyond his control that determine his destiny. ""You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me you don't"", Noah Cross tells Gittes. The implications reverberate through the lives of all the characters. <br/><br/>The production design and cinematography are beautiful. The locations capture the look and feel of pre-WW II Los Angeles. Jerry Goldsmith's score moves from lush and romantic to sparse and dissonant at all the appropriate moments. Roman Polanski shows that a Pole can understand of the American Private Detective tradition as well as the German Billy Wilder.  Nicholson has the guts to play a romantic lead with a bandage on his nose through half the movie. John Huston uses his small amount of screen time to create a frightening and memorable portrait of corrupted wealth. If there is a false note in the movie, it might be in the chemistry between Nicholson's Gittes and the beautiful but fragile Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway). While everyone quotes the last line of the movie, Dunaway has a great Noir line: ""I don't get tough with anyone, Mr. Gittes. My lawyer does.""<br/><br/>This movie deserves its reputation as a classic. You can revisit it many times, and still have fun exploring the labyrinths of Chinatown."

From what I had heard and read about this film was that it was as good or better than other 1970s movies such as ""The Godfather"", ""The Conversation"", ""The Sting"", or ""Taxi Driver"". I thought this was a very good movie, but not an excellent movie and definitely not as good as the Francis Ford Coppola movies of this time.<br/><br/>Chinatown seemed a bit slow and long to me. I did like Jack Nicolson's performance however, but his acting along with the good directing wasn't enough for me to call it an excellent movie. The performances of the other actors was good, but I didn't think it was great.<br/><br/>I'll watch this movie again in a few months, maybe then I'll feel more highly about it.<br/><br/>I rate this movie a generous 7 out of 10. I was thinking of rating it a 6."

","It took a long time between the golden age of this genre and Chinatown. Surprisingly, a european has to show America how to resurrect it. All in this movie is just evil. Nicholson is evil great, Dunaway evil mysterious and Huston and Polanski himself are just only evil, but...(he,he,he). Every detail fits in its place, the Academy Award for Towne's screenplay is quite o.k., but it doesn't hit me out of my chair. Perhaps it takes just a few minutes too long to chill me, perhaps it's only Faye Dunaway. I don't know. But that's the problem. Sometimes you see a movie, something is wrong, and you don't know what. The final kick as it exists in ""Farewell, my lovely"" with Bob Mitchum is missing. Nevertheless, Chinatown is seven points worth to me. A good attempt (for the first try after such a long time) and much, much better as it's sequel."
"truemythmedia","10","1","2","13 May 2019"," One of the Best of the Best
","Noir films were more a part of the cultural mainstream during the 1930s through the 1950s than they are today. Hardboiled detective films used to flood the theaters of yesteryear as superhero films flood theaters today. Everyone from Humphrey Bogart (""The Maltese Falcon"") to Jimmy Stewart (""Vertigo"") to Orson Welles (""The Third Man"") donned the fedora and proverbial magnifying glass. ""Chinatown"" might have arrived thirty years past the primetime of noir films, but it still is one of the best of the genre.
Jake himself is one of the better noir protagonists, because while he might fit some of the detective tropes, he also makes the role his own. One of the main things that make Jake interesting is the journey he takes a character. When we first meet Jake, he doesn't seem particularly content in his work; he seems to be doing it just to make ends meet. But as the film goes on, we watch as Jake's casual approach to his job falls away, and he frantically scrambles to find out what happens. Watching Jake shift from an uncaring and distant detective to a detective so personally involved in the case not only makes him a thrilling character, it makes the ending so much more intense and tragic.
Another thing I really like about this film is that nothing really feels forced as far as storyline. I've read my fair share of mystery novels and seen more than my fair share of mystery movies, and it always bugs me how many overly coincidental moments play into the detective (or protagonist) solving the mystery. Even in some of Polanski's other works, I've taken issue with the way some revelations are handled. For example, in ""The Ghost Writer"", there's a scene where the protagonist (played by Ewan McGregor) gets information only because he gets caught on the other side of an island during a rainstorm and he just happens to stop at a house where a character saw some vital information and was willing to relay it to the protagonist. That whole scene felt incredibly coincidental, yet the film wouldn't have worked without it. ""Chinatown"" doesn't really have any of those moments; instead, the script is drum-tight.
Without going into any details, just know that the last scene of this film is the scene that solidifies its greatness. The ending sells the bleakness of the themes and world in a way that feels tragic but totally unavoidable. No matter what Jake did, the film was always going to end the way that it did, and that really emphasizes the hopelessness of the world that Polanski has so carefully crafted. It might not be a happy film (this is Polanski we're talking about- he doesn't have many happy films), but it is a brilliant representation of the noir genre, and one of the most memorable detective films of all time."

","Roman Polanski's landmark, marvelously complex, classic film noir masterpiece, which is a fascinating mystery which is set in 1930s Los Angeles. Private detective J.J. Gittes, played to perfection by Jack Nicholson in bravura performance which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, gets hired by a mysterious femme fatale named Evelyn Mulwray, played beautifully by Faye Dunaway in a brilliant Oscar nominated performance of great subtlety, to investigate her husband Hollis, the chief engineer of the water department of an extra-marital affair. Gittes is swept into a web of double dealings, deceits, political scandals and murder, all leading to an unforgettable and powerful climatic in 'Chinatown.' Masterful direction by Polanski, with a captivating and intelligent Oscar winning original screenplay by Robert Towne, stunning cinematography by John A, Alonzo, and an evocative, dynamic score by the late great Jerry Goldsmith. This tour-de-force benefits greatly from the superlative supporting performances by Perry Lopez, John Hillerman, Diane Ladd, Darrell Zwerling, Burt Young, Bruce Glover, and James Hong. Special kudos must go to the late great director and character actor John Huston for his magnificent portrayal of the perverted and monstrously evil landowner Noah Cross. Roman Polanski makes a memorable cameo appearance as a short, sadistic switchblade wielding thug who savagely cuts Nicholson's nose. ""Chinatown"" stands as one of the true great classic films of 'the 70s. A cinematic treasure that was nominated for 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director: Roman Polanski. Highly recommended."

","In this movie Jack Nicholson is in his prime of acting and does a fantastic job playing the dirty detective. Faye Dunaway and Nicholson seemed to have a good and natural relationship on screen. Nicholson does an absolute fantastic job about balancing between being extremely serious and quite funny. Despite this movie being a mystery, drama, and film noir movie, I found myself laughing at many points throughout the film. I noticed that Polanski, the director, uses widescreen to film in this movie and it really works to enrapture everything for him. I was not a big fan of the ending like I know many other people were not. It did not seem like fate or destiny to me like it was supposed to. Just through the flawless acting of Jack Nicholson, it is unforgettable and I would recommend this movie to anyone."

Gittes (Nicholson) is working on an adultery case but quickly finds himself embroiled in murder and corruption.<br/><br/>The gathering of Polanski, Towne, Nicholson and Robert Evans (producer) put their respective skills together to craft one of the most lauded neo-noir films of all time. It's a searing picture awash with the staples of the film noir and gumshoe detective movies that graced cinema in the 40s and 50s. From the characterisations (suspicious femmes - mouthy coppers - sleazy kingpin - tough protagonist in a whirlpool of unravelling layers), to the hard boiled script, violence, sex and brutal revelations, it's a noir essential that only lacks chiaroscuro and expressionistic swirls to seal the complete deal.<br/><br/>Allegories unbound, iconography assured and dialogue now in the lexicon of legends, Chinatown is not to be missed, not just by fans of noir, but fans of cinema, period. 9.5/10"
"willcundallreview","9","1","2","25 April 2015"," A marvellous film with lots of marvellous things
","Rating-9/10 <br/><br/>Chinatown is a classic movie that is still talked of today as one of the very best. To be fair there is no doubting that this is superbly acted and the same goes for the writing and directing which all together makes this a fine film in cinema history. It also stays a mystery and never gives up the ending easily and leaves you not only guessing but also thinking about all the intricate details going on.<br/><br/>Now Chinatown doesn't have the most exciting story, or maybe the premise doesn't seem exciting but the movie itself is good when it comes to the depth involved. The story is so well researched and so well put together, you don't need big thrills and gunshots everywhere to be made to enjoy this piece. I think one big thing about the plot is it's level of detail as mentioned as it is just overly detailed and really makes the plot thicker if anything.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson portrays J.J. Gittes with a certain ease In his demeanour and a kind of worked out character that seems planned and as if Nicholson put a lot of work in before taking the role. Cast such as Faye Dunaway do a top job too here and she seems calm and yet her character is very complex and hard to figure out what's going on with her, the certain chemistry if you will between Nicholson and Dunaway could be analysed over and over and you can really see Gittes does not understand her fully. <br/><br/>Robert Towne the writer creates a script that is considered among the very best in cinema, and I mean worldwide. It is calm and calculated and Towne makes a screenplay something more than well, a screenplay, he creates drama and intrigue in all the right places. The script is slow but somehow Towne makes it exciting in a way and lets you watch with an air of what's next around the corner, just a top job from a top writer.<br/><br/>The neo-noir style is in abundance, but it is safe in it's pickings of where to put it, it isn't overused in any case and when the biggest examples of neo-noir are seen, they work very well. I felt the score that is in line with the neo-noir style is a fine one and the late Jerry Goldsmith does a magnificent job in making quite bland and ordinary scenes seem yet again, exciting and also gives a lovely air of mystery even in the music.<br/><br/>You know many films we see the cinematography over looked and not really thought of as one of the highlights, but here it very much is the case and a big one. John Alonzo was nominated for an Oscar for his work but the fact that when people mention this they only go for the directing, writing and acting is an insult to the beautiful craft Alonzo creates. The shots are just so well timed and the close ups and very few cuts make this ahead of it's time in camera work for movies.<br/><br/>Overall I felt it to be firmly a brilliant movie and one that should stay with the viewer no matter what they felt about it. I do feel this is overrated and without shooting me here me out, I can see why people love this and it definitely isn't a mystery why, it is just I didn't find this exciting enough to be flawless, but is still a wonderful and glorious movie that even with just what I say, is still near the very top."

","I absolutely loved this film although I found the ending completely heartbreaking. I also found there to be an electricity in the sex scene in the film that few movies from any era can produce. I felt that this film was a beautifully made and well acted commentary on themes such as the corrupt nature of authority figures, the oppressive nature of dark secrets, and the physical and emotional frailty of those who try to stand up to corruption against powerful authority figures. I also found the many references to the ""water wars"" to be fairly poignant giving that I am currently living in California in the midst of a drought.

"Vartiainen","Null","1","2","24 November 2014"," Classic neo-noir
","One of the penultimate film-noir films and one of the best Jack Nicholson movies as well. Chinatown is a slowly unraveling mystery story at its best, each scene slowly building the suspense, offering hints to the final solution, yet that final twist is there to left us gaping in horror and awe.<br/><br/>The movie's greatest strengths are its iron tight script and its cast. The story takes place in the early 20th century LA, during a time of great drought. J.J. ""Jake"" Gittes (Nicholson), a private detective of some skill, is hired to spy on one of the players in the so called Water Wars. Not everything goes as planned and Gites finds himself pulled deeper into the mystery, mostly against his will, as it often happens. Along the way he encounters murder, corruption, old feuds, high class women, rich tycoons and misleading answers. It's considered one of the classic film-noir movies for a reason, yet it updates the formula somewhat in good neo-noir fashion by deviating from the old character stereotypes - a welcome change.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson is also on a roll in this movie. He has been born to play characters such as these and Gites might very well be one of his best. He's everything. Arrogant, sly, quite the ladies man, intelligent, witty, too large for the world and all around bad ass. The rest of the cast are up to the task, with special mention going to old Hollywood legend John Huston, playing one of the water tycoons.<br/><br/>Chinatown is a must see for all ones of detective and mystery stories. It's an all around well-acted, -produced, -directed and -executed film. One of the classics."
"braddugg","10","1","2","19 September 2014"," Mesmerizing and mysterious and so authentically made.
","Mesmerizing and mysterious and so authentically made.<br/><br/>Its hard not to delve into the script right from the first frame, as the reels goes on, characters become more mysterious, more secrets are revealed and more questions raised, is it about water and the power to hold water or something much beyond that, if that's one question, then why is Jake so interested in things like Evelyn Cross. <br/><br/>Jake Gittes is played by Jack Nicholson and he is done an exceptional job and so did so many others, in fact all of them must be applauded for acting. Now for such supreme acting to be extracted, the director takes a toll and here we have Roman Polanski at the helm and its his take on the script thats makes it more dark and interesting. <br/><br/>Robert Towne has produced a screenplay thats is superbly written, fast paced for its 140 minutes length and becomes more interesting till the last frame, dialogues are written so well, that they are mystique when we hear and are so self explanatory when it happens in the film. The best dialogue that astonished me is ""She is my sister and my daughter"" does anyone expect this all through the film, I very much doubt. The pace holds it up well and is written with enough moments of dark humor, its not sarcastic or finding flaws in system, but finding flaws in person who are a BIG part of the system and are the main drivers of it. So it's psychological more than incident based. I believe, Robert Towne wrote it as incident based screenplay but Roman Polanski who has made even THE PIANIST as an extremely psychological film is who raises above the script and makes it a masterpiece.<br/><br/>I will go with 5/5 and a best writing for Robert Towne, best acting for Jack Nicholson and best direction for Roman Polanski are my awards. Just watch it please.<br/><br/>Also, I got to know of this film through the equally well adapted Hindi film, ""Manorama Six Feet Under"" which is well worth a watch will review that later."
"Mr-Fusion","9","1","2","25 June 2014"," Proves it's not just a noir poser; superb thriller
","For my money, Jerry Goldsmith's ""Main Theme"" for CHINATOWN is one of the all-time great pieces of film music. Both seductive and melancholy, it instantly evokes the period setting of the film and the ridiculously bleak nature of the story. <br/><br/>And it is one hell of a story; a grade-A film noir with a unique Water & Power angle that serves as a red herring to the real narrative substance. It's well-written and proves John A. Alonzo was one of the great cinematographers (there's some brilliant shot composition here). But it really comes down to the core cast. Nicholson fits into the PI mold well, both educated and crude around women, while John Huston, playing a monumental scumbag, brings the affable charm to really highlight the menace. Faye Dunaway ably pulls off the femme fatale component, until we realize that she's the film's heroine . . . unbelievably tragic though that is. <br/><br/>It's the kind of movie that gets under your skin and stays there. Both the ending and final line are a testament to '70s filmmaking, with the balls to forego a happy epilogue for all involved. You couldn't make this movie today, and it sits on the top-shelf with the finest movies of its decade. <br/><br/>It just gets better with every watch.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Film noir is a genre that consists a sense of pessimism. It is a style in the cinema that can be described as dark, depressing and twisted. In the film noir world, the cops are crooked, the women are devious and the hero is a man who can't seem to understand anything that is being investigated. By the end of this long-lasting journey through intrigue and mystery, you will find the truth and the truth will or can be deceiving.<br/><br/>Enter J.J. Gittes. Gittes (Jack Nicholson), is a hard-working private eye, who's specializes in eavesdropping on cheating wives and husbands. His job consists of dropping onto a conversation between the cheating wife or husband and snapping photographs of the two of them together. One day, Gittes finds out that a client wants him to take pictures of her cheating husband. The husband is a chief engineer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Learning that he is building a reservoir and that people are opposing his construction of the reservoir, Gittes decides to follow the chief engineer around, taking photographs of him and his adulterous lover. Now, you might think I am telling the first half of the story. Well, I am. The reason why is because the story of Chinatown is a lot twisted than you think.<br/><br/>After Gittes finds out about the cheating husband, he soon finds out that the woman he met in his office is not the same woman he met before. Enter the second character of the story, Evelyn Mulwray, (Faye Dunaway). She is the actual wife of the chief engineer. But, who was the client that was in Gittes' office? Anyway, Gittes continues his investigation and winds up having his nose cut from a punk, (Roman Polanski), and having to find out that water is the main clue of the murder. But, wait a minute.... The chief engineer is in control of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Why would someone kill him? <br/><br/>The story deepens as Gittes meets up with Noah Cross, (John Huston), during his investigation. Now, there are two people involved in this mystery. More clues start to pop up. And Gittes? Well, he's in way over his head. I guess the truth is going to be hard to get to.<br/><br/>Chinatown is in the great tradition of the film-noir movies of the 1940's. In fact, the story takes place in 1937 Los Angeles. Director Roman Polanski creates a very dark and disturbing underworld where sometimes the truth can lead to dangerous circumstances. The set direction and costume design are very well done and builds a certain amount of authenticity as both a period picture and as a film noir movie. The way Los Angeles is portrayed as a city of mystery is great because there is so much going on in this metropolis that we, as the audience, are caught between two ongoing problems: the water issue and Gittes' investigation.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson is perhaps, one of the best and most hard-working actors of our time. He creates, what I think, one of his best and most memorable performances in his career. He portrays Jake Gittes as both a man and a detective, who understands something about bad luck since he been to that place. Here, his presence makes the film works because he can't seem to penetrate this strange and mixed up world that seems different to us since he can't understand everything he's given. The more he feeds himself into this world, the more knowledge he will gained. Every time he gets closer to the clues, he ends up having to be drawn back to himself. One scene that proves this point is when Gittes' nose is cut by Polanski. Every step is dangerous, according to Gittes.<br/><br/>I also enjoy and really admired the performances by Dunaway and Huston. Dunaway is stunning as Mulwray, creating a character, who at first, isn't pleased by Gittes' joke, but soon comes to terms and becomes Gittes' helper as she begins to explore the underworld with him. Together, you might think that there's a chemistry between the two, but really, these two characters are somehow locked up in this underworld, where everything is not what is seems to be, according to the characters. John Huston is very convincing as Noah Cross, a man who's questions are startling to Gittes since he is crossing that invisible line between discovery and the truth. In one scene, he advised Jake, ""You don't what you're dealing with. You just don't""<br/><br/>Robert Towne's screenplay for the movie is a captivating script that is filled with authentic dialogue, which illustrates the world of 1937 Los Angeles and also creates sharp conversations between all of the characters. There are a lot of great well-written and well-spoken lines in Chinatown that can be dared to be said. <br/><br/>I wish more storytellers can tell more stories like this one. It is also equivalent to a great book, one that you can't simply put down. I have had that feeling while watching Chinatown. I just couldn't stop watching and for the most of the time, I was more focused on every bit of detail and aspect that this movie had to offer. The first time you might not understand everything that is being done. But, when you see it the second time around, you will understand how everything falls into place. In fact, maybe we can learn something about the littlest details, like water. ★★★★ 4 stars."

That's the kind of imprint this film leaves. <br/><br/>Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway are perfect in their roles as a cynical private detective and a mysterious and beautiful femme fatale, respectively (of course). I thought the lighting was suiting, the camera-work was appropriate, but not over the top. The score wasn't unusual, so it wasn't all that important, but who cares? It's a dramatic film, and a predictable dramatic score is fitting. The actual music involved is jazzy and well-placed. The plot is gripping and riveting; so seeing this film is definitely an interesting way to spend an evening.<br/><br/>Overall, an enthralling film that couldn't possible bore anyone, and a fun dramatic movie to watch if you like that sort of plot.

"tadpole-596-918256","9","1","2","26 November 2013"," Director Roman Polanski blows the whistle on America . . .
",". . . in his masterwork movie, CHINATOWN. All of our brave soldiers have died so that government of the rich people, by the rich people, and for the rich people shall not perish, Polanski proves here. As the film's richest character, Noah Cross says, rich people can even surprise themselves when they notice how evil they have become. After knocking up his own daughter in her mid-teens, he's hell-bent in having the local police aid and abet him in his craving to gain carnal knowledge of his daughter\granddaughter, Katherine. When his business partner, Hollis, objects, Noah drowns Hollis in Hollis' own fish pond. Noah has the police cover this up for him, of course.<br/><br/>Noah, as you might have noticed, can do ANYTHING he wants, with the full support of the local police. This is because he is the richest Angelino, and he's about to become at least twice as rich, thanks to his scheme to triple the land area of Los Angeles through his manipulation of the water supply. Though everything that Noah does is unconstitutional, the U.S. Constitution and the Holy Bible get far less of his respect than toilet paper. Polanski also aims to prove that American police are the dumbest segment of the world population. Most of the cops in CHINATOWN are eager to commit any outrage imaginable for fewer pay crumbs off the rich man's table than even the butler is paid. These crime enablers derive their main payment vicariously, because they are bullies at heart and would work as henchmen for Noah and his ilk at no pay at all. They glory in making everyone else grovel at Noah's feet, forced to worship his accumulated mountain of gold.<br/><br/>The self-anointed ""good cops"" in CHINATOWN's world are the most stupid of all. Private Eye Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson)'s ""back story"" is that he tried to be a ""good cop"" in L.A.'s Chinatown, but got his lover killed. He thinks he can quit the LAPD and outwit the rich. Instead, he gets a new lover killed in Chinatown, and condemns another 15-year-old girl to the hell of incest at the hands of her billionaire grandfather. This TRUE STORY of the origins of Los Angeles, and the moral character of her founding father, raised a few hackles. Noah Cross' heirs ordered President Nixon to have Polanski's family butchered by C.I.A. operatives. They also trumped up bogus charges directly taken from CHINATOWN's Oscar-winning script to prevent Polanski from ever setting foot in America again, effectively silencing this lone voice crying out a warning from our wasteland. Everything is this review is TRUE--you can see most of it documented just by watching CHINATOWN. (If it were NOT true, there would not have been such a conflagration launched against the Polanski family!) Anyone who is brave and has a good heart will understand. As for the rest of you, Nicholson sums it up the best: ""YOU JUST CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!!"""
"vincentlynch-moonoi","7","1","2","31 October 2013"," Great film-making with some flaws
","This is an exceptional, yet flawed film.<br/><br/>Biggest pro: Exceptional acting by pretty much all involved. Biggest con: Overly long, could have benefited from tighter editing.<br/><br/>This is probably the film that put Jack Nicholson over as a broad-based popular actor. Prior to this, most of his screen appearances were either minor or lay somewhere in the cult film genre that appealed to a narrow audience. With this film, however, serious moviegoers across the spectrum could enjoy what I would have to call a nearly flawless performance. I've never cared much for Faye Dunaway, but liked her here. Frankly, I think this must have been a difficult role for her -- a character who has something very sinister to hide and who constantly crosses the line in terms of truth and honesty. Nicely done.<br/><br/>John Huston -- nearly always a gem -- is no less so here. If anything, we could have used a little more of him throughout the film, although I suppose that would have pointed to him as the ""bad guy"" long before director Polanski wanted to make that obvious. Perry Lopez was excellent as a police detective. And it was nice to see John Hillerman.<br/><br/>As indicated, at about 2 hours and 10 minutes, the film could have been more tightly edited. At points it seemed to drag a bit. And although this viewpoint is debatable, Polanski decided to keep the viewer in the dark about what was really happening in the story line for longer than I would have liked. I'm more an upfront guy -- give me the basics of the plot early on, and then I can enjoy the journey more. Polanski decided to let the story emerge just as it emerged in Nicholson's character's mind...but that often left us wondering what was going on, as well. The one thing in my mind that I question is -- what was so good about this case that would make Nicholson risk his life? At some point wouldn't a smart PI have just walked away from it all or brought the police in?<br/><br/>A real plus should go into the ""sets"". Very realistic for the era depicted.<br/><br/>Highly recommended, despite a few flaws, although it may not be a film you want to go back and watch over and over again. It falls in that same genre as the more modern ""The Usual Suspects""."

That is why the film is titled Chinatown, because it represents a time in Jake's (Nicholson's character) life where he wasn't able to make a difference in the police force and became cynical towards the world. ""Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown"" is what they told him, and that is why he decided to retire and become a private investigator working on his own. He doesn't want to forget it, he wants to catch the bad guys and balance things out. He doesn't want these rich executives to continue thinking they can get away with anything. That is exactly why he decides to investigate things on his own and begins to enter dangerous territory where not everyone is who they say they are. He slowly begins to uncover one lie after another, and that is what makes Chinatown such an entertaining and masterful thriller. We are part of the investigation and begin discovering things at the same time Jake does. We are as confident as he is that he is going to uncover everything. This is Jack Nicholson's movie from the opening scene and he delivers one of his best performances to date. Faye Dunaway is also interesting in her femme fatale role; we are never sure if we can trust her or not. Polanski has delivered a perfect homage to the 40's film noir thrillers. Chinatown will remain as one of the best classical films of all time. This is my favorite Polanski film, perfect in every way.<br/><br/>Jake Gittes seems to be doing well as a private detective in Los Angeles, since he specializes in infidelities and there are many in the city. His latest assignment is to follow Evelyn Mulwray's (Diane Ladd) husband who happens to be the builder of the city's water supply system. His name is Hollis (Darrell Zwerling) and he is fascinated with everything that has to do with water, but Evelyn is convinced he is having an affair. Jake accepts the job and begins following Hollis, and surely enough he photographs him with a younger woman causing a scandal in the city. Jake believes his job is done, until a Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) comes thundering into his office claiming that she had never hired him to follow her husband. Apparently the first woman claiming to be Mrs. Mulwray was only an impersonator and now Jake has a law suit in his hands. Surprisingly Mrs. Mulwray drops the law suit a few days later, and her husband is found dead after an apparent suicide. Jake is now hired by Mrs. Mulwray to discover who might have wanted her husband dead, and soon Jake will find himself uncovering an entire web of deceit and corruption that is much bigger than he thinks.<br/><br/>This masterful film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, but only won one (Best Original Screenplay written by Robert Towne) considering it had to compete in 1975 with another perfect film: The Godfather Part II. One of the best things about Chinatown actually is the screenplay. There are so many great dialogues and quotes from this film that are still remembered today almost 40 years later. Chinatown is exactly what a classical film looks like. Polanski created a masterpiece by recreating the classic film noir from the 40's with great art direction, costume designs, and cinematography. The editing and the original score are also done wonderfully, but none of this would be enough if it weren't for the wonderful performances from Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. Chinatown deserves all the praise it has received over time and it has really turned into a timeless classic and one of the few that continues to astonish modern audiences. The twists and surprises in Chinatown continue to work today."
"RyanCShowers","Null","1","2","13 July 2013"," 1974 is rocked by the writing achievement in Chinatown
","As I wrote the title to this post, the year ""1974"" flashed before my eyes in terms of my opinion of the highly respected film Chinatown. I've now seen this film twice, the first time I ""convinced"" myself it to love it no matter what I actually thought of it, knowing how highly regarded screenplay is in the movie industry. Honestly, I felt the film's pacing was a dud and Nicholson didn't work as the leading character. The screenplay was fine, but I felt like I was going to drown in my own saliva from falling asleep in this boring movie. I rewatched the film knowing where the story is going and having a firm grip on the plot and came out drinking the Chinatown cool-aid.<br/><br/>My most substantial complaints of my first viewing of Chinatown, pacing aside, was the disappointment I felt in Jack Nicholson's performance. I before thought he was playing himself as a detective. Jack Nicholson the Detective, not J.J. Gittes, which is frustrating and awkward to watch. On second viewing, I took to Nicholson's performance more, he's serviceable with a few moments of finesse. When Nicholson is put in ""hammy"" scenes, I feel like it's only Jack Nicholson that appears most times. Maybe that's why his work in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the best work of his career. He gets to play the eccentric character that he is in real life. <br/><br/>Faye Dunaway emerges as the heroine grounded in mystery. Her character has layers that Dunaway is allowed to slowly peal off, each layer making sense from what we know about the layer prior. Chinatown is essentially a neo-film noir of its time, and Dunaway fits the bill of a noir heroine to a tee. Set in the 1930s, Chiantown features some wonderful costumes, sets, and cinematography that add to that era and the noir-feeling of the picture. The film score helps the picture set its wonderful tone, also.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski is the man I have any kind of a beef with when it comes to Chinatown. Polanski excels at creating the rush for viewers in the second half of the film, but Chinatown's blinding flaw is that the first hour, Polanski lets the picture flat-line. The information we're given in the first hour makes sense at the end of the movie, we need to see these crucial scenes, but Polanski doesn't help make these overreaching plot arc scenes lively enough to keep me interested. The first hour succeeds on all levels, with the huge exception of the lackadaisical directing. The second half, Polanski shifts the film into drive, stomps on the gas petal and makes amends for the first hour's glacial pacing.<br/><br/>Finally, what makes Chinatown ""Chinatown"".....the marvelous screenplay. Robert Towney penned the screenplay, which revived the noir-genre in the 1970s. Not only that, but Towney scribed a manicured script that had thick character development and a serpentine plot that keeps unfolding in your mind even after the movie has concluded. People probably confuse themselves searching for the allegory to bigger things in Chinatown's script, however, literary devices aren't why Chinatown is a step above most screenplays ever written. It's brilliant in the communication to the audience, keeping the audience under water in the mysteries (we're introduced to one big mystery to learn about multiple others in solving the one at hand) of Chinatown and the multiples secrets the characters conceal about their past. <br/><br/>Chinatown opens its film in a odd fashion and goes against the formula of film noir anatomy with its first twenty minutes. It's very carefully plotted and tricky to comprehend at first. But then a mystery unfolds that's one of the most satisfying and involved conclusions to a mystery story. Filled to the brim with fine performances and wonderful decor, if you're willing to be patient and relinquish your full attention to the plot, Chinatown is a movie that resonates and unrolls in your mind. The more I've thought about the intelligence behind the film, the closer Chinatown is to getting a perfect from me. <br/><br/>Rating: 9.5/10<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"danduda1","8","1","2","21 June 2013"," Powerful, affecting
","Almost 40 years later this movie has lost none of its power to affect.<br/><br/>It uses the trappings of a fedora-sporting detective (Jack Nicholson), on the trail of a mystery he doesn't realize he does not want to unravel, to tell a drama of a family destroyed by horrific deeds and secrets. The story remains timeless, ultimately, due to its illumination of the best and worst within us - and that enormous valley where most of us, like detective Jake Gittes, fall - somewhere in between.<br/><br/>I won't give away any story, but to give you some idea how powerful this is, I was never able to enjoy John Huston acting in a movie ever again because of his portrayal here (Noah Cross). The revelatory scene between Gittes and Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) retains its power to shock and disturb.<br/><br/>What makes this so potent, really, is the screenplay by Robert Towne. It's powerful in ways many movies never reach; and maybe no one writes more realistic dialogue than Towne.<br/><br/>The unsavory parts of the story are redeemed by the positive we get from Evelyn Mulwray, and her determination to carry on. Although the story doesn't end with her walking away victorious, her perseverance is really the heart of this tale.<br/><br/>20 years earlier this story could never have been told in a Hollywood movie; the excellence of this one movie - ""Chinatown"" - makes that entire fight to loosen censorship worthwhile."
"Sonic_Ocean","10","1","2","16 May 2013"," As little as possible....
","What I love about movies that come from the New Hollywood genres is their quality of elegance that make these pictures into something special that cannot be captured ever again. Whether it is the clean look in the visuals or its technique of not going with all the bare details in story or its characters.<br/><br/>That certain mystique is especially captured so beautifully in 'Chinatown.' It's a story that pulls you into a big mystery, but ultimately it feels like the town is full of mysteries. One thing I have to say I love is the effectiveness of the title, in that after watching the movie it finally takes on the true colors of what the movie is about and really gives meaning to what is disturbing about what I just witnessed on screen.<br/><br/>And I'll leave it at that. I could go on about the acting performances that really give strength to the film. All I could say is that the collaborative effort of the creation of the story, its characters and its atmosphere all culminate in creating a movie that is truly dark and brooding. It's basically a movie that will stick with you. This is probably a horrible review, but I guess I just want to let anyone know who might read this that this is a classic."
"Red-Barracuda","10","1","2","1 February 2013"," Exceptional neo-noir masterpiece
","Chinatown can be interpreted in a number of ways. On the surface it's a compelling detective film, while it's also about the corrupt power of big business. It's also a damning indictment on the very origins of Los Angeles itself, where the city became a powerful entity on the back of the theft of water from the poor. Anyone with money is shown to be simply above the law. The central character, private investigator Jake Gittes, is ultimately shown to be utterly impotent when up against the water baron Noah Cross. The latter is at liberty to do exactly as he pleases, from large scale financial corruption to the ultimate personal transgression of incest. The story is a very pessimistic one indeed with Chinatown itself mainly referenced pointedly as a place where different rules apply, a place where anything goes and the law can do as they please. Gittes himself hints at an episode in his past where he tried to help a girl in Chinatown and it ended badly, the main narrative pans out tragically and history repeats itself. It's only at the end of the film where the action relocates to Chinatown itself and it is one of the most unforgettable, uncompromising and nihilistic in cinema history. Director Roman Polanski insisted on this bleak ending against the wishes of his screenwriter Robert Towne. Only a few years earlier Polanski's wife Sharon Tate had been murdered as the result of a house invasion by the Manson Family. Polanski, therefore, had an added level of cynicism about life in general because of this; he said 'That's life. Beautiful blondes die in Los Angeles. Sharon had.'<br/><br/>This is a classic film with very good reason. Everything is right about it - the direction, the writing, the story and the acting. The latter is covered by a trio of unforgettable performances from Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway and John Huston; and a highly memorable cameo from Polanski himself as a knife-wielding enforcer, made all the more sinister because of his diminutive size. Nicholson and Dunaway's characters are multi-dimensional with many inner demons, while Huston is an all too believable monster, whose true horror is just below the surface. The detailed recreation of 30's L.A. is also extremely well-done; it also has ensured that there is a certain timeless quality to Chinatown. But apart from anything else this is simply a great movie whose mystery is consistently enthralling throughout. One of the all time greats."

","Chinatown is a crime mystery psychological drama film; the screenplay in this 1974 classic is one that is way beyond its time and it will take years before another masterful screenplay can match the Academy Award winning screenplay of Chinatown. The screenplay was done by the Robert Towne (who you will know for his writing in the Tom Cruise Movies The Firm in 1993 Mission Impossible in 1996 and Mission Impossible II in 2000) who decide not to adapt the novel The Great Gatsby (1974) handed to him by producer Robert Evans but Towne wrote his own and Chinatown was the result of his writing.<br/><br/>The movie had a tragic ending with Robert Evans the producer, intending the screenplay to have a happy ending but Polanski stuck to his gun for a tragic ending, he is quoted to have said ""I knew that if Chinatown was to be special, not just another thriller where the good guys triumph in the final reel, Evelyn had to die.""

"Desertman84","10","1","2","4 March 2012"," It's Chinatown
","Chinatown is a neo-noir film, directed by Roman Polanski from a screenplay by Robert Towne and starring Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway and John Huston. The film features many elements of the film noir genre, particularly a multi-layered story that is part mystery and part psychological drama. It was released by Paramount Pictures. The story, set in Los Angeles in 1937, was inspired by the California Water Wars, the historical disputes over land and water rights that had raged in southern California during the 1910s and 1920s, in which William Mulholland acted on behalf of Los Angeles interests to secure water rights in the Owens Valley.<br/><br/>""You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't,"" warns water baron Noah Cross, when smooth cop-turned-private eye J.J. ""Jake"" Gittes starts nosing around Cross's water diversion scheme. That proves to be the ominous lesson of Chinatown, Roman Polanski's critically lauded 1974 revision of 1940s film noir detective movies. In 1930s Los Angeles, ""matrimonial work"" specialist Gittes is hired by Evelyn Mulwray to tail her husband, Water Department engineer Hollis Mulwray. Gittes photographs him in the company of a young blonde and figures the case is closed, only to discover that the real Mrs. Mulwray had nothing to do with hiring Gittes in the first place. When Hollis turns up dead, Gittes decides to investigate further, encountering a shady old-age home, corrupt bureaucrats, angry orange farmers, and a nostril-slicing thug along the way. By the time he confronts Cross, Evelyn's father and Mulwray's former business partner, Jake thinks he knows everything, but an even more sordid truth awaits him. When circumstances force Jake to return to his old beat in Chinatown, he realizes just how impotent he is against the wealthy, depraved Cross. ""Forget it, Jake,"" his old partner tells him. ""It's Chinatown."" <br/><br/>Chinatown's period sheen renders this dilemma at once contemporary and timeless, pointing to larger implications about the effects of corporate rapaciousness on individuals.Reworking the somber underpinnings of detective noir along more pessimistic lines, Polanski and screenwriter Robert Towne convey a '70s-inflected critique of capitalist and bureaucratic malevolence in a carefully detailed period piece hearkening back to the genre's roots in the 1930s and '40s. Gittes always has a smart comeback like Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe, but the corruption Gittes finds is too deep for one man to stop. As bruised and cynical as the decade that produced it, this noir classic benefits from Robert Towne's brilliant screenplay, director Roman Polanski's steady hand, and wonderful performances from Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway."
"toll-8","Null","1","2","21 September 2011"," Nicholson at his best. Before he became a Joker
","Jack Nicholson starts his career as a headlined actor in style. The first film in which he takes the lead showed the world exactly what talent this man has. This film, to me, is his best acting experience, especially since it doesn't involve him laughing hysterically but delivering lines from an excellent script with brutality, wit and sarcasm.<br/><br/>He plays Jake Gittes, a Private Investigator, specialising in adultery cases. He is approached by a woman claiming to be the wife of Mr Mulwray, the owner of the water supply for LA, a man going through hard times due to the drought currently occupying LA. She believes her husband is having an affair with a younger woman and asks him to investigate. Just as Gittes begins his investigation, the real wife of Mr Mulwray (Faye Dunway) surfaces, threatening to sue Gittes for his intrusion. So what is going on?<br/><br/>Gittes pure curiosity into the situation and the arrival of Mr Mulwray's murdered body sends Gittes into a world of deceit and corruption, all stemming down to the importance of the city's water problem and some shocking family truths. The truth to which Gittes is to find, turns out to be darker and more sinister than many will be expecting, a realisation that had me baffled. This reveal, you may feel, has no link with the rest of the movie but thinking back to a few one liners and a strange John Huston, you can see where this back story links in and how important it is to the final outcome.<br/><br/>At no point in this movie did I find myself uninterested and it kept me guessing as to what will come in the next scene. This was due to Polanski's brilliant direction. From the first shot of Nicholson spying on Mr Mulwray, I felt myself applauding Polanski's directing. The shots were beautiful and a single frame seemed to reveal so much.<br/><br/>Polanski slowly drips information to the audience, giving you enough information to move onto the next scene but not enough so that the answers can be figured out before the credits role. My only complaint about it would be that I would have liked the ending to have been wrapped up a little better but perhaps Polanski felt the need to allow the audience to think about this film passed the end credits. Many others have come to like this ending but I think it ended too abruptly considering the rest of the film reveals itself very slowly. The ending seems rushed and this is not just from the story as the acting in the last five minutes seemed weaker and the camera work became lazy.<br/><br/>The film reminds me of an Alfred Hitchcock style of filmmaking and I could compare this film to his classic Vertigo (1958) with its long lingering shots that build plenty of emotion and reveal all through the image and character on the screen.<br/><br/>The music works well with the film, bringing out lots of tension whether it is when Gittes is help at knife point or is leaning in for a kiss. The music brings the film to its noir roots despite it being recorded in colour.<br/><br/>I can see why this film is classed as a classic but the overly rushed ending takes a little away from it. Nicholson though is brilliant as the Private Eye and in my opinion surpasses the Joker (Batman) and McMurphy (One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest) interpretations audiences love him for. <br/><br/>See this film for Nicholson and for the disturbing revelation that caused my jaw to hit the floor."

I first saw it 25 years ago but watched it yesterday on TV and was again overwhelmed by how good it is. The other thing worth mentioning is that it has hardly dated at all. Certainly Jack Nicholson looks younger than we're all used to seeing him these days (me and him both!) but because the story is set in the 1930s, it could have been made yesterday. The cast, the locations, the script, the direction, the dialogue, the photography and that evocative score are all pretty much perfect. Above all, the great fast paced story with an ending that hits you right in the stomach has as much power today as ever. I'm sure that anyone reading this will have seen Chinatown but if not, go out of your way to see it. A true cinematic masterpiece."
"ElMaruecan82","10","1","2","13 July 2011"," Patience and attention demanding ... getting better after each viewing ...
","First time I saw ""Chinatown"", it looked good and I liked it, the second time, it was even better, and so on and so forth, but there was always a little something that couldn't get me totally 'into the film'. Yesterday, I decided not to 'watch' ""Chinatown"" but to 'pay attention to it', and I finally got why it is regarded as one of the greatest American films.<br/><br/>As soon as Jerry Goldsmith's haunting score starts, a genre is resurrecting, a private-eye whose cigarette smoke harmoniously draws the hair of a femme-fatale, and a title announcing a haunting presence. Roman Polanski adapted the film-noir genre with a more modern touch : the first frames featuring pictures of very explicit sexual poses show how far we are from the Hayes Code, and the photographer is not the archetypal private eye, laconic, full of debts and booze. Jack Nicholson plays the role of J.J. aka Jake Gittes, a man who made 'private eye' his métier, perfectly organized, with two associates and a secretary, ironically earning his respectable money from the depraved lifestyle of the pre-war Los Angeles.<br/><br/>Strangely, the first client almost disappoints as she's too unbelievably stereotypical. She's apparently a rich woman pretending to be Mrs. Evelyn Mullray, with an exaggerated aristocratic look. She suspects her husband, the Chief Engineer of Water and Power, of cheating her. We're finally reassured when the real Evelyn makes her appearance, but pay attention to the details: she had to trick J.J. and makes him admit that he's never seen her, what could have been compromised if the two associates had warned him when he came. The script needed Jakes to enter with such enthusiasm he wouldn't let anyone talk, hence the hilarious Chinaman joke, and its embarrassing aftermath.<br/><br/>Every detail, every originality, plays a significant role. Jakes takes one card from Mr. Yellburton of the Water and Power office and uses it later, to enter a protected zone. Even the details that are not plot significant, like when Gittes deliberately annoys Yellburton's secretary or asks a snotty office worker for a ruler, so he can tear a piece of paper and cover it with a loud cough, give an extraordinary sense of reality. The film doesn't even deal with an exotic statuette or a jewel heist, but the control of water, an unlikely subject that brilliantly comforted the 'mystery' element of the film as when a Chinese man tells Gittes that the water is ""bad for glass"", and it takes a second meaning when you hear it again. Everything looks natural and unforced, but the perfectionism demands a concentration from the viewer, for a rewarding pay-off.<br/><br/>The script is renowned for having been written by Robert Towne with Jack Nicholson in mind. Indeed, who else could have embodied such a cynical and apathetic attitude with this appeal, the way Gittes evokes his professionalism makes him even more charismatic as it justifies his insistence to solve the mystery, as stated in Polanski's favorite moment, when Jake and Evelyn appears in profile, face to face, with the famous bandage on Nicholson's nose and the priceless line ""I like my nose. I like breathing through it"". Faye Dunaway is also perfect as the black widow whose sophisticated mannerisms, finely traced eyebrows and bright red lips, give her a misleading femme-fatale appearance, that couldn't let you guess that she's actually the heroine as the character with the most selfless motives. The whole film is full of illusions and contradictions illustrated by the perfect casting of John Huston as Noah Cross, the powerful mastermind, whose evil scheme is hidden behind his elegant courtesy and the funny way he always call Jakes 'Mr. Gitts'. A perfect casting that also includes Polanski as the 'Kitty Cat' midget.<br/><br/>But behind Polanski's inside joke cameo, Gittes keeping this big bandage in his nose is the unforgettable trademark of the film, an ironic punishment and the warning to a man whose nosiness might cause bigger damages. And that's the power of ""Chinatown"", the constant feeling of an imminent danger, embodied by this word : ""Chinatown"". Towne, the Oscar winning writer of the script, asked a policeman what he did in Chinatown, he replied : ""As little as possible"". If you wonder what kind of law enforcement that is, just listen to Gittes explaining that sometimes during Chinese gang quarrels, with so many different dialects, you never knew when you prevented a crime from happening, or when you were causing one, so the best thing was to do 'as little as possible' and visibly, there is a wound in Gittes' past, as he tried to help a girl, who was finally 'hurt', an obvious euphemism.<br/><br/>""Chinatown"" resonates as a resurgence of Gittes' past, with another woman he wants to protect, and the tragic irony is that we get the meaning when it's too late. And this is where I'm glad the movie was made during the 70's when directors were allowed to shock you with a dark ending. Polanski rightfully insisted that the movie needed to end tragically to be memorable and meaningful, he who lost Sharon Tate, in a savage massacre in that very town of Los Angeles. And the fact that Cross doesn't get his comeuppance makes him even more a creepier villain. The tragic ending was foreshadowed by many details that look even more symbolic after several viewings, Evelyn's strange spot in her eye, the moment where her falls on the horn, so we're prepared when he hear the sound again. It's those little details that make the difference.<br/><br/>The movie ends brutally, but thanks to the perfection of Towne's script, Polanki's masterful direction and final personal touch, and a top-notch acting based on Nicholson-Dunaway-Huston triangular force, we understand the significance of ""Chinatown"", and sure after such an event, Gittes' would probably become more cynical and more apathetic, but will he really forget another Chinatown? We sure won't ..."

It really is an epic and a tale you cannot avert your eyes from.<br/><br/>The film marks a turning point in Roman Polanski's career. A step away from art films and British comedies to a full-budget, Hollywood-style film with big name actors. While his other films up until now were for the most part good films, this is the one that probably hit home with American audiences. And considering the script won an Academy Award, it was excellent material to work with. (Of course, ""Rosemary's Baby"" was also a hit, but I suspect this was even more mainstream.) <br/><br/>Nicholson is great here, in part because he is subdued. He gets a lot of credit for playing violent or insane characters, but gets much less credit for his work as a protagonist without illness. In some ways, this could be considered Nicholson's best work because he carried the film, presented his character well, and did not have to fall back on the crazy facade he has mastered."

","If you've seen your share of B Westerns from the Thirties and Forties, you're bound to have seen a few where water rights are being contested, while the evil town boss sends out his henchmen to buy up all the land from the starving ranchers who have no way to water their herds or grow their crops. In some respects, ""Chinatown"" is the ultimate B Western turned into a stylish noir film that stands as one of the premier classics coming out of the 1970's.<br/><br/>There's another comparison I can draw as well, that being Bogart's 1941 picture, ""The Maltese Falcon"". J.J. Gittes (Jack Nicholson) operates a lot like Sam Marlowe, and isn't above putting the picture's femme fatale (Faye Dunaway as Evelyn Mulwray) in the hot seat when the facts of a case point him in that direction. I would like to have seen some snappier banter between Nicholson's character and Detective Escobar's crew, the way Bogie did with Ward Bond and Barton MacLane in 'Falcon'. John Huston directed that great era classic, but I didn't know he could pour on the subdued malice the way he did here as the head of the Cross family. That was an interesting observation he had about ugly politicians and whores looking better as they get older.<br/><br/>I wonder what Jack Nicholson must have thought to himself doing this picture with that bandage slapped across his face most of the time. I guess you have to be pretty confident with yourself as an actor to go with it, because as the viewer, it distracted me no end, to the point of being comical at times. When that happened, all I had to do was think back to how he earned it, and I winced all over again."

","Roman Polanski's genius is questionable. Whether or not he does possess a certain cinematic genius is neither urgent or necessary to conclude. His body of work speaks for itself, his 1974 magnum opus speaks for its decade, reality in the face of theatricality, and for the sanctity of the cinema itself. Now although it is not completely justifiable to prove whether Polanski is or is not a genius, it is rather important to discuss the life of this idolized and wanted man. Roman Polanski was born in the year 1933 in Paris to Polish parents. When his mother and father were forced into concentration camps for being Jewish, Polanski was faced with the unmeasurable difficulty of surviving the Holocaust on his own. His Mother, ultimately, fell victim to the horrors of Auschwitz. If that's not enough, if you would so melodramatically, fast forward to the year of 1969. To the Summer Of Love. To the end of the small portion of Polanski's life he would later recall as the happiest he's ever had. He had a beautiful, talented, and adoring wife. Her name was Sharon Tate. The baby inside of her, she and Roman would never name. In August of 1969 the Manson Family laid slain to Sharon Tate and the baby inside of her, both terrorizing and taunting, the darkest chapter of Polanski's life was marooned with notoriety and fear. It was only a few years after the death of his wife where Roman would leave his mark on the world forever. Chinatown flows with a lavishly perfected Noir tone, and I should add here, the film is the Neo Noir archetype, the best of its kind and one of the best that Film Noir carries in its respective canon. Also, whenever one sets out to write about Chinatown, one cannot understate the delicacy, the supreme handling of pacing which is to be found in this particular film. Not before, and not since, has pacing been so well thought out, so marvelously calculated, and devilishly crafted. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway stand immortal in this film, bellowing through the tenement halls inside of every dirty city confined within every Noir film in rotation. If Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway stand luminous as Kings of their respective Kingdom, then John Huston stands apart; shrouded in darkness, transparent, eager, vicious, immediate. John Huston's 'Noah Cross' exists, alright, and the most dangerous thing about the 'Noah Cross's of the world is that the evil within them is otherwise ordinary, bottomless, and unstoppable. Robert Towne's script is simply impeccable. Flawless storytelling accompanied by snappy dialogue, and a climax that cuts deeper than that of documentary reality. But it is Polanski who is the true star of this picture. You can see him in every shot, peering in through the lens, and directly into your heart. You can taste him in every dry patch of dialogue, smell him in the midst of gun smoke, and fear him as the tension culminates into the wake of tragedy. It is there, in the tragedy, he dares you to hope for the best, he wants to feel safe because films make you feel comfortable. He takes the trust that he'd earned from the audience, and crushes it, oh, and he makes sure it stings. He makes sure it hurts. And in in the aftermath of the his final act, his final betrayal, the ultimate tragedy, he makes sure you can feel him. He leaves you in pain. He leaves you guilty in satisfaction. Knowing that tragedy is the most universal of luxuries, Polanski makes that perfectly clear, and for the first time, his voice is heard, his war cry. Coherent and horrifying."
"andy-933-696608","10","1","2","11 January 2011"," Chinatown Movie Review
","A long time favorite of mine and a classic that I believe Jack Nicholson can truly be remembered for as his greatest work of cinematic art. Director Roman Polanski and screen writer Robert Towne give audiences a masterpiece of both drama and suspense from the wondering viewpoint of Nicholson's character Gittes, a man who's profession is to find the truth, although the truth might be more than what he'd hoped to discover. Having a dark history in La's Chinatown, Gittie makes his honest living by exploiting the dark secrets few people want out. The secrets usually are born from either rumors or suspicions of affairs. A mysterious women claiming to be Hollis Mularay's wife, Evelyn hires Jake to scoop out the truth and find out if there really is someone else. Jake would've probably thought of old Hollis to be the most fascinating tail he's ever tracked in years, following him to public meetings, beaches, and even a mistress that finishes it all. Hollis is no ordinary guy, being the partner of Noah Cross (Houston), Evelyn's crafty and suspicious father, in the LA water and power department. It doesn't really matter to Jake, all that matters is his objective, and the sweet payday received for his work. His work results in more than just a simple check, but the consequences of widespread publicity, attracting the attention of the real, and truly more sophisticated Evelyn Mulray (Dunaway), who feels both insulted and obliged for the matter to be taken care of courtroom style. It's to Jakes luck and Evelyn's misfortune that he never sees the sight of judge, at the cost of Hollis's life though. The very sight of his body being dragged from a water reservoir, with salt water in his lungs is enough for the cops to call it an accidental death. Jake on the other hand, saw it as murder, believing the pieces in this puzzle all fit. The first piece started with the fake Evelyn looking to bust Mulray with a mysteriously significant mistress, thus reaching the second piece as the real Evelyn sues, then quickly draws back on the lawsuit, ending with the final piece of Mulray's murder. The plot escalates from secrets into answers stemming to the very dark and puzzled world Gittes use to live in. If non of you readers get what I'm talking about, I mean Chinatown, a place where the cops were meant to do as little as possible, never knowing whether they were helping the good or the bad. Chinatown, a place riddled with corruption, drugs, and dark aspiring mystery. Thus, Jakes suspicions place him on a quest to find the whole point of this elaborate plot to bury the truth, following up all kinds of leads that'll make viewers ask more and more questions on the very little, but defining significance they represent. Take for instance the missing mistress of Hollis Mulray. Why is it so important to Noah Cross that she be found? According to Evelyn and several people at Water and Power, Mulray and Cross had a falling out on where the water in LA should go. Either to the City or the People of LA. Many were suffering from the drought, particularly those in the south, raising live stock, with little water, and poisoned wells. It all seems detrimental. More though to the mystery of Hollis's murder, the truth behind it goes to the nature of secrecy that Plagues ""Chinatown"". A little bird (Fake Eveyln) sings a little, giving Jake a few names to look up, only to see their names as the already deceased, leaving him with the conclusion that Hollis knew to much. Jake himself puts himself in the same shoes, as he learns far more about his employer Evelyn than he should know. After a quick, but in the moment and straight to the bedroom romance with Evelyn, Jake's sense to spy leads to the discovery of Hollis's missing mistress, and forcing Evelyn to tell more than she's been saying half the film. Baring the child of your own father, while calling yourself her sister must no doubt be one of the toughest burdens ever, especially when it come to protecting that secret from a man who wants to have the child as his own. Noah Cross, the master mind behind all, reveals not only his place of being Katherine's father, but also the intention of incorporating LA's Northwest valley, and thus irrigating it. As we viewers draw to a close, the films ends in its title of focus, Chinatown. When struggling for the truth, Jake fails to save those he loves at the very remark of ""Forget it Jake its Chinatown"". A magnificent ending to film, that incorporates the elements of historical corruption, love, mystery, thrill, suspense, and furthermore the realistic notion of it's title ""Chinatown"". Chinatown, like general life is what it is, sometimes good triumphs over evil, and the other times, evil triumphs over good to our personal distaste. I honestly see this as one of Nicholson's most trademarked characters, using both his dark and even haunting history, as well as his slick wit to further move himself forward in the films mystery of a story, while collaborating with Dunaway's portrayal of an even more tortured figure. Mulray has gone through the unholy touch of her father at the bedside, hiding his child, and doing all she can to conceal her truth, expressing her partial dishonesty in the very doubt of her voice. Despite his short screen time, John Houston's performance is both as haunting, and yet the least tortured of the film's characters, feeling little regret for his sins, while pursuing his power hungry goals with an almost terrifying form of expressing his want for them. ""Chinatown"" itself, using it's musical romance theme can haunt a fan, almost as much as it's done to the hero J.J. Gittes."

","The past shapes who we are for better or worse. It silently makes decisions for us. Ever so tenderly pushing us over the edge or holding us back. Putting words in our mouth or stifling intentions. It defines us and J.J. 'Jake' Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is no exception. He is a man completely shaped by his past. It's one he hides and avoids with obscure answers. He even uses the expression, ""Let sleeping dogs lie"" and notes, ""Sometimes you're better off not knowing."" But we do want to know. This is a mystery after all, and like Gittes, you will keep guessing until the credits roll.<br/><br/>""Let me explain something to you, Walsh. This business requires a certain amount of finesse."" Says a confident and well presented J.J. Gittes speaking of his profession. Although you are watching a noir detective film, Gittes does not conform to the classical disillusioned detective working out of a shabby poorly lit office with slumped shoulders and a poisonously cynical outlook. Gittes is self assured and financially well off with a secretary and two assistant detectives.<br/><br/>Retired from the police force, he now mostly takes on adultery cases. Cue wealthy woman with a cheating husband. She hires Mr Gittes to follow her husband, Hollis Mulwray, a well-known chief engineer of L.A.'s 'Water and Power' company. Gittes and his assistants waste no time in wrapping up the case. Like the classical noir detective, Gittes follows his own set of morals and values which do not preclude him from making a quick buck by selling out the high profile Mr Mulwray and his adulterous ways to the newspapers. A buck is a buck and Mr Gittes is in business.<br/><br/>The first of many twists surprises us when the real Mrs Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway), along with her lawyer, shows up at Gittes' office and presents him with a defamation lawsuit. ""There's no point getting tough with me."" Gittes says to Mrs Mulwray, who in turn responds, ""I don't get tough with anyone, Mr Gettis. My lawyer does."" And with that, I fell in love. Her pencil lined eyebrows and blood red lipstick framing a cold, almost detached expression as she sizes up and back-foots the ever in charge Mr Gittes.<br/><br/>Gittes realises he was set up and used for some other purpose. ""I'm not supposed to be the one who's caught with his pants down."" He does not intend on letting anyone use him. And so begins the game of who and why. A mystery takes shape and slowly unfolds over 130 minutes.<br/><br/>His curiosity, along with ours, grows further when Mr Mulwray turns up dead and the girl Mr Mulwray was seeing goes missing. Thugs try to 'persuade' him to quit it when he starts snooping around Water and Power's interests and one of them, played by the director Roman Polanski, splits his nostril with a switch-blade. Not one to back down, Gittes gives as much as he takes and driven by his need to solve the case, clear his name and help the leading lady, he calmly and relentlessly navigates the twists and turns to the bitter end.<br/><br/>Like any good mystery thriller, Chinatown is full of twists and none of them feel tacked on for effect. Each one cleverly progresses the story, redefines relationships and your suspicions on who is behind the murder and whether it's related to the larger conspiracy of the water kind. It keeps you guessing and interested and as the film progresses, two distinct arcs develop interrelated by the murder.<br/><br/>The grand arc concerns itself with who controls the water and what they stand to gain by denying L.A.'s citizens its use. We imagine many unseen figures in high places with resources behind them. Going against them is a lone detective. An ex-police officer who couldn't cut it in the force perhaps? As capable as Gittes seems, the odds area heavily stacked against him. A real underdog for the viewer to cheer.<br/><br/>I referred to the water arc as the 'grand' one because it affects the whole city, not because it's more interesting or more important than the small-scale arc, one of skeletons in the closet and family secrets coming to a head. If anything, this story arc, as intertwined as it is with the grand one, is the more intriguing and ultimately more memorable one. The family history, their relationships current and past, is what makes this detective story such a compelling one.<br/><br/>A third arc yet, more subtle but just as important, is played out by the man himself. It deals with his past while working in the police force in L.A.'s Chinatown. Nothing specific is alluded to but we glimpse enough to know that he was disillusioned. Despite his best efforts, he made little difference. There was a woman he cared for and in trying to help her, he hastened her demise. More than likely, Gittes quit the police force as a direct result of this event.<br/><br/>Most of this information is revealed in one great scene where our two leads lay naked in bed in lazy abandon of all their troubles. Jake comes across as a deeply troubled man haunted by his past. Evelyn, for her part, has let her guard down and is honestly affectionate and caring for the first time. She has just asked whether the girl he cared for died when the phone rings. And it rings as she holds his eyes waiting, hoping as much as us for an answer. It doesn't come. She answers the phone and we're racing off into more suspense.<br/><br/>Chinatown is a masterful blend of mystery, thriller, romance and suspense packaged in a hard boiled detective noir story. It features outstanding performances from the two leads in their prime. Coupled with confident direction from Roman Polanski and an Oscar winning script from Robert Towne, it's sure to please every fan of cinema."

","I read, recently, that, in a joint poll by the 'Guardian' and the 'Observer', Roman Polanski's 'Chinatown' was voted the greatest film of all time.<br/><br/>Now that may be arguable - I feel that, with the volume of great cinema that's come out of Hollywood over the years, and the variety of genres in which we find excellence, it may be facile to label any individual film as the ""best"" or the ""greatest"" ... Having said that, however, 'Chinatown' cannot but be characterized as representative of neo noir at its tightest and most gripping, with a celebrated screenplay that does not relax its hold on you till the unforgettable final scene - 'Forget it, Jake ... it's Chinatown.'<br/><br/>Much has been written about Jack Nicholson's virtuosity as Detective J.J.Gitte, and his gritty portrayal of the acerbic detective rightly deserves a place in every history book of Hollywood. The film, however, at the end, is neither Jack Nicholson's, nor Faye Dunaway's - who matches Nicholson scene for scene -, but, unquestionably, Roman Polanski's triumph - every scene in the film is handled like a Ming vase - touch it and it will break.<br/><br/>I read that there was considerable disagreement between Polanski and Stone - who wrote the screenplay - over how the film should end, and that, ultimately, Polanski had his way ... Having seen the film, I feel happy that this was so - there could be no more fitting finale ... after all, it's 'Chinatown'! A tour de force, in every sense of the word."

","Having recently watched Mr Polanski's The Ghost Writer (2010), I decided to look back at one of his earlier works. I saw Chinatown many years ago and so it was an interesting experience to re-visit the old classic. Set in, what appears to be, 1930's Los Angeles during a heat wave, private detective J.J. Gittes makes a living investigating adultery cases.<br/><br/>One day, a Mrs Evelyn Mulwray walks into Mr Gittes office and hires him to investigate he husband Hollis. She believes he is having an affair and wants evidence. Gittes and his associates get right on the case. Mr Mulwray is followed as he goes about his work as Chief Engineer of the city's water department. There is a meeting about building a new dam to bring more water to the city that Mulwray is against. He also spends time inspecting dry river beds and finishes up spending most of the night on a beach where a large amount of water is dumped very late in the evening. Eventually he is caught out with a young blonde woman and the evidence, in the form of photographs, is obtained. The following day the story is all over the newspapers and Mr Gittes is confronted by the real Mrs Mulwray and her lawyer. Everybody wants to talk to Mr Mulwray but he seems to have disappeared. He is later found dead in a reservoir with salt water in his lungs. Mr Gittes now has another mystery to solve, one involving corruption the city's water department, Evelyn Mulwray and her rich father, Noah Cross.<br/><br/>This is a classic movie, no special effects or fancy techniques, just the skill of the director and the art of the actors to convey the story. It's the little things I noticed that made this film a stand out for me, the setting of pocket watches to find out what time Mr Mulwray left the beach or the smashing of a tail-light to make a car easier to follow at night. Great performances from all of the main cast, special mentions go to the immense Jack Nicholson as J.J.Gittes, the fabulous Faye Dunaway as Evelyn Mulwray and the great John Huston as Noah Cross.<br/><br/>It's a very slow paced film that, for me, got a little bit too pedestrian towards the middle. The storytelling was spot on and the cinematography and dialogue were great. Over all it's a really compelling detective story with quite a few twists and turns in it. There's quite a different ending that you may not expect. It may have scored higher if it hadn't fallen a bit flat in the middle, but it's most definitely recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 8.3/10"

","This is one of the most exquisite ""new noirs"" to come out of Hollywood in the past few decades. The story, a deceptively simple narrative about water rights in Los Angeles of the 1930s, points a cold finger at the heart of Hollywood itself. Jack Nicholson is dynamite as the crafty P.I. hired to take out dirty laundry who gets himself caught up in the mess.<br/><br/>I've never been a huge fan of Faye Dunaway in this film, but John Huston as the villainous Noah Cross more than makes up for any sentimentality on her part. He plays the role with his whole body and soul, really making us believe in this person, which is what makes his character so uniquely terrifying in film history. The director Polanski himself makes one of the film's most memorable guest appearances as a ""midget"" goon who takes a knife to the hero's nostril.<br/><br/>""Chinatown"" itself is the place where Nicholson's character Jake Gittes used to work the beat as a legitimate cop -- the name and the place are hovering like a ghost in the margins of every scene of the film. It symbolizes both Gittes' lost idealism and a kind of place where evil inevitably wins. It's a dark undercurrent running through the film unseen until the climax. Basically I think the film is about how little of what's happening that we're actually able to see, at least at first glance. Thus the role of the detective becomes, as it does in most of the great ""noirs"", a metaphor for the role of a living person generally. What lies beneath is something that we might have been better off not knowing about; something we're powerless to fight because it's rooted in human nature itself."

He really isn't in every scene, but his presence is felt so strong in this film. He reminds me somewhat of Hannibal Lectur, he's not everywhere throughout the film but he's still there hurting people in a very strange (and nasty) way. Jack Nicholson had the performance of the year (1974)he plays the archetype of a anti-hero well and he always follows that motto, ""do as little as possible."" All in all, an amazing story."

","'Chinatown' is one of those rare film that is absolutely perfect. Sure there are plenty of films that have very few flaws, but they are not as complex as this movie, nor are their plots as brilliantly put together. Many people who dislike the film have called it boring and they do not like the ending. They forget the film is about a serious subject matter and shouldn't be handled like an action movie. Polanski, along with the rest of the cast, handle the story with maturity and precision, the way it should be. Polanski does not insult the viewers' intelligence. He forces us to use our imagination about past events and events that are currently happening. It may take several viewing to put all the pieces together, but with each viewing the film becomes more meaningful. Even though the film ends on an unhappy note, people must understand why the film ended that way. The ending is one of the reasons the film is so powerful and unforgettable. But that will be discussed a little later.<br/><br/>'Chinatown' is the story of a private eye detective J.J. ""Jake"" Gittes (Nicholson) who investigates the extramarital affair of a prominent engineer in Los Angeles. It is set in the 1930s, and the city is suffering a major drought. Even though the city is going through a drought, Gittes discovers that thousands of gallons of water is being dumped at night. He is dumbfounded, but he does not realize he is about to enter a conspiracy involving the elite of the city. This conspiracy stretches out to the farmers in the surrounding land. He is warned on several occasions throughout the film about what he is getting into, but he still enters the lion's mouth full speed ahead. Jack Nicholson gives one of the great performances of his career. Even though all the actors did a superb job, including Faye Dunaway, Nicholson still towers above anyone else. There is a reason he is considered one of the all time greats. So few actors can bring such range into their roles. He is funny as hell when he needs to be and serious and sensitive the story requires it.<br/><br/>The film is also carried by its brilliant screenplay. The screenplay has been hailed one of the best of all time, and I find that hard to argue. The dialog is so well written, it is an absolute joy watch time an again. Graphics can become dates, action sequences can become tame, but good dialog is timeless. Apparently, Robert Towne, the main screen writer, turned down 'The Great Gatsby' to instead write 'Chinatown'. He would have made a lot more money writing 'Gatsby', but inspiration won over dollars. He made the right decision because what he gave us was a screenplay for the ages. It is wickedly clever, intelligent, and cynical. Towne must have been at the pinnacle of his career.<br/><br/>Many people have voiced their displeasure at the ending of the film. They feel it is depressing. They feel the film should not have ended that way. They feel that people have overrated the film because of the ending. To me, the ending is absolutely brilliant. It should rank as one of the great endings in film history. In the ending, the ghosts of the past coming crashing like a tidal wave. Notice in the ending, it is only time Evelyn and Noah Cross are together in the movie. Notice that in the ending, things are so confusing, hardly anyone can figure out what is happening. Throughout the film, Jake talks about Chinatown, or how he doesn't like talking about it. Jake really does not realize what he is getting into. What he is getting into is destiny. All the money or motivation in the world cannot stop destiny from happening. And this destiny is not always happy. In fact, it can be downright brutal. At times in this life, there are forces beyond one's control. What a phenomenal achievement in film-making."

","Watching a movie like this is like watching carefully arranged dominoes fall one by one perfectly onto each other. The plot is simple but the perceived facts twist and turn like they would in the films from the genre that inspired it. Like dominoes there's satisfaction with each fall but there's a doubt and a fear that there could be a mistake which would throw the entire course off balance. Right the way through there are always the right kind of twists and the right kind of suspense. The viewer is consistently disorientated. And it isn't until the end that you know that Roman Polanski got it right and that everything fell in the right place.<br/><br/>The perfection of everything in the film is artistic rather than efficient. I feel like there's sorrow in it rather than just indulgence. The characters, the acting, the beautiful framing are almost incidental, byproducts of extreme passion. The full credits roll before the film and slow down the viewer and ready them to take it in. The evil isn't underlying, where we expect it to be in mystery films. The truth is underlying, it's unknown, but the evil is always there, it's the doubt of the excellently acted JJ Gittes and the doubt of the viewer in the stories that don't add up, the things that don't seem right that force us into Chinatown. Force us to dig into the depths yet making it seem like our own free will, like the lulling of the blonde femme fatale, where our journey for where things add up leads us to the place where they don't, and they never do. Chinatown is the place where it hurts and things don't make sense and tortured mothers are shot in front of their daughters, where modern popular films rarely go.<br/><br/>A brilliant film."
"shattenjager777","10","1","2","16 April 2007"," The perfect Neo-Noir
","There are a number of different paths to take when creating a neo-noir film. In ""Chinatown,"" Polanski and screenwriter Robert Towne went in the then-innovative direction of essentially ""playing it straight"" with their neo-noir. That is to say, there is nothing really ""neo"" about it other than being in color. It's set during the noir period, with noir dialogue and noir characters. However, Polanski executes the film so perfectly that it becomes perhaps the single most essential noir film of all time (or at least in the top two with ""The Maltese Falcon"").<br/><br/>The plot is everything a film noir should be--mysterious and somewhat convoluted, following the hard-edged detective Jake Gittes through the dark underbelly of the new city of Los Angeles. While the underlying scheme may seem a disappointment, the seeming banality of it enhances its disastrous effects on those involved even further than they would be otherwise. However, perhaps the strongest element of this film is its incredible characterization. While noir was always loaded (some would say hampered) with stock characters, even the characters who seem to fit the stock roles in ""Chinatown"" have extra layers of depth beyond what one would expect. Gittes is not simply a hard-nosed detective, but a man with an extreme stubborn streak and a need to prove his own intellectual abilities; Evelyn Mulwray is not just the femme fatale or the damsel in distress but an over-dramatic and fascinating combination of the two who seems to vacillate back and forth while she decides herself which she is; Lou Escobar is an intelligent and competent detective who only seems a step behind Gittes because he lacks some of Gittes's information; and of course Noah Cross is one of cinema's all-time great characters, though the details would constitute a spoiler. The dialogue of the film also deserves mention, as it sparkles with noir-speak slang, almost poetic rhythm, and the type of literary edge that always made the language of films noir so interesting.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most easily noticeable element of this film is its incredible acting. Jack Nicholson is surprising and thus particularly effective in his relatively restrained, nontheatrical turn as Jake Gittes. He even manages to resist the temptation to take the character out of control and over the top when possible, which is quite an accomplishment for an actor who has made such a career out of doing just that. Faye Dunaway's performance is a fascinating study in duality, as her character seems self-consciously aware of her position as both femme fatale and damsel in distress throughout this film and then vacillates between them as though she is still trying to make up her own mind about who she is, which of course she is. Meanwhile, John Huston simply steals the show in an absolute powerhouse performance as the charming and villainous Noah Cross that ranks as one of Hollywood's all-time great performances.<br/><br/>Overseeing this entire process, Roman Polanski directs the film perfectly. Everything from the editing to the cinematography is executed magnificently, resulting in a truly beautiful film in which every shot accentuates the mood of the piece and every scene is told as much with the camera as with the dialogue.<br/><br/>All together, Roman Polanski's ""Chinatown"" is a monumental film achievement. Years after the death of the film noir, Polanski crates perhaps the ultimate in the genre, following all of its conventions while adding layers of depth that perhaps no other noir can lay claim to. This film might also be the last example of noir played for real rather than for laughs or genre deconstruction, making it an almost priceless piece of cinematic history."
"stevenverb-1","10","1","2","16 November 2006"," One Of The Best Films of the 1970's, possibly of all time
","This truly is one of the greatest films of all time, with a plot with such a massive and complex core, which is so well constructed, it is a movie that if paid close attention to will simply take your breath away. Jack Nicholson (in his best role and that says something for one of Hollywood's greats) plays the private detective who is in way over his head when he is hired to spy on the L.A. water commissioner, which leads him to become entangled in a sinister and convoluted case. It is such a complex film I would have to write about a 20,000 word essay before I could really tell you the story, so my advice is just watch it and be fascinated by the story (it may however take two watches before you can fully understand everything). You have a director (Roman Polanski) and a writer (Robert Towne) at the peak of their powers and a film which deserved more awards than the single one Robert Towne receieved (It was just unfortunate to be up in the same year as The Godfather II, another of Hollywood's great films). I just wish films of today were as consistently good today as they were in the 1970's (I wasn't born until 1981 and missed these films on their initial and shock felt release, so I still have a lot of catching up to do)"

","flawless, a complex combination of beauty and downright seediness - works because it is constrained within a coherent narrative - a modernist masterpiece<br/><br/>From the very beginning one gets the impression of fun and menace within this movie - the awful joke run riotously bad by Geddis regarding the sexual morais of the Chinese and the hopelessly seedy nature of the assignments that Geddis, as a private eye, usually gets, hint of the possibility that things will soon go very pear shaped. <br/><br/>Los Angeles is of course the star, but this time it is the hideous beauty beneath the sprawl that wins; something truly gone to seed - The Late Show (1977) meets the Big Sleep (1946).<br/><br/>Of course the Jack Nicolson and Faye Dunaway chemistry works brilliantly, but it is the sparing but towering performance of John Huston that steals the show - almost a cameo, he plays the Noah Cross figure at the centre of the whole sordid affair; a figure who is the grotesque freakish abomination at the heart of the plot. <br/><br/>Of course one could not leave out Roman Polañski, whose flawless direction, eye for detail and mood, along with a few theatrical embellishments, ensures that a good story succeeds."

"fimimix","10","1","2","29 June 2006"," ..now I know what a ""film-noir"" is..
","...and I lived right through that era - even before ! I guess people use that term to let you know they are ""hip"" about film-parlance. I'd call it drama........<br/><br/>""Chinatown"" CERTAINLY is a classic, because - as many people noted - it is so nearly perfect. Robert Towne wrote the best screenplay; Boo! to ""Citizen Kane"" being the best ! AND, it's in rich color - colors that we see and feel. Some commentators noticed how glamorous Ms. Dunaway was, how lovely the autos were, the open lushness of the early San Fernando Valley before it was cannibalized by greedy developers. In the late 30s and 40s, there WERE ranches out here more than a-square-mile.<br/><br/>The film did not bring-out why Chinatown was considered to be as dangerous as sections of Los Angeles is now - because of the Chinese ""tongs"" - referred to once but not really explained. Who even knows, today, what they were? Mention ""MS13"" and almost everyone will know what it is - one of the most vicious gangs in the country, which is finally experiencing how it has spread. A ""tong"" was the Chinese version: if you were Chinese, you belonged to one of its thousands of families, no matter in which city you mention - very similar to The Mafia families. Today, we know that the Chinese race is not the scum it was labeled to be; couldn't even become citizens after opening-up The West. They moved south to Mexico: many Mexicans have slanted eyes because of inter-marriage. I once heard Chinese being spoken with the musical lilt of Spanish - beautiful !<br/><br/>The USA was beginning to come alive again, POST-depression - movies helped its citizens escape the drudgery of every-day life. The best movies were produced then - so many fabulous film-stars. Can you use more than one hand to compare today's stars with them? Nah.....<br/><br/>...everyone told the story: detective film....<br/><br/>It is my opinion Nicholson's role was so effective because Polanski allowed him to be himself - not much acting here. Dunaway was the perfect ""femme-fatale"". Polanski's bit-part certainly didn't cause any sensation - most likely to save money, although his direction was brilliant. Huston was the epitome of depravity and megalomania - ""The future, the future?"" He may have stolen the vastness of The Valley, but it was his partner - Hollis L. Mulwray - who made it bloom by opening the valves to bring-in the water - ""there it is, take it"". You can still find those ""steps"" the water cascades down into a reservoir where they found his body. Anyone know the name of that steep, winding road down the mountains and across present-day Freeway 101 ? Very similar......Towne just switched the spelling, because that family is still very powerful in Los Angeles....Mulwray wasn't murdered, that's a Hollywood story; he brought the water in and lived to a ripe old-age.<br/><br/>All the ingredients were magically mixed to make this wonderful movie. If directors-actors-actresses-producers fought during the making of film in that era, they knew they were doing important work - it can't be repeated today. Every re-make is surely to be doomed. That ""Chinatown"" was produced so like the REAL classics is a miracle. Yes, there are wonderful, modern film, but they are of a different genre: why? The originals had STORIES ! The only reason younger generations can ""review"" them is through the miracle of preservation on VHS and DVD. They've missed the real thing......<br/><br/>If you like good dialog, under-played action and skillful cinematography, then ""Chinatown"" is a movie for you - if you do not like to wait till character-development can be done, then watch James Bond. If a modern-day star wants to be really noticed, let them arrive at The Academy Awards with that era's look and glamorous gowns - not one of the stringy-haired stars could compete.<br/><br/>Indeed, ""Chinatown"" is a film that can survive for ever. It shows what most people have missed, but some can still revel in......Bravo!"

I don't know how someone could make a movie that well.<br/><br/>I first saw Chinatown when it was on AMC at like eleven-thirty at night. In the first five minuets of the movie I knew I would love it. This is if not the best acting performance of Jack Nicholson as Jake ""JJ"" Gittes. Faye Dunaway was excellent in it also. In my own private movie collection I have over 260 movies, and Chinatown is my favorite.<br/><br/>A must see for everyone."
"btu","10","1","2","19 January 1999"," Probably the greatest movie from the '70's. Bringing together a great script with the best cast Hollywood had at the time.
","This motion picture brought together a great script by Robert Town, a great cast lead by Jack Nicholson and great directing  by Roman Polanski. The movie is set in Los Angeles in the late 1930's and filmed in the film noir style that made movies like The Maltese Falcon and Out of the Past great films. The key difference is that Chinatown is in color adding to its richness in photography by cinematographer John Alonzo and its spectacular music score by Jerry Goldsmith. My favorite part of the movie is John Hustons portrayal of Noah Cross. Mr. Huston was born to play this part bringing his tough no nonsense attitude and giving it to Noah Cross making this character the most mysterious of the cast. ""You may think you know what your dealing with but believe me you don't"", Noah Cross tells Mr. Gittes at their first meeting adding to this mystery that Mr. Huston brings to his charecter every time he is on screen. This film is one of those films that you will see over and over and enjoying it each time. It's a timeless work of art that only gets better with time."
"revival05","9","1","2","2 July 2000"," It's a hard world. And ""Chinatown"" proves it.
","--Author is aware of spelling mistakes--<br/><br/>This is an endless masterpiece. From the start to finish I was on my seat. The suspense is all over the movie from the first to the last minute. When Faye Dunaway appears as the real wife, you think that the plot has got it's last twists. Well, you better think again. Just like I had to.<br/><br/>
The plot ringles as a snake, and it's a ride to hang on. From the beginning you are cousing upp in the sofa, enjoying Nicholson's very fine portrait. At the end you are so frightened, so moved by the moral. You feel so totaly helpless by the end. This is Polanski's without a doubt best movie, and his appearence as the man with the knife is a great pleasure to watch, in the same scene as you see Nicholson soaked as a rat. That's also a big pleasure to watch. Polanski's way to show the incredible heat that surrounds the city is marvelous. Acting is great, to say the least. Nicholson in one of his best roles, even if I'm not really sure wich one of the great ones (""The Shining"", ""One flew over the cucoo's nest"", ""Mars Attacks!"", ""As good as it gets"") that's the best, it's a tough job to say. Faye Dunaway is not really the world's best actress, even if she's good. And I think this is the role of her life, Bonnie Parker gets close, but concidering that overrated BONNIE & CLYDE is about two times ""less good"" (is that an ok term?) than CHINATOWN it gets a bit complicated to say. The plot is nothing else than a 10-pointer and Jerry Goldsmith proves that he's been around quite a while.<br/><br/>
It is simply a very good, excelent movie with Polanski's brilliance mixed with Nicholson's brilliance. A must-see! 9/10"

","Sam Spade didn't get the girl in ""Maltese Falcon"" and Jake doesn't get the girl in ""Chinatown"".  True, they don't get the girl for different reasons but both reasons are superb.  ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""Chinatown"" are without a doubt, the two greatest detective films that have graced American screens.  Two important reasons for this are Jack Nicholson and Humphrey Bogart.  Of course both have great supporting casts as well.  In ""Chinatown"" the supporting roles are filled superbly by Faye Dunaway and John Huston (in a devilishly malicious role).  The script by Robert Towne is excellent and intelligent with many memorable moments and twists.  The highlights of this film are the Chinaman joke (easily Nicholson's best and funniest monologues), Dunaway's stunning daughter/sister revelation, Roman Polanski's knife-wielding thug that provides one of Hollywood's most memorable props and the film's surprising conclusion.  All in all, ""Chinatown"" is a complex detective thriller, with a dense, though-provoking script and some superb performances."
"mmt02","10","1","2","2 June 1999"," One of the Best of All Time
","Chinatown is a movie that combines a superb script with flawless directing. Robert Towne's script is probably the best script of all time. It encompasses all the elements of classical film noirs and uses them to tell a perfect story. The clues are fed to the audience slowly, but carefully. As Jake Gittes discovers more and more of the twisted plot revolving around the death of Mr. Mulwray, a world of disgusting corruption is found. Towne's script is reinforced by two of the greates performances of all time: Faye Dunaway and Jack Nicholson. Dunaway is the perfect femme fatale; she pulls Jake into a case that is bigger than he can handle. Nicholson plays a more thoughtful character than his usual roles. The most interesting part of the Gittes character is his vulnerability. Nicholson's nose is covered with bandages for a good part of the film to reinforce the fact that Gittes is not super-human; he will not and can not solve this case in time to save Dunaway.<br/><br/>Finally, Roman Polanski's direction is amazing in Chinatown. His camera is a voyeur in the film. It follows just over Nicholson's shoulder, it is right next to Dunaway's face (which from interviews, I hear really disturbed her and created friction between she and Polanski), and it surveys the young L.A. landscape revealing its superficial beauty. Polanski wonderfully contrasts this beautiful image of early L.A. and the corruption underlying the plot. On the one hand we see the desert and all its stark beauty. But in another scene, the camera is dodging punches or trying to get away from Claude Mulvhill. This move definetely signified a peek in Polanski's career. It is unfortunate that events in his personal life has made him an outcast in America, he truly had a great eye as a director."
"Don-102","10","1","2","4 March 1999"," Deep, Dark Noir...Sunny on the Surface
","Roman Polanski's CHINATOWN, is a must for fans of L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, although that film does not hold a candle to this.  Not only does it have style, but it has as much substance, something rare in most movies.  And yes, it is a product of the 1970's, the first decade when films showed the influence of their predecessors.  This is an homage to film-noir, of course, but it elevates the genre to a whole new level because of its deep psychological themes.  I could discuss the plot, which is as thick as a dictionary, but 1000 words is not enough to encapsulate this fantastic movie.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson plays JJ Gittes in an understated, Bogart-type way, however he is still a difficult man to figure out.  The film ends, fittingly, in Chinatown, where Gittes got his start in this business.  We don't know what went wrong with him there, something hinted at while in bed with Dunaway's Mrs. Mulwray, but it must have been messy.  The ending is a stunning payoff to what has transpired.  It is unexpected and it is sad.  Dunaway turns in a deceptively great performance as the tortured femme fatale.  Notice her mannerisms whenever her father is brought up.  First time viewers will cringe when they find out why she acts this way.<br/><br/>Legendary director John Huston plays the father, Noah Cross, one of the most reprehensible characters in recent memory.  You sense evil when he's on-screen and he is symbolic of the drought in L.A.  The man is soulless and insane. Polanski brings together a great cast of stars and then unknowns to create an ever-unfolding plot that turns left when you expect a right.  He even puts himself in the mix, taking a piece out of Gittes snoopy nose.<br/><br/>It is also beautifully photographed, with golden daylights remembering a more golden age, and serene sunsets and nights.  Underneath is the evil of murder, theft, and incest.  Think of all of the elements.  Its like a Hitchcock filmography of props: B/w photos, dead decoys, bi-focal glasses, water basins, broken taillights, the eye of a fish, bandaged nose, a sister, and a daughter. Jerry Goldsmith's musical score echoes loss and tragedy as everything comes to a rousing, murderous halt in CHINATOWN.<br/><br/>(NOTE: This film should be seen in its widescreen format on video.  Each shot is almost portrait-like and watching the pan-and-scan cropped version is like pressing your nose against the glass and watching.)"
"MartinHafer","8","3","12","26 April 2007"," A very nice, if imperfect, homage to Film Noir
","While I know that CHINATOWN has a great reputation and has received many 10s from reviewers, as a fan of Film Noir, I saw a few minor problems that kept the score from being a bit higher--though it's still an exceptional film. First, as any devoted fan of Noir knows, Noir is always, and I repeat, always filmed in black and white. The great shadows and camera angles are an important trademark of the style. While this Roman Polanski film is beautifully filmed (with a lot of sepia tones) and it definitely has the look of a late 1930s Warner Brothers gangster film, it just isn't true Noir because it's in color! Second, and this is a problem shared by THE BIG SLEEP, is that the plot is very, very complicated--perhaps a bit too complicated--making the resolution of mysteries and complications a bit too simple. The end, in particular, just seemed too convoluted a solution and left a lot of loose ends. BUT, getting past these factors, the film is still exceptional. Jack Nicholson was terrific and so was the rest of the cast. And the film was definitely interesting and exciting. It's definitely one of the better films of the 1970s--but I just can't see this as a better film than many of the earlier Noir films, such as THE KILLERS, KISS OF DEATH or DOA."

","This is understandably a classic film noir. Every time I watch it, I somehow get the idea it was made in the '80s, and every time I am surprised to 'find out' it was made in the year I was born. The atmosphere of the recreated era of California is superbly done; so many shots could be paused and looked at as paintings. The story unfolds quite haphazardly, but it works, even up to the gloomy ending, which has its undeniable place and point in a (the) world where 'hierarchy' remains a key word. Faye Dunaway is the stunning femme fatale, Jack Nicholson is the reluctant but hard headed private dick, and the supporting roles, especially the one by John Huston as a way too rich and arrogant, beastly man, are more than satisfactory. And still...<br/><br/>I love this film, but somehow I can never get myself to give this one the full 10 out of 10.

","Reference Sherlock Holmes about the drawbacks of getting emotionally involved with your clients and the efficacy of police interrogation techniques after watching 'CHINATOWN'...<br/><br/>There was this bespectacled, light-skinned little lady I knew in high school. She usually sat in the front of the class at Cass Tech. and kept to herself; never saying much. I have no doubt she collected her 'A's, got her diploma, and matriculated her way out into the real world and her rightful place in the social order. I would have to compare her to Rosa Parks in her demeanor and psychological disposition.<br/><br/>Imagine my surprise when I sat down next to her in the back of the Crosstown bus, and on route to our destinations she starts riffing about 'CHINATOWN'! Normally, when I meet strangers, acquaintances, and friends, I dominate the conversation with my rambling free association about my experiences and events, but not so in this case. The young lady communicated to me with an uncharacteristic animation and enthusiasm that I was certain had nothing to do with my personal charm, good looks or winning personality; or perhaps lack thereof. I spent most of our ride listening to her explain in great detail about this wonderful film involving a private eye who puts all the pieces together in a murder mystery and yet still ends up mishandling it all when he gets to Chinatown.<br/><br/>When I rang the bell to get off at my stop, I couldn't shake the uncomfortable feeling that this little woman thought this film somehow gave her a kind of special insight into me and my own experience in Life. I was a pretty popular playwright back in high school with an extensive share of performance successes and debacles. All the while we were riding over to the East Side she kept urging me that I should see this film. Being, as I said, a quiet and unassuming person, she did not press the point much beyond that. I shrugged off what she said, and despite telling her that I would have to see the film when I got a chance; it would be years before I actually did see it. But these words she uttered rang through my mind like an unanswered telephone, ""Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.""<br/><br/>Finally, the opportunity presented itself at the Helen De Roy Auditorium on the campus of Wayne State University. I went with my sister and a good friend Nick Meyers. We sat in the darkened auditorium and when the film ended, didn't know quite what to say to each other or what to make of it. Nick had to go pick up his girl friend and my sister gave me a ride back into to Highland Park where I was working on a script for her to be aired on educational television.<br/><br/>I have said all of the above because I feel a special personal connection to 'CHINATOWN'. It is about many things; but primarily it is about how Money and Politics and the viewpoint of a severely disturbed tycoon affects the quality of relationships and environment in Southern California. That being said, this does not begin to describe the effect that 'CHINATOWN' can have on the viewer. I think these two quotes from the screenplay might better illustrate what I mean:<br/><br/>GITTES<br/><br/>I'll tell you the unwritten law, you dumb son<br/><br/>of a bitch, you gotta be rich to kill somebody,<br/><br/>anybody and get away with it. You think you got <br/><br/>that kind of dough, you think you got that kind<br/><br/>of class?<br/><br/>MULWRAY<br/><br/>In case you've forgotten, gentlemen, over five<br/><br/>hundred lives were lost when the Vander der Lip <br/><br/>Dam gave way.

Well, it won't hold. I won't build it.<br/><br/>It's that simple. I am not making that kind of mistake<br/><br/>twice. Thank you, gentlemen.<br/><br/>There are three films I always felt could have been directed by a Satanist. They are 'THE EXORCIST', 'ROSEMARY'S BABY' and 'CHINATOWN'. Oddly enough, Roman Polanski has directed two of them. This is a comment on the darkness of the subject matter and is not meant as a pejorative statement.<br/><br/>Even in the beginning of 'CHINATOWN' one has the feeling that one is experiencing a sick, twisted point of view. Polanski excels at creating this general air of perversity and corruption as an indefinable something you can't quite put your finger on, but which you know is there. The other thing he excels at in this movie is that sustained sense of deja vu'; that growing dread and sense of the impression that '-it's happening again-'; such as I have only felt directing performances of one-act plays, demonstrating defensive tactics in the police academy as a police cadet or having a Zorba-like inspiration about teaching the Grid Technique in the classroom only to have it all fall apart in actual practice and application.<br/><br/>""Forget it, Jake.

","I was quite excited about 'Chinatown' because of the so many great things I had heard about. When the movie started on a slow pace, I was having my doubts whether I would like it. However, this is a layered movie and as the story unfolds, it gets darker and dangerous, and when you look back, you understand that nothing was as it seemed. There are plenty of twist and turns and yet they manage to develop the story without seeming out of place. This is easily one of Polanski's best films. Much of it is a homage to the noire genre but I also see some Kubrick references. The cinematography deserves special mention. I don not consider myself a Jack Nicholson fan but he's very good as detective Gittes determined to seek the truth. John Huston is terrific as Noah. His Noah is the villain of the scariest kind. He appears to be a charming, friendly and basically nice guy but there's a sleazy and greedy monster behind that facade. Yet, for me the star of 'Chinatown' is Faye Dunaway. At first, she seems like your typical film-noire femme fatale type but there is much more to her character and I repeat again that nothing is as it seems, watch a little further"

I STILL think the ending is not necessary (screenwriter Robert Towne complained a lot that director Roman Polanski changed his happy ending into a horrifying one) but I find the entire movie fascinating. It catches the 1930s perfectly down to the clothes, the houses, the cars--everything. The script is very involved--you have to pay strict attention or you'll miss some of the many twists. The script deservedly won an Academy Award. The acting is just great--Nicholson, Dunaway and Huston are just perfect in their roles. It runs over two hours but I was never once bored. The cinematography and music just add to the 1930s mood. Also this was the last film Roman Polanski directed in the USA before leaving to avoid being jailed on rape charges. Beautifically directed, acted and shot. A 10 all the way."
"varundelpiero","9","1","3","30 October 2008"," One of the finest pieces of American cinema...
","1974 was just a great year for The Motion Picture. Not only did it produce such works as THE GODFATHER PART II (possible the best movie of ALL time), THE TOWERING INFERNO, LENNY, A WOMAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE, and THE CONVERSATION, but added to that esteemed list is the magnificent CHINATOWN, which is perhaps the finest piece of film noir ever created (save for L.A. CONFIDENTIAL).<br/><br/>Roman Polanski's thriller/mystery is easily the best film of his fine catalog, though some may argue that THE PIANIST was much more powerful. The direction and style are simply brilliant, and every scene of CHINATOWN's ~210 minute run-time is excellent, and serves a purpose in the telling of the story.<br/><br/>The screenplay itself is also excellent, and Robert Towne deserved the Oscar hands-down. There are enough twists and turns here to keep the viewer on edge, and warrant multiple viewings. This film is not for those who find it hard to pay attention unless there is a mindless explosion or chase-sequence every 5 minutes. It is worth noting here that Towne and Polanski had a bitter series of conflicts regarding the ending of the film; a series which Polanski eventually won, much to the delight of film noir enthusiasts everywhere. Towne's ending was less realistic and more pretentious, and years later he realised that the right choice was indeed made.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson produces perhaps his finest piece of work, arguably even better than ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST and AS GOOD AS IT GETS. Indeed this was the film that propelled Nicholson to the level of 'superstar', and rightly so. From the start of the movie, the viewer gets the sense that his character is just another generic, super-heroic, super-smart, invincible P.I. who never seems to falter. However, as the character develops, we see that this is not the case, as we discover that the character is actually human; he feels, he cares, he makes mistakes, he even bleeds.<br/><br/>Faye Dunaway is equally impressive as the 'femme fatale', and her interaction with Nicholson will keep the viewer intrigued and entertained. John Huston pulls off the greedy wealthy 'super-villain' as effectively as any other actor, yet for some unknown reason fell short of an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>The cinematography and set design are excellent, as Alonzo recreates 1930s Los Angeles in a beautifully flawless manner. The use of colour (which was seen as somewhat 'taboo' in film noirs at that time) was effective, and helped to enhance the picture rather than distract attention from the main plot.<br/><br/>This is definitely a film that deserves multiple viewings as mentioned earlier, so that the viewer can piece together the mystery in hindsight, and discover elements that he/she missed on the first viewing. The film and screenplay could potentially work quite effectively as teaching tools in film/literature schools as the efficacy and power evoked in the direction and writing are top-notch. Indeed, the whole notion of 'CHINATOWN' works not only as a locale, but on a more profound level as a state of mind.<br/><br/>This is altogether a brilliant movie and garners a place on any serious film viewer's Top 100. It should enter mine at #84 or so. Were it not for the supremely excellent THE GODFATHER PART II, this film would have won the Best Picture Oscar, and Roman Polanski would have won his first Best Director Oscar. (Note: He eventually won Best Director in 2002 for THE PIANIST)<br/><br/>4 stars (out of 4). 9/10. Unreservedly recommended."

Faye Dunaway plays her role wonderfully; it seemed so natural.<br/><br/>As long as no one spoils the ending for you, be prepared for a mixture of emotions.<br/><br/>Polanski did a wonderful job directing, the music is perfect, Robert Towne's script is alive and kicking!

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","1","3","8 April 2008"," ""Chinatown"" is simple but elegant, a noir for the 70s
","The best crime films of all time continue to prove that they're not about the action and the plot twists. While ""Chinatown"" certainly keeps you guessing, it's the style of the film and the acting that make it so good. You don't watch ""Chinatown"" when you're in the mood for a good thriller--you watch it when you want to see fine film-making.<br/><br/>""Chinatown"" is about a private investigator named J.J. Gittes (Jack Nicholson) who is hired by Evelyn Mulwray, the wife of the man in charge of Los Angeles' water supply, to find out who her husband is having an affair with. When her husband turns up dead and the woman Gittes thought was Mulwray was actually someone else, Gittes and the real Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) begin an investigation and a relationship in the process of discovering the truth. Gittes eventually finds himself in a bit of trouble as he tries to figure it all out, including receiving a slashed nose (a character played by director Roman Polanski)<br/><br/>It is only fitting that the character who scars Gittes is played by Polanski himself. He leaves a mark on Gittes that we see for the rest of the film, that is symbolic of his own marks on the film as a director. First of all, Polanski is at his prime with this film. His semi-first person camera angles and pans seem to really suit the film well. While he had a ton of help from screenwriter Robert Towne (who won the only Oscar the film received), the characters' subtleties are by far their most interesting and important features.<br/><br/>Nicholson and Dunaway do some great noir acting. Nicholson is a clever, foul-mouthed, lovably dislikable protagonist and Dunaway succeeds at portraying the fact that her character appears to be hiding something from Gittes in nearly every scene. Both were worthy of their Oscar nominations. The film doesn't work without them both being very interesting characters to watch.<br/><br/>As with any mystery that's really not so much about the mystery and more about subtleties, ""Chinatown"" warrants a second viewing. You need to be able to spend more time paying attention to Nicholson's references to his life in Chinatown, for example, and spend less time trying to make sense of the plot. The plot is certainly interesting and the ending really delivers what you've been waiting for in a film where people are getting mixed up in things they shouldn't be. ""Chinatown"" is undoubtedly a classic, even if it lacks the attractive swagger that films like ""The Godfather Pt. II"" (which beat it out for the Oscar) have."
"bobsgrock","9","1","3","28 March 2008"," A remarkable picture.
","Chinatown is and incredible experience, one of the best in film history. The story is captivating and the direction is perfect as the audience begins to figure out what is going on at the same time Jack Nicholson's J.J. Gittes does. In brief, Gittes is a private detective who is investigating alleged affairs between the water commissioner Hollis Mulwray and some woman. As Gittes continues to search, he finds way more than he bargained for including an alluring, mysterious woman with a dark secret, her rich and psychologically powerful father, and a plan that will forever change the future of the city of Los Angeles. Modeled after the classic film noirs of the 1930s and 1940s, Chinatown perfectly captures that era with wonderful sets, terrific acting, smooth directing, and a script hailed today as one of the best ever written. Overall, Chinatown is comparable to The Maltese Falcon and Double Indemnity as one of the best film noirs ever put onto celluloid."
"gcd70","7","1","3","25 March 2008"," Cleverly woven tale
","Classic, old fashioned tale of murder and deceit is cleverly woven by formidable director Roman Ploanski. This, one of his most renowned and successful works, tells the story of private dick Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson), who is embroiled in a scandal involving the LA water board after being used to frame its chief engineer.<br/><br/>Well known writer Robert Towne has penned an involving plot which twists and turns and becomes ever more complex as the film goes on. A credit to him also are his three dimensional, well written characters that audiences will really appreciate. Nicholson (looking very young and fresh faced) is most convincing as the street wise p.i. who is determined to uncover the major players in a conspiracy that seems to reach farther and deeper than anyone ever suspected. Alongside him is a solid Faye Dunaway as the wife who slowly shifts from hopeless victim to definite suspect. The support these two leads get form John Huston (a most enjoyable turn), Perry Lopez and Burt Young is also most commendable.<br/><br/>Wrapping up this entertaining fare are some striking sets and dapper costumes that bring 30's LA effectively and affectively to life, while Jerry Goldsmith's score is a memorable one. Really though, top accolades must go to director Polanski (who also made a cameo appearance) and screenwriter Towne (academy award winner for this) for fashioning such an intriguing yarn. Due note goes to a strong cast.<br/><br/>Saturday, July 13, 1996 - Video"

","The problem with these classic movies is that seeing them for the first time 30 years after the fact, once their classic status has had plenty of time to ferment can often be a slightly deflating experience. After all, there's very few movies that can live up to that kind of expectation.<br/><br/>That in mind ""Chinatown"" still holds up brilliantly, by virtue of being an obvious inspiration for so much that has come since. Watching it now its easy to see its echoes rippling through hundreds of subsequent movies, from ""Blade Runner"" to ""Brick"".

"shhimundercoverdamnit","10","1","3","15 February 2008"," ""How do you like them apples?""
","Chinatown=Landmark film. It's not only one of the greatest detective films ever, but one of the most perfectly constructed of all films ever.<br/><br/>It all starts off on a quite familiar footing. Jaded Los Angeles Private Eye Jack Gittes ( Jack Nicholson) is hired to investigate Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling), builder of the city's water supply system, over a possible affair.<br/><br/>Not a pretty complex case, right?............ Gittes simply does what he does best and photographs Mulwray with a young girl. Case closed right? Wrong! From here, Jake is quickly brought into a world of intrigue, corruption, and double crosses as the real Mrs. Mulwray ( Faye Dunaway) makes an appearance, and her husband quickly turns up dead.<br/><br/>With every lead that Gittes comes across, there seems to be a connection with water. So it is here that he unravels the City of Angels scandals one after the next, but the biggest mystery is what, and who, lies at the heart of it all.<br/><br/>Nicholson is absolute magic as Gittes, and his face can tell a thousand stories, with or without the plaster on the nose. His wicked grin softens his character's world- weary cynicism and adds an interesting sympathetic edge to his hard, somewhat aloof at times character.<br/><br/>Dunaway is her typical enigmatic-self. Her whole ""sister... daughter... sister... daughter"" routine has to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>I have to say though, that is is John Huston who steals the film though. His Cross is the perfect foil as the disturbing father. Guy just gives me the creeps. Especially, that final scene with Katherine.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis sure did his homework for There Will Be Blood. The voice and some of the mannerisms he adopted in playing the oil-man Plainview were pure John Huston.<br/><br/>In fact, speaking of the film's ending.... I think the murder of Polanski's wife Sharon Tate goes along way in explaining the tragic conclusion, and certainly the despair the film leaves you with.<br/><br/>One of the things I love most about the film, heck referring to the title itself: is the whole idea of past events haunting and influencing character's actions in the present.<br/><br/>For instance, Jake failing to save the life of a woman he had cared for when he was a detective in Chinatown, Evelyn's own troubled history, etc.<br/><br/>I think my favorite line from the film, is uttered by Cross to Jake when he says, """"You may think you know what you're dealing with, but, believe me, you don't."" Easily one of the best lines in a film, filled with em.... You know the situation, Gittes finds himself in goes way beyond murder or scandal. Cross was far above the power of the mayor or even police. As Evelyn cries. ""He owns the police!""<br/><br/>Also look for director Roman Polanski as the thug who pokes a switchblade up Nicholson's nostril while uttering the infamous line: ""You're a very nosy fellow, kitty cat. Huh? You know what happens to nosy fellows? Huh? No? Wanna guess? Huh? No? Okay. They lose their noses."" <br/><br/>I think my favorite scene from the entire film is the one where Jake beats the crap out of that goon in the retirement home. Just something about the way it was filmed......"
"shafatqadri","9","1","3","15 February 2008"," Enter the Chinatown!!!!!!!!!!
","This is Roman Polanski at his best. I had seen Roman Polanski's The Pianist before I watched Chinatown. I won't bother attempting to summarize this masterpiece. It would be an exercise in futility and would only detract from the genius of the film. Suffice it to say, the plot is complicated and watching this intricate and deadly web unfold is a source of joy that bears many repeated viewings.<br/><br/>This is the film credited with creating the mythic figure that we know as Jack Nicholson. His portrayal of a private detective caught in a conspiracy much greater than he can handle is the maypole that the other characters, both naughty and nice, skip around. His charm and his vulnerability keep the viewer interested in the increasingly complex course of events.<br/><br/>And the other characters, while not as prominent, are searingly memorable. John Huston's turn as a man wealthy enough to have a different set of laws apply is frighteningly understated with his power. Faye Dunaway manically switches from serenely confident to skittishly fragile as each layer of protective secrets is peeled away.<br/><br/>You need to watch CHinatown many times. Many subtle plot points won't be caught on a single viewing. Also the hypnotic pace that is maintained is all the more powerful when you already know what is going to happen. After repeated viewings the ending in particular seems painfully inevitable and as a result all the more tragic. The cynicism of the climax is not terribly surprising when you come to know that Polanski's wife was brutally murdered by some gang several years earlier.<br/><br/>Not long after the success of Chinatown, Roman Polanski fled to Europe avoiding a conviction for consensual sex with a thirteen year old girl. Chinatown is likely to remain the pinnacle of his work and a watershed in American cinema."
"dacart","10","1","3","14 January 2008"," The Score! and.. it's ""lose"" NOT ""loose"" !!!!
","Another reason to see ""Chinatown"" is for the incredible score by Jerry Goldsmith. The following is something a friend of mine Steve Horowitz wrote to me about the score: ""The film score for CHINATOWN is as famous for the conditions under which it was written as it is for the music itself. Shortly before the film was to debut, producer Robert Evans discarded the score written by composer Phillip Lambro and handed the project to Jerry Goldsmith.<br/><br/>Goldsmith had ten days to both write and record a new score before CHINATOWN debuted. The resulting score was extremely sparse, making use of several songs popular during the 1930s and resting upon a single original theme--but it proved the perfect additive to the film, and it is extremely difficult to image CHINATOWN without it Jerry Goldsmith's work on Chinatown may be the best work ever done for a film score. Utilizing an avant garde ensemble (four pianos, four harps, percussion, strings, and solo trumpet) the composer paints a sound-scape both eerie and nostalgic -- imagine listening to thirties jazz echoing through layers of deep water. The cumulative effect of this perfectly organized album is one of quiet, aching despair. The three tracks of source music add to Goldsmith's remarkable achievement. A must for anyone interested in serious instrumental music."" <br/><br/>Finally, I would not comment on this except it is literally the fourth time today that I have seen this misspelled. The word is ""lose"" NOT ""loose."" as in ""how Nicholson could loose(sic) to Art Carney..."" PLEASE any one reading this who doesn't know the difference between lose and loose please note: A LOOSE ball that is picked up by the other team can help you LOSE the game.<br/><br/>Thanks for your indulgence in this.

","(There are Spoilers) It's Los Angeles 1937 where there's a major controversy over a dam being built outside of city limits. The dam is to divert precious water from the valley that will in effect drive the farmers there into bankruptcy and foreclosure of their homes and farmland.<br/><br/>Private Eye J.J Jake Gittes, Jack Nicholson, unknowingly gets involved with this water scheme by being contacted by this woman, Diane Ladd, claiming to be the wife of L.A's Power & Water Commissioner Hollis I. Mulwary, Darrell Zwerling. Claiming that her husband is cheating on her ""Mrs. Evelyn Mulwary"" has Gittes get the goods on him by photographing Mr. Mulwary with this young woman,Belinda Palmer, with the photos ending up in the local papers. It's later when Gittes is contacted by the real Mrs. Evelyn Mulwary, Faye Dunnaway, that he realizes that he's been taken for a sucker by whoever this woman the fake Mrs. Mulwary, who turned out to be a Mrs. Ida Sessions, is and the person who hired her!<br/><br/>""Chinatown"" then has a number of surprises hit both PI Gittes and its audience in that Mrs. Mulwary is the estranged daughter of L.A power broker Noah Cross, John Huston. Cross made his millions in real estate and land development with the help of Hollis Mulwary his son-in-law. It's not long after that Mr. Mulwary ends up dead in the L.A reservoir with the L.A coroner concluding that his death was either an accident or suicide!<br/><br/>Gittes knowing that Mr. Mulwary was actually murdered in that he opposed Cross' plan to build a dam that will in fact threaten the people, mostly farmers, who live around it goes out of his way to find out who in fact did murder Mr. Mulwary. Gittes suspicions are confirmed in the fact that Mr. Mulwary's lungs were filled with salt water making it impossible that he drowned in the fresh water L.A reservoir.<br/><br/>the kicker to this whole shady project, the building of the dam, is soon discovered, with the help of Mrs. Sessions, by PI Gittes in that Cross and his stooges in the L.A City government are buying up the land that's to be irrigated by the dam dirt cheap from the hard pressed farmers. With a bill later in the year to be voted on by the people of L.A, that's sure to pass, the valley will become part of Los Angeles proper and be worth some 30 million dollars! A fraction of what Cross & Co. bought it for!<br/><br/>The crooked land deal angle of ""Chinatown"" is really secondary to what the real deal in the movie is and that has to do with the mysterious young woman whom the late Mr. Hollis Mulwary was involved with. It's that young woman that's been kept secret by both Mr. Cross and his daughter Evelyn Mulwary from PI Gittes. In the end she's the reason for both Cross & Evelyn's strange and unnatural actions in the film. That's until her true identity is revealed at the conclusion of the movie which just about blew Gittes mind!<br/><br/>Dark and suspenseful film noir with Jack Nicholson at his best as PI Gittes finding out that he bit off far more the he can chew in taking on the powerful and at the same time degenerate Noah Cross. Gittes should have known better that he just can't win in his fight with Cross and the people that he controlled,that included the entire LAPD. It was Gittes' cockiness in that he could derail Cross' plan that lead to the tragedy at the end of the movie that took place in the Chinatown section of L.A.<br/><br/>Director Roman Polaski beside making one of the classic film noir films of the post WWII Hollywood era also had a cameo appearance in the movie paying one of Cross' knife wielding hoods. Polanski was the person who sliced open Gittes nose having him go through almost the entire movie with a massive bandage on his face. That bandage, covering almost half his face, was a tempting target for anyone who got psychically involved, like the farmers in the valley, with him in the movie."

","The story of a secret love affair which turns out to be a woman's bitter journey through life is well presented in the movie. Jack Nicholson (J.J Gittes) is hired twice as a private investigator to reveal the mystery of a murder which normally could be considered as a matter of money but it isn't; it's all because of secret adultery between a father and his daughter which remains a secret till the last minutes of the picture. <br/><br/>The last ten minutes of the story leaves clears the whole story about the lie behind the secret girlfriend and also water and energy used as an excuse to masquerade a murder. <br/><br/>It's a nice one if you happen to watch a mystery. The nice idea of the dumb police killing the woman who was paying too much price for her and her father's actions is just nice not just because it's true and it happens a lot, but also because of the idea that it's just Chinatown and Jake ought to forget the love affair he just had with the woman. <br/><br/>It wasn't the best but it's definitely worth to watch."
"Doylenf","8","1","3","7 October 2006"," Imperfect film noir never gets near the real ""Chinatown""...
","It's surprising that for all the slavish attention to period detail that Roman Polanski puts into CHINATOWN, he lets down the audience in the finale which is supposed to take place in the actual Chinatown at night. Instead, it looks (as the original review in The New York Times pointed out), more like Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn with a few neon signs flickering in the background for Oriental flavor, filmed on an artificial, improvised set. It's a letdown when the film's most crucial moments aren't given the careful period flavor that goes into the majority of the piece. It's also unworthy of the film's final line: ""Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.""<br/><br/>Robert Foote's screenplay owes a great deal to Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett, both expert writers of crime detective fiction full of sardonic humor and double entendre remarks, usually delivered in deadpan manner by whomever was playing the male detective.<br/><br/>In both CHINATOWN and THE MALTESE FALCON, a private eye gets involved in a messy case involving murder and other assorted mayhem, drawn into the case by a cool femme fatale who knows more than she's saying, and a cast of mostly unsavory characters living in the fringes of L.A.'s Chinatown area where crime in the 1930s is rampant.<br/><br/>In this case, the cynical, hard-nosed detective is played to perfection by JACK NICHOLSON in the kind of role he excelled in, justly winning a Best Actor nomination. And likewise, the inscrutable dame is played by FAYE DUNAWAY in the sort of part Mary Astor essayed in ""The Maltese Falcon"". Instead of Sydney Greenstreet, we get JOHN HUSTON in the role of her megalomaniac, corrupt father. And keeping all of this fascinating material well in hand is Roman Polanski, himself a player in the film as the hood who slashes Nicholson's nose.<br/><br/>It's gritty, authentic looking (except for the above-mentioned flaw) and captures the mood of the story with its Los Angeles backgrounds and detailed attention to '30s styles. Visually, it's a masterpiece--and while the story gets a little slow once in awhile in uncovering a convoluted plot involving land rights and water control, it leads to a highly suspenseful ending.<br/><br/>A stylish thriller, well worth watching, especially if you love film noir. But somehow, Bogie's image hovers over most of the dialog and it falls far short of being called a ""masterpiece"" as many have done here. A more concise, compact telling of the tale would have made that description more apt instead of this long, rambling story with its engineering background and slow revelations."

Dunaway gives perhaps the best performance of her career as the tormented Femme Fatale with a secret past. The fine supporting cast includes Huston as a menacing patriarch. This is the best film on Polanski's impressive resume and he beautifully evokes 1930s L.A. with a film noir look composed of muted colors, perfectly complemented by Goldsmith's moody score and Towne's Oscar-winning script. The director also has a memorable cameo as a knife-wielding heavy. A haunting masterpiece."
"alexx668","8","1","3","16 May 2006"," Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown..
","Roman Polanski's neo-noir ""Chinatown"" presents a nihilistic outlook on mankind. A cynical and detached private detective (specialist in extramarital affairs) deals with what seems a typical adultery case, which quickly turns to a complex affair that includes murder, political corruption, financial scandals, destroyed families and so on. The bleakness is pretty impressive.<br/><br/>The detective himself ain't doing much better, unable to define between right and wrong, and also repeating the same mistakes he made in the past when he served in the police-force in Chinatown. And so it is, the ending brings him back to Chinatown, where his actions damn the people he's supposed to protect. However, it's his detachment which dominates; a cowardly submission to fate; a depression.<br/><br/>The ending is great, aided by a moody jazzy soundtrack. On the downside, the plot at times seems forced, just so that Polanski gets his points across. But a tight brooding thriller all the same."
"rivendell1","10","1","3","13 May 2006"," Couple of interesting points
","I once took a class in screen writing in Hollywood and there was general agreement that this was the best screenplay ever written. A couple of trivia points that may be of some interest. There was a great scene with the wonderful actor Royal Dano that for reasons never made clear Polanski edited out at the last minute. It happened just before Gittes goes in search of the Orange groves in the valley. That was a mistake by Polanski. There was a scene in the script in which Gittes is in an airplane flying to meet Noah Cross for the first time where the pilot actually tells Gittes that there was a rumor that Cross had an incestuous relationship with his daughter. BIG mistake by R. Towne to foreshadow like that and the right decision by Polanski to cut it out. Also, Polanski and Faye Dunaway absolutely despised each other on the set culminating in the now famous confrontation with Polanski actually dropping his pants and pissing on her script notes in front of her. Just a great movie all around!"

","This is a top ten for me. I have watched this film several times, and each time I see why Jack Nicholson is one of our great American actors. It starts with a story of complexity but accessibility. Nicholson's Jake Gittes, running around with a slit in the side of his nose, put there by Polanski, investigates, gets careless, and realizes what he has stumbled upon. Fay Dunaway as Mrs. Mulray and John Huston and that voice: ""Just find the girl."" There are comic scenes and Nicholson has feet of clay, but he finally puts his personal integrity on the line. He moves into darkness and sees the underside. And then there is Chinatown with its secrets, politics, incest, all of that. It is such an intelligent movies. One of the reviewers said it was compact. That says it all. Every scene is necessary. It's too bad Polanski can't work in the U.S. anymore--he still releases a treasures every so often. To get back to the movie, all that leads to the climactic last several minutes has been prepared for with loving care by the director. It's so nice to know that there are films like this that people will watch into the latter stages of the 21st century. One of finest."

Upon watching it Wednesday night, I can see what he's talking about. Sitting here, I can remember not a single flaw in this film. Nicholson, Dunaway, and all the actors are consistently great, even brilliant, and the cinematography is amazing. Roman Polanski's life's story is so sad, it's amazing the level of art he is able to craft in his pictures. Really, I had a sense of awe walking out of Cheray on Wednesday night, a similar feeling I had after seeing The Pianist a few years ago. The difference is, I didn't leave Chinatown hating humanity and all of human history.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson is incredible in this film. As outgoing and brass as he is in The Last Detail, it's amazing to see him so coy and careful in this picture. As each week goes by we are seeing his legend grow, and it's really thrilling.<br/><br/>Next, I want to comment that I was not expecting such a great mystery story going into this. It was like watching one of these detective TV shows, but instead of flat characters and predictable story lines I saw a brilliantly round bunch of people living a huge twisted life. It's violent and it's loving, it's suspenseful and heartbreaking. I can't say enough about how perfect a film I think this is.<br/><br/>Next, I want to comment on the use of the score in this film. The trumpet solos are simply haunting. They add age to the film, in echoing the popular music of the time, and they add a sort of eerie tone. It's absolutely perfect for a mystery like this.<br/><br/>I also want to comment on the credits being at the beginning of the film. Not only does this show importance with regards to the entire production staff, but Polanski presents them in such a way that immediately set the time of the movie. The script is old-fashioned, the background is an old-fashioned theatre curtain, and the colors are deep browns, black, and white.

","In Chinatown, it is not just the filming or the acting thats good, like in most cases. Everything in this movie is excellent; the writing is the best I have ever seen and I totally believed that it was the prewar 1940's. All of the characters are believable and the story line is great, not to mention the great musical score. This movie has a plethora of famous quotes such as when Gittes is at Mrs.Mulwray's home, Mrs.Mulwray asks Jake what he use to do working for the District Atourney, Gittes replies with, ""As little as possible."" All of the clothes, sets, and cars and any other items on screen point to the times of the 1940's. The film does a good job of sending out a message: Things may be very complicated and no matter how hard you try, you just won't understand them. ""Forget it Jake, it's Chinatown."" Nicholson was born for the part of Jake Gittes and he is beside Faye Dunaway, who is mostly famous for ""Bonnie and Clyde."""

This is 2006, and with all the CGI blowing city blocks to dust and rubble, and nudity and murder stylized and glorified, this film made 32 years ago shows us a dark and disturbing world of the city. Before gangsters had Escalades sittin on dubs, and crack rocks bigger than caramel covered candy apples, we had Chinatown. Gritty, down-to-earth, raw and never flinching, Roman Polanski shows us the not so glamorous parts of humanity. As we watch this crime unfold before our eyes, we come to realize to truth is even more bone chilling than the idea of the truth before it. Polanski touches parts of our soul not generally touched by Hollywood. How perfect can you make a film? This film is about as close as it gets. There are hardly any mistakes in this masterpiece.

This is truly a great story, and I like the fact that it is indirectly based on William Mulholland and is set in Los Angeles in the 1930's. Robert Towne, the screenwriter, did a magnificent job but Roman Polanski was right about the ending- I won't spoil it- which Towne was so much against. Jack Nicholson delivers one of his strongest performances as a Private Detective J.J. Gittes who faces many problems and uncovers many things that soon lead to a memorable night in Chinatown. Nominated for 11 Oscars, it won one for best screenplay, Robert Towne. This movie received an R Rating for no reason- there is hardly any violence, language, but there are some scenes that are kind of explicit involving really just dialog.

Perhaps it is Jake's pure desperation. However, if so...it makes the scene feel rushed where it need not be rushed.<br/><br/>Otherwise, this is a wonderful film and should be required viewing for any film buff. Polansky creates the right amount of confusion, intrigue, and atmosphere to bring the story to life in a way few directors can.

There isn't a great ""AHA!"" moment, nevertheless, at the end of the movie you feel completely overwhelmed by it's meticulous planning.

","Yet once again Jack Nicholson shows us how it's done by simply doing what he does best, playing himself. Chinatown is a unique and fairly impressive noir piece that I was only recently able to see. Much like L.A. Confidential, CT throws us right into the mix of the old days, very convincingly, through great cinematography and perfect set pieces.  <br/><br/>Chinatown is fairly effective creating a mysterious atmosphere by using shady characters of questionable backgrounds and a story that holds much more to it than what's merely on the surface. Somewhat hard to follow when compared to most films, you really must pay attention during this one. This is not one to get up and go to the bathroom during unless you hit the pause button. I found this slightly annoying at first, but then it quickly grew on me. I like how everything here isn't spelled out for you in bold letters. One must pay attention and piece things together for themselves, which is exactly how a mystery should be. It keeps you on your toes. You never seem to know which direction the story is going to take you next.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is close to perfect. The cinematography, the score, and the acting are all top notch. All of these elements are combined into a screaming mystery flick. Some may be tempted to get bored at some point, but don't, you must pay attention. I personally enjoyed it quite well and think it's an excellent film. My one and only qualm with it though is the seemingly anti-climactic ending that, while realistic, simply comes out of nowhere without warning. I felt a tad let down at the end after all of that buildup, but the more I think about it, the more I actually like it. This, as I have heard from many people, is not a film to judge on it's first viewing, but one that must be viewed several times in order for the viewer to absorb everything. For this reason alone, and the fact that I've seen it only once, I can't bring myself to take too much away from it simply because of my one qualm with it. I must view it again and see if I like it better. I think I will do just that.<br/><br/>Overall, a great, beautiful, classic noir that won't soon be forgotten."

He knows he's been lied to and Dunaway enters the car, startled by his presence. He asks for the keys. She acts surprised. He says, ""It's either that or you drive to the police yourself..."" Again, she acts clueless. It is here where Nicholson makes the slightest of facial gestures, right before saying, ""C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray-- you've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there."" The whole scene is marvelous, and the facial expression makes it.<br/><br/>

The plot needn't be rehashed here. Instead, I'll focus on the many small details that in combination add up with such astonishing effect: the rich, evil Noah Cross repeatedly mispronouncing Gitte's name, or the slithery and completely unnerving way his arms enfold and drag away a character at film's end; the almost Asian, ""inscrutable"" look on Evelyn Mulray's face as she turns away from Gittes in bed after Gittes talks about Chinatown; Yelburton's secretary distractedly offering key clues to a ""nosy"" Gittes; the 2-dollar bill and the ASCAP card in Ida Session's wallet. So many brilliant, subtle touches.

Calling it a pastiche should not suggest that the director's unmistakable stylistic stamp is lacking; indeed, the unusual pacing, realistic texture, and vivid (if not always pleasant) characterizations are all there. But this time, the director's affection for his source material is so evident, and so genuine, that we see a less chilly, less gritty Polanski than we have before, and that's why 'Chinatown' is likely to appeal even to viewers who dislike his other pictures. The wonderful design helps a lot--the movie's bathed in rosy light--and the script and score aren't too shabby either.

","Not just for fans of Jack Nicholson, Roman Polanski's expertly crafted mid-70's riff on mid-40's film noir that takes place in Los Angeles circa the mid 30's is everything it's cracked up to be.  On one hand, it's simply a rock-solid mystery thriller chock full of quotable dialogue (my favorite line is Gettis to a police officer, ""Nevermind, you're dumber than you think I thought you were.""), political intrigue, snazzy private eyes, troublesome dames, grizzled henchmen, and excellent plot twists that service the story and aren't just there for the sake of surprise.  The scene where Gettis is slapping around Faye Dunaway's character in an attempt to get to the truth about the mystery girl is probably the best executed and most brilliantly conceived way to reveal a shocking plot twist in a movie that I have ever seen.  That alone would make it a damn fine film, but helmed by Polanksi, it's also a great work of art in terms of lighting, set design, pacing, and all those wonderful details.<br/><br/>Any time you think you spot a cliche or a genre cop-out, just remember this film probably did it first or was weaving and executing it in such a brilliant way as to make the term cliche moot.  The only traditional film noir to even come close to this level of brilliance since is Curtis Hanson's much thicker and twistier ""LA Confidential"" and that was over twenty years later."

To me, taking out the references to the Chinese in this film would be like removing deregatory references towards blacks in ""Malcolm X"" This is another one of those great films of the 70's that requires an attention span which more than half of the American population does not possess.

","Please note: I saw this movie edited for TV, so my review may have been different if I saw it unedited.<br/><br/>Chinatown plays much like an old film-noir, except this is in color, which, for some reason, works very well. In it, Jack Nicholson plays Jake Gettes. He's a private dick and is hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to look at her husband, since she thinks he's cheating on her. He then gets involved in a murder case and something with losing water in L.A. (which was quite smaller in the 40's, I learned).<br/><br/>Don't watch this alone! Actually, what I mean by that is watch it with someone else so you can ask them questions during the film. I'm glad I had that advantage. It's a really entertaining movie that also keeps you enthralled, not knowing what's going to happen next. Yet, it deservedly won its Best Original Screenply, which includes one-liners like: `Is that your phone number?' `I don't know, I don't call myself that often.' I laughed a couple times, which lightened the mood. I liked the mystery; I kept on guessing, but in the last half hour or so, I decided to just stop and let the entertainment speak for itself.<br/><br/>Nicholson did a very good job, what with the sliced nose and all. He made me believe that he was a P.I. The camerawork, though nothing impressive, showed us the timepiece, and I really thought I was in the 40's, set in some old noir that came to color. I supposed that was director Roman Polanski's idea all along. By the way, Polanski has a cameo as the hood who slices Jake's nose. Dunaway seemed to be perfect for the part, at least on what I've seen in the few old noirs I've seen.<br/><br/>The reason I didn't give Chinatown a higher rating is that I found myself playing with a paper clip a few times. I also wasn't really `thrilled' much, just into the mystery. The music was scarce but it was effective. I wish I could say more, but my memory's hazy, so I'll leave you with just saying `see it'!<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R for language and violence."

","Roman Polanski enjoyed his best film since his ""Rosemary's Baby"" with ""Chinatown.""  An extremely intricate, well conceived crime thriller scripted by Robert Towne and Polanski, this film is reminiscent of (or pays tribute to) a number of cinematic predecessors.<br/><br/>John Huston, who has a key role here, enjoyed his own great directorial success with ""The Maltese Falcon,"" and in ""Chinatown,"" the hero (played by Jack Nicholson in a Sam Spade/Phillip Marlow role) engages in a bit of deja vu with Faye Dunaway toward the end.  Nicholson phones the cops in the presence of Dunaway, then begs her to tell him the truth about her spurious ""alabi"" before the fuzz arrives. It's a situation directly from the Huston film (when Humphrey Bogart acts out an identical scenario with Mary Astor). <br/><br/>
Dunaway played the same type character here as six years earlier in ""The Thomas Crown Affair,"" and obviously did it so well that ""Thomas Crown"" served as a shoe-in for her casting in ""Chinatown.""  <br/><br/>Polanski's ""semi-subjective camera"" honors Robert Mongomery's pioneer work in ""Lady in the Lake"" (1947) as the viewer closely follows the action from the left shoulder of Nicholson as he craftily solves the mystery web.<br/><br/>
An unusual score with sharp percussive strikes in the low piano register, balanced with a cool trumpet and strings, embroider the soundtrack, and lending an air of both suspense and sophistication to the ambience.<br/><br/>
The business about private vs government controlled power and water seems a bit complex to fully fathom in a single viewing; still, the impression is that all the pieces of this involved puzzle fit together--the result of very crafty writing.<br/><br/>The result is a film that holds up well despite it's forthcoming quarter century anniversary.

Young Nicholson rules with one of his best performances from the days

super-cool without the super-creepiness of his later acting

exciting, but it's one of the film's strengths to take an ostensibly
boring
topic and make it fascinating. You wonder who's behind this gigantic (30
million dollar) fraud, and why the poor water board guy had to be killed,
and what the water guy's supposed ""girlfriend"" had to do with it.

","Even though it was made in 1974, almost 30 years after the 'noir period' in Hollywood could be said to have ended, Chinatown remains as much one of the hallmarks of that classic style as do movies from the golden era themselves (""The Big Sleep"", ""Touch of Evil"" etc)<br/><br/>   Director Polanski and screenwriter Towne have created a faultless universe filled with some of the most memorable characters ever to grace a cinema screen.  Chief amongst these is embittered private eye Jake Gittes, played expertly by Jack Nicholson.  Gittes has a quick wit and a low tolerance for fools, but he won't rest until he's finally solved a case. When Evelyn Mulray (Dunaway) appears on the scene, it sets in motion an astonishing chain of events that harks back to an era in Jake's life he's trying to put behind him.  ""Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown... ""<br/><br/>   The mystery that unfolds is labyrinthine, but even if you're not a big 'whodunnit' fan, it's worth seeing this for the quality of the performances and writing alone.

"pjcarline","9","1","3","8 November 2001"," Chinatown remains a modern classic
","Chinatown is a landmark film, made during the golden age of cinema. Featuring crisp direction, flawless acting, a taut script and a haunting soundtrack, it is a film that will leave a lasting impression on any viewer. A film noir in terms of style and content, enhanced by colour cinematography, Chinatown is a tense and complex thriller that remains a modern classic.<br/><br/>Private eye Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson), is approached by (whom the viewer believes to be) the wife of Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwirling), the chief engineer of the Los Angeles Water and Power Company. In a seemingly routine case, Gittes is asked to uncover a marital affair, but his investigations leave him entangled in a web of corruption, murder and deceit. The film beautifully intertwines two storylines - one centring upon Los Angeles' mysterious water drought, the other upon the unpleasant and ultimately tragic life of Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway). Gittes, a cocksure former policeman, launches himself into the case with vigour, but with each step, he finds himself increasingly out of his depth, unravelling a unpleasant world of extremities and moral decay. As his enquiries lead him to sinister millionaire Noah Cross (John Huston), the stage is set for an unforgettable night in Chinatown...<br/><br/>As Gittes, Nicholson shines throughout. Clearly relishing his ample role - he is seemingly omnipresent throughout the film - the maverick, Jameson swilling Gittes is colourfully brought to life. As in 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest', this is a part that Nicholson was born to play. As the tortured Evelyn Mulwray, Dunaway also gives a performance of empathy, emotion and sensuality. Similarly, Huston is at ease as the unpleasant and frankly psychopathic Noah Cross. The interaction between the three main characters is a joy to behold. The chemistry between Dunaway and Nicholson is beautifully harnessed by Polanski, and the continual reference to Gittes as 'gits' by Cross provides one of the films' wittiest moments.<br/><br/>Polanski directs with atmosphere and style. The heightened volume of incidental sounds - opening of doors, footsteps, taps of typewriter keys - adds suspense to an already atmospheric and tense thriller. Nicholson, Dunaway and Huston impeccably respond to numerous close-ups, providing intimate portrayals of their respective characters. As the plot unfolds, the viewer shares Gittes' assumptions, frustrations and feelings of helplessness, as the situation becomes more sinister and complex. Polanski does not rely too heavily on Nicholson's dynamism in the role, gaining much support from Huston, and the Oscar nominated Dunaway. Robert Towne's script is ably handled, with the viewer escorted through a maze of plots and sub-plots by a well practised guide. The bleak and bloody finale is an apt conclusion to a film that does not offer hope in a city full of decay and free of remorse."

","Roman Polanski directed this film set in 1940's Los Angeles before his wife, Sharon Tate was murdered by Charles Manson's Â‘Family' and before he fled the country to avoid charges of statutory rape of an under-aged starlet.  Jack Nicholson plays a detective who is dragged into the middle of a mystery too large and too strange to describe.  Along the way he encounters Faye Dunaway and John Huston and receives a nasty wound from director Roman Polanski. Lots has been said about the direction of Roman Polanski and the acting of Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway and John Huston in this classic (and I don't mean to diminish their accomplishments here at all) but major credit has to go to Jerry Goldsmith for the music, John A. Alonzo for cinematography, and Richard Sylbert for art direction.

"eibon09","Null","1","3","19 December 2000"," Masterpiece
","Chinatown(1974) is the Noir feature that all Neo Noirs made today look up as their inspiration.  Filled with excellent acting, great story, superb direction, terrific music, and wonderful writing.  Chinatown was made in a great year for films(1974) that included The Conversation and The Godfather Part 2.  I wasn't big with the movie when I first saw it but after a few viewings came to love it for its depiction of corruption and evil. Chinatown is not a pure Film Noir because its not a black and white movie and doesn't have any low key and high contrast lighting.<br/><br/>Chinatown(1974) was filmed during the daytime.  This contrasts other Noirs as they usually are filmed at night.  This changed the way Noir pictures would be perceived.  Many Neo Noirs after Chinatown(1974) would follow in the film's lead by having the action take place during the day.  This is a rare instance where the Noir picture is given a daytime atmosphere that works.<br/><br/>Chinatown(1974) was the first Noir to be shown in color.  This was because the movie had a much bigger budget compared to the average Film Noirs of the 1940s and 1950s.  Also, black and white photography was out of style during this period.  The director wanted to try something different by filming Chinatown in color instead of doing it in the usual black and white. Chinatown(1974) as well as L.A. Confidential(1997) are the few Noir features that are helped by color.<br/><br/>There were many disagreements during the making of Chinatown.  The director and writer had separate ideas on how the film should be portrayed.  Robert Towne did an excellent job in writing the screenplay. Robert Towne has not been involved in anything this good since.  The film's true brilliance goes to director, Roman Polanski who brings things to life with perfect execution.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson gives out the best acting job of his career in role of J.J. Gittes.  Jake Gittes is in the tradition of Sam Spade and Phililp Marlowe. He is involved in the same line of detective work as Mickey Spillane protagonist, Mike Hammer.  The actor plays his character with panache.  His performance is worthy of the legendary Humphrey Bogart.<br/><br/>The art direction is a marval to behold.  The depiction of 1930s Los Angeles is outstanding.  Los Angeles is portrayed as mysterious and guilty.  The actors do a terrific job at blending in with the art designs.  Its one of the most beautiful film designs that I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Chinatown(1974) has its share of memorable lines.  one great is by Noah Cross which goes as ""Whores, buildings, and politicans become respectible if they last long enough"".  Another great line is ""The future, Mr. Gitts, the future"" when asked by Gittes on why he is committing fraud.  The best line of the film is ""see, Mr. Gitts, most people never have to face the fact that, at the right time and the right place, they're capable of anything"". Finally, there is the classic line ""As little as possible"".<br/><br/>Chinatown(1974) is an unique motion picture because of its double plot. The two plots of the film are the water plot and incest plot.  The two plots although different from each other are in reality interrelated.  The water plot deals with money and power and the incest plot has to do with control for the future and power.  These two plots combined are related to the theme of evil, greed, and power.<br/><br/>John Huston is outstanding as the evil and villainious Noah Cross.  Faye Dunaway is fascinating and powerful as the doomed Mrs. Mulwray.  Roman Polanski makes a memorable appearence as the man with the knife.  The director's best films are Chinatown(1974), Repulsion(1965), and The Tenant(1976).  Chinatown(1974) is a great motion picture of immortal proportions."

","CHINATOWN (1974)	****<br/><br/>Some films are obligatory for a person serious about cinema. CHINATOWN is one of them. It is the best film Roman Polanski ever directed, and see that is not easy to be better than ROSEMARY'S BABY, REPULSION, THE TENANT and TESS. It is maybe the best mystery film ever made... Yes, tying PSYCHO and VERTIGO... Okay, so it is the best film-noir ever made- and see that is not easy to be better than THE MALTESE FALCON and DOUBLE INDEMNITY. The American Film Institute gave it a glorious place on their list of 100 best films of all time- #19, above the Oscar winner of that year (1975): THE GODFATHER- PART II. That's really fair, at least. CHINATOWN is superbly directed, amazingly acted and perfectly written- in resume, flawlessly made.<br/><br/>Presented by Roman Polanski himself as a homage to the film-noir, CHINATOWN is admirable in every scene. The story is so clever, so intelligent, so complex, so carefully built that you can't say you would take something or complain that a thing should have been done this way or that... And what's better: the film isn't dated by any means. Now, in 2000, 26 years after its release, it is as impacting and jaw-dropping as in 1974. So today's audiences can easily enjoy this classic puzzle, if I can say that way.<br/><br/>Telling much of the story is not only spoiling, but a crime. The basic is this: a LA private detective named Jake Gittes is visited by a woman named Evelyn Mulwray, who thinks that her husband is having an affair. Gittes thinks this is just another case, but then the husband dies in mysterious circumstances and there's something related to the city's water crisis... The story offers endless twists, but they are intelligent and always come in the right time, making you jump from your seat. Of course it calls for attention, but it is never confusing or difficult. Instead of this, it is tense, suspenseful and entertaining. <br/><br/>The Oscar winning screenplay is one of the best ever written, combining classic mystery with some smart twists and turns. I'm not exaggerating, because everything on it is flawless, from the dialogues (with an unusual kind of black humor) to the character development. And Roman Polanski proves that he was once a master. There isn't a needless scene, a disposable character or window dressing. With great film editing, score and cinematography, the climate for a film-noir is perfect.<br/><br/>Much of the merit goes to the acting. Jack Nicholson is amazing as always as Gittes- it seems that the character was made for him. Faye Dunaway gives another astonishing performance. She plays a multi-faced Evelyn Mulwray, sometimes cold, sometimes romantic. She's not the kind of character you can always trust in, but sometimes you do. One of my favorite scenes, not only in CHINATOWN, but in films in general, is the one when she explains a certain thing to Gittes: ""She's my sister, she's my daughter..."" Not to talk about John Huston, in a key, memorable role, and a cameo by director Polanski.<br/><br/>Perfectly crafted and always surprising, CHINATOWN is a classic and a masterpiece in every sense of the word. It is a film about ambiguity, or about the many meanings a thing can assume, and about the mystery that is human nature: a lover is not only a lover, a father is not only a father, a sister is not only a sister, a murder is not only a murder, a pair of glasses are not only a pair of glasses, a lake in the backyard is not only a lake... Everything will be solved (or won't it?) in the last scene, one of the most memorable moments of cinema. There's no score in the background, the camera gets out of control, just as the characters do. It's when one of the characters gets back to a place where his life was changed years before, and the story seems to be repeating. It's impacting. An unforgettable conclusion to an unforgettable film."
"jens.karlsson","10","1","3","12 October 2000"," Sensing Jack's thoughts
","This is a true gem among the many superb movies that were made in the seventies. Polanski manages to not only capture the spirit and feel, to say nothing of the look, of film noir movies, but also to make a film noir movie that is riveting and exciting in its own right, about thirty years after the Golden Age of that particular genre. Every scene here is a work of art, every nuance is thrilling, nothing is neglected. You get the eerie feeling of mystery, the milieu and ambience of the thirties, the odd characters and much more. Jack Nicholson's acting here is outstanding. Most of the time he doesn't have to say anything, really. By sheer acting he manages to convey every feeling. Every disappointment, every agony, every curiosity, every witticism. After having seen this movie, you are left with a tremendously exhilarating feeling that you have really seen something special. The movie remains a reliable and wonderful friend. Chinatown richly deserves the rating ""10"" that I have given it. See it if you haven't already!!! And even if you have, it's always a thrill to revisit its world of magic from time to time."

","I don't know why this film is so revered as honestly, I couldn't wait for it to get over- but it never would. Really, this is the longest film I've ever had the displeasure to sit through. Jack Nicholson plays a private detective without the usual Nicholson antics which would have at least made the proceedings more watchable, Faye Dunaway plays a heiress who hires Nicholson, and harbors a dirty secret and John Huston plays her father and head honcho who is the epitome of evil. The story isn't bad and I can see why the film is so revered, especially when you see the ending but man, does it take its time to get going."
"brefane","8","1","4","5 January 2008"," It's Jake, Chinatown.
","A beautifully crafted film noir that's earned the right to be called a classic. Masterfuly directed by Roman Polanski who makes cunning use of the widescreen, gets all the details unerringly right and creates a disturbing atmosphere of widespread corruption. John Alonzo's cinematography, Jerry Goldsmith's score, Sam O'Steen's editing, and the set and costume design are all flawless. Robert Towne's Oscar winning screenplay is a beauty though the ominous references to Chinatown become a bit obvious and heavy-handed, and the ending, apparently wanted by Polanski, makes the characters seem more the victims of contrivance than fate. Polanski gets effective performances from Dunaway, Huston, Diane Ladd, and Belinda Palmer. And Nicholson, who's in every scene, shows why he's a star even if I find him more effective in the wise guy aspects of the role than in the scenes where he's supposed to show vulnerability. Though I don't rank it as highly as Polanski's The Pianist, Knife in the Water, or Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown is highly recommended."

","This is a film in which not a single image, not a single word, not a single sound is wasted. As an example of the art of making movies, it's about as close to a perfectly crafted film as you'll ever see anywhere. Take the opening scene, for example: once you've seen the film through, viewing it again--especially if you pay careful attention to the apparently meaningless small talk between Gettes and his fisherman client--will demonstrate how carefully put together everything is. You realize soon that you've been prepared for everything all along; like Gettes, it's all been there in front of your eyes, and you just didn't see it. Last but not least, the score is simply haunting and instantly evocative."

","There isn't a great deal I can say in praise of this film that hasn't been said before. If you want a worthy review of this film, check out Roger Ebert or one of the other stalwart critics. They're spot on as usual about this one.<br/><br/>A few points of praise: all the performances (Nicholson, Dunaway, Huston), the plot (Robert Towne), the direction (Polanski at his best since Repulsion), the score (Jerry Goldsmith, no surprises there)... get the picture? One little gripe is Polanski's tinkering with the ending, which might still be wonderfully tragic, but shouldn't have taken place in Chinatown. The name was not supposed to be the actual place, but a suggestion of a dark place we've been and shouldn't go back to again for the sake of our EMOTIONAL well-being, not the physical... in this case Jake's past, in which he was a beat cop in Chinatown.<br/><br/>You might not know that a sequel, The Two Jakes, was made in 1990 with Nicholson (who directed it) and some of the key supporting cast. Most reviews pull it to pieces, except for a very well-considered one by Roger Ebert. Of course, it's not the classic Chinatown is, but it's a damned good movie. It's about the past, how it pervades our lives for the rest of our days, and how we assimilate it into our futures.<br/><br/>So there's what I think. Chinatown is one of those movies that should never be forgotten, but one of those that will probably, and sadly, not stand up to the ever-diminishing attention spans of today's audiences. Catch it while you can cope with it."

","Life is a mystery, and within that mystery are mysteries of their own. Chinatown is the mystery film of all mystery films, and J.J. Gittes nearly outdoes Sherlock Holmes himself. Yet the mysteriousness that is contained in every waking moment and in every human being is also explored in Chinatown.<br/><br/>Chinatown tells the story of Private Investigator J.J. Gittes, who does dirty work for husbands, wives, boyfriends, and girlfriends to find out for them if their significant other is involved romantically with somebody on the side. A woman comes into Mr. Gittes' office and asks him to investigate her husband, who is named Hollis Mulwray. Mr. Mulwray just happens to be a man with a very important position in the city of San Francisco.<br/><br/>Mr. Gittes' investigation takes twists and turns, and each one causes the viewer to yearn for more action and mystery. Yet the investigation means nothing without Gittes, who is played quite brilliantly by Jack Nicholson. It is Gittes who seems to be more of a mystery than that which he is trying to solve (even though that which he investigates is captivating indeed), and Polanski's exploration of the human mystery is breath-taking and thought-provoking. Speaking of Polanski, his direction is wonderful, creative, and eye-catching, but not flashy to the point of distraction.<br/><br/>The screenplay is very smart as well, and it takes ahold one's attention and attaches it to the story and characters at hand while including enigmatic elements. Further, what I have failed to mention is that the film takes place not in the 1970s, but in the 1920s or 1930s. Roman Polanski's score, the design of the credits, and the accurate set and costume design fit perfectly into that era.<br/><br/>The only problem with this film is some acting difficulty on the part of the supporting actors, but these problems are merely a mote of dust on the beautiful waters of Chinatown.

American culture became incomparably wealthy from it's successful campaign of human tyranny and international slave trade, graduating to worldwide dominace of commerce and religion (ratified by the Monroe doctrine).  Hubris took on a whole new meaning as fathers took their slaves who in many cases were actually their daughters(!) for mere sexual pleasure.  Polanski, like the German born Sierk was guided by a perceptive europeon eye to exploit America's  greatest weaknesses.  Indeed, this is the FUNCTION of film noir: savvy exploitation of (a) society unaware of it's own predicament.  This why it is a form of genius reserved only for the outsider."

","Chinatown is the only film-noir movie I've seen that uses sunlight ironically. If film-noir by definition deals with dark subject matter, what's all the brilliant sunlight for? Robert Towne's script is a perfect assemblage of complexity and coherence; the plot twists are never misleading and add to the story, not detract from it. Director Polanski was also lucky enough to catch Jack Nicholson in his prime; he is perfectly cast as slimy and yet vulnerable Jack Gittes. Faye Dunaway is also superb. She was in her prime too, with Bonnie and Clyde behind and Network yet to come. There is genius in not showing Chinatown (the place) until the end of the movie; it represents the idea that all dirty secrets reveal their tragic consequences only after a miserable and dogged search for truth. A must-see for true film buffs."

","Next to The Godfather, this is the movie I would take with me to a desert island (given a choice of one movie).  I own this film on VHS, but if it's showing on cable and I happen upon it, I end up watching it anyway.  I truly can't find any flaws with it, and although the story can be a bit confusing for first time viewers, it gets better with every repeated viewing.  If the Devil exists and I wind up in Hell when I die, I would definitely expect him to be in the guise of Noah Cross.  He is the most vile screen villain I can recall; even Tommy Udo from Kiss of Death would have difficulty matching up to him in the meanness category.  The final scene of the movie matches up with any other in movie history - ""C'mon Jake, it's Chinatown"".  Existential film noir at it's finest.  Don't bother with the sequel if you love this movie.  I saw a double feature of Chinatown and The Two Jakes at the New Beverly in Hollywood - big mistake!  LA Confidential is a more true sequel, although they chickened out and gave it a happy ending."
"andy-227","Null","1","4","17 December 1999"," One of the most excellent films in the history of motion pictures!
","""Chinatown"" is a film that you draw more from with each viewing.  And in turn, it becomes better with each viewing.  I recently had the pleasure of watching a 25th Anniversary screening of ""Chinatown"" on the big wide Panavision screen.  There, it was as if I were seeing it for the very first time!  I was fully absorbed within the confines of the film.  It was absolutely incredible.  Now, I am proud to call myself a happy owner of the 25th Anniversary DVD release of ""Chinatown"".  After watching the DVD, I finally feel like I fully understand all of the minute details and subplots leading up to the explosive climax of ""Chinatown"".  I can also see how ""Chinatown"" is talking about the world we live in today, in a sense that in a world that is corrupt and laden with deceit and mystery, a hopeful outcome will never be.  And more wisely spoken still, it is better that we forget about it all and stay out of it.  ""Forget about it Jake, it's Chinatown"". The meaning is a metaphor for every person's life in the world today.  It's unfortunate, but that's life!  ""Chinatown"" has been labeled as a classic example of the film noir genre.  I wouldn't call it such.  Film noir is something like ""The Third Man"" or ""The Killing"", in which absolutely nothing good comes out of a situation and for no good reason.  ""Chinatown"" had reason, and it was more of a puzzle than simplistic film noir, unraveling and unraveling until there was nothing left but the message in the climax of ""Chinatown"".  I loved it!  It was the first time that I really felt influenced, inspired, and deeply affected by a film.  It was really riveting.  The only exception to this being a really great film was the most typical Hollywood cliche that has placed films like James Cameron's ""TITANIC"" into the category of pure absurdity and stupidity.  I'm talking about how the characters know each other for a day or two, and already find each other having sex.  They do this sex thing in every movie, and why? Life doesn't happen that way, unless you are a complete sleazebag.  Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and I highly recommend this to someone who wants to see a film that toys with our interests and our intellect like a great riddle or a puzzle.  I also think it is a film that will change your life forever!"

However, the ending seems really abrupt, almost like the film was not entirely completed.  This film really draws you in, and you're dying to know exactly what happens next. It's also impossible to guess the solution early on in piece- always a sign of a good crime/mystery story.  The actors are all top notch, especially Nicholson, and Robert Townes story is absolutely superb.  A must for anyone who likes a good crime or murder mystery.  Highly recommended"

","I enjoyed watching this movie, though I won't rave about it like most people do. I think it was beautifully shot, casted, and scripted, but the story was a bit of a slow burner. That is fine with me generally, but I didn't think the plot was earth shattering or completely mind- bending.<br/><br/>I think I was looking for something different than what this film gave me, but I think given the time period it was created and the time period it was set that it was extremely well done. I like that the ending wasn't so happy, and that there was a darker side to it, but I think I am desensitized by those things these days. Had I seen this movie in 1974 I probably would've given it an 8, and I can look at it for what it's worth."

","I'm not sure if it was the story that didn't draw me in or the content, but I wasn't as thrilled with it as I thought I was going to be. It had really lovely photography and stunning color, but a lot of what went on didn't hold my attention.<br/><br/>The concern for water was a realistic and very appropriate topic that still applies today, so its messages regarding that was promising and well documented. However I found the story hard to follow, even in the two hours it took to explain it. A quick trip to wikipedia didn't help, and it didn't help me keep my interest because of this. Even so, it was interesting to notice how it was filmed, especially when it made the scenes more dynamic with its obvious widescreen bars above and below the screen.<br/><br/>It also didn't feel too much like the time period it took place in, too, especially when everything was in color. I felt this would have worked a lot better as a black and white film, and maybe with a little color put into certain scenes depending on the content."
"inspectors71","Null","1","5","18 March 2006"," Inspectors71's pick for the best American movie ever made
","I showed Roman Polanski's Chinatown to my wife about ten years ago and she hated it. It wasn't entertainment, and evil wins. With this in mind, Chinatown and all the people involved on and off screen should be forever congratulated for creating, quite possibly, the perfect adult story that isn't entertainment.<br/><br/>I have watched this movie two dozen or more times and I cannot find a flaw in its construction, plotting, artistry, or performance. On top of its perfection, the viewer must appreciate what Candace Bergen once pointed out on an AFI presentation of the top 100 films of all time, that the movie is utterly daring and fearless. The whole idea that a major American film studio would tell the (fictionalized?) story of how LA got big is amazing in itself.<br/><br/>Yet, it isn't entertainment, and evil wins.<br/><br/>Polanski's creation, his dark image of Depression-era Los Angeles, governed by the thoroughly-corrupted and populated by near-virtuous, real people is so beautiful in its execution, its performances (where do I start with my kudos?--Nicholson, Dunaway, Huston?), and its daring that my praise may turn off prospective viewers--it's some old movie about a private eye, water rights, and incest.<br/><br/>Yuck. Who wants to watch that? <br/><br/>But if you crave more than entertainment, can stand it when the good guys can only hobble off the field of battle with nothing to show for their bravery but their dignity, and want your time in front of the DVD player to mean something, then accept that Chinatown will deliver to you a meaningful two hours, an appreciation of how good a movie can be.<br/><br/>A masterpiece."

","The opening credits; scrolling down the screen so uniformed, and to such classic 'slooth' music that one could believe the film was actually made in the time that the music was popularized by the murder mystery genre, the nineteen thirties. Trumpets playing slowly as the main character, Jake 'J.J.' Gittes (Jack Nicholson), is revealed to us. As an ex-police officer, Jake now deals purely in private investigation, a real 'slooth' for hire, and he is incredibly good at what he does. The movie is based around the murder of a Los Angeles Water and Power Works Chief Engineer, and how water is the root of life and social power to the City of Los Angeles. Although the movie is technically a murder mystery, there is a real underlining theme of how people with power will do anything to keep that power, and when the line should be drawn between morals and greed.<br/><br/>Faye Dunaway plays Evelyn Mulwray, the wife of the murdered engineer. As the film progresses we are thrown back and forth between trusting that the mogul's wife is innocent or believing that she is behind the whole murder. We are not alone in the query of believing the blonde bombshell, Gittes as well is deceived by her, but only until he gets the bottom of the case. Jack Nicholson plays the role of the tough cop very well. He's stern, witty, and sharp, the characteristics that truly define a P.I. in this genre. Although he is mislead at times, there wasn't a second that I thought he wouldn't figure the whole thing out.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski, the director of this film, brilliantly molded the murder mystery with ideals about the corrupt nature of capitalism. The co-founder of the L.A. Water and Power Works Department, and murderer in the film, is portrayed in a way that we come understand the situation he is in and the lengths at which he will go to make sure he comes out on top. At times I did relate to him in a sense that he didn't want to lose what he had worked so hard to build, but his actions to keep his empire afloat become so extreme that I was disgusted with the entire thought of the capitalistic goal: to make the almighty dollar.<br/><br/>We come to find out that the murderous tycoon and his whole family is just as out of whack as his ethics. Evelyn Mulwray, his daughter, had a sick, morbid relationship with her corrupt father, which resulted in the conception of a daughter. The plot from there on in shifts from trying to put your finger on a murderer, to the trials of trying to escape a twisted life. All in all, the movie comes together quite well, and as much as you are kept on the edge of your seat with the suspense of the mystery, you are left with the powerful feeling that maybe capitalism isn't the way to go."

","From BAFTA and Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated director Roman Polanski this is a classic thriller. Basically JJ 'Jake' Gittes (BAFTA and Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Jack Nicholson, in what many consider his ""best-ever role"", I personally love him in Cuckoo's Nest) is the private detective, who makes an honest living sticking his nose into others lives, specialising in matrimonial cases. He is hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Bonnie and Clyde's Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Faye Dunaway) when she suspects her husband Hollis (Darrell Zwerling), who built the city water supply system, of having an affair. He professionally photographs him with a young girl, but he does not realise in this scandal is that Mrs. Mulwray is an impersonator. When Hollis is found dead (drowned with salt water in his lungs), Jake is now in the middle of a case of deceit, murder, incest and municipal corruption, all relating back to the city's water supply. The memorable moments for me are Jake having his nose cut, finding out that Evelyn has a sister/daughter, because her villain father, Noah Cross (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated John Huston) raped her, and the conclusion where Evelyn is driving away and shot in the eye. Also starring Perry Lopez as Lieutenant Lou Escobar, John Hillerman as Russ Yelburton Diane Ladd as Ida Sessions, Roy Jenson as Claude Mulvihill, Polanski as Man with Knife, Richard Bakalyan as Detective Loach, Joe Mantell as Lawrence Walsh, Diamonds Are Forever's Bruce Glover as Duffy, James Hong as Kahn and Burt Young as Curly. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Jerry Goldsmith, Best Sound and Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay - Motion Picture, and it was nominated for Best Original Score. Jack Nicholson was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 71 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, he was number 63 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 7 on The World's Greatest Actor, Noah Cross was number 16 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 9 on 100 Years of Film Scores, it was number 74 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown.""), it was number 16 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 4 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die, it was number 19 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 48 on The 100 Greatest Films.

"Herag","7","1","8","4 May 2011"," Overrated Screenplay
","Robert Townsend is an overpaid, overrated, writer. Jack Nicholson was good and so was John Houston. Fay Dunaway was OK (she was terrific when she got slapped). The story is twisted so much so the viewer could write his own story as it happens in the movie. The ending was altered by Polanski who is another overrated director (see Barry Levinson's direction of ""Bugsy"") The ending was the anticlimax and the worst ending of any movie. In the '70s, directors like Coppola and Scorsese had not made their mark and Polanksi was the one of the new kid on the block who had connections (like Evans and Nicholson),and was known as a radical director for movie like ""Rosemarys Baby"". He was embraced instantly by his cronies. These days directors like Polanski are dime a dozen and he won't make a dent in Hollywood. Its obvious that he likes stories that were weird, or socio-pathic and most of his films had shock value. With advent of TV sitcoms this value is lost to the audience. The movie is worth watching once, not ten times! like Robert Evens claims he watched it (see special features on DVD). Few scenes and few lines of dialog stand out but overall it is another good film not a great film like we are led to believe."

","Chinatown excellently employs color contrasts, masterful use of shadows, and intriguing reflection shots. The cinematography and the meticulously written detective story highlight this movie as unmistakably noir. It is missing a few noir elements such as unusual camera angles and intricately colorful dialogue, but it's still a smooth and refreshing addition.<br/><br/>One complaint is the relatively impassive characters. Nearly every character has something to hide, so they act as reserved as possible. It's understandable, but it does make the movie a little tedious when the audience is expected to care about the facts without caring for any of the people involved. Noir films usually have the main character toeing the line between likable and unlikable, while staying emotionally detached as possible, solely focused on unraveling the mystery. Nicholson (Jake Gittes) gives a smooth and flawless performance in this role. He deserves praise for this film, but the rest of the reserved cast leaves a bit to be desired.<br/><br/>*Potential spoilers below*<br/><br/>Another complaint lies in the conclusion, which doesn't feel adequately resolved. The only ones who can explain the situation are dismissed. The ending sequences makes it seem as if the detectives on the case have no interest in the truth and have a vested interest in letting crimes go unpunished. It's likely that the truth will come out in court, but the presentation of the conclusion leaves a sour taste for no apparent reason."

The Los Angeles story is a great one to build around, but the ""you don't know who you're messing around with"" angle has been further exonerated from ingratiating gangster or back story horror plots decades ago and was left with a lack of follow through here.

","This movie is a great noir. From muted colors to shaded performances to an uncompromised ending, the movie's a worthy successor to the 40's classics. And that's despite the 130-minute length, twice the average. Plus, director Polanski doesn't have to meet Code requirements that compromised many 40's films. We get an ending that benefits the general storyline, no matter how much of a downer it is for the audience. The movie's a first-rate noir that makes a lasting impression. The story line was brilliant, it kept you on the edge of your seat the whole entire time. The cinematography was so well done, the use of lighting and camera angles had this awesome effect that drew you in and set the tone for every scene. The acting was marvelous too, Dunaway and Nicholson were brilliant together and had an edgy feel that kept a mysterious and hidden evil to both of them that kept the viewer questioning at all times. They also had awesome chemistry that made them so convincing together! Over all I loved this film and would recommend it."

","Roman Polanski's take on Film Noir harks back to Huston's own version of THE MALTESE FALCON: flawless filmmaking, with outstanding performances from outstanding players working from an outstanding script. It rarely gets better than this. With California currently in the throes of ""the worst drought in Recorded History,"" CHINATOWN is all too relevant for Today's audiences. And the cattle barons are apparently to blame (see COWSPIRACY.com); while Ordinary Citizens are being forced to cut back on water usage, the Corporate Farms are being allowed to conduct Business As Usual- and, just today, it was announced that another city (Baltimore) was going to follow in the footsteps of the Powers That Be in Detroit, and shut off the water supply to people unable to pay their water bill(s).

","I have really been on my film noir game as of late. Although Chinatown isn't technically film noir, it's most definitely neo noir. It possesses the same sort of qualities as a great 40's film noir just with color and updated issues. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway star as a private investigator and a recent widow respectively. Of course, the two cross paths and form an unlikely bond over a recent tragedy. But as always with noir films, there's so much more to the plot that unravels.<br/><br/>I will say for the most of the film I felt like I needed more of a back-story with Nicholson's character Jake Gittes, but after watching the film as a whole, I definitely think it worked. The point is you don't need to know exactly what went down in Chinatown years before. You just need to know there's a history there. Nicholson brings an incredible amount of experience but also relatability to Jake. He's the kind of guy that you don't necessarily agree with the things he does but you end up rooting for him anyway. Dunaway on the other hand plays Evelyn much more guarded. There was a point in the film where she said ""lets just drop the whole thing"" where I knew there was much more to her character. Isn't there always with female characters in noir's? <br/><br/>The film deals with plenty of controversial subjects that are still prevalent now. Adultery, rape, and even a little bit of abuse. I never thought the film exploited these issues or glorified it, but it was definitely noticeable. But for the most part, it worked to the film's climatic advantage. I did have a problem with Jerry Goldsmith's score though. Goldsmith, who is one of the greatest composers of all time, seemed to struggle with consistency. It went in and out with loud and intense moments but then wasn't noticeable for several scenes at a time. I just found it to be distracting. But of course the most famous part of Chinatown is the ending. Which turned out to be one of the more shocking endings I have seen in a long time. An ending that definitely saved the film for me.<br/><br/>+Nicholson & Dunaway's performance <br/><br/>+Mysterious characters <br/><br/>+Ending<br/><br/>+Script <br/><br/>-Score <br/><br/>8.8/10"

Then and now I have to take a little break or a day off from doing this because well I can be a bit tried of doing this, but I still have fun reviewing and I'm extremely proud to be talking about the great classics and the new films, TV shows and games that come out. Speaking of cult classics, Chinatown was on top of my list to watch next, because I heard nothing but amazing things about this movie and after watching it I can agree that this movie was outstanding.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson is now known as the single best actor of all time just like Daniel Day-Lewis, Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, and in this movie his talent dose shine in this movie. He played his so well that I actually didn't fully hate him because in the movie his character is kind of a A-hole but I didn't hate him, if a different director took the director chair and directed the movie differently then maybe I would have dislike him. Jack Nicholson did probably his 4th best performance that I've seen from him.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with lines that I won't lie but the lines have stuck with me after the movie was over and I got to give the writers credit for that. The music in this movie has that smooth jazzy beat to it and that totally fitted the movie so well.

","It is not that Chinatown is really excelling at something, but more that it doesn't have any big flaws.<br/><br/>Chinatown is a ""film noir"" from the 70s about an early 20th century private investigator working a case. Played by Jack Nicholson, this fellow has a passion for finding out the truth regardless of the circumstances and he gets a bit too involved in a case.<br/><br/>The film has a really good flow, almost too perfect, with a slowly growing tension until the end. Nothing feels awkward or out of place.<br/><br/>The two main actors, Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway, are high caliber actors who do exactly what the film requires them to, but also none of the other actors mess up their roles. Even a kid who shows up in the movie for about 20 seconds is good at what he does.<br/><br/>The music has a jazzy feel to it, but is filled with instrument effects that are integrated very effectively with the events in the film.<br/><br/>There is nothing wrong with the camera work either. Good shot composition. Nothing brilliant or innovative though.<br/><br/>But, if I had to nitpick, there are some issues with the story and its characters. <br/><br/>The bad guy is not well outlined. His motivations and logic remain a bit obscure by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The plot overall is not always unclear. The general lines are clear enough but some details may escape you. This is a problem with detective stories in general, when the story goes down one path then down another and introduces minor characters that disappear only to reappear half a movie later and you are left with questions like ""Wait, so who killed that other girl and did she know that other guy?"".<br/><br/>Also, for such a steady rise in the storyline, it ends very abruptly with a few of the issues still unresolved, though the abrupt end does fit the story of Jack Nicholson's character.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very clean and well put together film, but at the end of it I did not cheer or cry or change my mind about something. Chinatown excels only at being a very solid film."

","This detective's movie is an engaging watch. Jack Nicolson's performance was superb and his commanding presence on screen is a testament to such a fine actor. The costume designer must also get a mention. That jacket was swanky. As for the film it was such a grim, fascinating and intricate story. Who to trust? The more important question was who would stand in the way of finding out the truth? The answer to that would prove to be the cop leading the investigation and the one who would keep it that way.<br/><br/>For such an interesting and disturbing film it is therefore disappointing that it ends so unfished. It would seem that the director or writer discarded his work as it was climaxing. With the secret exposed the story just petered out. It ends in Chinatown with a thoroughly dissatisfying closing. Although it does give food to though that the movie is more horror than detective. The conclusion of this film is that detectives only find out murderers and criminals and they do not catch them bring about a remedy. The major character did not cover himself in glory as he himself had taken part in a catalogue of felonies. His actions would prove to be detrimental to the person he was trying to help."

","This is such a classic, and all around great film. But, I honestly think the plot was a tiny bit dry. Yes, it's a mystery with lots of twists and turns and surprises. But after a while it begins to feel a bit like a scandal within a scandal within another scandal (scandal-ception?) There was no real tension, and it seemed like they were just adding plot details to draw it out. There was also a little bit too much dialogue for my tastes. That being said, I also appreciated that it wasn't paced like a typical ""murder mystery,"" and the way in which it unfolded was slightly more lifelike. What was redeeming for me was the ending (which a lot of people hate apparently). The characters have been on this wild goose chase, only to have it not play out in their favor. Which I think has to be a VERY conscious decision to do, because it's not what's expected and therefore under scrutiny. I think it fits here though, especially since the previous parts of the film didn't give you the feeling something bad was going to happen—it seemed like Jake would prevail. A lot of the time, films with an ""unhappy"" ending have a pessimistic tone throughout so it's almost as if you expect it. <br/><br/>I really love the camera and lighting work. Specifically that slightly yellowed tone (but never too yellow) with orange-y reds that appears in a bunch of films from this era. It looks as though they need to add a bit of cyan, but I'm pretty sure it was intentional. It's also rather difficult to duplicate—I've tried. <br/><br/>It references film noir a little, but clearly has a twist to it that's more current to 1974. I believe it's called neo noir. And one more thing: the soundtrack was amazing, but it was used rather poorly, and in a way that called attention to itself. This could be intentional, but it felt unintentional."

Although it's slow moving for the most part, it's also ultra stylish and the director keeps your attention throughout. There are also nice performances from the whole cast, not least Faye Dunaway's alluring femme fatale and John Huston as the elderly patriarch.<br/><br/>Despite its laidback appeal, CHINATOWN contains some shocking material, most of which seems quite tame these days but which must have packed a punch when it first came out; I'm thinking the final twist in particular. Nevertheless, bolstered by strong performances and good direction, this is a minor classic of its genre."

","Jack Nicholson plays private investigator J.J. Gittes. The time is 1937 and the place is Los Angeles. Gettis specializes in infidelity cases. Most of his clients seem to be ordinary folk, but one day a woman shows up who purports to be Mrs. Hollis Mulwray, the wife of the chief engineer of the Los Angeles Water and Power department, and things get complicated and interesting from there.<br/><br/>The story has the trappings of a film noir, but it separates itself from that genre in several ways. For one thing it is in color. The use of a muted color palette creates a sense of the times. The depiction of 1930s Los Angeles is done well enough to have convinced me of its authenticity--the cars, houses, and dress seem to be right. I particularly liked the appearance of a pristine Social Security card in a wallet, 1937 being the first year of the issuance of such cards. Jerry Goldsmith's score is notable, accentuating the tense scenes without being intrusive. The main theme sets a plaintive note that had me longing for the past. The movie is so fixed in the era it depicts that it should be timeless in its appeal.<br/><br/>Another thing that sets this movie apart from the classic film noir is having Gittes being well dressed and polite, not displaying the hard core cynicism typical of such characters. He also shows vulnerabilities that hard-boiled PIs usually do not have. And his business is doing well enough to have two employees he refers to as his ""operatives.""<br/><br/>Nicholson is pretty much in every scene and we see the whole movie from his viewpoint. It's hard to imagine a more perfect actor for this part; Nicholson's performance is a pure delight to watch. Pretty much the same can be said for Faye Dunaway as Mrs. Mulwray. The whole cast is top notch. The story unfolds seamlessly just feeding us enough information to keep our interest, but close attention must be paid. We are left discovering the facts along with Gittes.<br/><br/>I saw this in its original release, but the Blu-Ray DVD has left a more lasting impression on me than my original viewing. Full use is made of filming in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, creating a sense of ease and openness. The DVD has lots of extras filmed in 2009: a full feature commentary by screenwriter Robert Towne, interviews with Nicholson and Polanski, a history of the Los Angeles water supply (that I found surprisingly interesting), and an appreciation short that had various people commenting on their reactions to the movie. Polanski commented that he ranks ""Chinatown"" as his second best work, being edged out by ""The Pianist.""<br/><br/>I can't find anything negative to say about this movie."

","First off, this review uses parallelism between Chinatown and Blade Runner and includes spoilers for both films. As such, please stop reading if you do not want knowledge of important plot elements of either of these films. <br/><br/>Chinatown is a film that sneaks up on you and punches you in the face at the end. But it does it in such a way that -- for a moment -- you're not even sure what happened. Nicholson, Dunaway, and Huston play their parts brilliantly. It's truly painful to watch Evelyn fall from such a stoic person to a nervous wreck. All the while, she keeps you guessing. In fact most of the characters of this film keep you guessing in an Agatha Christie sort of way. Who's good, who's bad, who's crazy? It keeps shifting on subtle levels. <br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent. Nice smooth camera shots and composition. Restrained use of camera motion. Nice editing and a suitable score. The pacing is also really good. Fast enough to keep a person's interest, but slow enough to show the lush locations and buildings. The only case in which I'd subtract marks is for the Chinatown location itself. Once Chinatown is shown, it's presented fairly flat and lacking in visual detail. <br/><br/>After watching this film, I couldn't help but think of Blade Runner. Now I see the connections between the two films. Blade Runner owes quite a bit to Chinatown. In particular, Rick Deckard's interaction with Rachel. I can also see why Jeter's truly awful and inconsistent novelized sequel to Blade Runner (The Edge of Human) made sexual abuse references in regards to Rachel. However, dealing with the sudden shock of discovering that you're not human serves the purpose effectively enough. Adding on a borrowed element from another film on top of that is totally unnecessary. <br/><br/>The tone of Chinatown and the visual style of the era that it is set in forms the basis of Blade Runner's world. 1940s future-noir is the look, and the tone is equally serious. This 'tone' is something that a great deal of modern films seem to lack. Both films hold true to their tone and mood consistently while presenting a story that could be applied to various eras. <br/><br/>Before beginning to think that one film is copying another, consider that most art forms derive elements from earlier works. There's no question that Chinatown owes quite a bit to 1946's The Big Sleep. And I'm sure it continues on back beyond that point in film and novels. The key is how it's done:<br/><br/>In particular, if a writer or director has a new idea and is inspired by an existing film, then it's best if the new project be a unique world with new characters. In other words, not a sequel. In this case, Chinatown to Blade Runner. In cases such as this, scenes and characters can be similar. Even lines of dialogue can take on somewhat similar structure. <br/><br/>However, if a sequel is to be shot then the rules change. The viewer is much more wary of sequels and prequels. Unfortunately, there has been a rash of sequels lately that recycle lines wholesale. To re-use general plot points is one thing (and to be done subtly -- if at all), but recycling lines is often the kiss of death for a sequel. <br/><br/>Examples:<br/><br/>Strong Sequels:<br/><br/>Aliens: This film uses a plot structure that is very similar to that of Alien. However, it works because the two films are of different genres and the characters are unique enough between films. <br/><br/>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan: In this case, there was an imperative to take the film in a different direction from the first. Hence this film is very different from Star Trek: The Motion Picture. It represents a completely different story, totally different motivations, mood, and plot. The two films share little in common, except for the general universe in which they exist and the main cast of core characters. Ideally, this is how a sequel should be done. Note that it does remain consistent to the previously-established Star Trek universe. <br/><br/>Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back: Again, the film is unique from its predecessor. Furthermore, it falls into a slightly different sub-genre of film. The tone of Empire is much different than that of A New Hope and remains consistent throughout. Consistency is absolutely key to making any film a success. Hopefully modern directors can re-discover this concept. The screenplays are totally unique between the two films and there are no recycled lines of dialogue. <br/><br/>I won't name sequels that are considered to be poorly done. I'm sure readers of IMDb reviews are well aware of many examples of sub-standard sequel and prequel films. Take a look at them closely and look for recycled lines, 'homage' scenes that are nearly carbon copies, blatantly re-used plot lines, weak and highly derivative stories, inconsistent treatment of firmly-established characters, and a lack of substance. <br/><br/>All of this returns us to Chinatown. Here is a film that is packed with emotional substance. It's subtle yet strong. Chinatown owes its visual style and tone to the film noir era while presenting totally new material. The characters are multi-layered and difficult to strictly classify. It never tries too hard and there seem to be no absolutes in the film. And lastly -- and most importantly -- it ends exactly where it should. Perhaps the ending should be the starting point of any writer's work. It's what makes or breaks films with even the greatest level of potential."

","In Chinatown, inspector J.J. Gittes is sucked into a world of scandal and mystery, where nothing is as it seems and everything is connected. Set in 1940's L.A., Chinatown takes mystery noir and turns into into a beautiful masterpiece. Surprisingly it is compared by many to the 1997 feature L.A. Confidential, who also say that they are alike. I find this difficult to believe, because Chinatown is more of a mystery noir while L.A. Confidential is more of a thriller. The performances in Chinatown are first- rate, with immensely deep performances by Jack Nicholson and Fay Dunaway. Both were nominated for their roles, and they both deserved to win. An honorable mention is John Huston as Noah Cross, a mysterious man who has more involvement then seen. It's not easy to like Jack Nicholson's character; he is snoopy and sly, and will do whatever it takes to get information. However, the viewer can easily understand him for he is sucked into this world without warning. The script by Robert Towne won Best Original Screenplay, which it deserved very much because of the absolute brilliance and originality. There is not one excessive line in this film, or really an excessive scene. Roman Polanski too this excellent script and turned it into pure brilliance, also high notes for pushing the cast members. The photography is interesting, but there isn't much of 50's shown in this picture, it's much more involved in the storyline then the setting. The only real flaw of this film is that it gets a bit slow and boring, but it doesn't hurt it much from being the masterpiece it is."

","Chinatown (1974) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Roman Polanski's stylish noir follows private detective J.J. Gittes (Jack Nicholson) as he tries to solve a man's murder but he keeps getting different stories from his wife (Faye Dunaway) and her father (John Huston). Many film noir fans object to anyone calling CHINATOWN noir because their arguments include the fact that this here isn't B&W and that it was made in the 70s. Many people feel a true noir can only be B&W and come from the 40s or 50s but no matter what label you want to put on it there's no question that this is one of the greatest films of the decade. Robert Towne rightfully earned his Best Screenplay Oscar because there are very few films, past or present, that would be willing to tell the type of story told here. One of the major plot points deals with water and who would have ever thought that water would make for one of the great crime dramas? One of the key elements is the way Polanski brings this dirty world to life. There are many scumbags scattered throughout the film and while I wouldn't call the film confusing the director does manage to make you you can follow it from start to finish and he also makes sure that everything is laid out pretty well. One of the strongest points is the beautiful atmosphere created by the director and the cinematography and music score also help bring this out. There's also no question that we get some superb performances with Nicholson leading the charge. It's really amazing to sit back and see some of the excellent performances this guy gave during this period but his work here is right up there with what Bogart and Mitchum could do in the genre. Nicholson is so laid back and cool about everything that you can't help but love going on this journey with him. Dunaway has a very difficult part but she handles it just fine and plays on the same level as Nicholson. Huston gives the greatest performance of his career and even though he's only in a handful of scenes there's no doubt that once you see him here you'll never forget him. CHINATOWN is without question one of the great films of its type and it's just an example of everything going right for a movie. The screenplay, direction and performances are all top-notch and it makes for a terrific entertainment."

","Jake Gittes is a former cop turned private detective. When he is contracted by a Mrs Mulwray to find out if her husband is having an affair, he takes to trailing Water Company Executive Hollis Mulwray. Mulwray appears to only have water and a dry riverbed on his mind but eventually they catch him with a young woman, although almost immediately the news gets leaked to the papers and Mulwray goes missing, only to turn up dead. At this point the real Mrs Mulwray comes to Gittes threatening to sue him for his involvement and Jake realises that he had been set up to set up the Mulwrays. He continues his investigation into the murder only to find a conspiracy involving thousands of gallons of water being wasted during a drought and the mysterious presence of Mrs Mulwray's father, Noah Cross.<br/><br/>As a fan of film noir and tough detective movies, I am too often put off by modern entries into the genre that try to replace atmosphere and intelligence by just having nudity and swearing; the genre managed atmosphere without these in the forties and fifties but yet modern films seem to rely on them. With Chinatown however, everything works well as a homage to the best years of the genre and, as such, is very well set in the period and is of suitable presentation even if the material and tone is darker and harder than would have been allowed years ago. This is not to say it is just a copy and paste from better films because it isn't and indeed stands out as one of the best detective noirs I have seen in ages. The plot is always going to be the most important thing and it gets it spot on throughout, doing the proper thing of starting with a simple story and continually building it more and more complex as it goes. Unlike some other ""classics"" of the genre, Chinatown manages to do this without ever losing the audience and I found the plot to be both rewardingly complex but yet still very easy to follow.<br/><br/>Needless to say, things are very dark and the script is convincingly dark and miserable, leading to an ending that is as depressing as I've seen – not so much in what actually happens but also in the wider implications for the characters that the credits prevent us from seeing. Director Polanski does a great job of putting this story in a lush setting that produces a real strong sense of period but also manages to always be showing us the darkness coming through subtly throughout the movie. Of course it helps that he also has a great cast to work with. Jack Nicholson is iconic in this role and, if I had to pick one film to act as an introduction to Nicholson then it would be this one. He is tough yet damaged, upright but seedy and he brings out his complex character well. Dunaway has less screen time but is just as impressive with a similarly dark role. Huston adds class and manages to ooze menace while also coming across as a harmless old man. The support cast are all fine but really the film belongs to these three, with Nicholson being the stand out role."

","Something borough me back time and again to Chinatown...I didn't know what it was, for a start I couldn't understand the plot, and the beige was almost sickening...but I couldn't resist. Maybe I just wanted to decipher it, maybe it was Gittes' smart mouth, maybe it was that massive bandage keeping his nose together. After about 20, god knows, how many watches I finally got it...this is possibly the best pastiche ever made! <br/><br/>But wait! before you kill me for calling this a simple pastiche, hear me out, because this isn't just a simple pastiche. Whilst much of the new American film makers at the time were making excitingly different, youthful films (for a laugh lets say 'two-lane black top') Chinatown seems to be a look back at the times of old film making - the P.I., Howard Hawks, Bogy and so forth. But this, as much as any film made in this brilliant period, breaks with the old. <br/><br/>Its entire structure, its whole fabric is laced with a kind of uncanny wrongness. Its construction is built to fall apart, to tear and reveal that beige colour, that badly timed joke, that plot which unravels before our's and our 'heros' eyes. Chinatown is beautiful because, well, it isn't. Its charming yet devastating, funny yet worrying. There is something just not quite right about this film's homage...<br/><br/>And so to conclude with some kind of coherence: Chinatown is a film I had to work at (and perhaps this is why i like it so much). The plot is labyrinthine, its characters are often generic, and Gittes is a far from a admirable - even likable - hero, but these are what makes this film. Listing its flaws is tantamount to listing its qualities. And this is a quality film in many ways. The plot subtle and enjoyable (if you cant work it out - see, 'The Big Sleep'), the performances are very good, the script is quick and witty (in many ways). <br/><br/>So not a simple pastiche. This is a very clever and (dare i say) profound homage to the detective film. Very strongly recommended to anyone interested in American cinema and to everyone else too."

","""Chinatown"" is one of the earliest examples of what came to be known as ""neo-noir"", the modern equivalent of the film noir genre of the forties and fifties. Other examples include Michael Winner's remake of ""The Big Sleep"", ""Body Heat"", ""Gorky Park"", ""No Mercy"", ""Tequila Sunrise"", ""LA Confidential"" and the more recent ""Insomnia"". Apart from ""LA Confidential"", made in the nineties about the fifties, all of those films had a contemporary setting, but ""Chinatown"" is a period piece. It is set in 1937 in Los Angeles, the city which was the setting for many of the most famous noirs, such as the original ""Big Sleep"".<br/><br/>As with a number of classic noirs, including ""The Big Sleep"" and ""The Maltese Falcon"", the hero, Jake Gittes, is a private investigator. A woman claiming to be Evelyn Mulwray, the wife of the chief engineer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, hires him to keep her husband, whom she suspects of adultery, under surveillance. Gittes, however, soon realises that he has been duped and that the woman was an impostor. Attempting to discover the reasons behind this deception, Gittes finds himself embroiled in a web of corruption. A shadowy group are scheming to use taxpayers money to divert water from the city to irrigate agricultural land in the San Fernando Valley. This group have been buying up land in the valley under false names, knowing that its value will increase dramatically once it enjoys the benefits of irrigation. This plot line was inspired by the disputes over land and water rights that became known as the ""California Water Wars"", and the character of Hollis Mulwray, Evelyn's husband, was partly based on William Mulholland, a key figure in those ""wars"", although in reality the ""wars"" took place during the 1910s and 20s rather than the 30s and Mulholland died in 1935.<br/><br/>Despite the title, the film has little to do with the Chinese-American quarter of Los Angeles beyond the fact that Gittes was once a police officer in Chinatown; his former colleague Lou Escobar, who is still a detective, plays an important role.<br/><br/>Director Roman Polanski and scriptwriter Robert Towne seem to have intended the film as a deliberate homage to film noir, but ""homage to"" does not necessarily mean the same as ""pastiche of"". It was made in colour rather than black-and white, which had fallen out of favour by 1974. Polanski, however, was at pains to ensure that his film was as visually distinctive as the traditional noir look, although very different from it.<br/><br/>The old films noirs, such as ""The Big Sleep"", were often dark and moody in tone, with many scenes taking place at night. ""Chinatown"", however, is the precise opposite. It is set during a hot, dry summer and shot in a harsh, glaring Southern California daylight, as pitiless as the villains of the story. The literal translation of ""film noir"" is, of course, ""black film"", but ""dark film"" often seems a more appropriate rendition, and in metaphorical if not literal terms there is as much darkness here as in any of the classic noirs; the plot takes in not merely financial corruption but also murder and incest. Some have seen the moral darkness which lies at the heart of this film as being rooted in the 1969 murder of the director's wife Sharon Tate by the Charles Manson gang. It must, however, be said that a similar darkness exists in some of Polanski's films from before 1969, such as ""Repulsion"" or ""Rosemary's Baby"".<br/><br/>Although Jack Nicholson was already a well-known actor following his appearances in films like ""Easy Rider"" and ""Five Easy Pieces"", ""Chinatown"" is sometimes regarded as the one which secured his reputation as a major star. His Gittes, the outwardly cynical, detached outsider who is inwardly driven by a strong desire to see justice done, is a classic noir hero of the type who once would have been played by Humphrey Bogart.<br/><br/>Faye Dunaway is also excellent as Evelyn, but the best performance comes from John Huston, better known as a director than as an actor. Huston plays Noah Cross, Evelyn's father and Hollis Mulwray's former partner who is one of the main villains. Cross says that says most people never have to acknowledge that, given the right circumstances, they are ""capable of anything"", and he himself is certainly capable of anything, even of the rape of his own daughter. Yet Huston makes him seem all the more sinister for being, outwardly, a charming and civilised man. Remarkably, although the film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, Huston was not among them for ""Best Supporting Actor"". (That was the year when three of the five nominations in that category went to the same film, ""The Godfather Part II"").<br/><br/>When they were first made, most of what we today regard as classic noirs were seen as little more than routine potboilers. (Huston's own ""The Maltese Falcon"" was something of an exception). By the mid-seventies, however, they were becoming more widely appreciated as finely crafted films, even as cinematic masterpieces, capable of making statements about society and about human nature. Polanski's homage falls within that tradition. It is well-directed, well-acted and with an intelligent and literate script. (Of those eleven nominations only one, that for Towne's ""Best Original Screenplay"", resulted in an actual award). With the possible exception of ""L.A. Confidential"", this is the best of the neo-noirs. 8/10"

","I realise I am very much in minority here but, I don't rate this movie anything like as much as most people clearly do. It is enjoyable, fairly clever and just about holds the interest but there is a big problem. Probably the very best thing in this is Jack Nicholson, trouble is he virtually is the film. Much as I enjoy watching the man when he is on top form like this, he does distract from the working of the film. Also, good though his performance is, he does not convince of his attraction to Dunaway. Talking of the leading lady, I may as well try an deal with another irritation, this whole mystery surrounding her and its clarification at the end. I think the whole mother/sister incest business is another distraction and just a little too close to home with regard to the director and his known sexual preferences. Basically I think Polanski wanted to make a noir, he loved the idea of using the iconic Nicholson and he got off on the Dunaway secret both aspects subsequently, for me alone it seems, conspiring to defeat him."
"sme_no_densetsu","9","0","1","7 March 2009"," ""Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.""
","The title, ""Chinatown"", derives from an anecdote told in the film by private detective Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson). Years earlier when he was working in law enforcement in Chinatown he was told to do 'as little as possible' because you couldn't be sure if you were preventing a crime or helping to commit one. It is this central concept that the film is built on, though very little of the action actually occurs in Chinatown.<br/><br/>The Oscar-winning original screenplay by Robert Towne is today regarded as one of the very best of all time, and with good reason. The crux of the mystery is highly original and the plot is incredibly intricate without becoming convoluted. Thus, given the storyline's complexity, you'd be advised to pay close attention.<br/><br/>The cast is a fine one and produced two Oscar nominees in Jack Nicholson & Faye Dunaway. I also think that John Huston was worthy of a nomination but apparently the Oscar voters didn't agree. The rest of the supporting cast is uniformly solid, including Polanski himself in a small role as a man who has a unique way of dealing with nosy people.<br/><br/>Polanski's direction is top-notch and the film's eleven Oscar nominations give an idea of the general high standard of all of the film's components. For instance, Jerry Goldsmith's score was later named one of the top ten of all time by the AFI. Personally, I think that it's good but not quite that good.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I would have no problem ranking this film among the best of all time. In fact, if you've seen the film once and didn't particularly care for it then I would suggest that you give it another try. Admittedly, on my first viewing I was less than enthusiastic but since then I've come to regard the film as a masterpiece."

","Roman Polanski's celebrated neo-noir 'Chinatown' was made when the director, and his star Jack Nicholson, were arguably both at the peak of their powers; indeed, there's a strong case that the early 1970s represented a golden age for the Hollywood movie, full stop. One achievement of this film is the actor's, Nicholson creating the character of the fast talking private eye while staying clear of the shadow of Philip Marlowe: perhaps one can think of Jake Gittes as a younger version of Chandler's hero, not yet as disillusioned (at least, this is true at the start of the film). One can also state he avoids his own shadow, playing wholly within the role, something he has not always managed since. Meanwhile, Robert Towne's intelligent script, about the economic growth and control of Los Angeles, seems particularly appropriate for a Hollywood film. In late career, Polanski has made some pretty ropey thrillers: but here his direction is taut throughout, and the film is compelling and atmospheric. It deserves its reputation; and passes muster alongside the other amazing movies that Nicholson made between 1970 and 1975."

","1974 the year of The Godfather's 2nd instalment which pretty much was the greatest film of that year but....... Also in the running for best picture that year was Polanski's finest moment in film history, Chinatown. Noir had pretty much had its run in the late 40's and 50's, the 60's decade was the decade of Disney's invasion of seminal kids films but the 1970's which i regard has the greatest decade in Hollywood history we where brought within that decade, Jaws, The first two (and best) Godfather films, Dog Day Afternoon,Taxi Driver, A Clockwork Orange,Star Wars, Dirty Harry, this was the decade of the blockbuster. Noir had no place in this decade but Roman Polanski defied what the audience were seeking by bringing them his most memorable film. Jack Nicholson played Jake Gittes, a private investigator hired by a one Mrs Mulwray to spy on her husband who she suspects is having an affair, on taking on this case Gittes begins to delve into a dark secret behind LA's unexplainable draught which he traces back to a deal made within the city's Water and Power. This dark and beautifully shot film created a tone of intensity between its actors and its audience Polanski was able to give his audience the sense that we knew what Gittes was after before delivering us the shocking twist at the end which for if you haven't seen this film i will not mention. Nicholson shines in this dark film which is up there with his greatest work such as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and The Shining and a memorable role for acting legend John Huston as the retired owner of water and power Noah Cross. Masterfully shot, beautifully written, terrifically acted and shocking until the closing credits by far one of the greatest surviving films of the 70's and gave the dying noir genre a shot in the arm. <br/><br/>10/10"

","'Chinatown' is a rare achievement- it manages to update a classic 1940's film genre without ruining it, in this case the hardboiled private investigator/film noir genre. Not only does it not ruin it or turn it into a big in-joke for cinema buffs, 'Chinatown' actually expands on the formula to include elements that would not have been possible or acceptable in that earlier time. The basic plot does not sound all that enticing (private eye investigates water usage scandal) but that is really just the jumping off mark for a number of strange subplots, each one more bizarre than the previous. In best film noir fashion, characters are not who they seem to be, major plot points shrink in significance while seemingly minor ones prove vitally important. The man trying to unravel the whole caper, as they say, is Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson), a private dick who usually specializes in smaller and more mundane cases, like marital infidelity. Before he knows it, Gittes is in over his head but he doesn't like being played for the fool, so he determines to find the truth no matter where it leads. What director Roman Polanski and writer Robert Towne end up with is a sort of revved-up, R-rated '70's combination of 'The Maltese Falcon' and 'The Big Sleep.' They keep all the conventions (the requisite opening scene where a mysterious woman shows up and hires the p.i., etc.) then elaborate on them and ultimately create some new ones. It's all great fun to watch and confusing as hell at times. John Huston plays Noah Cross, a wealthy monster of a man, whose evil isn't completely apparent till late in the film. Faye Dunaway is the femme fatale, Evelyn Mulwray, who hardly ever gives Gittes a truthful answer about anything (think Mary Astor in 'Maltese Falcon'). Towne's script is full of great dialogue and intriguing situations. Famously, he and Polanski feuded over the ending; Towne wanted a satisfactory resolution, Polanski, a downbeat one. The director won out. I don't think a 'happy ending' would have ruined the film, but the conclusion they used is certainly unforgettable. And now, of course, it's almost impossible to imagine 'Chinatown' ending any other way."

","I haven't seen the reflection in the glass behind Gittes when he signs contract with Mrs. Mullwray, therefore I'm still deeply marked with that movie. It is amazing, very fine and funny, &, like most Polanski's movies, overwhelming. It is a matter of balance: humor and mockery, say, often catch up with seriousness, even tragedy. That is what I love about his work. I loved the settings and costumes too. The whole plot reminded me of Tennessee Williams' literature and also Fitzgerald's, probably because of the sleazy atmosphere the two of them install (incestuous dad, family secrets, business corruption, etc).

There is a mysterious turn of events with a parallel story and sub-plot around the murder involving affairs and relationship.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski has done a marvelous job. He controls the director's medium. There are not many notes in the movie that I would consider as off-note, except a few  the most striking the love scene between the detective Jake and the lead lady Evelyn. But apart from that the movie is fabulous. It has an excellent story and screenplay written by Robert Towne.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson is great in his skills and does give a confidence, style, insightful, and daring image of Jake Gittes. So has Fane Dunaway as daughter, wife and mother and John Huston as rich, wealthy, mean and corrupt father have done marvelous jobs.<br/><br/>The musical score of the movie is punctuated at finer parts of the film bringing more mystery and drama in the narrative. I loved the camera angles  and it reminded so much of Akira Kurosawa's canvass  that covers all background with aesthetic placement of characters forming a pleasing painting on the screen. Roman has a very keen eye on every department of the movie and that fact comes out loud and clear.<br/><br/>The sad ending is a typical Roman's touch to his trademark films.<br/><br/>I loved it and would highly recommend to others to see it at least once.<br/><br/>(Stars 8 out of 10)"

","After seeing this movie (I picked it up from Best Buy while getting the Sin City special edition), I realized how much a film can truly make you think. The themes alone that permeate the plot; we protect what we love but you can never fully protect anyone, power corrupts, there isn't always a happy ending, etc.<br/><br/>Not to mention the purely adult way in which these themes are represented, with superb acting, direction that paid close attention to detail, an environment that was very bright but made the shadows that much darker, and a villain that was so despicable and vile that you felt as empty as Jake looked at the end of the movie when Evelyn was killed and Noah walks away with his bastard daughter wrought by incest, not to mention the financial success him and his friends would still enjoy from the new levy being built.<br/><br/>It's absolutely impossible to see a noir, which is typically dark and blurry throughout the film, to come up with an ending that doesn't satisfy us completely. We have to make up our own minds, use our own little private dicks inside our heads to determine what ends up happening in L.A. and not to mention what happens to Evelyn's daughter.<br/><br/>It's typical for a detective noir to end on a very final note, with that last piece of the puzzle being put into place within the last ten minutes and then the protagonist making everything right again, by finally doing the right thing. This movie didn't have that. Everything was put together, but you don't get the moral satisfaction that the other movies offer. You get a very bright movie with an even darker and blurrier ending than most noirs offer throughout the entire movie. It's Chinatown.<br/><br/>Now onto the acting. The acting was absolutely superb on all fronts. Faye Dunaway's Evelyn stole my heart, Jack Nicholson was the perfect protagonist (always trying to do the right thing, yet always failing. Proving a major theme in this movie, futility), John Huston's Noah Cross was the most brilliantly played role and I, like everyone else, attribute it to the fact that he was the master of noir for a long time.<br/><br/>Now, the writing. I don't care what anyone else tells you, everything in this movie is absolutely necessary, if you pay attention to everything being shot and everything being said. It might take multiple viewings, but otherwise, it's a fantastic story with characters that are both larger than life and yet less than, as well, creating humanity. The writing was spectacular.<br/><br/>The directing was fantastic. Roman Polanski crafted a masterpiece. He must have put a lot of work into this movie, because the attention to detail, knowing what to keep in frame and what to cut out and giving subtle hints as to the end throughout had to have been tough, but he absolutely did it.<br/><br/>Everything that came together and meshed so well in this movie shines through. You can take them all separately or just sit back and enjoy the entire thing. Either way, you'll be impressed and awed."

Jack Nicholson gives the performance of his career as Jake Gittes, while Faye Dunaway complements him nicely as Evelyn, a mysterious woman with a twisted past. John Huston is also terrific as Noah Cross, a bigwig with a suspicious demeanor. My favorite of the smaller performances was that of Roman Polanski (the director) as a knife-wielding goon.<br/><br/>Technical: 10/10 The violent scenes are shockingly realistic for a 1970s film, the sound and visual effects line up nicely, the cinematography is completely amazing, and the score is classic.<br/><br/>Atmosphere: 10/10 The atmosphere of the film is its true strongest point. The costumes and at direction give off the feel of old-time Los Angeles, and the film manages to be creepy and mysterious all the way through.

Strong screen writing makes this movie fast-paced, intriguing and humorous. All the good qualities of a great movie.

","Polanski has always directed uneven and sometimes disappointing movies.<br/><br/>Having said that, this writer revisited ""Chinatown"" almost thirty-three years after its release and found it good. In fact, found it excellent! Visually stunning (as an auteur's films should be) ""Chinatown"" is also a period-piece which would make the BBC proud: it reeks of purity. The costumes, cars, offices are SO accurate that it makes one want to weep. Of course, it is OUR vision of what LA was/should be. And so it goes.<br/><br/>Nicholson is pre-'Satanic'-eyebrows, and 'La Faye' simply stunning. Polanski's conceit of using John Huston in a key role takes one's breath away: Huston is presented as an 'eminence gris', the power behind the throne, as he was in real life.<br/><br/>Satisfying and a brilliant nod (and wink) to the 'forties films noir.

"denscul","9","0","1","7 April 2007"," A bit of Art imitating life.
","My high rating is due to the fact that the ""smart ass"" private eye character we see in so many of this type genre is worldly wise except for the fact that he misses the paternity line of Faye Dunnaway until the end of the movie, and his lack of catching on causes her death. This is not the usual shamus movie. I was left with the impression that John Huston's character, although wounded and hurt, would get off legally because the last scene plays in Chinatown, where anyone with money and influence can beat any legal rap. However as someone who believes that if you live long enough, your own misdeeds will eventually punish you more than the corrupt law.<br/><br/>As for life art imitating life, you have Roman Polanski, the convicted rapist of a 13 year old, and Jack Nicholson growing up not knowing who his father and mother was. This fact of life plays a central theme in this film, and J.J. Gittes had figured everything out but the true connection between Dunaway's character and Huston's, but too late to be the hero. Instead he is like most of us, a guy who hasn't got all the answers, and thats what separates this from your average cop film.<br/><br/>As for the film, the only thing I didn't like, and don't like in general, is the tint used to give us the impression that the time frame is the 1930's and not 1974 when the movie was shot. Isn't the dress, 30 cars and ethic stereotyping enough to remind us of that era? Maybe Polanski should have shot it in Black and White, like the Godfather, or Maltese Falcon."

","Upon its release, Roman Polanski's 'Chinatown' was a critical success, and was lauded as one of the greatest neo-noirs of its time. Furthermore, over thirty years later, the film remains standing as one of the few post-1960 productions that can credibly be compared with the likes of 'Double Indemnity' and 'The Maltese Falcon.'<br/><br/>Jake 'J.J' Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a Los Angeles cop turned private investigator, who specialises in spying on and photographing cheating partners. Gittes is hired by a woman named Evelyn Mulwray to investigate her cheating husband, Hollis Mulwray, the chief engineer for the city's water department. However, shortly after, Mr. Mulwray is found murdered in the reservoir, and the supposed Mrs. Mulwray turns out to be an impostor. Nevertheless, we know that the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) is tied into this mystery somewhere; how simply remains a matter of time.<br/><br/>Polanski beautifully evokes the time and place of 1930s Los Angeles, never straying too far from that iconic film-noir style. Despite being filmed in colour, we are always reminded of the film's roots, complemented by Richard Sylbert's wonderful production design and W. Stewart Campbell's art direction. Missing, also, is the Jake Gittes narration outlined in the original script  this typical noir component was, no doubt, simply excluded for its redundancy. Through Nicholson's terrific acting, we already know what Gittes is thinking; we don't need to be told again. Furthermore, by not including narration, we only learn the newest developments in the crime as Gittes does, heightening the suspense and uncertainty of the ultimate outcome.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is near flawless. John A. Alonzo's cinematography is stellar, as is the shadowy original score from the always-reliable Jerry Goldsmith. The acting is also top-notch, with Jack Nicholson notably receiving most of the acclaim, and picking up his fourth unsuccessful Oscar nomination for Best Actor (he would eventually win the following year for 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest'). The supporting cast, however, is equally good, with Faye Dunaway brilliant as Evelyn Mulwray, legendary film director John Huston great as her wealthy, scheming villainous father and an enjoyably memorable cameo from Polanski himself as the knife-wielding thug who slices Gittes' nose.<br/><br/>The shocking and tragically downbeat ending to the film certainly came as a surprise to me, though it probably wouldn't have to devoted fans of the film-noir genre. It is he with the money and power that ultimately emerges triumphant, we are told. When Evelyn is trying to escape her father, brandishing a weapon in his direction, Jake warns her to ""let the police handle this."" ""He owns the police!"" she replies, before desperately shooting her father in the arm. Just seconds later she is shot down by police. Jake is led away from the scene, all too aware that it was his actions that led directly to this outcome. However, he is now powerless to do anything. The rich and the powerful have, and will continue to, get their way. Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown."

","What makes this a great story is how clever the key storytelling elements are referenced in the narrative. <br/><br/>Huston is the 'writer', the most powerful man in the self contained L.A. microcosm. Having the power of a prime mover, he is 'dangerous', naturally. The 'child' of the writer is Dunaway, who represents the 'story' itself; the business about the diversion of L.A.'s drinking water and the dispossessed Okies (suggesting ""The Grapes of Wrath"") is the ruse that Towne wants us to follow. Our surrogate, Jack, is employed to guide us to the truth: the sidebar business would 'take only 5 minutes to explain'. What matters is the smart use of symbolism and the effect we feel as our expectations are eventually turned upside-down.<br/><br/>And as a movie, Polanski shows again he is one of the greats, here tipping his hat to Hitchcock. To invest yourself in this movie is to let it saturate you; see it and you'll understand; the realization of just how deeply this becomes embedded into us registers when the 'story' is taken away from us at the end."

Gittes, however, has a way of letting his snooping get him into trouble, or from what he better knows it as, Chinatown.

You are confused from the first twenty minutes, just as Polanski and Towne want, and any assumption you have will be wrong. As Towne said, ""Chinatown is a state of mind,"" we spend the entire film in Chinatown without physically going there.

","I first saw Chinatown in my senior year in high school. I simply loved the film. I tend to be a little biased when it comes to noir film anyway, but this film blew me away. The film is set in Southern California and it follows a private investigator by the name of Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson). Gittes is a little crass and rough around the edges but you get the feeling that he is genuinely a good person. A woman, whom says she is Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway), although she turns out to be Ida Sessions (Diane Ladd), comes to his office seeking his help because she thinks that her husband Hollis (Darrell Zwerling) is having an affair. Jake decides to investigate and all he sees is Hollis talking with another woman.<br/><br/>Hollis is the chief engineer for the water company who is in a debate about the construction a dam. He refuses to build it on grounds that the dam would not hold. Hollis creates many enemies by refusing to build the dam, mostly farmers. Things are turned upside down when Hollis ends up dead. Jake then decides to investigate Hollis's death, which complicates Jake's life even more. Jake tries to investigate Hollis's death but it just leads him into trouble. Throughout the film, it seems that Jake is in way over his head. He does not really understand what is going on. Eventually his investigation leads him to Noah Cross, a wealthy businessman as well as Evelyn's father. Jake becomes entangled in a destructive web spun by Cross and he ends up learning much more than he ever expected. What Jake uncovers leads him and Evelyn down a dangerous path into Chinatown.<br/><br/>Everyone close to Jake talks about Chinatown as if it were hell. In the Film, there is not much talked about what happened in Chinatown. All we know is that bad things happened there. The last line in the film sums up the characters' view on Chinatown, ""Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown."" Chinatown seems to represent all the bad things in the characters' lives. One important aspect to the film would have to be that the entire film is shot from Jake's point of view. Every scene in the film has Jack Nicholson in it. We, as the audience, do not know anything more than what Jake knows. This creates much mystery in the film regarding the entire plot. The film can be quite confusing and it took me more than one viewing to understand it, and I am not even sure I understand it now.<br/><br/>Jake is truly alienated because he had no idea with what he is dealing and we take the ride with him. I found myself trying to figure out what was really going on, unsuccessfully I might add. It is a great film to watch alone or with a whole group and it is a lot of fun watching it with people who have never seen it. Chinatown has great acting, great directing, great writing, great cinematography, and essentially, everything in the film was done well. Such a great film, I recommend it to everyone. Truly, one of those films everybody should see."
"dlaferriere","9","0","2","9 March 2006"," ending
","What I liked most about this movie was how it ended. It wasn't your typical Hollywood ending where the good guy prevails. Instead in Chinatown the sinister man gets away with everything he did. I liked this not because I like the bad guy winning, but because it is actually what would happen in the real world. In today's world the rich man can get away with almost anything and that's the way it was here.<br/><br/>I also thought the ending was well done because of where it ended. It ended in Chinatown where the most corrupt things happen and nothing is done about it because of the fear of being killed. This story is basically the same thing. Jake knows the truth but is not able to convince anyone of it and he can't go about it on his own because Noah Cross will have him killed if he gets in the way. Noah can do this because he is a powerful man and has bought everyone off. In Chinatown it was the same way for Jake. He solved the crimes but couldn't do anything about it for fear of his life. That is the way it is in the real world, it shouldn't be that way, but it is.<br/><br/>There was also some foreshadowing as to what would happen to Evelyn at the end of the movie. She was shot through the back on the head and in the eye and then fell on the horn. Earlier in the movie Jake picks up on the black spot in her eye which she calls a flaw. Also when Jake surprises her at the house where he daughter is being kept she cries and falls on the horn like she did in the end. Both these instances foreshadow how Evelyn died in the end.<br/><br/>Overall I thought the ending was the best part. I liked it because it was more of a real world story, but it also had the Hollywood twist with the lucky shot the cop made to hit her in the head. It was also ironic because it ended in Chinatown where Jake didn't want to be because only bad things happen there. His wife was killed there because of his detective work and now his newfound girl is killed because of his work. Jake was also stuck between a rock and a hard place because he wanted to pin the crimes on Noah, but couldn't because of the risk of his life. He went through the same type of problem when he worked in Chinatown as a detective. So everything that happens to Jake when he used to be in Chinatown happened all over again when he went back."

","Roman Polanski's Chinatown is by far one of the better neo noirs that I have ever seen. Despite the color instead of the classic black and white noirs of earlier times, Chinatown could easily be considered on the same level as its predecessors. L.A. Confidential does not seem to be in the same league. The movie's drab and macabre feeling resonates long after the movie ends. Staying consistent with many ground breaking movies of this period, the apocalyptic ending seems to be the only appropriate way to end this dark story. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway's performances are perfect for what the movie entitles. Robert Towne's script is near flawless. The twists and turns do not seem clichÃ© and are there to propel the movie deeper and deeper into a winding abyss. The subject matter chosen for the film also serves the picture well. Los Angeles was built on the backs of the men who devised the plans for water engineering to provide the sprawling city with water. The two men who are credited with this feat are the lofty and idealistic Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling), who believed that the water supply belonged to the public, and the greedy, power hungry Noah Cross (John Huston), who wishes to deprive the already dehydrated city for his own benefit. Herein lays the mystery that J.J. Giddis' (Jack Nicholson) character is trying to unlace. The corruption goes all the way up to the top including holds on the police department and other public officials. In the end, J.J. is able to uncover the scandal, but is rendered powerless by the elite of the L.A. scene. Not only does his attempt fail, but he himself is left feeling empty and helpless in the face of these powerful men, who he made the mistake of labeling as just human and subject to law like every other citizen. He is trapped just as was Hollis Mulwray who encountered a far more violent end. J.J. Giddis is conceived to be a wheeling and dealing character who only after his own fame and glory, although he would never admit it himself. He's an ex-cop who is driven by the prospect of making money and isn't afraid to wear it. However, when he is approached by Evelyn Cross Mulwray, his motives start to change. He is still after the fame of uncovering one of the more groundbreaking scandals of the time, but there also a human element that is entered into the context. He goes out of his way and puts his collar on the line for this abused woman. In the end the only decent thing that he has conceivably done in the last decade goes unrewarded and ends in tragedy. This beautifully written story is more than just a genre of film labeled ""noir"". It has all kinds of social implications as well. It depicts the fruitless toil of idealistic liberals waging a war against the insurmountable power of the elite and privileged, who only got that way through corruption and dishonest dealings. It is far more poignant to the turbulence of the 1970's than to the times of the 1930's."

","Nobody ever hires Gittes to uncover the water scandal, yet this is what the whole movie is about. Noah Cross is the money that made Los Angeles possible, Evelyn and Catherine are L.A., Escobar and the police force are old morality, Gittes is the postmodern morality, Mulwray represents technology. Just like how Katherine is the unnatural product of Cross and his daughter, present L.A. is the unnatural product of money and the rape of Owens Valley. It used to be that traditional values could be relied upon to make it in the world. But just as Escobar's cronie killed Evelyn in the end, those values cannot comprehend modern moral challenges, such as those provided by the potential of modern technology. Gittes transcends the old morality and is able to name Cross's crime, in his face (this predawn scene is beautiful and done all in one shot). A more perfect script coupled with the perfect director, I can't think of."

In this film noir gem by Roman Polanski, Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway played so well together, one can't but flinch at the moment its resolution hits us. It's tragic, dark, unforgiving, and yet we can't look away.<br/><br/>Robert Towne's flawless script takes us through one eye-opening experience after another. As we wonder whether any of the scenarios in the film were based on reality, or if it's all the work of a creative writer. Every player does his or her part to the best of his ability, doing justice to every line, every nuance, every tentacle that lurks in the midst of the corruption at the heart of the story. There are so many disturbing pieces, and they all fit perfectly. Never before had a detective encountered so much evil in so little time.<br/><br/>This film works probably even better after 30 years of its initial release. It was a classic the minute its first screening ended, and a classic it remains."

","Does that mean it's bad? Certainly not I wouldn't suggest that it's a really good movie, probably even a great movie but certainly not the best. Newsweek named it the most influential movie of the 1970's. They must not have seen the Godfather Parts I or II or a virtual host of other movies (Jaws, Rocky, Patton to name just three) that were more famous and much more noteworthy to the public. True this was one of Nicholson's best and most famous performances (along with The Shining, A Few Good Men, and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) and the same is true for Faye Dunaway perhaps her most famous role. She was young, beautiful, and talented and I know Ali McGraw couldn't have touched her performance in 2 million years. I have not seen this film for quite some time which explains why I don't believe it was the greatest film of the 1970's if it was I would have watched it more than a couple of times in my entire life. I never had much respect for Polanski's work and it had nothing to do with the accusations he committed a crime. I just didn't connect with any of his characters or his directing. No slam against him but I just didn't. If I remember correctly Detective Jake Gittes in L.A. is hired to investigate charges of adultery against a wealthy, influential man. When he turns up dead Gittes investigates and turns up a nefarious money making scheme involving the deceased's wife and his father-in-law turned business partner. I don't feel I need to throughly explain this movie as I'm sure it's been done a thousand times on this site but I do think people should view it as it is what I consider a classic. It's was just not that memorable to me aside from the ending which was pretty unexpected."

","The first movie I've seen from Roman Polanski's hand was ""The Pianist"" and the best way to describe what it did to me, was blowing me away. Nothing more, nothing less. It was one of the best examples of pure and honest cinema. Polanski knows how to suck you into a story like only few others can. What he does is not so different from what the other directors do (you will not see any special filming techniques for instance), but somehow he can give you that little extra that makes it all that more interesting. Hoping for the best, I wondered if I would feel it again with ""Chinatown"".<br/><br/>Jake 'J.J.' Gittes works as a private detective. When a woman comes in his office, claiming to be Evelyn Cross Mulwray, the wife of chief engineer of the water department Hollis Mulwray and asking him to investigate her husband's adulterous ways, there is no reason not to think this isn't just a normal every-day case. So Jake starts his investigation and is able to take photos of Hollis with a young lady. Case closed you would say, but when Hollis turns up murdered, Jake decides to investigate this from a bit closer. Soon he finds more than he thought there was to be found. Not only does he discover a plot to buy cheap, unwatered land for low prices, which than will be watered and sold for millions of dollars, he also finds out who the real wife of Mulwray is, who masterminded the plot, what the mysterious woman had to do with all of this and why so many different people are interested in that young girl Mulwray was photographed with...<br/><br/>""Chinatown"" was shot almost thirty years before ""The Pianist"", but it is all too clear that Roman Polanski already knew exactly what to do to give a movie that little extra. Not only is it an excellent character study that focuses on all the characters and still doesn't feel impossible to entangle. It is also a movie in which you'll see some actors giving away one of their finest performances ever. Take for instance Jack Nicholson. He's so unbelievably real as the P.I Jake 'J.J.' Gittes. He plays it like he hasn't played another role in his entire life, like it is coming out of all of his pores. And the same can be said about all the other actors like for instance Faye Dunaway, John Huston,... Even the supporting actors seemed to fit perfectly in their roles.<br/><br/>What I also liked about this movie was the entire atmosphere. Not only does it give you an excellent idea of what the 1920's - 1930's looked and felt like, it also breathes some kind of threatening mysteriousness. That's probably what makes this movie so special. Not only the story and the acting are very good, so is the entire setting and feeling of the movie. <br/><br/>All in all this is a classic that shouldn't be missed by anybody who claims to be a real movie fan. It's for many reasons a fascinating movie that shows very well what a talented director Roman Polanski actually is. I give this movie an 8.5/10."

The case quickly turns to set ups, conspiracy and murder.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunnaway play this movie perfectly. A private detective needs to be played as street smart and cool. The street wise must ooze from him without being overplayed and ruining his cool.

","The first time I saw this film 30 years ago, I was puzzled by all the attention it was getting from the critics. I thought it was just an interesting period piece about a wise guy gumshoe who stumbled onto a confusing scheme to steal water in 1930s L.A. But after every subsequent viewing, my fascination with it has deepened. Robert Towne's script is a compelling study of human depravity and the lonely struggle some people make to at least stem its effects. What seems like a very stylish turn in the private eye genre is actually a reflection of the deepening cynicism that American society was undergoing at the time it was made. If you've only seen this masterpiece once, give it another look. And another. If you love great movies, you'll fall under its disquieting spell. (David Thomson's novel ""Suspects"", is a very well done exploration of the mood and themes prevalent in ""Chinatown"".)"

"Travis69","10","0","1","3 December 2003"," Chinatown review
","`Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown!' Long before The Pianist, Roman Polanski's other classic was Chinatown, a film based on a place with its own rules, logic and morality. Unfortunately for private investigator Jake Gittes (who else but Jack Nicholson), Chinatown is a place where ghosts have advised him to do `as little as possible'; yet that technique is almost unfeasible when emotions are thrown into the mix. Like Harry Caul from the other great film paranoia-noir of 1974, The Conversation, Jake involves himself too heavily in one case and winds up in the same place with no sanity for human nature. As in most films Chinatown ends where it begins. This time, it just happens to begin in the back-story.<br/><br/>Chinatown could very well mean more than just a place. It's also arguably a state of mind. What else would you expect from film noir? John Huston (yes, that John Huston) plays the incestuous crooked man, Noah Cross, who goes from owning the Water Dept. to owning the police and anyone else with a price. Yet, the corruption that happens to Jake in Chinatown-perhaps on both instances-is not corruption directly from Chinatown. Chinatown is a place where police have been known to avoid the rigors of street life. And it's not because the Chinese, or the other immigrants who reside there, are more than or just as dangerous as anyone else. Many of the larger North American cities have a Chinatown, often confused with being untouched by the law because of `language barriers'; more applicable reasoning would say that it's a place where upper government simply doesn't care what happens there-that people in Chinatown are led to ruining (even killing) themselves.<br/><br/>In one particular scene, Jake is lying in bed with the widow of a recently-murdered water department chief engineer, Evelyn Cross-Mulwray (a brilliant Faye Dunaway). After revealing his hopes of assisting her on the case to overcome his past, Evelyn's profile is turned to the camera with an inscrutable, symbolized extension of her eyes and lighting of her skin-could she soon too be Jake's Chinatown ghost?<br/><br/>Chinatown's screenplay is right by the book (some say it's the finest ever written) and all the actors, especially Nicholson, do a wonderful job emphasizing its black humor. You wouldn't expect any laugh-out-loud moments in a crime mystery thriller like this; but with a cocky P.I. played by Nicholson, there's plenty. How ridiculous is it when sheep trample into a courtroom in one of the film's opening scenes? Or how about Jake, for seventy-five percent of the film, running around playing detective with a Band-Aid on his nose? There are also plenty of jump-out-of-your-bed moments as well. Similar to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre which also came out in 1974 (there seems to be a lot of relevancy between films of that year), bad things seem to happen during daylight. In fact, Chinatown is not a very dark film noir at all; perhaps that's part of the suspense in witnessing one of the most disturbing endings of all time.<br/><br/>

What else can be said about Jack Nicholson's, Faye Dunaway's, and John Ford's performances that hasn't already been said. They are simply perfect. It was interesting to read in Dunaway's biography, My Life Looking for Gatsby, how unpleasant and even abusive director Polanski was toward the cast, particularly towards, her but even to Nicholson.

","In Roman Polanski's Chinatown, inspector J.J. Gittes is sucked into a world of scandal and mystery, where nothing is as it seems and everything is connected. Set in 1940's L.A., Chinatown takes mystery noir and turns into into a beautiful masterpiece. Surprisingly it is compared by many to the 1997 feature L.A. Confidential, who also say that they are alike. I find this difficult to believe, because Chinatown is more of a mystery noir while L.A. Confidential is more of a thriller. The performances in Chinatown are first- rate, with immensley deep performances by Jack Nicholson and Fay Dunaway. Both were nominated for their roles, and they both deserved to win. An honorable mention is John Huston as Noah Cross, a mysterious man who has more involvement then seen. It's not easy to like Jack Nicholson's character; he is snoopy and sly, and will do whatever it takes to get information. However, the viewer can easily understand him for he is sucked into this world without warning. The script by Robert Towne won Best Original Screenplay, which it deserved very much because of the absolute brilliance and originality. There is not one excessive line in this film, or really an excessive scene. Roman Polanski too this excellent script and turned it into pure brilliance, also high notes for pushing the cast members. The photography is interesting, but there isn't much of 50's shown in this picture, it's much more involved in the storyline then the setting. The only real flaw of this film is that it gets a bit slow and boring, but it doesn't hurt it much from being the masterpiece it is. One of the top ten films of all time. 9.75/10"

","CHINATOWN(1974), ****1/2 out of 5. Starring Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, John Huston, Perry Lopez, John Hillerman, Darrell Zwerling, Diane Ladd, Roy Jenson, Roman Polanski, James Hong, and Burt Young as Curly.<br/><br/>A wonderfully brooding, suspenseful revisitation of the land of film noir, CHINATOWN is not only one of the greatest detective films, but one of the most perfectly constructed of all films. With Polanski's brilliant direction, Towne's intricate screenplay, and Nicholson's and Dunaway's tour de force performances, the film stands as one of the best of the 1970s. The plot revolves around Gittes (Nicholson), a Chandleresque private eye who specializes in the most distasteful of detective enterprises--snooping after straying spouses. After being duped by a woman pretending to be the wife of the city water commissioner, Gittes meets the man's real wife, Evelyn Mulwray (Dunaway), but before long she ends up a widow. Drawn into these strange goings-on, Gittes follows a jigsaw puzzle of clues that leads to Mulwray's father, Cross (Huston). Cross has involved himself in the ""future"" of Los Angeles by engineering a plot to divert the city's water supply for his own gain.<br/><br/>Besides telling a gripping story involving incest and political graft, CHINATOWN recaptures the atmosphere of Los Angeles, 1937--the cars, clothes, and buildings, right down to the barber chairs (kudos to production designer Richard Sylbert and costumer Anthea Sylbert). Even the muted color cinematography (normally antithetical to the tenets of noir) is evocative and apppropriate. Interestingly, Towne's script included not a single scene set in Chinatown--initially a metaphorical state of mind rather than a specific place.<br/><br/>Look for director Polanski as the thug who pokes a switchblade up Nicholson's nostril while uttering the infamous line, ""You know what happens to nosy fellows? They lose their noses."" Another highlight: Dunaway's ""sister... daughter... sister... daughter"" routine, a camp classic much parodied since. CHINATOWN earned 11 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, but only Towne took home a statuette for his cynical screenplay."
"kanerazor","10","0","2","22 February 2003"," Exciting, captivating, and harrowing-one of the greatest films ever made!
","Chinatown is one of the rare films that showcases the absolute full potential of the Hollywood dream factory. Everything about this film is absolutely perfect. It's really a shame that Chinatown came out the same year as The Godfather Part II (which is my favorite movie ever) and only got an original screenplay Oscar-virtually ANY OTHER YEAR it would have easily gotten Best Picture and Director, and who knows what else.<br/><br/>The story alone makes this a classic thriller. Robert Towne really put together an incredible screenplay, which requires you to pay close attention to figure out everything happening but is worth every bit of the effort. As all the pieces of the puzzle come together, the film just gets more and more mesmerizing. The dialogue is incredible; I can count on one hand the number of films I've seen that were as quotable. The highlights are the exchanges between Gittes and Cross, as well as the famous scene with Gittes and Evelyn. The film remains incredibly absorbing right up until the devastating finale. Polanski had to fight Towne to put that ending on there, but for good reason. This ending left me horrified, but Chinatown just would not have been the same movie without it. Polanski directs the entire thing brilliantly-he evokes so many different emotions out of the viewers just right and leaves us with the feeling that we have just been exposed to events that should have remained hidden, if only to prevent emotional scars.<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly excellent, from the leads to Escobar and Yelburton to Evelyn's servants to the farmers in the San Fernando Valley, and everyone in between. That includes the director himself in a very gory cameo. I want to talk about the leads. Jack Nicholson is an actor who I used to think was very overrated. I'd primarily seen his films in the past 15 years or so, and thought he always played himself, complete with grinning and rudeness. When I saw Chinatown though, I was blown away. There is one scene where he's telling the dirty joke and seems like JACK, but other than that there is not a trace of the regular character. Gittes is a cynical, wounded private eye who at first is simply trying to make a living, then clear his name, and then finds himself in love and wanting to care and protect in spite of himself. Nicholson nails every aspect of the performance, and after watching him here I went out to see other early works of his such as Five Easy Pieces. John Houston is also exceptional, playing one of the most contemptible villains ever, and my guess as to the reason he wasn't nominated for Best Supporting Actor is simply because the Academy hated his character far too much.<br/><br/>However, I think Faye Dunaway deserves the most praise here. She delivers one of the best performances I've ever seen by an actress in any movie. At first Evelyn is so icy (I've heard some even call her a femme fatale, even though that label is certainly not appropriate once you watch the entire film) and we wonder what she could possibly be hiding. Then later we see that she is in great pain, but can only wonder why. I was especially moved by her when she softly told Gittes ""Please believe me; I would never have hurt Hollis. He was the kindest most gentle man and you wouldn't believe what he had to go through for me."" After the revelation, I found myself never having cared about a movie character more. I haven't seen Dunaway's other starring roles, but it's clear why she was one of the top actresses of the 1970s, and I'm glad she won Best Actress for Network two years after this.<br/><br/>I've made an effort not to spoil anything in this remarkable film. Anyone who wants to see everything a movie can be needs to experience Chinatown."

","Of all the movies produced by Robert Evans during his tenure in charge of Paramount in the early-mid 1970s, CHINATOWN is the one for which I think he deserves the most credit. Evans, either by design or serendipity, brought together Robert Towne's superb screenplay and Roman Polanski's confident and polished direction to create a magnificently accomplished tale of avarice and treachery. The oppressive heat of a 1937 Los Angeles summer drought seems burned into the celluloid, thanks to John A. Alonzo's immaculate cinematography and there is also strong production design from Richard Sylbert. Jerry Goldsmith contributes a haunting and evocative score. <br/><br/>Jack Nicholson plays Jake Gittes, a medium-rent private detective specialising in matrimony cases, who is duped into investigating a racket involving murdered water Commissioner Hollis Mulwray. Gittes concentrates on Mulwray's emotionally disturbed widow (Faye Dunaway) with whom he becomes emotionally involved and her powerful father Noah Cross (John Huston), a Machiavellian figure who is hiding a horrible secret.<br/><br/>Dunaway and Huston are great (possibly career-best) and Nicholson has not yet reached the excesses of his (admittedly entertaining) scenery-chewing style on view in such movies as THE SHINING and THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK. Polanksi has taken the typical 1940s film noir (which we are used to seeing in black- and-white) and updated it to lush colour, making it richly evocative of the period during which it is set yet, at the same time, curiously modern even by todays standards.<br/><br/>CHINATOWN completely deserves it's reputation as one of the key films of the 1970's which earned that particular decade its well-deserved epithet as the outstanding period for the production of intelligent and challenging cinema.<br/><br/>Real fans should also look at the belated sequel, THE TWO JAKES (1990) and, especially, Curtis Hanson's homage, LA CONFIDENTIAL (1997)."

","`C'mon Jake, it's . . . Chinatown,' so utters Joe Mantell, one of the finest and least known character players of his generation, to Jack Nicholson's Jake Gittes at film's end. Those of you who have seen the film realize that it is not about Chinatown at all, but what it stands for in the story: broken dreams and that things are often not what they seem.<br/><br/>	Chinatown is a great film, truly one of the all time greats. As I type this I have the video jacket in front of me and the production / cast credits on the back read like a Who's Who in Hollywood in the1970's. (Chinatown was released in 1974). Robert Evans, Roman Polanski, Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, John Hillerman, Burt Young, John Huston. Robert Towne, to name a few, persons all well known to the public or whom someday would be. When viewed in this context, it is easy to understand why Chinatown is such a classic.<br/><br/>	The story is too complicated and convoluted to go into detail here, as all of the great gumshoe films of the 1940's were, but a recap is in order. It is 1930's Los Angeles. Jake Gittes (Nicholson) is a private investigator making a nice living performing surveillance on wayward spouses. One day, a wealthy woman shows up wishing to hire Jake to trail her husband, who happens to be the Los Angeles water commissioner, only it turns out that the woman who did the hiring is not the man's wife. Gittes should have paid better attention to the alarm bell which went off in his mind because he is soon involved in public fraud, murder and family scandal. Along the way he falls in love with the water commissioner's real wife, the smoky and secretive Evelyn Mulray, ably played by Faye Dunaway, and a woman who is hiding a dark family secret. 	I won't give the finish away, but it does end in Chinatown in an unexpected and tragic way. 	I am not certain Chinatown could be shot and produced today as it was in 1974. There are excellent interior/exterior and location shots of 1930's architecture which today would be almost 30 years older. Director Roman Polanski's influence upon his pictures is, in my view, unique, for I have never seen anyone draw emotion out of his characters as he does. (I was reminded of this when I recently viewed The Pianist). It is a pity that his well-documented problems with the American legal system have kept him out of the United States for so many years, for I doubt that we will ever have the opportunity now to see if he has another American masterpiece within him, as was Chinatown and 1968's Rosemary's Baby. 	Another example of Polanski's genius is how he managed to make a masterpiece of a story which was shot in bright color but should have been filmed in black and white. (My imagination runs wild when I consider what Humphrey Bogart would have been like as Jake Gittes, or Sydney Greenstreet as the quintessentially evil Noah Cross, portrayed by John Huston and the father of Evelyn Mulray, together as they were in The Maltese Falcon, another film noir classic). Polanski not only used color but vivid color to turn the picture within itself and present a dark story in the full light of day. 	Jack Nicholson was a year away from his big success in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. Faye Dunaway, who earned a place in my Grand Dame Hall of Fame with her performance as the benighted Evelyn Mulray, was at the height of her popularity and powers in 1974. Huston as the sinister Noah Cross will keep you awake at night after your first viewing of this film. Players such as John Hillerman and Burt Young would go on to greater success and popularity . Chinatown owes much of it's success to these players. 	A last word about the previously mentioned Joe Mantell who had a small role as one of Jake's investigators. He did utter the film's most famous line, but that is not all of his story. Mr. Mantell appeared in a 1960 Twilight Zone episode titled, `Nervous Man in A Four Dollar Room,' where he literally had to change his entire personality in real time on camera, Marc Scott Zicree, writing in The Twilight Zone Companion, (copyright 1982, Bantam Books), has this to say about him: `Joe Mantell is an actor not generally known, but he should be.' 	In Chinatown, even the bit players were great performers."

","Although I do not appreciate Polanski's movies that much (""Macbeth"" for example which is the worse movie I've ever seen), I must say that I loved this one.  Sure, it's a little gory, which is what I usually do not like about Polanski's movies, but in ""Chinatown"", I thought the gory scenes were OK for two reasons:<br/><br/>-There is not too much gore.<br/><br/>-The gore scenes are pretty subtle.<br/><br/>In fact, I can only recall one gory scene, the ending.  I say it is subtle because I hadn't noticed that Faye Dunaway had been shot through the eye at first. <br/><br/>  This movie shows you what you can do with just a few elements. A woman who believes her husband is cheating on her whereas she isn't really his wife, a water dam, and the man who controls the projects for the dam.  These three simple elements lead to a complex story of murder and incest.  Plus, Polanski got the best actors for the movie and created a masterpiece.  It's great."

","Last year the AFI ranked ""Chinatown"" #19 on a list of the hundred greatest movies of the last 100 years, just above ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". ""Cuckoo's Nest"" being one of my all time favorite movies, I thought I should definitely see ""Chinatown"". While watching the movie I was interested, but not really intrigued. I know the plot had something to do with water and land deals and murder. I couldn't really get into the story. The acting was good, the ending seemed abrupt, and the whole film overall is overrated. I don't understand why this movie is considered so great. As far as film-noir goes, I thought LA Confidential was much better."

","""Mr. Gittes, most people never have to face the fact that, in the right time and the right place, they're capable of...ANYTHING.""<br/><br/>Those words are spoken by John Huston's evil Noah Cross, a rich and powerful old rancher and investor for whom the word ""rapacious"" was coined.  His quote above comes during the film's final scene, but explains everything that has come before....and then some.<br/><br/>If you've ever wondered why politicians leave lucrative careers in favor of running for public office so they can, uhhh, ""serve the public"", well, this is your film.  If you've ever wondered why people donate heavily to politicians, this is your film. The access to power, and the money the power provides, fuels much of what Jack Nicholson's detective J. J. Gittes uncovers when he sets out to investigate what he believes is a simple case of marital infidelity.  He finds out that what goes around comes around, and that the road to Hell is, indeed, paved with good intentions.<br/><br/>The film's mood is set even before the credits:  The familiar Paramount mountain mural is set in sepia tone, with a flourish of 1930's torch music by Jerry Goldsmith.  Despite the period setting, the story and impact are timeless.<br/><br/>Approached by a mysterious woman who claims to be concerned about her prominent husband's philandering, Gittes sets a trap that only he, himself, can fall into.  There are so many little details that mean so much that I can insist this film won't display its total brilliance without repeated viewings.  Details like:<br/><br/>---The meaning of the SAG card found in a victim's wallet; ---The link between Real Estate plat books and obits; ---One look at the supposed philandering husband, and you know he's faithful, conscientious and honest; ---The meaning of the film's title, which is only hinted at at key points; ---The effect of the friction between the honest Gittes and his malleable former cohort (""Of course, we all have to swim in the same water"") from his Chinatown days; ---The mysterious salt water found in telling places (hint: lungs and backyard ponds); ---The significance of the name ""Hollis Mulwray"":  The name is drawn from James Mulholland, a longtime civic leader in L.A.; ---The battle, financial and otherwise, for water in L.A. (then, a desert community), considered a right for the city's residents, but, in the eyes of those delivering it, worth killing for; ---Those deep, deep secrets borne by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway).<br/><br/>Please don't judge this great, great film on a single viewing.  Let its music, sets and grandeur take you back to another time, and watch evil unfold, as the do-gooder finds how defenseless he really is when money and evil join forces."

","Whatever you may think of Nicholson or Polanski as individuals this is great cinema. Even if you don't much like Nicholson as an actor you will have to make an exception in the case of this movie. The plot is constantly developing, with blind alleys and constant twists abounding. Just as you think things are becoming clearer something else happens to make you wonder. The sense of menace is palpable. Just who are the good guys and who are the bad guys? This is also one of the few films that has the power to genuinely shock as the final layers of truth are exposed."
"ACB-6","10","0","1","27 April 1999"," A classic mystery of murder, politics, and love
","Chinatown is a classic mystery full of twists and turns.  Jack Nicholson is a private investegator who becomes part of an elaborate plot to kill the head of the Los Angeles water department.  From the start Nicholson knows something is up, and begins to discover a huge scandal.<br/><br/>This movie often receives unfavorable comments because the plot can be difficult to follow.  The first time I saw the movie, I was very confused. However, after watching it again the movie made more sense.  The script is so well written, if you miss one little part of the dialogue you could be lost for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie marks a highlight for Roman Polanski (this is my favorite movie by Polanski), and Jerry Goldsmith (this is my favorite musical score by Goldsmith).  If it had not been for The Godfather II coming out the same year, Chinatown may have run off with an incredible number of Oscars.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie is how well the movie flows into the final scene.  After watching the movie several times, I continually pick out more and more of the symbolism and foreshadowing throughout the storyline.<br/><br/>This movie is incredible.  Great acting from Jack Nicholson, John Huston, and Faye Dunaway.  Great directing from Roman Polanski.  Great screenwriting by Robert Towne, and great music provided by Jerry Goldsmith.  If you have not seen this movie, put it high on your must see list.  If you have seen the movie, I urge you to watch it more than once."

","CHINATOWN is a classic example film noir.  It is must viewing for fans of the genre.<br/><br/>The Oscar winning script is extremely engaging.  Polanski's directing is his best work.  The sets and costumes are period perfect.  Nicholson is perfect in the protagonist role, and Huston does a perfect ""creep.""<br/><br/>The only weak area is Faye Dunaway who looks like she is walking through the role.  The true film noir femme fatale has a contained emotion the viewer can sense lying underneath her expressionless facade.  She is a smoldering volcano only appearing dormant on the outside.  Ms. Dunaway got the expressionless appearance right, but we sense no heat underneath.  For true examples of femme fatales, think Lauren Bacall in THE BIG SLEEP, Barbara Stanwyk in DOUBLE INDEMNITY, or Marlene Dietrich in TOUCH OF EVIL.  Or more modernly the steamy Linda Fiorentino in JADE or THE LAST SEDUCTION.<br/><br/>Still, CHINATOWN is a film not to be missed."

","Smart film-noir draws me in every time. This film is one of the smartest. What casting! The star of the film is 1930's Los Angeles. Jack Nicholson is the flawed good guy, Jake Gittes. Film legend John Huston is the bad guy. The theme is the exercise of power. When Jake was slapping Faye Dunaway, my dismay matched his when we both suddenly understood exactly what she was saying. Few movie moments equal that one for provoking sheer astonishment mixed, finally, with horrified comprehension."

","Chinatown is ultimate culmination of writing, acting, and cinematography that I have ever seen.  Nicholson and Dunaway are excellent.  Polanski and Towne did a remarkable job writing and directing.  This movie needs to be seen many times.  Every time I see Chinatown it gets better and better. I highly recommend it to anybody that has never seen it or to anybody that has only seen it once.  Chinatown is truly a masterpiece. It is without a doubt in the TOP 3 movies ever made."

","Many people consider Robert Towne's script to be one of the best and coherent scripts ever. I thought it was confusing, but maybe I'll just have to see the movie again to sort things out. Chinatown's tragic ending, one of the highlights of the script has been considered one of the greatest movie endings of all time. It should be known that it was written not by Robert Towne, but by Roman Polanski. I thought the ending was good, but the only scene set in the film's title location went by too quickly. Roman Polanski with help from cinematographer John A. Alonzo created an excellent atmosphere with some scenes in  darkness, and some in blinding sunlight. The acting of Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway and John Huston is also very good, but they're not 5 star performances.  And Jerry Goldsmith's musical score is one of the best I've ever heard. I have no trouble at all with Chinatown ranking #19 on the AFI's Top 100."
