"lekgolah","8","65","78","20 January 2011"," Great performances all-round and directing make this well worth watching
","Despite not having seen Gone Baby Gone, I've heard a lot of good things about Ben Affleck's switch to directing and so I decided to watch The Town, which put simply is about band robbers but to expand on that, the film is also about the leader of the group, played by Ben Affleck. <br/><br/>When watching the trailer it easy to draw comparisons to Heat and The Departed but this is different. Many films about crime make the audience side either the police or the criminals yet The Town allows the audience to see people from both sides of the law fairly. Jon Hamm plays an honest working FBI officer while Ben Affleck plays the criminal. The film is shot predominately from the criminals perspective, therefore the audience feel the same sense of urgency that they do but we don't want to see them gun down the FBI and police and let them get away with their crimes. It is a difficult challenge for the director to deal with but he does it well and the end result is very good.<br/><br/>The entire cast are all fantastic even when given smaller roles, for example Chris Cooper and the late Pete Postlethwaite steel the scenes that they are in. Jeremy Renner has earned a lot of attention from his role and he deserves it, giving an honest performance, which clearly took a lot of research to perfect. An almost unrecognisable Blake Lively and Rebecca Hall are both great. Ben Affleck and Jon Hamm as the opposing forces are also great but it is Renner's performance that stands out.<br/><br/>As a crime film, it is important that the action doesn't turn the whole film into an all guns blazing film. The action scenes are handed pretty well and the car chases through the minor roads of Boston are really exciting to watch.<br/><br/>The Town is not only only a solid action/ crime film but also marks Affleck as a great director. I strongly recommend this film if you are interested in the genre. While it is not perfect, it does so much well, that you would be missing out if you didn't see this."
"Simon_Says_Movies","8","118","157","17 September 2010"," One of the finest pieces of ensemble acting in years
","To say that The Town is everything Takers tried to be and failed at would actually be an insult to Ben Affleck's latest film. Mentioning that bland rehashing in the same breath would imply they even exist on the same plane, but the honest truth is this gritty Boston crime drama is something special and the best film of the early fall season.<br/><br/>Affleck's first foray into directing with the Dennis Lehane adaptation Gone Baby Gone shocked viewers and the critical community in kind, showing that a fading acting career does not mean one is down-and-out in Hollywood. Affleck marries his two passions in The Town, directing, producing and writing the film as well as starring in the lead role, his first since 2003's Paycheck. He owns this comeback performance, successfully wiping any lingering distaste from duds like Daredevil or Gigli. This is by no means a one-man show, but The Town has nothing close to a weak link, in fact, this may be one of the finest pieces of ensemble acting in years.<br/><br/>Joining Affleck in a supporting role is Jeremy Renner, fresh off his best actor Oscar nomination for The Hurt Locker and he beyond a doubt proves he is no one-hit wonder. This is Oscar-worthy acting yet again for Renner, nailing his Boston accent along with his loose-cannon mentality. He is terrifying, but impossible to pry your eyes away from. The most shocking revelation comes from Blake Lively (TV's ""Gossip Girl"") as a doped-up mother with more than a few issues. She is not only unrecognizable, but owns her role, never calling attention to her drastic deviation from type. Substantial buzz was also placed in the way of John Hamm from the acclaimed television drama Mad Men. He is sufficiently pompous as a dedicated FBI agent also scoring a number of the films laughs.<br/><br/>Before I wander too much further into specifics, the characters in The Town populate a Boston suburb called Charlestown, which an introductory message informs us, is the world-center for bank robbers. Affleck's Doug MacRay heads a team of those in such a profession including Renner as James Coughlin and two others played by Slaine, and Owen Burke. During one of their routine bank heists, they are forced to take a hostage (Rebecca Hall) during their hasty escape. Afterwards, to make sure she does not know anything incriminating following her release from captivity, MacRay follows her and inadvertently falls for her in the process.<br/><br/>There is nothing particularly revelatory about The Town, there are few surprises or much that deviates from a standard crime drama. But Affleck directs with such skill and confidence while showcasing yet another peek into suburban Boston that it is never less than riveting. There is an overlying sense of impeding dread that perforates The Town and a handful of sensational action sequences do little to let up the firm grasp the film has on our windpipes. Propelled by faultless acting and a pitch- perfect script, this slice of the Boston criminal underworld is everything for which we could have hoped following such a bland summer. Affleck has always been a star, and if he continues to produce films of this pedigree, then there might be hope for the movies yet."
"blackmambamark","8","228","327","14 September 2010"," Take a bow Mr. Affleck....you have certainly earned it.
","My Oh My how Ben Affleck has had a up and down career. Starting out as the cheesy yet funny guy in those Kevin Smith flicks, to the academy award winning writer of ""Good Will Hunting"", all the way back down to the pathetic string of acting he produced only 10 years ago. But there is a silver lining....with his directorial debut in ""Gone Baby Gone"", and his much improved acting in ""Hollywoodland"". Ben Affleck is beginning to once again prove his worth in Tinsel Town. Hopefully he can continue to feverish pace.<br/><br/>Well i can say with complete just, that this is the best ""Heist"" movie since ""Swordfish""......Now i know most of you may not like ""Swordfish"", but what other bank robbery movie can you compare it to in the past 10 years? Maybe ""Snatch""? ""Lock Stock""?....eh, if you classify those movies as ""Heist"" pictures, than okay, it's the best heist movie since ""Snatch"" or maybe even ""Oceans 11""....either way, it's a big compliment.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck has certainly proved that ""Gone Baby Gone"" was not a fluke. He can actually direct a major motion picture. And not only can he do it, he does it very well. Sure the movie had some minor flaws, but nothing that takes too much away from the overall big picture. The best way i can compare it is.....it's like an east coast ""Heat"". Now, the group is not as fool proof or professional as the gang in ""Heat""......well, let's face it, you will probably never top that group in movie.....ever. But never the less, the style of film making really pulls you into each sequence, whether it be the action packed bank robbery, the emotional dialog between characters, or the intense decisions the players all must endure.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't try to WOW! you by offering a different style of bank robbery. Which is a good thing, because you really run the risk of tripping over your own two feet in the process. But i really think the major factor in this film, was the acting. Everyone came to play ball in this one........but i can also say this with complete confidence.......Ben Affleck was the best actor in this movie. Yes, i know it's hard to swallow for some of you, but he really showed us all, what he is truly capable of doing. So Mr. Affleck, let me tip my hat to you and say job well done sir. You took a lot of crap to the face, and you wiped it off, and came back strong.<br/><br/>Bottom Line......Yes, i can honestly say that this is one of the best movies of the year so far. Sure the movie gets a little sappy at the end, but it's pretty necessary. But overall, your very well entertained.<br/><br/>I read an article a few months ago about even after ""Gone Baby Gone"", people still wouldn't hire Affleck as a director. And he had to fight tooth and nail to land this deal. Well, hopefully now you can find more work buddy, because you have certainly earned it."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","127","178","19 September 2010"," Affleck's second matches realism of the first and the fine ensemble carries the rest
","Ben Affleck's second feature film as a director -- if nothing else -- proves he's no fluke. In all the ways his sincere and revealing debut ""Gone Baby Gone"" succeeds, so does ""The Town."" Both are Boston-based crime dramas that are both touchingly dramatic at times yet gripping at others. More impressive with his work on ""The Town,"" however, is that it proves he could just as easily go on to direct an action blockbuster as he could an Oscar-winning drama.<br/><br/>It starts with the cast and the performances he gets from them. In 2007, he helped Amy Ryan to a supporting actress nomination, and that's ignoring the other talents in the film such as Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan and Ed Harris. In ""The Town,"" he gets Oscar nominee Jeremy Renner in his first major film since his breakout in ""The Hurt Locker"" and Jon Hamm in his first major film since TV's ""Mad Men"" took off. He also gets a pair of up-and-comers in Rebecca Hall and ""Gossip Girl"" star Blake Lively. And that's not to mention Pete Postelthwaite and Chris Cooper. Next to ""Inception,"" it's the best ensemble cast of the year.<br/><br/>Based on the Chuck Hogan novel ""Prince of Thieves,"" the film follows a team of bank robbers from Charlestown, an area notorious for grooming the best at intercepting armored cars and taking down banks. As with ""Gone Baby Gone,"" also based on a novel (by Dennis Lehane), the city of Boston and the people and culture are as important to Affleck as the plot. He's sure to let shots of the Charlestown bridge and Fenway Park soak in amidst the ever-building pinch the main characters are in.<br/><br/>Doug MacRay (Affleck) and his buddy Jim (Renner) and a couple others pull off a bank job in the opening scene, but when it doesn't go exactly as planned, they're forced to kidnap the bank manager (Hall). To make sure she didn't see anything and can hand them on a platter to the feds (led by Jon Hamm's Special Agent Frawley), Doug trails her, only to find himself falling for her.<br/><br/>""The Town"" is one of those crime dramas/bank-job action films that while not revelatory for the genre, executes everything well and sticks to a character-driven story in order to stay meaningful. Perhaps the reason it works so well is because it floats in between the drama, never becoming too much of a guns 'n robbers flick, but also not slipping into crime melodrama for too long. Affleck's performance as MacRay acts in accordance; it's tastefully understated and he lets go of the machismo that has marred a few of his previous roles.<br/><br/>The film also has an unexpected but much appreciated sense of humor. In a mile-a-minute crime drama/thriller, you don't expect to laugh the way you will in ""The Town,"" which speaks even more to the writing and Affleck's versatility. Even if there are some plot conventions and no-surprise characters (as good as Hamm is, he's playing every other quick-witted FBI guy in films), the dialogue is sharp, the story is exciting and the way we are so easily able to see things from MacRay's perspective as the bank robber who wants out makes up for any use of convention as a crutch.<br/><br/>There's no doubt that if ""The Town"" becomes a success that studios will seek out Affleck for some more high-profile projects and it will certainly be interesting to see how he handles material not rooted in Boston sub-culture. As long as he continues to get such memorable performances out of his actors, he'll be doing things on the other end of the camera for a long time to come.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site http://moviemusereviews.com"
"Jerique","9","248","387","18 September 2010"," I'll see you again...
","I was wrong about Ben Affleck. I never believed that Affleck was ever a star. I never saw him as a director-type. I do admit I was wrong, though. Ben Affleck was truly incredible as Doug McCray, and I've never seen him work his acting at such a high level. As far as the plot of the film goes, it's very engaging. The trailer doesn't give this film justice as it's very intense and romantic at times.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner is quite intimidating and Blake Lively is sexy, Ben Affleck is gripping and the supporting cast is incredibly powerful. I think the movie was powerful and not at all predictable. I couldn't wait to see what would happen and if Doug would get away. It's such a greatly crafted movie. From writing to acting this film is wickedly astounding.<br/><br/>I thought that the sex scene was over too quickly, but it was made up with all the action. I thoroughly enjoyed the chase scenes. I thought the action sequences were well-drawn out. I loved the bank robbery scenes of the blue masks and the nun outfits. I especially liked Ben's scenes with the sledge hammer and the scene where he says, ""if I think anything might happen to her, I'm gonna kill both of you."" It's a clip from the trailer, but it's so much better when it happens in the film.<br/><br/>It's driven as an action film with drama and romance on the side. There's a few chuckles along the way, but pretty much sparse. I thought the romance was done just enough and I felt the drama was perfectly done and drastically added to the plot, as well as the tone of the film.<br/><br/>It's certainly the best heist movie I've ever seen. In comparison, if you called Inception a heist movie, this movie is a better heist movie. I really think this is the Heat of the decade. I truly believe that Affleck is in his peek of his career and this is his greatest performance, directing, writing and acting. I'm overjoyed and excited to see his next piece of work."
"Matt_Layden","8","87","130","18 September 2010"," Ben Affleck has his comeback.
","A bank robbery goes a little different than planned when one of the robbers takes a hostage. Doug (Affleck) has to duty to check up on the hostage after she is let go, to see if she knows anything about the crew. Surprise, they start dating. Can he continue his life of robbing banks and have a love life? Will his crew accept that he is with her? Will she ever find out? This is The Town. <br/><br/>Gone Baby Gone was his first directorial effort set in the city of Boston, The Town is his second. Ben obviously loves the city and if he keeps making films like these two, I'll be happy with some more Boston. I'm not going to preach about which film is better, their both different. Gone Baby Gone has more of an emotional punch with it's climax and tough decisions. The Town doesn't reach those heights, but it's a well made tense action thriller with a bit of a romance thrown in. <br/><br/>This time Affleck is in front of the camera as well. He seems to have left his pretty boy blockbuster image behind him. I'm thankful, I can only take so many Armageddons or Pearl Harbors. He's matured as an actor, this is evident by his roles as of late. State of Play and Hollywoodland are two examples. Of course he's had some fun films in between, but he's probably the best thing about those. Extract anyone? <br/><br/>For The Town he has assembled quite the cast. Jeremy Renner, who is hot off of The Hurt Locker plays his buddy with an attitude who won't think twice about pulling the trigger if you're in his way. Mad Men's Jon Hamm who is the FBI agent on their trail, his partner is Man in Black actor Titus Welliver, who was also in Gone Baby Gone. I wouldn't mind seeing more of him in films and if he's Affleck's good luck charm, all the better. Blake Lively has a small role and she does skanky a little too well. She has a thing for Affleck's character and she has a daughter, but he's obviously fallen for someone else. Rebecca Hall, who has the hard role of playing the woman who is dating her abductor. Things don't look too well for this relationship.<br/><br/>The Town shows Affleck's ability at directing action sequences. Gone Baby Gone wasn't full of gunfights and car chases, but The Town is. There are three separate heists in the film, the opening, the middle section and the climactic ending. All three are different from each other, one is in a bank, the other a truck and finally a baseball stadium. Each heist was exciting to watch and gave you those Heat moments. It's obviously the Heat was influential in the making of this film. It seems all movies that have robberies in them look to Heat. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck had a hand in writing the film, he of course won an Oscar with Matt Damon for writing Good Will Hunting. It appears he's found his footing once again and hopefully the allure of the blockbuster won't claim him once more. The Town is a successful film made for adults. It's slick, well acted and has enough thrilling moments to keep those who seek it entertained. The film centres mostly on Affleck and his new love and the heist bits are second fodder. Renner is the only one who gets some spotlight from the crew, the other two are simply background faces. The Town does it's job as a movie and Ben Affleck has found himself a new career."
"Eternality","6","100","157","29 October 2010"," The Town is a generic crime-thriller that offers nothing more than two hours of average entertainment.
","I react with some measure of disappointment to Ben Affleck's newest feature, The Town. Starring himself, Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker, 2009), and Rebecca Hall (Vicky Cristina Barcelona, 2008), this crime-heist thriller is set in Charlestown, Boston, where every other day there seems to be an armed robbery happening. Produced by Graham King, who won the Best Picture Oscar for Scorsese's The Departed (2006), which is also set in Boston, The Town is a generic crime-thriller that offers nothing more than two hours of average entertainment.<br/><br/>The film follows Affleck's character, Doug , as he faces a turning point in his life. He leads a gang of masked armed robbers but wants to quit a life of crime and change for good. His dream of a better future is spurred on by a coincidental romance with Claire (Hall), who was an unharmed victim (and a key witness) of one of his heist schemes. To complicate things, Claire does not know that Doug was involved in that heist. Worse, his partner-in-crime, James (Renner), a volatile, Joe Pesci-like madman, discovers their relationship and threatens to kill her.<br/><br/>There is a scene with these three characters together, sitting around a table at an outdoor café. This is perhaps the only moment in the film that causes a significant degree of uneasiness and tension in the viewer. Sad to say, much of the entire film does not live up to its ""thriller"" tag. As a crime-thriller, it is a borderline passable entry. That is not good enough for Affleck, whose debut directing effort Gone Baby Gone has shown that he is capable of making a noteworthy thriller.<br/><br/>The Town has reasonably well-executed action sequences, but they amount to nothing if the story is one-dimensional, and the characters underdeveloped. The romance between Doug and Claire, which I feel to be the film's central narrative thread, is clearly lacking in development, thus when the film closes with their separation, and ends with the line ""see you again, this side or the other"", it feels unconvincing.<br/><br/>The Town's standout performance is credited to Renner. He steals the screen every time he appears, but his characterization is limited to the stereotypical caricature of a bad-ass gangster. Nevertheless, Renner's performance helps to engage the viewer whenever the story fails to do so. As for Affleck's performance, there is no surprise in store for us. He is weak in acting and should stick to directing instead. But hey, I am starting to have doubts about his directing too.<br/><br/>SCORE: 6/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"
"littlengine","9","145","234","16 September 2010"," One of the best movies of the year
","Last night I saw the sneak peek of the Town. Driving for 30 minutes and waiting in the huge line to get into the theatre I thought to myself, this film better be worth it. I can tell you now, I was not disappointed. This film delivered in so many ways. Ben Affleck surprised me again with his screenplay, directing and acting, showing me that he is a force in this world. The rest of the casting was brilliant as well. Jeremy Renner was breathtaking as Gem, playing the troubled and hardened career criminal. Blake Lively stunned me as Krista. I did not think she had the skill to pull off such a character and she delivered in all of her scenes. Pete Postlewaite has some amazing dialogue and is frighteningly amazing in his role. Overall this movie absolutely delivers because of the emotional content that allows the audience to become attached to the characters, and the amazing action sequences that keep you on the edge of your seat. All in all, I must say that this is one of the best films of the year."
"gsravanth","8","84","139","17 September 2010"," Well done!!
","I had a trip to 'the town' last night and well, it is surprisingly entertaining. I still can't believe Ben Affleck can pull off everything (story, screenplay, direction, starring in a lead role) with such an ease. Three years after his debut directional venture 'Gone Baby Gone', Ben comes up with an ever better one this time.<br/><br/>A perfect combo of sold story, captivating screenplay, amazing writing, brilliant character development, good emotional content and brilliant cinematography (watch out for the shaky camera, this is the best camera work I've seen after 'Bourne' series) all together delivers an entertaining action thriller...worth a watch."

","I've wanted to see The Town for so damn long and it's well worth the wait! One of Ben Afflecks best roles/directed by! So well done in so many aspects, I love the intensity and the ridiculous amount of profanity. I'm glad it's got high ratings and award nominations even though no one won any of them. Blake Lively is gorgeous glad she's been involved in so much since The Town, same for Ben and Jeremy which is great. Very good movie all around highly recommended!"
"MovieManMenzel","8","35","57","25 January 2011"," ""The Town"" proves that Ben Affleck is not only a gifted actor, but also has a great eye for directing.
","In ""The Town,"" Ben Affleck plays Doug, the brains behind an Irish mob that robs banks and plans heists all around the Boston area. After their last huge bank job, Doug learns from his colleague, James (James Coughlin), that the female bank manager, Claire (Rebecca Hall) from the bank lives a few blocks away from where the mob meets. This is when Doug decides to investigate Claire and see what she knows about him and the other members of his crew. Along the way, Doug falls in love with Claire as the FBI is slowly investigating him and his fellow mob members to see where they are going to strike next. It's only a matter of time before the FBI comes after Doug and it's now up to Doug to decide whether it's the mob life or love....<br/><br/>I have to admit when I first saw the trailers for ""The Town"" I wasn't really that impressed with it. Sure it looked like a solid action movie about bank-robbers but the trailers just seemed to give away too much. When ""The Town"" was actually released in theaters I didn't have a chance to see it because it was released during a time where for some reason, which I am not sure of, I didn't see any films. I did however, read the reviews for the film and they were nothing but extreme positives. I tried to see the film in theaters but like most things nowadays it didn't last more than a few weeks at the local theaters. I decided to buy the flick on Blu Ray and finally sat down last night to watch it...<br/><br/>There is so much good to say about ""The Town"" but it's hard to pick where to start. The easiest place to start is with Ben Affleck so I am going to start there. As many may know already, Affleck directed, co-wrote, and starred in this film. Unlike most people, I never really disliked Affleck even though earlier in his career, he had a few stinkers (""Gigli,"" ""Daredevil,"" and ""Jersey Girl"" all come to mind) but I figured he just hasn't found the right fit yet. In ""The Town"" Ben Affleck shows off just how solid of an actor he can be with the right material. He plays the tough Irish mob leader to perfection. I am talking everything from the accent to the mannerisms; Affleck just nails it. <br/><br/>Along with the acting, his eye as a director is also rather solid. This is Affleck's second directorial endeavor and its surprisingly better than his first, which is saying a lot. ""Gone Baby Gone"" was well reviewed by critics and audience members alike and many were shocked to learn that Affleck directed that flick. ""The Town"" is rated even higher by both categories of people. Affleck knows his way behind the scenes capturing raw emotion, realistic and gritty violence, and truly showing his audience he knows how to make his cast act out their roles to near perfection. Affleck's dark and corrupt vision of Boston reminded me of something Martin Scorsese would have created. If Affleck keeps this up, you never know but he might just become the next Scorsese.<br/><br/>Besides Affleck providing a solid performance, there are several other names that deserve some recognition here. Rebecca Hall is absolutely terrific as the bank manager and Doug's love interest. It's was interesting to see a smaller name in such a big role but it worked to the films advantage. She seemed perfect to play an out of town girl, who gets involved with someone has sleazy and shady as Doug. Jon Hamm did a perfect job as the lead FBI agent. I haven't seen him in many other projects but his mannerisms fit my ideal image of a FBI agent. Jeremy Renner, who played James was just nuts! He played this whacked out character perfectly. The guy seemed to not care about anything and anyone but did it in such a believable fashion. He truly was a demented and troubled soul in the film and really acted his heart out to show that. The one person I do have to say didn't really wow me was Blake Lively. I will admit it was nice seeing her play a really dark and gritty role, which is out of her normal character but she wasn't convincing to me. I just had a hard time believing her as a trashy person. As a whore, I can see but the white trash thing didn't work for me. I am sure many would disagree but trashy I couldn't picture. <br/><br/>All in all, I really don't have anything bad to say about ""The Town."" It was a solid film all around. The pacing was perfect, the acting was solid, and the direction was superb. This movie may soon be placed in the same category where such movies like ""Goodfellas,"" ""Casino,"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" now sit. It will not shock me if this film holds up over the years and becomes known as a cult classic. The film may be too violent or gritty for some but for those who like raw and gritty dramas will probably be adding ""The Town"" to their favorites list. <br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""The Town"" is a solid 8 out of 10. A ton of kudos points are in order for Affleck and the entire cast of this film."
"dierregi","5","37","61","4 October 2010"," Glorified gangsters rule
","This movie follows a well-traveled road: weary criminal wants to change life and meet a girl who might push him in the right direction. Obviously, only a ""last job"" stands in the way to living happily ever after.<br/><br/>So far, nothing unusual. However, despite the fact that the plot did not seem overwhelming innovative, I was quite please with part I and II, but my appreciation dropped during part III. There are a few minor twists in part I and II. For instance, the girl is linked to a crime scene and not so innocent. The criminal is an ex-hero of some sort, but his father is a convict. Again, nothing wildly original here, but enough action and suspense to keep the public interested.<br/><br/>That is, if you did not see ""Heat"" and do not mind the rip-off scenes and general feeling of the plot.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, part III turns a likely story into the realm of science fiction. How is it possible that four men can survive the attack of an army of Special Forces? Aren't those Special Forces trained to aim and shoot, rather than just shoot randomly and hit everything around the villains, except the villains themselves? <br/><br/>Ben Affleck is not Michael Mann and he could not pull off a decent ending for his movie. While ""Heat"" manages to retain a certain atmosphere, ""The Town"" crumbles miserably at the end. Besides not being in the Michael Mann league of directors, Affleck is not even such a great actor, remaining expressionless and dull in all his scenes. Luckily, Jeremy Renner has better acting skills and creates some tension with his crazy, out-of-control, character. Jon Hamm is also good, as a straight FBI man."
"CarsonTrent","2","166","314","17 September 2010"," Get off your high horses, guys...
","I've been reading a couple of reviews here, and was surprised, granted out of only 10 comments written to this moment, to see raving blabber on ""most complex heist movie since..."", or ""Ben has proved that x movie was not a fluke"", and even references to ""Good Will .."", and one even mentioned Oscar nominations. Obviously some of these people have been born only 10 years ago, or else they would recognize the botched rip-off of such heist movies as Point Break 1991, or more recently Heat 1995(which is a remake of a lesser version of itself LA Takedown 1989), to name but the most shamelessly plagiarized ones. So Ben didn't really dig too deep for inspiration. I will call it inspiration although a plagiarism law suit wouldn't come as a surprise to me in relation to The Town. I guess Ben saw himself as kind of a Mc Cauley-de Niro in Heat, Hamm would be Hanna-Pacino, Jeremy Renner a kind of Tom Sizemore-Cheritto, and Rebecca Hall-Amy Brenneman-Eady. I especially liked the phone conversation between Ben and her where she stands at the window with all police waiting and she gives him the sign, wink!,that she's under surveillance and he should split...(to use a bit of heist flick lingo, myself)Does it remind anyone of the scene where Ashley Judd gives Val Kilmer the sign that he should disappear, after the heist gone wrong? I guess not, for the time being.<br/><br/>I won't even start with the gratuitous work-out scene where Ben shows us his six-pack...talk about gratuitous. Also, there are some f-word written to a small piece of paper jokes, the guys in the last row will laugh at for sure. Real brain puzzlers. Acting, on Ben's part is no surprise. He walks around frown-mouthed and thinks he is in character. Pityfull. Hamm does not have another persona outside Mad Men, and should stick to TV, in my opinion. Direction-I especially enjoyed the shaky close-up camera work during the action sequences, to create dynamism, no doubt Ben must have thought to himself. <br/><br/>Altogether a plot-holes filled rip-off, and not a good one at that, either.<br/><br/>Oh, and one more thing, why again did Bendoug have to go poking around Claire? To find out how much she knows? After the FBI had already questioned her? So he can attract more attention to himself? Well I guess by asking these questions the whole plot kind of unravels like a poorly woven 5 bucks sweater when you pull a loose thread..."

By choosing Charlestown (now a yuppier ""Chuckville"") as its base, the North End for a car chase and the bowels of old (1912) Fenway for the climactic ""last job"", he is at home in his surrounding. Anyone who has walked thru the North End, stopped for a ""slice"" and checked out the streets knows that's the last place you'd ever expect a high speed car chase. Ben's camera work and editing makes it a thrilling, crash filled event. Pity the poor stunt drivers who has to careen around those corners! <br/><br/>So, lots of reviews tell the plot points. I'm just writing to voice my opinion on the entertainment value and that is very high. Though its over two hours, it never drags. Ben gives each of his excellent cast a very strong scene or two. Chris Cooper gets 5 minutes of screen time and is excellent. Rebecca Hall, the prettiest average looking person you'll see, is terrific. Jeremy Renner is calm and explosive, at the same time. Jon Hamm gets to look cool, be cool and stay cool. He is a different FBI than we are used to. Smart, but with a meaner edge. And, for me, last but not least, Blake Lively. I hear she's a glamor girl on TV and red carpets, but here she absorbs the role of broken, damaged and desperate, with a glob of mascara in each eye. One review I read said ""she's no Amy Ryan"" (see:""Gone Baby Gone""). Maybe not, but that's pretty unfair and she is well up to the task here. <br/><br/>So, action, anti-heroes to ""root"" for and Fenway Park (a diamond on the outside, pretty scruffy underneath)!! What's not to like? But I've got to nit-pick one thing. Does everyone in the world have a 3 day beard??? FBI guys go to the office unshaven for days? Ben even has some uneven moments where he goes from 2 to 1 to 3 day beards in the same caper! Hey, what can you do, its not one big long shoot, but it was a lot of stubble!"
"shanpanjwani","10","29","50","13 September 2010"," An exceptionally thrilling, well made crime drama that really works.
","I got a chance to see this film at a free screening earlier tonight, and all I could say was, nothing. My mind was sufficiently blown away, and mixed emotions coursed through my body. This film honestly lived up to its hype, a feat so few films have achieved recently besides Avatar and Inception. As we all know, the plot revolves around Doug MacRay(Affleck), the ringleader of a group of bank robbers. In the first scene of the film, he and his men rob a bank, and kidnap the bank manager Claire(Hall). They let her go free, but she remains traumatized from that moment on, with her only clue as to the identity of her kidnappers being a tattoo behind James Coughlin's(Renner) neck. She is visibly shaken when inquired by Special Agent Adam Frawley(Hamm), and ultimately breaks down in front of Macray at the laundromat, where he comforts her, while falling for her as time goes on. Ultimately, the plot thickens, as MacRay goes through his tumultuous relationships with Coughlin and his sister(Lively), his own father, and Claire, while continuing heists and evading agent Frawley. It is a rather well developed plot, albeit not completely original, but that is far from the movie's shining points. First off, the main characters are very well developed. Renner does a great job as Affleck's best friend and second in command. He reflects his role as flawlessly as any actor can. Rebecca Hall displays a fine performance, showing us yet again how great an actress she can be. Affleck, who has been trashed by many over the years, had been slowly regaining a good reputation amongst the masses, receiving good reviews for his performances as a supporting actor in Extract and State of play. As the main character in The Town, he has managed to show us that his acting and directing skills have not diminished much from the time he gifted us with Good Will Hunting. Even Blake Lively delivers a mature performance, proving that she has indeed fruited into a good actress since her days in Gossip Girl. The best performance, however, was from none other than Mr Don Draper himself, John Hamm. He proves to us that his acting is better than just television-worthy. His luring charisma and brutally honest dialogue is good enough to get him an Oscar nod for sure, and may likely do for him and Mad Men what 40-Year Old Virgin did for Steve Carrell and The Office: Get a great show the audience it truly deserves, and turn the actor into a Hollywood star. There are two non-graphic sex scenes(one involving Hall and Affleck, the with Lively and Affleck), and only three heist scenes(the opening bank scene, the hilarious and action packed heist involving the nun masks seen in trailers, and the concluding Fenway Park heist). The action scenes are few and limited, but are all great, especially the one at Fenway park. However, the heist scenes, as well as other violent scenes, regardless of their great impact and sheer brilliance, come remotely close to the brutality of the masterful dialogue of this gem of a film. Each main character gets their own fair share, but the two that stab our hearts with the most powerful thrusts are the ones from Peter Postlethwaite, who plays Affleck's boss, and Chris Cooper in his lone scene in jail as Affleck's father. Both have to do with the way his mother ""left"" him. Though I have already spoiled many aspects of the film, I cannot spoil those two dialogue sequences. They are both equally cringe-inducing and tear jerking, and you'll easily be able to identify them, not only through your ears, but by the pain your heart goes through. The dialogue is like a SAW trap: It is a hammer that will pound you relentlessly until your are as close to keeling over as possible. The film may sound very grim, which it is, but there is loads of humor in it, too. Most of it is dark and unexpected, due to the irony of the situations, such as some of Hamm and Lively's confrontations, Affleck's conversation with Hall at the laundromat about her kidnappers, the scene where Affleck and Renner talk about Hall, and when they beat up her tormentors and their brief dialogue before that. The funniest moment was by far and away the moment where the robbers, dressed in nun masks, are seen changing and driving by a police officer after the robbery, when he stares at them and does nothing. It should be noted that this film isn't for minors, due to its heavy use of the f-word, amongst other things. It isn't the love story that most have rendered it to be. The romance is yet another subplot to the drama and thrills this movie induces amongst its viewers. This film can definitely clinch at least a few Oscar noms for screenplay, writing, supporting actor, director, film, and should win for screenplay, due to the sharp dialogue which wickedly cuts into you, seeps into you, and rips you to shreds. A perfect film. 10/10 <br/><br/>For those of you who want to write your own review for the film, here are a few suggested summaries:Exceptional; Affleck's Redemption; the best film of the year."
"pottz1","1","69","131","11 October 2010"," Wait, didn't I already see this?
","Typically movies do not make enough of an impact on me that I feel I need to comment. ""The Town"" however is certainly one of those movies. How a movie like this can be made without a ton of money being exchanged between the writers of the original work and the plagiarists who reconstituted a couple of old script's is beyond me? This movie simply combined the plots of two previous made Hollywood movies entitled ""Heat"" and ""Point Break"", packaged it in a different city, Boston instead of Los Angeles, and added the dreadful acting and directing of Ben Affleck. I just wish I could get my money back for having paid for this awful movie. After all, I've already see ""Heat"" and ""Point Break"" dozens of times and like them both. I'm not going to rehash the storyline but I do want to point out a few things that particularly annoyed me about this movie. The first is the part is the rip from ""Shawshank Redemption"" where she dug up the bag of money. This scene worked so magnificently in Shawshank because you desperately wanted the characters to end up in Zihuatanejo as free men. When the female character in ""The Town"" dug up the bag, I was hoping she would give it to the authorities so they could expedite the process of tracking down the thug murderer who buried it there and throw him in the electric chair. In other words, I didn't find any of characters sympathetic, compelling or likable. Second, are we really supposed to believe a successful, single, very good looking woman would fall for an uneducated, ruthless killer thug from Southie? Really? Finally, in this day and age of ""CSI"" and ""BONES"", are we supposed to believe Affleck's character is just going to lay low in Florida for the rest of his life? That final scene was almost as ridiculous as the part where he was working out. What was that? Was that some sort of dare between he and his Hollywood buddies to have a comparatively and equally lame scene like the one in ""Top Gun"" when they are playing volleyball? If you have not seen this movie yet, save yourself the time and money."
"franksherman","5","32","58","25 September 2010"," Hey wasn't this called Heat before?
","OK I was personally a big fan of Gone Baby Gone. This movie was exactly like the movie Heat but instead of Al Pacino we have Jack Hamm and instead of Deniro we have the Affleck. This obviously is a huge step down. I mean it wasn't terrible but it surely wasn't great. In this movie(and come to think of it all Affleck starring roles) Ben has as much depth as a kiddie pool. He has the exact same facial expression during the entire film. The action scenes were good but that really didn't save it. And also not as many good actors. We are substituting Tom Sizemore for some fat Irish guy. Come on Think what you like but I know if you wanna see how this movie should have been see Heat."
"searchanddestroy-1","Null","22","39","18 September 2010"," Sort of poor man's HEAT
","I am disappointed by this film. I'll be straight, I expected better than that. I don't speak of the film it self, the story, characters, actor's directing, but by the fact that this screenplay is not faithful to the original novel. I read it a couple of years ago, and the movie should have been better than that. Especially concerning the very ending. The book's one is far better. I won't spoil it any further, especially for the IMDb readers who already know some of my comments and who also know what I love and what I hate in a movie. What kind of ending I prefer, for instance. <br/><br/>But, except for that, it's a pretty effective action packed thriller, with powerful performances from the actors. We, of course, think of HEAT and sometimes of POINT BREAK. An old fashioned topic about gangsters and code of honour. <br/><br/>A good movie for most of the audiences, but I expected more than that, only because of my taste.<br/><br/>One more thing: When an armored truck - weighing more than three or four tons - is hitting a car or a wall, I don't think it rises from the ground before jumping in the air; especially if it has not reached a high speed. <br/><br/>Period."
"seymourblack-1","9","6","8","1 May 2013"," Crime & Romance In Charlestown
","""The Town"" is a real crowd-pleaser in which some exciting action sequences are complemented by quieter passages during which a romance develops in very unusual circumstances. There's so much intensity about everything that happens on screen that there's never a point at which the audience's interest is allowed to flag, even for the briefest moment and the characters are so well developed that they add real interest and substance to everything that happens.<br/><br/>The story is based on Chuck Hogan's novel ""Prince Of Thieves"" and is set in Charlestown, a neighbourhood of Boston which is reputed to be the bank robbery capital of America. This is a tough area in which the skills associated with bank robbery are frequently passed down from father to son and where broken homes are common. One of the real strengths of ""The Town"" is the powerful and authentic way in which this neighbourhood and its people are depicted. This is done so successfully that the atmosphere of the place and the values of its residents make an indelible impression on everyone who sees the movie.<br/><br/>Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) is a typical product of Charlestown. He leads a gang of four friends that rob banks and armoured cars and like his father before him, works for local crime boss Fergie Colm (Pete Postlethwaite). Doug's crew have remained successful because of their professionalism. All their jobs are well planned and great care is always taken to ensure that no evidence is left which could link them to their robberies.<br/><br/>Things start to become complicated for Doug after a robbery during which his gang takes bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage. She's subsequently released unharmed but they start to become concerned about whether she can identify them. Their concern is heightened when they discover that she lives just a few blocks away and gang member Jem Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) wants to keep tabs on her. Jem's a particularly violent character with a short fuse and so Doug volunteers to do the job himself.<br/><br/>Doug meets Claire in a Laundromat and the couple are immediately attracted to each other. It soon becomes clear that Claire would be able to identify Jem because she caught sight of a very distinctive tattoo on his neck. Doug convinces her that it would be dangerous for her to pass this information on to the FBI and their relationship continues to grow steadily. Doug becomes increasingly disillusioned with his way of life and wants to leave it and Charlestown behind. He soon learns, however, that escape is almost impossible and to make matters worse, an FBI team led by Special Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) is closing in.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck, in only his second film as a director, does a great job in making the action sequences exciting and fascinating to watch and also takes great care in the way that he enables the characters to develop. There's a great deal of tension in ""The Town"". For example, during Doug and Claire's conversations, when she knows nothing about his involvement in her abduction and then on later occasions with Jem, Fergie and ex-girlfriend Krista (Blake Lively) when Doug decides he wants to leave Charlestown.<br/><br/>In a movie full of good performances, Jeremy Renner excels as the volatile Jem who seems to become increasingly unpredictable as the story progresses and Rebecca Hall stands out in her role as the only totally sympathetic character in the cast. Chris Cooper and Pete Postlethwaite are exceptional in their relatively small parts and Jon Hamm is very determined as the FBI agent who's ready to resort to any measure in order to hunt the gang down."
"friendoffilm","1","29","55","29 March 2014"," Ben Affleck's ""The Town""-so bad that it's good:
","""The Town"" is an overrated, hyped-up, cheesy piece of junk, imo. It's more like a feature- length, made-for-TV soap opera than a regular movie, and is very cartoonlike with a poor to mediocre cast. None of the characters are believable except for Jeremy Renner's role as the crazy ""Jem"" Coughlin, and Jon Hamm as Adam Frawley, the FBI Agt. who's been assigned to bring Doug MacRay and his men to their knees and to prison, once and for all. <br/><br/>The beginning of ""The Town"", with the opening bank heist and the aerial/on the ground shots of Charlestown and Boston, generally, was interesting, but it went from being okay to being just plain awful in a matter of minutes. <br/><br/>The Town conveys the message to me, personally, that people don't have to be held accountable for what they do, and, as long as they get what they want, anything goes. A strong message that predatory behavior such as stalking a person, and associating with a person who shoots, kills and beats people within inches of their life is okay is also evident in The Town. <br/><br/>So is the message that a woman who's very princess-like, demure and ""normal"" and steals the heart of the de-facto leader of a local gang of thieving thugs can be petted and praised as a good lass, regardless of what she does, and that being an accessory to someone's criminal activity and making dupes out of law enforcement people who are trying to do their assigned jobs of bringing criminals to justice is okay. <br/><br/>The Town also indicates the continued ""dumbing down"" of America and the world; the fact that such a film not only can be mad, but to have such glowing reviews from most people is a strong reflection of that."
"youaresquishy","5","38","76","19 September 2010"," Nothing special, but not terrible
","I thought this movie was an acceptable way to pass some time, but overall was nothing terribly special. The few action scenes were pretty interesting and creative though--it was the parts in between that I didn't really enjoy much. If the entire movie was as good as the action sequences, it definitely would've received a 6 or 7 from me. <br/><br/>I don't think Ben Affleck is an especially good actor, and I thought he wasn't especially good in this. I didn't believe in his character much-- he didn't really seem like a bad guy to me. I didn't think there was much chemistry between him and his character's love interest. I didn't think Jon Hamm was all that good either--he didn't really seem like an FBI guy to me. I thought Jeremy Renner stole the show. Chris Cooper was excellent, as usual, but had only a small role. I thought Rebecca Hall was pretty good. <br/><br/>Certain portions of the plot were a little silly, but I don't want to spoil anything. Overall, I guess if you're really big on crime movies, you should probably see this just for the crime parts, because they are pretty cool. As a whole, however, this isn't particularly good or particularly bad."
"RebelYell_659","9","27","52","19 September 2010"," Worth investing a little time
","This movie is worth taking the time to go see. As a former cop and detective the way the FBI works on the suspects is very convincing. The fact that the crew was able to continue working with the cops knowing so much tended to keep this a solid escapism film.<br/><br/>The plot and sub plot worked well and reminded me of a nice pulp fiction story. I don't want to spoil any of the film so suffice it to say that it is worth going to see.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner from the Hurt Locker was stellar, Jon Hamm pulled it off I never thought he was Don Draper, Rebeca Hall, and Ben Affleck were also good. The supporting cast did not disappoint either.<br/><br/>The cast made this movie work. I can honestly say I liked all the characters. Blake Lively acted just like her character would have in real life. She is the true victim of her environment and there was no redemption for her."
"airguitar57","10","10","16","27 September 2010"," Best heist film since Heat
","There seems to be two camps when it comes to Ben Affleck, those that adore him and those that abhor him. No matter which camp you belong to it is hard to deny that his directorial debut Gone Baby Gone was anything less than terrific. So now comes the moment of truth, is he going to succumb to the sophomore slump or will he cement his status as a talented director? With The Town, Affleck takes on triple duty, as writer, director and lead actor and manages to deliver on every front.<br/><br/>Within the blue-collar town of Charlestown, Massachusetts lays a legend of bank robbery. Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) leads a team of friends and professional bank robbers. During the robbery of a Cambridge bank, the team takes bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage. Following the release of Claire the team discovers that she lives nearby. Hothead Jem Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) offers to confront Claire in order to figure out what she knows. Fearing Jem's penchant for trouble, Doug insists that he approach Claire. After revealing her hostage experience to Doug, the two develop an intimate relationship. Having tired of his life of crime, Doug decides that he wants a change. Unfortunately, getting out won't be easy, he must first face the investigations of FBI agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) and the demands of boss Fergie Colm (Peter Postlethwaite).<br/><br/>There wasn't a bit about this film that I didn't like. The cast is magnificent. With any film set in the Boston area you run the risk of the actor resting too hard on what he thinks is a Boston accent rather than an accurate one. Having been a Boston resident for five years, I believe that I can spot this difference. I can say with all honesty and without reservations that this film nails that accent. Even Blake Lively, easily the weakest link, seems genuine. Obviously, the performance of the actors isn't entirely based on the Boston accent, but I would be remiss if I didn't comment on it.<br/><br/>As for the actual acting, it is damn good. This may be Affleck's most complex and best performance of his career. He is controlled and precise in his actions. In every way, Affleck completely becomes MacRay, and that is saying something. I think it speaks to the quality of the actors when you root for a criminal and against an FBI agent. I have seen some reviewers bashing Blake Lively's performance but I'm going to cry foul. She is easily the weakest actor of the big names involved, but let's look at who she's swimming with, Rebecca Hall, Affleck, Jon Hamm and Jeremy Renner, all working at the top of their game. Lively is completely convincing, in fact I know that I've seen girls just like her character in the sketchier areas of Boston, with the obvious addendum that they aren't nearly as attractive. This film could have easily remained a simple heist film, but the actors involved elevate it to something darker and with many more layers.<br/><br/>The action is fantastic. Every heist is orchestrated beautifully. The audience is brought to the edge of its seat and it is often difficult to figure out just who you are rooting for. Some recent action films, especially following The Bourne Supremacy, have relied on the use of ""shaky"" hand-held cameras that when used inappropriately make the action difficult to follow. Affleck not only puts away the shaky camera but also shows that a nice steady shot can work even better. The action is always coherent and riveting. It was also nice to see a Boston film that was most definitely shot in Boston. A robbery that takes place in the North End, an area littered with narrow streets, benefits from this attention to detail and loyalty to the area. Affleck doesn't seem content in allowing his film to fade away in the pantheon of heist films; rather he crafts a film that will be remembered as one of the best.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck is one talented guy. Proving that Gone Baby Gone wasn't just a fluke, he returns to the director's chair to produce a film that is one of the year's best. Every part of the film is fantastic. Every member of the cast, yes even Blake Lively, gives everything they have giving performances that are genuine and not bogged down by inauthentic Boston accents. The action is nearly musical in its execution. Each action set piece is gripping and does not let down your expectations. The Town is a well-crafted and complex character study that also happens to be the best heist film since Heat.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

"gigan-92","10","4","5","20 March 2012"," Definitely Watch the Director's Cut
","I just wanted to say that on its own, the theatrical cut is a pretty damn awesome movie. Watching the extended cut is 10X even better. Simply put you get to see even more of the fascinating characters. Jon Hamm, while definitely playing the asshole, does quite nicely Rebecca Hall and Blake Lively are pretty awesome, the two creating a nice foil. And Peter Postlethwaite, rest his soul, is awesome in it. Jeremy Renner will go down in history as one of cinema's greatest bad-asses, that's for sure. And Ben Affleck, what can be said of Affleck? He not only starred in this, but co-wrote the screenplay and directed it. An aspiring Clint Eastwood figure? While films such as this are a great start, he has a long way to go before creating such a legacy, and he I hope he continues to make more great movies.<br/><br/>Regardless, this crime thriller is definitely a masterpiece. Its heart-pounding action is backed up with an excellent plot and bold characters. Credit is also due to the original source material, Chuck Hogan's novel ""Prince of Thieves"" (the author who has gone onto write the Strain trilogy with Guillermo del Toro). The score was also pretty great, by Harry Gregson-Willaims and David Buckley.<br/><br/>Sure to become a classic."
"mowskwozz","2","21","40","27 November 2012"," Boring
","Did I watch the same movie as most reviewers? Is it that people are expecting too little from mediocre actor so they are ecstatic when he doesn't do complete rubbish? Since The Town is on most bank robbery movie lists I should say that it is not a bank robbery movie, and it's not a thriller. It's a weak love story with bad Ben Affleck's performance packed in story about robbery and Charlestown, the neighborhood with high number of robbers. ""My dad was one, and so am I"" kind of thing. It's a movie about nothing with too much things going on. The same things that couple of minutes later are completely forgotten and the story goes on like some of them never happened. It has some great masks (different one for every occasion), but it seems that masks are there to make people pay no attention to weak action sequences and lack of tension. And even if we forget all about action and tension, we are left with bad love story. The movie is also too long and it seems that Ben got lost somewhere towards the end. <br/><br/>It is just bad and boring.<br/><br/>And let's be clear... the guy is robber, he's pointing guns at people he should be in jail and not in some idyllic house on a lake. <br/><br/>I gave it a 2/10 just because I've seen worst."
"YouFightLikeACow","7","24","47","13 September 2010"," Ben Affleck CAN direct
","Ben Affleck has proved he is good at directing movies. That's not to say this was a mindblowing movie, it was a very competent, well acted, well directed movie with some humor at moments and some intense action sequences.<br/><br/>The movie follows Doug MacRay, a bank robber who pursues a woman he and his crew had just abducted to try and befriend her. Relationships get complicated and the usual drama follows. Ben Affleck can be surprisingly affecting in his roles - he is a rather likable character despite being a crook. His other crew are not so memorable - Jeremy Renner is an interesting portrait, but not something we have not seen before. He is the typical bad ass who eventually steps beyond his bounds. Honestly, I don't even remember or care about the other two guys.<br/><br/>The woman, played by Rebecca Hall, does a solid job as Claire Keesey. We see her hardships, her torment and anguish (albeit a bit too much). The chemistry between her and Affleck is not really there, but hey, it's basically an action movie. Blake Lively seems out of place as MacRay's former lover. Jon Hamm plays a standard role as the hard driving cop who will stop at nothing. And Affleck's bosses are funny but not really memorable.<br/><br/>Affleck also directed The Town, and he seem to has a thing for the action camera. Most action sequences are fast paced and suspenseful (though EVERY bank heist reminds me of The Dark Knight, but that's just my geeky self). A problem I had with the heists was similar to what a friend pointed out: the robbers prepared hardcore for each heist, with huge guns and armor. My question is: why? Heists are supposed to be quiet, usually, and guns are used for crowd control and backup. EVERY heist in this movie went a little bit wrong. These crooks are either real amateurs or they suck at their jobs.<br/><br/>The plot was stretched a bit thin, and some of the motivations of the characters baffled me a bit. Some things were just unclear with the characters, and a lot of loose ends were not tied up. However, it's not really a big deal to me, as I enjoyed watching it and I took it for what it was: an action film with a little heart.<br/><br/>I saw this at a free screening: I'm not sure if I'd pay to see it. It's pretty standard fare; however, it's rather well-directed standard fare, if that makes any sense.<br/><br/>7/10"
"thesar-2","3","20","39","12 December 2010"," Get Outta Town
","Get Outta Town Let me start withI wasn't a big fan of The Departed, and I liked American Gangster a whole lot less. Both seemed to try and grab the Oscar, and hard, e.g. trying too desperately. Granted, Departed won it (thanks Jack) but I generally don't favor movie's only motive is for awards. (Or actors, such as Denzel Washington.)<br/><br/>That all said, I'm not sure The Town was set out to grab any awards, though I'm sure with 100 best picture nominations (okay, 10, but still) it's sure to get a nod. That's not saying too much since 2010 basically sucked and I would be racking my brain to come up with 10, let alone 100.<br/><br/>And yet, The Town SHOULDN'T win anything. In fact, the only nominations I would approve (but not win, mind you) would be: Best Cinematography and Best Supporting Actor for the always impressive Jeremy Renner. The rest of the cast, or talent, barely would pass an audition, let alone get any consideration.<br/><br/>The worst part of the movie was the over-used and well-done tired plot, including the infamous LIE subplot involving the laughable Ben Affleck and his honey, Rebecca Hall. The story, co-written by the lesser Affleck (Casey is just so much better) isn't anything new and brought little to the table.<br/><br/>OK, so we have ho-hum and very little depth bank robbers who wear disguises and/or forget to shave – shocking trickery! – who pull off their latest but must take (and eventually release) the manager, Claire (Hall) and in their suspicion, lead robber, Doug (Affleck) follows her once the ""heat"" is over. Naturally and completely unsurprisingly, he falls for her.<br/><br/>I'll pause a momenthere's where I prove how bad Affleck was in both acting and (co-)writing: he asks her a dozen or more questions on what she remembers or who's been talking to her. Maybe I'm being cynical, but she's pretty dumb, naïve, scared or just a plain idiot not to see why he's asking so many questions.<br/><br/>Fine, not everyone can put two'n'two together, but you'll have to get ahead of that plot hole to move on to the others.<br/><br/>The FBI knows whodunit, but they need to prove it or get a witness tonail them! Sorry, needed to put emphasis on that, because the movie asks, er, begs, you to have some urgency even though we know everyone's on the same page. Oh, and when Doug's being interrogated, let me say this: He ain't Keyser Söze. Hell, he ain't even the Joker. It would be more interesting to see the interrogation scene from Marathon Man, and if only I could play the dentist hovering over Affleck asking ""Do you think you're safe?""<br/><br/>Let's move on to the other obvious and clichéd plot of DougieBoy wanting to do his ""last robbery"" and start fresh inin Florida? Anyways, if they brought anything to the table that hasn't been done before in the countless ""I'm getting too old for this sh|t"" retirement bits (SEE: Lethal Weapon One, Two, Three), I might have given a sh|t myself.<br/><br/>I'm not going to spoil anything else, but to say: they try to unsuccessfully sneak some character depth to the story (The FBI agent that won't give up!, The Mother & Child who also want out!, The Mob won't let him go!) The positives about the film was, again, Renner, who wasn't on top of his game – nowhere near, but still good to watch and the striking, though formulaic views of Boston. Honestly, I don't mind scenic aerial shots of cities, or on the ground and in unfamiliar neighborhoods of cities. So, I did like how the film was shot.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it was always ended with a close up of the Dudley-Do-Wrong mug of Affleck. Buzz kill.<br/><br/>You have no one to root for. No depth of the characters other than what's spoken and not shown. You have nothing new under the Boston sun. And you have no reason to subject yourself with dozens of other already made, already better film versions of The Town. SKIP!"

","My desire to see this came from the cast, as I've followed their careers for quite some time, namely Affleck, Renner and Lively. I was not disappointed. <br/><br/>Now I'm not going to pretend that I'm an expert in the area of heist movies, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film. No comparisons to others, but as its own movie it does pretty well. I mean there were some moments where I wasn't satisfied, particularly with the ending, but overall it was a great movie.<br/><br/>The action is great, the plot has good pacing but main strength is with the cast.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck has proved yet again that he's a director, a great writer and an actor who's worth his salt. Many have reviewed Affleck's performance as 'wooden' and 'filled with nothing but frowning', but I think he did a wonderful job. His delivery was appropriate, his expressions were on point and I think that if you can play a criminal and a killer and still make the audience root for you in the end, then you've done a good job. And I inexplicably found myself rooting for MacCray by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Blake Lively continues to impress me as she sheds her ""Gossip Girl"" fame and battles with being taken seriously as an actress of real standing. Her character ""Krista"" was terribly two-dimensional and just like most other stereotypical ""skanky"" characters that are portrayed in movies, but she did it well and I have no complaints, except for maybe the fact that her laugh is a little childlike and didn't really fit with her character, but that is very minor. <br/><br/>Jeremy Renner was, in a word, exquisite. He was breathtakingly haunting as he echoes his previous acclaimed role in ""The Hurt Locker"", with a powerful performance as Jem, a ruthless, no-nonsense criminal who solves his problems with bullets and no mercy. He stole the show for sure, creating a complex, provocative performance out of a character who lacks development. He really was spectacular. <br/><br/>Buy this movie on DVD or stream it wherever you can because you will have a good time watching it."

","I remember laughing out loud at the aberration of a movie that was ""Pearl Harbour"" and in particular Ben Affleck's ""Kinda, sorta, coulda..."" chat-up line and haven't even seen ""Gigli"", but it's fair to say that with this and his earlier effort ""Gone Baby Gone"" he's certainly found his métier, not only in front, but also behind the camera.<br/><br/>""The Town"" (a poor title for a fast-moving film like this) is a gritty, contemporary heist thriller, with believable characters in largely realistic situations and with credible motives for their actions. I say largely, because you do have to get over the improbability of Affleck's serial armed robber's affair with accidental hostage Rebecca Hall and a series of thrilling but unbelievable car-chases and shoot-outs.<br/><br/>That said, the latter are delivered with skill and precision, while the attempts at character development are rewarded by the depth they add to the plot line. The acting too is of a high standard, with, to be honest, most of the supporting participants outshining the headline names of Affleck, Hall and ""Mad Men's"" Jon Hamm, in particular Jeremy Renner as Affleck's trigger-happy right-hand man and the late Pete Postlethwaite as the ruthless Irish overseer of the gang's criminal operations.<br/><br/>I visited Boston once over 15 years ago whch included taking in a baseball match at the venerable Fenway Park venue and enjoyed seeing this and other locations again, but better yet was just to chance to watch that rarity, a gripping and involving contemporary crime thriller, which this certainly was."
"justinwilliams367","10","5","7","23 April 2012"," My Review: The Town
","I was kind of biased when it came to Ben Affleck because he had some good movies and some bad movies. But he kept his cool as a writer/director. When he made Gone Baby Gone, it became one of those movies you would love to see again & again. And he proves that once again with The Town. In the film set in Boston, Affleck plays Doug Mcray, leader of a four-man robbery crew who hits banks and armored cars. Joining him is Jon Hamm from TV's Mad Men playing the FBI agent determined to bring the crew to justice. Jeremy Renner from The Hurt Locker playing Doug's best friend who's a little bit frightening, The gorgeous Rebecca Hall playing the bank manager connected to one of Doug's heists and his love interest. And Blake Lively from TV's Gossip Girl playing Renner's sister and Affleck's ex. I loved the chemistry between Affleck and Hall because they connected really well. But Hamm surprised me most and I don't watch Mad Men. Overall good movie, good cast, and if you haven't seen it, my suggestion: go to Best Buy, find this on DVD or Blu-Ray, and watch it. It's really good."

","Throw in a high budget, a charming badass, an attractive girlfriend, and what do you have? A Generic Hollywood blockbuster.<br/><br/>Before I even get started on the script I would like to comment on the acting. Ben Affleck is completely unbelievable as a badguy. He is too middle class to act tough, incredible charming and thoughtful, to the point that you think the movie is a romance. He falls in love at first sight and sacrifices everything for this girl who he has 'traumatized' meanwhile he is more than happy to spray his submachine gun all over the town. Oh and did I mention he had childhood problems? Did I have to? The movie is so incredibly cliché that you just want to laugh out loud. Rebecca Hall played her part well, is it really that hard to stand around looking pretty and feeling vulnerable. Blake Lively was a disgrace. Despite having absolutely no character depth (admittedly not her fault) her accent was abysmal to the point of being unaudible for most of the movie. She needs to stick to Gossip Girl, where the role is incredibly easy and her looks get her through the episodes due the abundance of gawking twelve-year-olds.Jon Hamm star of Madmen is yet another completely miscast character. While I am usually impressed by his acting, he did not pull off even slightly the badass detective role.<br/><br/>Basically this movie was based on the premise that if enough good looking people were thrown in it would make a lot of money. The performances however were not all bad, Jeremy Renner was powerful, and once again I was impressed by his ability, which was of course proved in 'The Hurt Locker'<br/><br/>The script was weak and predictable, most characters had no depth (for example the other two crew members of the supposedly four man team) and frankly just boring save one or two good lines. <br/><br/>I wont go deep into the plot holes because im sure someone will have covered that elsewhere, but I will note briefly that there are many of them. I don't usually take such negative stances on movies but I felt that this movie is completely undeserving of its rating."
"CrazyDonk","4","14","26","8 January 2011"," A Well Polished Turd
","Many people seem to love Ben Affleck's The Town. I guess I shouldn't be too surprised by that. I mean we do live in a society in which almost all our popular culture is fake. Fake ""reality"" shows flood our current television channels, the music business is full of fake posturing and overly manufactured acts, and Hollywood keeps filming the same old stories with bad writing, big star names, and lots of glitzy glamour. All flash and very little substance seems to be the trend of the day, or should I say decade? Well The Town is not much different, it too is a well polished turd. A turd that lacks pretty much any originality at all. The dialogue and overall quality of writing in this film should easily be surpassed by the average tenth grade student if challenged. Seriously, is there a single stretch of 10 minutes in this film that actually seemed like it could, or might be able to happen in reality? I've been around. From the big house to the white picket fence to the bad side of town and I'm telling you that no, there is nothing real. Nor is there anything meaningful here. This basically seemed like a badly written cartoon made into an even worse film. None of the characters who are given time to develop are anything more than cartoon like. Has the majority of people these days lost all perspective on what is realistic, and what is a total sham? It certainly seems so."

"Turfseer","6","6","9","15 March 2011"," Entertaining heist flick that wears out its welcome at the denouement
","'The Town' refers to 'Charlestown', once a predominantly Irish-Catholic section of Boston known for criminal activity. Crime apparently reached its apotheosis around 1995 in Charlestown when a series of bank robberies were committed. In more recent times, however, the area has become gentrified and probably most of its residents now would express surprise that Charlestown is currently associated with the serious type of crimes depicted in this film. Nonetheless, the filmmakers advise their audience in the trailer that ""there are over 300 bank robberies in Boston every year"" and ""most of these professionals live in a 1-square-mile neighborhood called Charlestown."" According to Wikipedia, however, there were 23 reported bank robberies in the entire Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the first quarter of 2010. So much for verisimilitude!<br/><br/>'The Town' works best when depicting the dark underside of the criminal underclass in Charlestown (albeit, a depiction that is decidedly anachronistic, as discussed above). My favorite character is 'Fergie', played by the late character actor, Pete Postlethwaite. He's a local crime boss who runs a floral shop as a front for his criminal activities. In perhaps the best scene in the film, Fergie confronts Ben Afleck's 'Doug MacRay', insisting that MacRay participate in the next bank robbery he's got planned, despite the fact that MacRay now wants out. MacRay is practically left speechless when Fergie reveals that years ago, he got MacRay's mother hooked on drugs in retaliation for his father wanting to leave Fergie's gang. The kicker is that the mother committed suicide. Fergie ups the stakes (like all good criminals) when he threatens to kill MacRay's girlfriend, Claire, the sweet bank manager turned hostage. Postlethwaite is perfect as the scraggy-faced long-time tough guy who'll stop at nothing to protect his turf.<br/><br/>There are a few other good things about 'The Town' including the excellent performance of Jeremy Renner as 'Jem', Doug's boyhood friend, who's now Doug's right hand man. Renner is utterly believable as the hot-headed psycho who always wants to take things a step further than Doug, his level-headed comrade in crime. There are also a collection of local Boston characters in the form of armored car guards, police officers and Fenway Park workers, who all show up, adding to the foreboding atmosphere. Blake Lively also acquits herself well as the McRay's jealous ex-girlfriend who can't accept the fact that she's the odd woman out. Should I also mention the first two bank robberies are neatly shot and edited and add to the overall fast pace of the film's narrative?<br/><br/>Unfortunately, a good deal of the rest of 'The Town' is typical Hollywood claptrap, which disqualifies it from being in the same league as that old chestnut, the gritty 1970 crime drama shot in the Boston area, 'The Friends of Eddie Coyle'. At the outset, it doesn't make a lot of sense that Jem decides to take Claire hostage as it soon becomes apparent that she lives in the neighborhood and could perhaps identify one (or all of them) as the perpetrators of the bank robbery.<br/><br/>The hostage 'faux pas' is a necessary contrivance in order to allow Doug to hook up with Claire. Many have criticized Affleck's performance, arguing that he seems out of place as a local boy from Charlestown. Maybe so, but Affleck is really saddled by a script that calls for a character working at complete cross purposes. The screenwriters want us to believe that McCray is on one hand, a bit of a psychopath who doesn't hesitate to join his pals in committing bank robberies where people are killed (although McCray insists he never does any killing himself). But when his chivalrous heart is offended after girlfriend Claire informs him some local bully has been harassing her, he has no qualms in breaking into the apartment of the bully in question and beating this guy (along with psycho buddy Jem), to a bloody pulp. As long as he's doing it for 'a good woman', McCray's violent outbursts are 'justified'.<br/><br/>Rebecca Hall is equally saddled by the film's unconvincing script. In one of the worst scenes in the film, when Jem intrudes on Doug and Claire's luncheon date, no bells and whistles go off in Claire's mind after she meets him. It's quite obvious that Jem is not only from 'the other side of the tracks' but is also thoroughly unsavory, and Claire ends up saying nothing to Doug afterward about him. You would think that that it might occur to good girl Claire that Doug's 'buddy' also puts her new boyfriend in a bad light too. The films' scenarists also lose points when they have Claire and the FBI agents standing at an open window where Doug can easily see that they're forcing her to entice him to her apartment. Hey, how about standing inside the living room, away from the window, where Doug can't draw any definitive conclusions as to whether the FBI is at the apartment or not.<br/><br/>'The Town' wears out its welcome completely in the final (third) bank robbery scene. While the first bank robbery was quick and for the most part fairly believable and the second one featured some comic relief with the gang dressed in Nun masks, the third heist appears to be simply derivative. Doug and Jem simply dress up as cops and rob the payroll room at Fenway Park. There is the obligatory shootout, with Jem doing his 'suicide-by-cop' routine. Meanwhile, Special Agent Frawley, stares mindlessly, as Doug makes his getaway in a cop car, right in front of his eyes. In a nod to the 'Shawshank Redemption', all's well that ends well when Claire digs up the stolen cash in her garden and donates it for the renovation of a local kids' hockey rink.<br/><br/>There you have it. 'The Town' manages to entertain in some respects but ultimately must resort to the tired trappings of the heist genre. It's a mixed bag that should at best, engender mixed reviews!"

","The people rating this movie well must not watch many movies. There has been some really great heist / bank robbery movies over the years, and this is not one of them.

I was expecting something with sizzling action and unexpected plot twists, but it just wasn't there. Very little character development left me not caring at all about some of the leads. This is all too common in many movies today. The directors are so intent on getting to the ""fun stuff"" that the groundwork isn't covered.

","(Synopsis) Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) was born and raised in Charlestown, a blue-collar neighborhood in Boston, where crime is a part of life. Charlestown is the world's capital for carjacking, kidnappings, and armed robberies. The tricks of the criminal trade are passed down from father to son. Doug is the brains and ruthless leader of a gang of bank robbers who have been able to get out clean after each bank robbery. But Doug knows that his luck will not last forever, and he is looking for one last big heist that will give him the chance to leave the town in his rear-view mirror. But no one will let him, especially, his right-hand man Jeremy (James Coughlin); because he believes that it would be a personal betrayal to him, and he is not going to allow that. In a recent bank job, Doug forced the bank manager Claire (Rebecca Hall) to open the safe, and then took her hostage as leverage for the getaway, eventually setting her free unharmed. Doug knows that he should leave Claire alone, but she only lives four blocks from him, and he can handle it, but he begins to fall for her. Their romantic involvement is about to take them down a perilous path.<br/><br/>(My Comment) Ben Affleck, who directed and co-wrote the movie, was also the lead actor in ""The Town."" The story traces the exploits of 4 Irish bank robbers in Boston who symbolize the criminal working class growing up in Charlestown. The three main characters of Doug, Jeremy/Gem, and Claire were interesting and developed so well that the audience is drawn in and can understand their plight. Even though Doug (Ben Affleck) is a criminal you can still root for him to succeed. The performance of Rebecca Hall as Claire was outstanding, because she was able to make you feel her anguish and torment after the bank robbery. James Coughlin as Gem portrays a bank robber who is out of control, and you know that by the end of the movie, he is the one who will eventually get them caught. The action packed heist scenes are all great, especially, the last and biggest robbery. I believe that Ben Affleck will receive several Oscar nominations for his work. The film is brutal yet it also rips at your heart. This is a good movie to see, but it is not for children. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run Time 2:00, Rated R) (10/10)"

","For a film with such a dull and uninspiring title, 'The Town' is surprisingly bold and original. It effectively balances an interesting and engaging storyline with some great action sequences. Heist movies are always at risk of being generic and repetitive but this one ensures that never happens with an original, convincing plot and an interesting bunch of characters.<br/><br/>The crime genre has become increasingly stale and action-obsessed in recent years, so 'The Town' deserves credit for focussing on story and character development as much as action and violence. Great action films with credible plots are hard to come by these days, but 'The Town' is one of them."
"Screen_Blitz","8","2","2","2 January 2016"," Ben Affleck's directorial efforts pay off
","Ben Affleck makes his second directorial effort after his debut in 'Gone Baby Gone' in this modern crime-drama set in the Charleston neighborhoods of Boston. Affleck plays Doug MacRay, a long-time bank robber who leads a group of criminals including his half-brother Jem Couglin (played by Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (played by Slaine), and Desmond Elden (played by Owen Burke), in a bank heist where Doug crosses paths with the bank manager Claire Keesey (played by Rebecca Hall) who witnesses the beating of her boss. Months later, their bank robbing spree comes to pause, and Doug comes face- to-face with Claire who doesn't recognize him from the robbery at a laundry shop. The two begin bonding eventually form a relationship, with Doug trying to keep his bank robbing spree a secret from Claire. The situation gets progressively dangerous when FBI agent Adam Frawley (played by Jon Hamm) and his crew set out in pursuit to take Doug and his crew down.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck has been one of the most talented actors of this genre, and this film shows he is only gifted in acting, but also in directing and writing. Opening with the four main characters armed, and dressed in black suits and ghoul masks busting through the bank and wielding their guns at the employees; this movie gives a fascinating and realistic depiction of the lives of bank robbing criminals, and the consequences that ensue. The story evenly balances a romantic subplot between Ben Affleck's character and Rebecca Hall's character, and the main character and his group running a life of vicious crime. The storyline is written very sharply and rarely suffers from inconsistencies. The romance between Affleck and Hall is handled very maturely by not poisoning the characters with overly sappy dialogue and instead, giving the characters a believable touch while connecting to the main story. As this is a crime-based flick, there are some scenes that get a bit violent and at times, quite brutal; though not as harsh as what you would see a Martin Scorsese film. However, they effectively show the brash nature of the characters.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck gives a really decent and grounded performance as the main character, though not as impressive as Jeremy Renner who delivers some outstanding acting as his half-brother. Although it wasn't quite expecting him to garner an Oscar nomination, I am being honest to say is quite impressive. Rebecca Hall also delivers a performance that deserves credibility. These actors are truly amazing and their characters feel so authentic thanks to their performance and Affleck's top notch screenplay. <br/><br/>The Town is not likely go down as a classic and doesn't level up to the critically acclaimed crime flicks like 'Goodfellas' or 'The Departed'. Nonetheless, it is a very entertaining and solid addition to the crime genre. Ben Affleck does a great job in terms of acting, directing, and writing."

","The Town... The movie is good, no doubt about it. It was well-acted, well-written, and all around just a fantastic movie. Problem is, albeit the fantastic directing, it's contrived. I say that with a sense of greatness though, because although being this, is actually does it in a good way. Ben Affleck - yeah, the actor! - directs, and deserves praise. Why? Well he actually made a good movie, simple and to the point. But instead of going on and on about how good (but formulaic) the film is, I'm just going to break down the good things, and why Ben Affleck needs to direct more movies. <br/><br/>Story: It's just easy to follow. The story was simple and easy to follow, and Ben Affleck knows this. So he DOES this. Movies nowadays think the key to making and film (and winning over the critics) is to create all these absurd quick edits and complex back flashes to what, when, and where something happened, then quickly cut to a twist, back again. It's confusing. No one really wants that. So instead of doing this, he creates a story that's easy and simple to follow. That's exactly what I wanted.<br/><br/>Acting: Ben Affleck directs and stars. He did a great job on both parts, and he sets up the cast perfectly. First off, there's no cringe-worthy scenes. We are following the characters throughout, and there isn't no crazy stuff the characters do or say that we question. A lot of movies do that, The Town knows exactly what not to do. It was real too, leading me too...<br/><br/>Realism: Yup. The Town knows how to create this effect? How does it create this effect? Well I'll tell you! The Town knows not to put in cheesy CGI effects. Everything lots realistic and gritty. You feel like your sucked into the situation of the characters. That's what films are SUPPOSED to do, and the objection is not to make us entertained. Movies are supposed to be an experience, and The Town knew what to do.<br/><br/>Romance: I cannot believe I am putting this on here, but it counts. The Town isn't confused with just being a crime-thriller. It knows it's strengths and it's weaknesses. It's a genre-binder. It binds together what we want to watch, too. Action, drama, romance, and more drama. What more could you exactly want? The movie has it all. <br/><br/>If you can get past that the movie is a bit contrived, it knows how to push this thing out of the way. It's simplistic, gritty, and highly realistic. Yup, this is a Ben Affleck movie and I'm proud to say it. The movie was fantastic though, and if wasn't so clichéd in some parts, maybe it would become a masterpiece. But it did what it did, as pushed boundaries no movie has dared to do. So that sets it, go see it. Recommended for all. 8/10."

","I rented this because the idea sounded like a rare good one. Unfortunately, what few good ideas Hollywood has any more, they somehow manage to screw up. The Town is 125 minutes of my life I'd like back.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a bank heist, that kind of seems semi-professional but they take a hostage as a precaution. After they let the hostage go, one of the robbers follows her to make sure she's no threat. They meet, and they accidentally end up falling in love. Romance dramas aren't my preferred genre, but that's a pretty good story line to start with. It's definitely problem for the protagonist to try to get out of without hurting her. Etc.<br/><br/>What they did with it, though, was boring, slow and full of pointless twists and turns in the plot. Was the writer trying desperately to confuse the viewer so as not to guess the ending? I almost shut this one off a couple times, and the only reason I didn't was, to find out if I guessed the ending right. And the actual ending was far stupider than I had guessed, which means this writer has a lot to learn about suspense and climax. It's too bad, because the premise was really box-office hit material. No wonder I never heard of this when it was out!"

","The four stars are for action content and some moderately decent acting.<br/><br/>The huge downfall (-6) of this movie was the plot and screenplay.<br/><br/>Basically, the main character is neither likable or believable, as he never really does anything heroic or miraculous to stop his lifestyle despite his statements and what seems like the director's idea that he has done enough. The love between him and his former hostage is sketchy and not well-developed, and she is outrageously naive and way too trusting for someone post-trauma.<br/><br/>The characters have to be so exaggerated in order to make this plot work so that the writer/director could fit in enough action to sell the movie. If one takes a realistic look at what actually happened, it becomes laughable that the crowning achievement of a guy who says one-liners while executing two guys before bailing on the girl he supposedly loves is that he leaves her a bag of dirty money buried in her sweet garden with a half-page ""I'll always love you"" note.<br/><br/>I can't believe they play violin at the end.

A friend and i watched the movie and wanted to stop watching for a couple of times. The dialogues were so easy to follow that sometimes we both said what the actor should say in response and he did ! The movies jumps from here to there without preparing the viewer. It was like a timed action movie, action for 5 minutes then some character scenes and just as you start to fall asleep some action and that just keeps going on through the whole movie, boring . .<br/><br/>Oh my god, Ben, what is wrong with your accent? I guess people from Boston talk with an accent, there is nothing wrong with that but it seems that where all the other actors just try to concentrate on acting with Renner doing a superb job Ben tries to show how good his accent is and fails miserably because of him trying to much, that's his problem in this movie, he tries so hard to be not only a good actor but also a good director that he fails in doing both.<br/><br/>All in all i would say it's a waste of time, watch the ones he stole the ideas from instead. Point Break, Heat.<br/><br/>I give it three stars for some of the action bits, some, and Renner."

","Went to a sneak preview of this movie last night. And I came out of the theater exhausted from the tension of caring about the people in this movie. Ben Affleck was one of the screenwriters, the director and the star and he did a great job in all three jobs. Jeremy Renner was so enthralling to watch -- he was a tightly wound fist of energy, frustration, anger and violence. Jon Hamm was the FBI good guy and did as good a job as any. Blake Lively surprised me with what I never would have guessed was true acting chops. And Ben deserves every accolade. This is not a movie for people who cringe at the F-bomb, or violence, or two really hot sex scenes. Definitely not for young people. But a thrill ride that will wear you out! Go see it!"

","I really had high expectations for this movie. I never would have even seen it if I hadn't already seen Gone Baby Gone (which Affleck also directed) and it was a great film. But he did even better than I had hoped for. Not only was the action intense, but the story was great. I'm not crazy about Ben Affleck as an actor, but the man can direct. And he did a decent job of acting in this movie. But the real surprise was Jeremy Renner. I'm glad he is getting some good jobs. The Hurt Locker was great and wouldn't have been the same without him. I really was impressed with this movie. By far the best bank heist movie I've ever seen. I mean the heist at the beginning of The Dark Knight was awesome, and I love Dog Day Afternoon. But this managed to keep your attention from the start and didn't let up for over two hours. Very few films of any kind can do that. Bravo to Ben Affleck and everyone involved with this movie. Should have been nominated for several Academy Awards. If you haven't seen it, go watch it now. Heck, buy it, you won't be disappointed."

There is none of that tension or excitement one gets when you are watching a carefully planned, brilliantly thought Heist ... or the suspense, drama and intrigue behind a Heist being executed ...infact that is not the focus of the movie at all.

","To sum it up in one word...disappointing! Although the film was well acted, the plot was simply to dry and predictable. The trailers for the film produced a lot of excitement and hype, but the film itself didn't meet the expectations. The film lacked the amount of excitement and action I expected and took on a more romantic or dramatic genre then I would have liked. There was no real climatic point throughout the film and the predictable ending left you disappointed and unsatisfied. The one thing I did like about this film although, was the realistic effects of gun and weapon wounds throughout the action scenes. Also, any fans of Ben Affleck will be glad to see him back in top form as an actor, as it was his performance and a few of the other cast members that prevented me from leaving the theatre before it ended. Overall, a very average and forgettable film."
"nokeylogplz","1","19","41","15 May 2011"," This is the ONLY correct review. Read it all and you will agree. I promise.
","Sorry critics, Its not even subjective in this case. This is the ONLY right answer. If you read it all you will agree. I promise. Honestly I hope someone replies to this and proves me wrong because I am tired of feeling this much anger over a stupid movie. Here's an in depth analyst of why this is the worst movie I have ever seen. <br/><br/>Its the worst story I have ever seen in a movie since pre 9/11. This movie's heroes shoot at cops, attempt to kill the innocent do-gooders, and take advantage of peoples love for their families for their own personal gain. I only watched the last few scenes so I could watch ben affleck get shot in the face and I got nothing except him on a balcony over a swamp at sunset reflecting over his life as if he deserved the chance because he fell in love with a girl a bit higher than him in social stature who felt sorry for him. However I am not even allowed to believe in her for the following reason. She had a slightly traumatizing experience in the beginning of the movie which is supposed to make us feel sorry for her but then she proves she doesn't deserve our pity when she aids the person who caused it in his escape, our beloved cop killer (explained later), Ben Affleck. So now her moral standing is at or below his and she legally earns and deserves a good amount of jail time herself. <br/><br/>At least Corleone's wife had to be lied to in order for her to stay with him. Okay, Ben Affleck doesn't actually shoot a cop but not because he's not trying too and also because the worst story with the lowest morals and lessons in the past 10 years also has the worst action scenes in the past 20. Ill explain. The people who really deserve justice in this movie, Boston's finest, are portrayed as, well, the only word to properly describe them is nincompoops. They are dumber and shoot worse than the bad guys form the 80's Die Hard movies. This is for the sake of prolonged action scenes which undeniably glorify our ""hero's"" will and ignorance of their wrong doing. As if every cop in the final shootout wouldn't have a picture of these guys in their pocket. ARE YOU FRIGGIN KIDDING ME? THEY GET AWAY IN COP UNIFORMS!? I haven't seen a plot twist that cheesy since that boy was kicked out of heaven by transformer angels in transformers 2! Not only are the real good guys dumb but they can't hit targets out in the open from 30-50 meters. Really, trained members of an American metropolitan SWAT team shoot like African war children with .762 AKs. No one has shot this bad in a movie since the bad guys from the black and white spaghetti westerns. <br/><br/>It is our American duty to boycott Ben Affleck's theatrical career from here on out for the sake of anyone who appreciates the common laws of man and thinks this world is a better place with police than without them."
"VideoGameHollywood","10","7","12","22 September 2010"," I was shocked, it was great!
","I don't hate Ben Affleck. Many of the other contributers on this website might, but I never have. I wouldn't go so far as to call myself a ""fan"", but I wouldn't avoid a movie because he was in it. I will and have avoided Ben Affleck movies not because of the person, but because his filter (i.e. terrible movies) is apparently set at zero. He probably should have fired his agent somewhere around 2003-04. I mean, just IMDb his stream of hits between 2001 and 2004. Some of these movies were money makers, well, at least Pearl Harbor, but most were flops on a scale that would have derailed Tom Hank's career. Affleck has proved resilient through this, and believe it or not, people still give him money in the film making business. Matter of fact they give him creative control over his movies now.<br/><br/>That's right folks Ben Affleck is now not just an actor, but a writer/ director, and he's pretty good at it. The Town impressed me much more than I thought it would. The story is pretty generic: Guy robs bank, takes hostage, falls in love with said hostage, stalks her, protects her from accomplices, protects her from policeall of this handled in a way that doesn't seem pointless. The story actually works pretty well, and the sheer audacity of robbing Fenway Park is admittedly pretty cool. Yet, the main shortcoming of the movie, what keeps it from being an A is the story itself.<br/><br/>I can't help but wonder if the reason the movie succeeds rests more upon the acting of Ben Affleck, or his direction, than on the original story on which it was based, a book by Dennis Lehane, who also wrote Boston movies Mystic River, Shutter Island, and Affleck's first directing effort, Gone Baby Gone. No joke, Affleck knocks it out of the park playing gangster with a heart of gold (who never killed anybody) Doug MacRay. I bought the character from the beginning. He plays a very methodical bank robber, who keeps his cool no matter the situation. Jeremy Renner plays Doug's partner and best friend Jem, the id of the duo. Jem is played with almost unrestrained intensity, yet never in a cartoon way. He represents everything ""the town"", Charlestown, Ma, stands for, at least in Affleck's portrayal of the Boston suburb. He is fiercely loyal and ready to settle any situation with violence. This group dynamic and the action alone, make the movie worth seeing.<br/><br/>The romance part of the story, while not seeming tacked on, does feel unessential. It is used to tie a couple of things together, but everything we learn about the gang through this relationship could have been learned elsewhere. The more interesting, yet underdeveloped, relationship is between Doug and Jem's cracked out sister, Krista, played with disgusting authenticity by Blake Lively. Her story plays much more realistic and is more integral to the plot, although the climax of her story seems kinda out of nowhere. Once again I do not blame this on Afflecks direction, but on the source story itself. My initial rating of the movie after walking out of the theater was a B-; I just wasn't feeling something about it. I think it had to do with the unimportance of the love story. Upon reflection, I'll raise the grade to a solid B. Not a must see, but if it's on Netflix, check it out. The most important thing I got out of this movie was that Ben Affleck is an up and coming director, one who I will follow. I can definitely say that I want to see his next directed effort after seeing this film.<br/><br/>Rating = B<br/><br/><ul><li>VideoGameHollywood.com</li></ul>"
"LadyLiberty","9","10","19","19 September 2010"," The Town is the Bomb!
","In the opening moments of the film, it is established that Charlestown, Massachusetts (a suburb of Boston) is the bank robbery capital of the world. It is, according to the information offered the audience, a way of life there. In some cases, it spans generations. Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) is a man who lives up—or down—to the town's reputation.<br/><br/>Doug and his best friend, James ""Jem"" Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) head up a small gang of very professional bank robbers. Their usual thorough planning and professional execution gets them in, out, and away from their target in short order. But a series of small hitches combined with Jem's short temper changes everything when he decides to take Bank Manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage. Although Claire is released unharmed, Jem obsesses about what she may have seen or what she might know. To satisfy both Jem and his own doubts, Doug decides he'll find out.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the FBI is obviously interested in a bank robbery, but the hostage gives Special Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) what he hopes will be enough information to catch the gang. With a number of agents and resources at his disposal, he begins his investigation by questioning Claire and then starts collecting information to help him identify and catch the robbers.<br/><br/>The secrets held close by the people of Charlestown, though, won't be given up easily and perhaps not without violence. Not to the FBI for sure, and perhaps not even to one of Charlestown's own as Doug soon begins to find out as he asks some questions of his own.<br/><br/>The Town is based on a 2005 book entitled ""Prince of Thieves"" by Chuck Hogan. The book was brilliantly adapted by Peter Craig, Ben Affleck, and Aaron Stockard. Affleck also directed The Town. In some cases, actors who try to do too much do a disservice to each of their jobs. In this case, though, Affleck proved his Oscar® for co-writing Good Will Hunting was no fluke, nor was his acclaimed directorial debut for Gone Baby Gone any accident. He writes and directs The Town with unbelievable skill, and then to top it off, his acting is just terrific.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner doesn't play the most sympathetic of characters, but he makes Jem so real that it's difficult to judge him for his many flaws. Jon Hamm is entirely believable as a frustrated FBI agent, and Rebecca Hall meshes well with Affleck in their scenes together. The standout here (aside from Affleck, of course) is the surprising Blake Lively. In a role as Jem's troubled sister, she's nothing short of amazing. After the casting directors see her here, you can bet we'll be seeing more of her on the big screen in the future.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Even before its release, The Town was generating some very exciting buzz about Ben Affleck. Although the rest of the cast is superb and the story itself is a gripping one, Affleck is clearly coming into his own as a multi-talented movie maker. As far as I'm concerned, The Town is must see viewing.<br/><br/>POLITICAL NOTES: Surprisingly (especially given the FBI's extensive involvement in the storyline) none.<br/><br/>FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Town is rated R for ""strong violence, pervasive language, some sexuality and drug use,"" and it should be. It is in no way suitable for children or younger teens (who probably won't like it anyway). But for mature teens and adults, The Town offers a rare movie-going experience: An extraordinarily well made and intelligent film that also offers an exciting two hours in the theatre."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Ben Affleck proved himself to be a talented director with ""Gone Baby Gone"". Here, he once again shows he is best suited behind the camera. He has a real feel for setting, scenery, actors and camera angles. Unfortunately, this story based on the Chuck Hogan novel ""Prince of Thieves"" is just a bit too formulaic to stand out from the crowd.<br/><br/>We are told upfront that the Boston neighborhood of Charlestown has more bank robbers than any other ... in fact, in some families it is a proud tradition, passed on to the next generation. Ben Affleck got the guide book from his dad - an incarcerated Chris Cooper who has only one scene, though it's very dramatic. Affleck's lifelong pal and crime partner is played by Jeremy Renner. Renner's character, Jem, is downright psychotic to Affleck's Mr. Sensitive. If after ""Hurt Locker"" you have a difficult time imagining Renner as a bad guy, you should check out ""North Country"". That's a very bad man.<br/><br/>As seen in the preview, Affleck's merry band of bank robbers take a hostage played by Rebecca Hall (""Vicky Cristina Barcelona""). Affleck, in the course of duty, falls for Hall. She is the light that shows him the way to a better life. Unfortunately, that story line leads us right back to more crime ... with FBI mad man Jon Hamm hot on the heals of the local bad boys.<br/><br/>The neighborhood crime lord, played superbly by Pete Postlethwaite, controls the every move of the gang and takes his ""fair"" share while leading through intimidation - all while trimming roses! Renner's sister and Affleck's previous squeeze is played alarmingly (and surprisingly) well by Blake Lively. She appears to have a nice little career ahead of her.<br/><br/>The frustrating thing with this film is that we have seen it all before, just without the heavy bean-town accents. Tons of automatic weaponry lead to very few actual injuries or deaths - always the sign of a cheesy shootout. The finale for Renner, Hall and Affleck are all advertised well in advance of the actual occurrence, which pretty much ends the suspense. On the bright side, the film is well made and entertaining enough. For a much better film on the culture of local/family crime check out ""Animal Kingdom""."

","The Town is an okay movie, not great and not bad. I give it an average rating of 5 points out of 10 on the I.M.D.B. system of weights and balances, ha ha.<br/><br/>Director Ben Affleck does a decent job with the material. The story is very gritty for him but it is also kind of predictable and trying to follow the footsteps of movies such as The Departed. The acting is fairly ho-hum in quality and as I said it is a predictable story, it is gritty and supposedly ""real"" to some but I never really was convinced I was watching anything but a Hollywood movie. It never really drew me in to the story.<br/><br/>I'd say it's worth seeing but save your 10 quid and catch it on D.V.D. I saw it with friends and we had an O.K. time.... as I said it is O.K."
"ironhorse_iv","8","5","8","28 January 2013"," One of the movies that save Ben Affleck career.
","The best Ben Affleck's film since Daredevil. Just kidding about Daredevil, that movie sucks. The Town redeems Ben Affleck not only from awful films he star in the past, and pretty much help him with his new job: directing, that would help him in later films like Argo. I was kinda iffy about seeing this, because first Ben Affleck starts in it, second Ben Affleck directed it, haven't yet seeing 'Gone Baby Gone'. I was kinda hoping it would be very similar to 'the Departed'. I really enjoy it. The movie is loosely based on Chuck Hogan's novel Prince of Thieves, and the movie start with a bank robbery. Claire Keesey, a bank manager (Rebecca Hall) just got rob and taken hostage, but later releaser her without harm. She was soon pick up by the police, and taken to the station for questions. FBI Special Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) interviews her to see if she can identify any of the mask bank robbers. Jon Hamm's performance alone as the FBI agent trying to nail them was great. Jon Hamm (Mad Men) will make a huge jump from TV to movies, soon. I predict he will win a Oscar one day. Anyways, she couldn't remember due to the trauma and sent home to rest. She later breaks down at a laundry mat, when a fellow Boston neighbor Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) sees and tries to help her deal with the pain. What Rebecca Hall doesn't know is that Doug is one of the four bank robbers, who has come to Claire to save her from fellow bank robber and friend James ""Jem' Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) who thinks of eliminating her as a witness due to her knowing too much. Jeremy Reginner was great as his psychopath best friend, who would rather die in the street, then in prison. He was just that evil in this film. A romance grows between Doug and Claire forcing Doug to make a life choice, to get out of the bank robbing business due to his disenchanted with his criminal lifestyle and the lies he has to tell Claire. Ben Affleck as Doug McRay seems to be a role he needed to play. The character is a crook, but you really see trying to change. There is a charm to it. The only problem for Doug is that Fergus 'Fergie' Colm (Pete Postlethwaite), his crime boss doesn't want him to leave. The writing for the film was pretty damn good: the whole speech about what happen to Doug's mother, the speech about Claire being tied up and touching the water. The movie has brilliant dialogue, and no better example of that then the 'Weight of Dollar scene' with Blake Lively and Jon Hamm. The accents can be hard to understand at times, but most of the parts are well-acted. The only one I had problems was Rebecca Hall's performance, it's seem too acty, and the scene in the bathroom where she was crying. I couldn't tell if she was crying or laughing. The three heist in the movie was great for the action-packed fan. The Action scenes wasn't too violent, or too graphic. It was the Stadium scene that got me. It was cut OK, but there were bits of the heist scenes I couldn't figure out due the movie leaving out a lot of information about how they were able to pull these bank task off with the limited money they had. How in the earth did they get police uniforms? The sex scenes were well crafted, and wasn't graphic at all. The sex scene between Doug and Krista (Blake Lively) is questionable, wasn't really needed. I know it's showed him not being into it, it actually helped with understanding his feelings throughout the movie, but it's doesn't have to be there. There were even comedy in the movie. See the nuns and one cop scene. Another one, that got me was when James drank the soda during the last shoot out. Another thing about the film, I didn't like was the negative press about Charlestown, as if saying it's a bad neighborhood. Today the neighborhood is a mix of upper-middle and middle-class residences, housing projects, and a large working class Irish-American demographic. While crime is still predominant, it's not the bank robbery capital of the world as said in the film. If the movie is settling in the early 1990's, it might be more reasonable. Anyways, overall: a great movie, that has very similarities to that of Heat, but in my opinion better than that."
"therealholyllama","6","8","15","14 October 2010"," Good, but not deserving all the plaudits
","Ben Affleck's The Town has been garnering critical acclaim from all quarters, and in many respects it's well deserved. However, I cannot help but feel that the comparisons to films such as The Departed / Infernal Affairs and Heat are overdone, and suspect that this film will not be creating as much work for the judging panels come awards season as many critics seem to think.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly this is an efficient action thriller, although a little too long at exactly two hours. Rebecca Hall is very good as Claire Keesey, the bank manager who is kidnapped by a gang led by Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) before then becoming romantically involved with him. Her acting and the script allow her character to develop rather more complexity than the stock romantic interest so often found in similar pictures. Affleck's direction and Robert Elswit's photography are, among other things, an ode to Boston, with excellent use of location and frequent wide and aerial cityscape shots creating a sense of place.<br/><br/>Of particular note is Blake Lively's excellent performance as Krista Coughlin, sometime love interest of MacRay's, prostitute, addict and dealer. Lively's performance brings depth and humanity to an important character, and she deserves the Best Supporting Actress nominations that should come her way.<br/><br/>However, what is good about The Town is matched by what is flawed. While Affleck's direction is praiseworthy, I found his acting somewhat two-dimensional, all troubled frowns and pity. His relationship with Hall's character was simply not believable, due to a lack of chemistry between the pair as well as the circumstances of their relationship, which stretched credulity to breaking point. And the less said about the frankly embarrassing working-out scene, the better.<br/><br/>The unrealistic nature of the plot affected more than just the unlikely relationship between the leads, or the fact that Keesey seems to forgive MacRay even when she finds out he was responsible for her appalling ordeal. The characters of Slaine (Albert Magloan) and Jim Coughlin (an excellent performance from Jeremy Renner) take decisions that they know will lead to their deaths without the film having given us an adequate sense of desperation that would justify it. And after so much death and destruction, MacRay just drives away without anyone as much as raising an eyebrow.<br/><br/>Finally, the piece is morally dubious. Now this might be deliberate, but it did not sit well with me. We are apparently supposed to be rooting for MacRay. He is presented as a complex character; a tough life and background explains how he finds himself embroiled in violent crime. He's looking for a way out, but is stymied by the malevolent influence of others, particularly Jim Coughlin and the Boss, Fergus Colm (Pete Postlethwaite). Yet I never once had the impression that MacRay fights particularly hard to overcome these obstacles to his desire to get away, and regardless of his wishes, one cannot escape the fact that he is the leader of a violent gang of thieves who, by the end of the film, are responsible for death, bloodshed, trauma, kidnap and destruction of property on a grand scale.<br/><br/>While The Town is enjoyable enough as a heist movie, and features some great performances, it carries too many flaws to be considered a truly good film."
"VinceGambini","3","3","4","16 May 2020"," Bad Script, High Production Value
","It all feels right at the start but falls apart quickly. So the FBI knows all the time who the bank robbers are but for some reason they are allowed to keep going. The main witness from the first robbery falls in love with a mysterious Ben Affleck, 4 days after the robbery and despite her claim that she remembers all their voices. And of course the flower shop would have been raided years ago. This script is a joke.

One is dialogue, what goes on in peoples lives and their perspectives show if they are an in DEPTH person or NOT and trying to achieve growth or not. . The Town has all these numerous personality conflicts that is what is needed to achieve growth. I am not sure if this is known to Ben Afflect or not..he just may be acting out what his soul calling is, for HIM TO TEACH HUMANKIND!.... and then it is manifesting. That is a statement that will confuse most of us...Most of us still question this because we have not looked for conscious methods of having the LUXURY of knowing what is TRUE in our lives and what is our souls calling...so we justify instead...we worry as well..and become satisfied with that...We seek the superficial, things OUTSIDE of ourselves rather than within. We learn by pain...but we could do better. Ben is displaying and showing and teaching what is is to go against the GRAIN. You get killed your friends get killed you give up any love and are left alone...If there is a lesson....BUT lets get this straight...not just one lesson..the lesson is this....If you try to DEVELOP YOUR OWN WILLFUL PLAN...using your WILL..you will fail ...Why...because you did not think the universe is interactive with you, if you leave that out , your plan will fail.. GREAT MOVIE...perfect EXAMPLE on what not to do...The universe supplies us with these examples....do we listen?<br/><br/>I love the part where the detective is saying to Ben ..""You know we lifted a fingerprint off the van ..RIGHT?"" or in other words by asking that question he is revealing that it's BOGUS!<br/><br/>Great dialogue in this movie....lets see a ""The Town 2"""

","I always get caught short on the idea of the glorification of someone whose life revolves around the deaths of others, whose ""occupation"" is to steal from those who have no say in anything. What I mean is, our hero is not there to dole out justice or to even a score, he's a two bit punk who happens to be smoother and more handsome than the others around him. In the process, he begins to become more human because of falling into a relationship. I know that this attitude would negate ""The Godfather"" or any of the wise-guy movies so popular over time. So I enjoy the development of the characters, even if I have not one scintilla of admiration for them. The ugliness of the Boston streets works well here as does the criminal element and the ""honor among thieves"" thing. What works well is Affleck's brush with true humanity. One last issue. I'm getting a little tired of the incredible amount of fire-power that these guys have and how little carnage there really is. Also, there seems to be a lot of carelessness in police work if we are to believe this stuff."

","Following Gone. Baby Gone, the re-invention of Ben Affleck continues apace with this highly satisfying crime thriller set in and encapsulating the Boston neighbourhood of Charlestown. Affleck is Doug, the hood with a heart of gold, the brains of a crew that includes loose canon James. When he falls for a bank clerk from one of his raids, and then inserts himself in her day-to-day life, the consequences prove lethal.<br/><br/>The plot complicates and unravels deliciously, but it is the characters and their intertwining neuroses that keep your attention here. Doug is cut from the same cloth as De Niro's character in Heat, a man whose moral compass is askew with regard to social mores, but rigid within the terms of his own world. James, on the other hand, is Begbie from Trainspotting, or Edward Norton in Rounders, a walking liability whose moral code, if he has one, is known only to himself. The Town may lack originality, but it pays off in spades in terms of genre expectation. Doug's motivations are tied up with not wanting to be his Dad (the ever-competent Chris Cooper), fretting about abandonment by Mum at the age of six, and carrying the regret of failing to be a contender when pro ice hockey gave him a shot.<br/><br/>Love interest Clare (Rebecca Hall) has family ghosts of hero own to deal with. Doug and Clare meet across the soiled socks in the laundromat, a low-key affecting scene that Affleck controls with aplomb. The critics who in recent years called him washed up as an actor must be hiding behind the couch.<br/><br/>The only wobble is Pete Postlehwaite as the local crime kingpin, in his ultimate role, oozing his usual visual charisma but making an unfortunate accent choice. The mother storyline, also, resolves in a manner you will see coming from miles away.<br/><br/>The Boston locality is utilized evocatively, and the whole thing moves along with pace and verve. Affleck has proved himself an astute filmmaker in recent years. Good to have him back."

","I'm going to be unpopular and rain on this parade.<br/><br/>The lead characters in ""The Town"" are all highly unlikable people that pretty much nobody with any sense would actually want to be around in real life. If you pay enough attention to the news, you'd know that Ben Affleck's narcissistic, smarmy, manipulative, psychopathic character (and that's what it really is in hard terms), isn't even acting, but it's the way he is in real life, not just in ""reel"" life. So, at least, Affleck has his particular character pinned down tight.<br/><br/>All of the acting performances are solid and the plot isn't bad--my big problem is that I never found myself rooting for any of these anti-heroes, not even once, and not even a little bit. I'm not talking about physical characteristics when I say that this is an ugly, grimy, crew of vicious criminals. I'm not being all namby-pamby about this--I've seen and enjoyed tons of violent entertainment, but I found these ""lead"" characters to be particularly revolting and unrelatable.<br/><br/>I guess our society has become so enamoured of ""winners"" that even extraordinarily unappealing human beings are appealing when they win. There's no other way that I can explain the high marks for this film. Personally, when I want to see people that are just behaving out-and-out bad, I simply watch some kind of a horror/thriller movie. I won't quite say don't sacrifice two hours of your life to this film, since it's very slick, non-stop entertainment, and you could do worse, but, by the end, I personally was only feeling empty and dirty. Therefore, I'm marking it down some and reaching for the soap. Maybe I'm getting old or something.<br/><br/>P.S. Possibly this film could be part of a ""scared-straight"" program, given that if there's one thing it doesn't do is make crime look glamorous."

","The Town is Charlestown, Boston, a place where crime is a way of life. Following a bank robbery, professional thief Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) has to keep a watch on bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) because after using her as hostage leverage during escape from the heist, she is the only witness who could possibly identify his gang. But once the two meet they start to fall for each other, forcing MacRay to re-evaluate his life in Charlestown. It's a re-evaluation that will upset a lot of people close to him and the gangster boss who hires him, and all this at a time when FBI agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) is closing in on the gang.<br/><br/>One of the most startling things about Ben Affleck's second film as director is that even with the conventional plot, and the formulaic characters, it's still an exhilarating and fresh picture. With Affleck comfortable in his Boston surroundings, it's evident that he and the team went for authenticity, something which in the main they achieve. Sure there's the odd implausible moments, they are - like it or not - cops and robbers staples, but ""The Town"" is not your standard run of the mill actioner. It is, for want of pigeon holing, a modern day noir, resplendent with bleak mood and well oiled characters. Based on Chuck Hogan's novel ""Prince of Thieves"", pic follows the formula of a rotten town with rotten people doing their best or worst to live and get by. Into the pot comes the bad guy who meets a good woman who wants to leave his crappy life and crappy home behind. So far so well trodden path, then, but this is not a giant gangland operation, like, say, ""The Departed"" or ""The Godfather"" et al, this is a small neighbourhood setting, with a small group of everyday dressed young men. It's one of the reasons why Affleck's film feels so very authentic.<br/><br/>Helping to exude the naturalistic and human feel of the drama is that Affleck doesn't overdo his action sections, yet they are terrific sections for sure. This is not Tony Scott/Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer action for popcorn excess. From the electric kick-start of the first heist, to the mid-section car chase - and to the knock out coup de grâce set in motion at Red Sox Stadium - Affleck shows great skill as a crafter of action - aided superbly by Dylan Tichenor's energised editing. Other violence is swift and to the point, the director knowing not to dwell too long on vicious passages in the narrative, thus keeping his characters free of caricatures. Mind, he is thankful to the great cast assembled for his picture, for this is very much an actors piece. Well written without flabby periods of talk for talk sake, The Town provides proper drama for proper actors - and that includes the director himself.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner is quickly turning into the go to guy for edginess, here as MacRay's best pal, Jem, he deals out a frightening loose cannon turn. Chris Cooper and Pete Postlethwaite have small roles, but both impact hard on proceedings, both memorable and both adding a touch of classy know how. Hamm arguably has the hardest role, for as FBI Agent Frawley he has to carry on his own the other plot thread that is the investigation. Not just that, but the film lends itself to one which dares you to root for the bad guys, it's a tough ask of the ""Mad Men"" actor but he nails it, with one two-fold scene in a bar, as he grills MacRay's ex, Krista (Blake Lively heartfelt and believable), particularly offering a glimpse of what a good actor he can be. Ultimately the main load has to be carried by Affleck and Hall as the central doomed lovers. There is death and misery every where in Charlestown - and for the protagonists of the story, including Doug & Claire. Their relationship offers hope, a beacon of hope in a murky world, but it's a relationship founded on black secrets and built around falsehoods. That Affleck & Hall draw us in with charm and acting gravitas further serves notice as to why The Town is top draw stuff.<br/><br/>Hardships, hard decisions and hard characters come alive in The Town, a great modern day drama that's showing ""Gone Baby Gone"" was no fluke, this lad Affleck really is some director. 9/10"

","This movie contains all what good action - thriller - bank job should have. Good actors, money (Ben Affleck), okay story and super nice Rebecca Hall. But I somehow got impression that I saw this all before in some other movie/s... If this one was made in 1990 probably would be interesting for some time but today after 20 millions movies like this made by a year... not even worth watching. Jeremy Renner got himself an Oscar nomination for this role but I am not sure that he deserved it. He is very good here but for academy nomination... Bottom line - Ben Affleck is trying as actor and as director, for me he failed this time but who knows??? Maybe next year we got some great FILM of his..."
"KnightsofNi11","7","6","11","27 September 2010"," Solid film
","Ben Affleck's sophomore directorial effort is a solid one. He makes good use of his name in showbiz to put together a great cast and weave an entertaining story with no shortage of the elements of what a good heist film should be. The Town centers around a group of friends who rob banks and cause mayhem in the town of Charlestown. When the gang's leader, Doug MacCray (Affleck), gets too involved with a witness to one of their robberies (Hall) things get heated within the group as well as outside it, as the FBI begins to crack down on these robberies. The Town, while never skimping on the high quality, fast paced, action, ends up being a strongly character driven story, making it a good heist film to watch, while also delivering a substantial amount of intelligence that many films of this genre lack.<br/><br/>I think it's safe to say that Affleck has proved himself much more worthy of the director chair rather than an acting role. Obviously Affleck stars in this film and is as mediocre as you'd expect (no offense to the guy, I respect his other talents) but he by no means drags the film down. Plus the rest of the cast makes up for anything his acting can't bring to the table. Jeremy Renner, in particular, plays his role as Affleck's short tempered best friend incredibly well. The relationship between these two is the focus of the film, and what they do branches out to the other characters, most of which play an important role. The handsomely brilliant Jon Hamm plays the hard boiled FBI agent in charge of bringing down these criminals by whatever means necessary. He fits the key role of the morally skewed cop that serves to elevate the popularity of our anti-hero protagonists. Rebecca Hall plays the bank clerk who is taken hostage by Affleck and his crew at the beginning of the film, not knowing that she'd fall for the leader of this crew later. The relationship between Affleck and Hall was the only thing I didn't completely buy as far as character development goes, but this storyline served it's purpose, and played an important role in the cathartic ending of the film.<br/><br/>There is honestly nothing I can really criticize The Town for. Affleck's directing is effective, the dialouge is viscerally excellent, the film stands out in its effluent character development, and the acting is superb. The Town possesses all the elements of a good film that is well worth the watch. It's an effective blend of story and action, just what is needed in a good heist film. The Town is in no way groundbreaking and it doesn't revolutionize the genre, but it holds its own against the greats of the genre and fits right in with the criteria for a good story about cops and robbers. In this regard I can most highly commend this film for not trying to be more than it was. This movie never forgets what kind of movie it is, and it doesn't try to soar to new heights. It serves to exemplify what this genre is all about, and is an all around solid film."
"MBunge","8","6","11","20 September 2010"," Affleck goes to Town and finds his career
","Ben Affleck continues to resurrect his career with an excellent film that combines working class angst, action-packed heist scenes and real opportunities for his cast to shine in their roles.<br/><br/>Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) is a full grown child of Charlestown, a roughneck white enclave of Boston where armed robbery is a profession handed down from father to son. With a long absent mother, imprisoned father and a past of discarded glory, Doug now heads up a four man crew than includes his childhood friend Jim Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), a more ruthless and violent criminal than Doug ever wants to be.<br/><br/>The crew successfully robs a bank, taking assistant manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage as they escape. But when they discover that Claire lives in Charleston, Jim and the others fear she'll lead the cops to them. Doug agrees to check her out to see if there's any danger and winds up falling in love with her. He's inspired to give up a life of crime and get away from Charlestown, but Doug finds himself caught between the overly-caffeinated FBI agent (Jon Hamm) trying to bring him to justice and the demands of a vicious Charlestown crime boss (Pete Postlethwaite) who insists that Doug and his crew perform one last spectacular robbery.<br/><br/>With The Town, Affleck again proves that he has little in common with the flashy and hyper-stylized storytelling of today's Hollywood, relying instead on effective but unadorned direction that emphasizes the performance of his actors. All of the main characters carry along some very dramatic moments in the film and Chris Cooper as Doug's father and Blake Lively as Jim Coughlin's sister and Doug's longtime sort-of girlfriend are quite affecting in smaller roles. By giving these characters and actors something to do other than run around and shoot stuff, Affleck provides a comfortable weight and sense of substance to the proceedings.<br/><br/>The Town also features two outstanding action sequences, a blunt but very precise sense of humor and nicely balances the demands of heist movie excitement with the more emotional tale of a man caught between what he's always known and what he could never admit he wanted.<br/><br/>Even with his sometimes questionable career and personal choices, I'm not exactly sure why Affleck ended up the Stallone to Matt Damon's Schwarzenegger. Whatever put him on this road, it's brought him to the point where he could become one of the best filmmakers of his era. Let's just hope he stays far, far away from Jennifer Lopez."
"Reel_starz","8","8","16","20 September 2010"," A ""Town"" to be proud of
","There's a line in The Town where Doug (Ben Affleck) describes his younger self as ""a twenty-two year old kid who thought he had it all figured out...before he threw it all away."" The same could be said of the old Ben Affleck, the one who took the movie industry by storm when he, along with best pal Matt Damon, won the Best Original Screenplay Oscar for 1997's Good Will Hunting. What followed was the stuff of Hollywood cautionary tales: while Matt Damon steadily gained popularity and respect, Affleck's accomplishments (namely a stellar turn in 2002's oft-overlooked Changing Lanes) were drowned out by his role in critical, if not box-office, duds like Pearl Harbor and Gigli, and by his much-publicized romance with two-time costar Jennifer Lopez. He was a punchline, a sellout. But this is a new Ben Affleck. After a praised performance in Hollywoodland and recapturing the industry's attention with his promising directorial debut Gone Baby Gone, he's carefully working his way to becoming the latest comeback kid.<br/><br/>It's immediately clear why he chose The Town as the next phase in that process. Like Good Will Hunting, it's essentially a love letter to Boston, the city that has provided the location of most of Affleck's best works. He delights in panoramic views of the downtown area and harbor, and a statement during the credits tells audience members that the movie is, in fact, dedicated to the good, normal, hard-working people of Charlestown, the neighborhood where most of the action takes place. However, it's also clear that he didn't just choose the location for personal kicks. He knows Boston the way Woody Allen and Martin Scorsese know New York or the way Michael Mann knows Los Angeles, and this unique awareness comes through in every scene, every shot. What is most impressive about Affleck's direction and the movie as a whole is how he grounds it in authenticity and manages to instantly and effortlessly drag viewers into this world. He doesn't romanticize or glorify; he lets the city – sometimes literally – speak for itself.<br/><br/>This realism extends to the people as well. Ben Affleck's script, co-written by Peter Craig and Aaron Stockard and based on Chuck Hogan's novel Prince of Thieves, is populated by rich, sharply-drawn characters that feel honest and genuine, a welcome relief from the cardboard stereotypes that often appear in this type of film. Of course, it helps to have a talented, all-star cast to bring the characters to life. As Doug, Ben Affleck delivers one of the best performances of his career, though that probably seems more about the quality of his past work than what he does in The Town; trust me, though, he's really quite good.<br/><br/>Still, it's the supporting cast that deserves much of the kudos in the acting department. First and foremost in line is Jeremy Renner, fresh off his star-making turn in last year's phenomenal The Hurt Locker, who here gives us a searing, live-wire of a performance as James Coughlin, Doug's childhood friend and chief partner-in-crime. Jim is a virtual ticking time-bomb, the kind of guy who acts without thinking and sets even his fellow criminals on edge, but like in The Hurt Locker, Renner avoids easy caricature, instead injecting his character with unexpected complexity and pathos. Rebecca Hall is striking as a bank manager/local do-gooder, and with help from the script, she turns Claire into more than just ""the girlfriend""; nothing about the performance feels artificial or forced. However, the most surprising performance comes from Blake Lively, who, at this point, is best known as Gossip Girl's Serena. She appears in only a handful of scenes, and at first glance, Krista Coughlin, sister of James and Doug's long-time girlfriend, appears to be nothing more than another prostitute with a heart of gold. As the movie progresses, however, Krista evolves from a stock character into a real person; she might not have a heart of gold, but she does have the feelings and nuances of someone you might run into while walking down the street, someone willing to do anything just to get through each day. Lively's final scene is raw and emotional, arguably the most poignant one in the film.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, though. The Town may be largely character-driven, but it's far from a quiet, intimate drama. The script's nearly pitch-black humor is reminiscent of Scorsese's The Departed, and the violence comes fast and unrestrained. Affleck directs the action sequences with proficiency, adding some well-placed stylistic flourishes but largely opting for a straightforward approach that creates tension while still allowing the viewer to easily keep track of what's going on. The highlight, a prolonged Fenway Park heist/shootout, is on par with Michael Mann's classic scene from Heat.<br/><br/>The Town is not without its flaws – Jon Hamm's FBI agent is rather underwritten, giving the actor little room to make much of an impression, and though the ending is probably the right one, it feels a bit too optimistic in tone for a movie essentially about the bleak trappings of working-class life – but for the most part, its strengths make those blemishes easy to forgive. This is a taut, gripping thriller about people who defy the law not because they think it's glamorous, but because they see no other way out. Watch out, world, because this new Ben Affleck? He's here to stay."
"aschein81","8","8","16","17 September 2010"," ""The Town"" sizzles with suspense and superb performances
","You may now officially forget about Armaggedon, Pearl Harbor, Gigli, and Daredevil. The Ben Affleck we first came to know 12 years ago when he wrote his Oscar-winning script for ""Good Will Hunting"" is now back in business.<br/><br/>Affleck's second effort in the director's chair, following his superb ""Gone Baby Gone"" back in 2007, once again lands him back in the mean streets of working class Boston. Based on the award-winning novel ""Prince of Thieves"" by Chuck Hogan, the story outline in ""The Town"" is mostly nothing new, as the majority of it is a routine police procedural involving FBI agents on the hunt for a group of talented bank robbers led by Affleck and Jeremy Renner. The plot itself doesn't have many surprises, for we in the audience know that the robbers will always get away until the climactic stand-off with the police towards the end. Affleck knows he isn't creating anything original here with the plot, but he successfully takes the genre of the inner-city crime thriller and executes it with great precision - with superb acting performances, a sprinkling of tender romance, and a heart-pounding level of suspense throughout. Oh yeah, and did I mention that those nun costumes they wear when committing the robberies are really badass?<br/><br/>The performances themselves are the heart of the film, as Affleck has cast actors in roles that make them completely believable and allow the audience to care about them. Blake Lively is outstanding in her very small role as a drugged out stripper, even though she has no more than 10 minutes of screen time. She is completely unrecognizable from her well-known role on ""Gossip Girl."" Jeremy Renner is terrifying as Affleck's co-leader of the gang. One can sense through his character just how much this life of crime in part of his blood, even if he tries to hide his true emotions by hiding behind violence and intimidation. The talented veteran Chris Cooper is also spectacular as Affleck's father in prison. His one, 3-minute long scene with Affleck behind glass could be a training manual for young actors wondering how it's done. Everyone else in the film, including Affleck, is strong and does the best they can at making their characters appear authentic.<br/><br/>Affleck appears to also have a great understanding of suspense, pacing, and editing, as I was completely immersed in every moment of the film - from the gripping opening minute until the ending credits. The film rarely feels like a typical slam-bam action movie (until the last 20 minutes when the film goes a bit over the top with a larger than necessary climax), but rather as a character-driven drama that exposes the culture of the people in this neighborhood who live in this cycle of generational crime. It's just a part of who these people are and what they know. Some of them desire to get out of it, but then they feel like they are ""too good"" for their friends by leaving them behind, as is true with the struggle of leaving any type of criminal gang. Affleck does a solid job in the script department by allowing the fast-paced dialogue amongst these characters to feel natural. He even throws in an occasional witty and hysterical line to break the film's serious tension. One that I especially liked was a satirical reference to crime shows like CSI and Bones. Some of the dialogue is difficult to hear given the strong Boston accents, but you can make most of it out.<br/><br/>The action / bank robberies are exceptionally directed and worth the price of admission themselves, as one would expect in a film focused on umm, drum roll please..bank robbers. However, they are intelligently spaced apart throughout the film's 2 hour run time to never make them too mundane. There are only 3 total robberies / heists in the film, with a great deal of character development in between. There is actually an enormous amount of tension and build-up between the 1st and 2nd heists in the film, which allows the 2nd heist to have that much more of an effect on the audience when it does occur. The only flaw in the direction of these scenes, is when the film goes for an overblown climax in the last 20 minutes. I suppose he was trying to please the action-friendly crowd, or the studio required him to add in more action. I'm not sure. He just adds in too much gunfire and SWAT teams to make it appear more Hollywood-esquire and unrealistic, and that takes away a bit of the reality and honesty from the first 75% of the film. However, that flaw aside, 90% of what is in this film is superior to most of anything shown in theaters so far this year, with the exception of Chris Nolan's masterful ""Inception."" It is well worth your time, and it demonstrates Affleck's true talent both as a scribe and director. Now I think it's time for all of us to tell Michael Bay how much he sucks."

"Supachewy","8","5","9","26 September 2010"," The Town Proves Affleck is a Force to be Reckoned With
","The crime drama The Town is directed by Ben Affleck and stars Ben Affleck, Rebecca Hall, Jon Hamm, and Jeremy Renner. The film takes place in modern day Charlestown, Massachusetts.<br/><br/>The film starts off with four men preparing to rob a bank and they are lead by Doug MacRay (Affleck). They quickly take all the money and leave all the tracers behind and do a nice and easy job. Then the group takes the bank manager, Claire Keesey (Hall), hostage and bring her into their van. Then they drop her off at a beach and drive away. Afterwards the group discovers that the FBI is searching for them and have contacted Claire. So Doug follows Claire and then eventually talks to her at a Laundromat. They soon develop a romantic relationship. The rest of the film follows how the group does more bank robberies, while the FBI is trying to catch them and Doug and Claire's relationship gets more complex.<br/><br/>The screenplay for this film was very good. It was constantly entertaining and was extremely realistic. There was not one point in this film where I said ooh that would never happen, they just did it to build up the drama. All the characters had quite a bit of depth to them and were all pretty relatable. One could say that Jeremy Renner and Jon Hamm's characters were stock characters but then again there are plenty of people like them. I was not a giant fan of the ending but I was satisfied with it. Also I enjoyed how there were so many bits of comic relief in here that just made it seem even more realistic.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck has been called the new Clint Eastwood, and to tell you the truth I think he might just be. Obviously it is not yet proved since he has only directed two films, but both of them are superb. Affleck got many memorable performances from his cast, even though he was busy being a member of the cast as well. Also Affleck had many complex shots that built up the tension. One of my favorite sequences in the film is with the group of robbers in the nun outfit and the police officer who sees them. I won't give away what happens but it was filmed brilliantly.<br/><br/>The acting in this film was great by almost everyone in the whole cast. Ben Affleck delivered his best performance yet in my opinion as the troubled bank robber who wants to end his ways and live a simple, happy life. The reason he probably gave such a brilliant performance was because he directed and co wrote the film so he knew exactly what he wanted. Rebecca Hall was also great as the bank manager who has a relationship with Doug. She was just a normal girl but was just so likable because of her innocence, I may say this is my favorite role of hers as well even though I haven't seen much of her work. Jeremy Renner gives another great performance as the on edge bank robber. Even though his character is a stock character in a way he just played the part perfectly. I can't say the same for Jon Hamm though because I think he just played the role as lead detective like any actor would. He did not add a sense of realism to his role. Blake Lively had a small part of the drug addicted sister of Jeremy Renner's character and gave a solid performance as well proving that she can be a serious actress. Chris Cooper is always great even though he was only in the film for one scene being Doug's father.<br/><br/>Overall I give this film a strong 8/10. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a smart crime drama. I am also proud to say that this is my favorite film of the year so far. I know what many of you are saying when you read this, what about Inception and Toy Story 3? Well to that I say neither of those films seems as real and full of emotion as this one. Yes, they are both fine films but this one is just more to my liking. I understand why the rest of you would like the other two better but the more I think about those two the more I dislike them even though I still do like them. Watch this film, it is the best bank robbery film in years."
"freemantle_uk","8","5","9","26 September 2010"," A very good crime thriller
","When Ben Affleck was a rising star back in the late nineties he had earned respected for staring in films like Good Will Hunting, Shakespeare in Love and Dogma, and big bucks from blockbusters such as Armageddon. But his career went downhill when he starred in critical flops like Pearl Harbor, Daredevil and worst of all Gigli, with his then fiancé Jennifer Lopez. But he has had a hell of a comeback, directing the crime thriller Gone Baby Gone and having a supporting role in State of Play. His comeback is now complete with The Town and shows that Affleck is an excellent director in the making.<br/><br/>Set in Boston, the area of Charlestown is an area famous for being the bank robbery capital of the world and producing more bank robberies then anyways. Doug MacRay (Affleck) runs a gang of bank robbers, including his hot headed friend James 'Jem' Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), getaway driver Albert 'Gloansy' Magloan (Slaine) and youngster Desmond 'Dez' Elden (Owen Burke). After robbing a bank in Cambridge the gang kidnap bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) as a hostage. With the FBI involved Doug sets out to silence the woman and ends falling for the woman. FBI agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) is on the hunt, the gang continue with their operations, being lead by Irish crime lord the Floirist (Pete Postlehewaite).<br/><br/>With a great cast Affleck directs an effective film. The Town is best film I have seen Affleck perform and he is convicting in his role as a gangster with at least some morals. Hall was excellent as a woman overcoming post-traumatic stress disorder and falls for Doug as rebound reaction. Renner continues to raise with another fine performance as a man with anger issues and a near sociopath and Hamm's role was very similar Al Pacino's in Heat. Postlehewaite also gave a very good Irish accent and a sinister performance. Hopefully there are some award nods for Hall and some of the supporting actors.<br/><br/>The script written by Affleck, Peter Craig and Aaron Stockard was a well crafted, plotted affair with well rounded characters all round. Affleck's direction was well paced and allowing for well crafted action and crime scenes and a moments of character development and emotional depth. There is a gritty style but does not linger on violence or being stereotypical. Affleck does seem to be influenced by Martin Scorsese, Clint Eastwood, Ron Howard, Michael Mann and similar directors: he is serious for the most part and does not sugarcoat things. With excellent cinematography and editing Affleck directs some excellent action sequences in a realistic manner and shows that action does not need a $100 Million budget. There are no elements that drag the film out and the crime scenes were done with effect and pace. They were believable and well thought-out. There is a excellent opening bank robbery sequence with the team in Halloween masks, which was clearly influenced by The Dark Knight. Affleck also has a dark sense of humour to help little the film occasionally. But Affleck does seem to like his helicopter and skyline a bit to much: yet as a criticism it is a minor one.<br/><br/>This is a film with a heart and a brain.<br/><br/>Affleck seems to be on the road to being the next Clint Eastwood."
"Willie-12","9","5","9","22 September 2010"," Very Good...Affleck Continues To Shine Behind Camera
","The Town is one of the most solid efforts I've seen this year. For me, minus a couple exceptions, the 2010 summer movie season was one of the most disappointing I've experienced in quite some time. Never have I been more ready to welcome a Fall movie line-up than this year. And one of the first movies high on my list of must-sees was The Town. It did not disappoint. Is it too soon to declare that Ben Affleck has achieved movie director greatness? Perhaps. But if he continues to churn out material like Gone Baby Gone and The Town, it won't be long and he'll be considered one of the best directors in Hollywood. This was a movie that had it's work cut out for it. I was expecting great things. Gone Baby Gone was my favorite movie from 2007, and although The Town does not quite reach it's status, it is still a very good film. It is clear from the outset that Affleck has his finger on the pulse of his characters in a way that allows him to steer the trajectory of the film in a direction that satisfies the viewer in almost every way. Few directors are able to achieve that kind of control, and still deliver. And the screenplay is exceptional. There are at least five characters in this film that are fleshed out, and so well developed that we actually care about what happens to them. It's hard enough for most directors to develop one or two characters to that extent. And the acting from all involved is very good, with one exceptional performance from Jeremy Renner. No doubt he'll be up for another Oscar nomination this year. Everything about this film is so good. The cinematography, the musical score, the editing...literally every aspect. It's interesting. Thirteen years ago when I saw Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in Good Will Hunting, I never dreamed Affleck would be the one who would emerge from that solid effort as the more talented one in any aspect. Damon has proved himself the better actor. I don't think too many people would argue against that point. However, Affleck has proved to be better behind the camera. And in the long run, I think that's where he'll prove to be the one who makes the bigger, longer-lasting impact."

","I don't know how this movie got such stellar reviews, but this ain't The Heat. The overall feeling after experiencing it is that of a disjointed puzzle. Despite the great cast, they fail to support the incoherent roles and plot in any satisfying way. In fact, the main protagonist is bouncing between two different types of personalities for the entire movie. No, the internal struggle or the baggage of traumas are not covering this erratic behavior. And the tension between characters is so fake, you can cut it with a knife. The only redeeming qualities are a couple of good action scenes and the decent love story. Rebecca Hall is pretty hot. In conclusion, the movie is worth one viewing, but I cannot recommend it to anyone. There are better thrillers.<br/><br/>This is my first review, just for the record."
"leantom-2","9","6","12","19 September 2010"," Mr. Affleck, Take a Bow.
","It's been awhile since I've seen a good movie in theaters.<br/><br/>Yes, I did catch ""Inception,"" but that movie was far too complex for my simple mind to retain.<br/><br/>And yes, I did see ""Machete,"" but films imitating D.W. Griffith's ""Birth of a Nation"" aren't appealing to my senses.<br/><br/>""The Town"" is far better than any movie I've seen in the last year. Not only are the action sequences breathtaking, but the story is well-scripted and powerful. The interactions between the story's main characters - Affleck, Reener and Hall - are beautifully rendered across a Bostonian landscape, and the casual pace of the story keeps one both interested and thoughtful. My friend was bored with the film's aforementioned pace, but I found it necessary in order to comprehend all of the character interactions. Indeed, the dialogue is what makes this film worthwhile; the script is what gives this film a lasting impact.<br/><br/>The movie starts out with four thieves robbing a bank in central Boston. After the robbery, one of the robbers - Coughlin (Reener) - decides to abduct a female bank manager - Claire (Hall) - as collateral (the alarm was tripped). After driving a few miles from the bank, the robbers release Hall, threatening her in the process (however, she is unharmed physically).<br/><br/>As a consequence of being abducted, Claire experiences residual effects. She becomes unstable, and simple activities become hard for her to complete. At this point, one of the bank-robbers - Macray (Affleck) - begins watching her, given that he wants to see if she knows anything that might implicate him and his buddies. However, as Macray is observing Claire, he notices the pain she's undergoing, and he starts to sympathize with her. What starts out as a simple reconnaissance mission turns into a full-blown relationship, with Macray eventually falling in love with the nervous, distraught Claire.<br/><br/>As the story progresses, Macray decides to quit being a bank-robber, opting instead to move from Boston with Claire and start a new life. However, there are people (i.e., a secondary party that's profiting from the robberies) who don't want Macray to leave, and they threaten to kill his girlfriend if he doesn't comply with their demands. What follows is an explosive conclusion which includes massive gunfights and clever twists, culminating in a finale that is well-worth the film's slow, casual pace.<br/><br/>What makes this movie brilliant is not the action sequences, though; it's the interactions between the main characters. For example, Macray and his psychotic accomplice, Coughlin, illustrate the brotherly bond between two friends who, though opposites in character, care for each other (note: it's similar to the friendship between Oskar Schindler and Amon Goethe in ""Schindler's List""). The tension between these two characters is felt throughout the movie, and the dialogue between them is both powerful and provocative.<br/><br/>John Hamm - the actor playing the main antagonist - delivers both a magnificent and realistic performance as a law-enforcement officer who is determined to bring the guilty parties to justice. I believe a best-supporting actor Oscar is not a stretch by any means.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck also gives a great performance as a troubled bank-robber who is trying to leave his criminal profession.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Mr. Affleck delivers to the audience a powerful movie characterized by a captivating dialogue and realistic character interactions. Mr. Affleck, take a bow!"
"ghlist7876","4","4","7","27 December 2010"," Best movie of 2010? I think rather far from it.
","I was expecting a lot more from this film than it delivered. What I liked were the supporting cast performances, chiefly Jeremy Renner's performance as the ""like a brother"", who will not be going back to Walpole any time soon. Next in line were the stellar performances of Blake Lively, Chris Cooper, Pete Postlethwaite, and a surprisingly good showing from Albert Magloan, as the curiously happy driver. Jon Hamm played a very stiff and believable FBI agent. What I could have done without, was the writer and star of the movie, Ben Affleck. I found his character malformed, uninteresting and his portrayal uninspired and lackluster. He dragged through this movie like an anchor in soft sand during choppy surf. About the time I started praying that he was going to be blown into a million bits of shredded and unneeded flesh, I checked my watch and saw that I still had another forty five minutes to go. Oh No! Affleck was so bad that it ruined the performance of Rebecca Hall, who might very well be a good actress, but we certainly weren't given the opportunity to find out in this film. Further, Affleck's ego is so overblown that he couldn't just let his character die in a blaze of gunfire the way he should have. Oh no, he had to escape to a southern bayou with a half a sack full of cash, so I'm sure there will be a ""The Town II"" coming to a theatre near you soon. Now consider this plot line disaster for a moment. Every cop in the city is looking for this guy because he just shot up a bunch of policemen, so the Boston PD sends men to Logan and Bradley airports (Bradley is over an hour and a half away) to wait for him, but they forget to send even one patrolman to South Street Station, the only place where one can board the Amtrak out of 'The Town'? It's hard to believe that Affleck would even try to pull that obvious plot flaw over on anyone, because South Street Station is exactly where any reasonably sane law enforcement professional would begin looking for a fleeing suspect. No one can escape by air anymore, this isn't the 70's, and you can't waltz onto an airplane carrying half a sack full of cash and an AR-15. Even the Boston PD would probably agree that you can't get most firearms past the TSA, thus to leave 'The Town', extended rail or car would have been the only options for a fleeing suspect. I was ready to shoot myself by this point. If there is one thing that they ""got right"" in this movie, it was when a cop on 'construction detail' plainly saw the robbers dressed as nuns and just looked the other way. However, that brings up another great plot flaw did that cop not have his police radio on? Was he not listening to all the chatter on the radio that there was an armored car heist, huge gunfight, and police chase going on right on the other side of the river and that the fleeing criminals were crossing the Charlestown bridge and coming right down his throat? Simply unbelievable, due to all the plot flaws."

","First of all, I apologyse for my poor English. <br/><br/>Just before going to the movies, I read some reviews here, and I was expecting to see some HEAT 2 or something like that. My opinion is that, although the film is WATCHABLE, it lacks a lot of veracity (the same veracity many people have somehow found in it) For example: The police almost knows for sure who robbed the banks, controls the gang movements, but this does not impede another robbery by the gang, which they prepare in very comfortable conditions. After the FBI finds out that Doug is dating Claire their life continues as if nothing happened. Policemen in a operation see gang men in police uniforms, open face, but they don't recognize the most wanted guys they are trying to hunt. I don't know, for me everything in this film is very hard to believe, it is too simple and flat. I was rather disappointed, maybe I am too exigent but this is what I feel."
"benjammin-roberts","3","5","10","13 February 2011"," Nicely shot although quite dull & slow
","This is a very poor film. Affleck does a good job with the directing but aside from that, the film is appalling. The film isn't helped by a script that is insincere & rather unbelievable (Eg - Affleck's dad is a notorious bank robber serving life sentences after killing two guards on a failed heist & yet the FBI never think to look into the possibility of his son being in the same 'trade'......Which is compounded by the line ""Its like a family trade, passed down by generation to generation"" which is mentioned by an FBI Agent! ). I didn't want to write this review as a tirade against Affleck but its hard not to when he directed/ co-wrote & had the lead role in this film. His acting is passable but his lines are forgettable, especially his attempt at a gravelly voice which does grate after a few scenes. All the other Actors in this film give terrific performances, especially Renner whose portrayal of Coughlin is excellent. You really feel how unpredictable his character is which makes for great tension on-screen. That said it still does not help the overall feel of the film. It plods along playing out an obvious plot which fails to go anywhere interesting or believable. Its shot well with excellent lighting & Post Production work, giving a dark & gritty portrayal of Charlstown but the story is a non-starter which is seriously let down by its writing and screen play.<br/><br/>I'd avoid this film if you can. If you get the chance you could maybe buy this on DVD & then smash it to pieces safe in the knowledge that you'd be saving someone else from seeing it. It is that bad. Mr Affleck - Stick to doing everything else apart from Acting & Writing & Directing and the world will be a safer place."
"shadowville","5","5","10","29 September 2010"," The Town? More like A Town. A Boring Town.
","Highly disappointing and highly overrated. Based on ratings and review I thought this movie was going to be an amazing hit like Departed. Oh boy was I given a let down. The acting was not particularly great and the storyline was bland -- the only story ""twist-up"" involves the girl who was part of the bank being robbed and one of the robbers eventually date her without her knowing the truth. However, the way this was written was of complete and utter disbelief. Nonsensible actions were partaken by the lead antihero played by Ben Affleck, and further nonsensical actions were partaken by the girl he's dating.<br/><br/>I understand that it's part of an action drama to include unbelievable events like crazy explosions and car chases, but to actually piece the storyline together through incredulous and unbelievable actions just causes the audience to not appreciate any of the ""important"" scenes and happenings in the film.<br/><br/>There is absolutely no suspense, no thrill. The action scenes were also really plain, stuff that we've also seen in the theaters since Lethal Weapon. I mean it's not terrible, but it's just not really anything unique or attention grabbing. The movie score was plain too (by the way, I don't know why they used Eminem's Not Afraid song in the trailer) and failed to drive any emotion, but maybe it was just because the story in itself was far too mediocre.<br/><br/>Watchable, not bad, but certainly not worth $12.50 at the Brooklyn movie theater. The movie was also excessively long. A boring 5/10."
"TheMovieDiorama","8","3","5","1 April 2018"," The Town turns up the 'Heat' to deliver a tantalising thriller.
","Affleck gets slack off screen, and yes occasionally some of his performances are lacklustre. But when he is in full control of his own film, he becomes this formidable swirling vortex that chews up every scene. The Town is a great example of just that. A band of Charlestown residents perform bank robberies where during one of them they take a woman hostage. The ring leader of this group of misfits rapidly falls in love with her and attempts to protect her and his delinquent brother simultaneously. It's not the most original thriller ever, in fact it follows a narrative flow similarly to the likes of 'Heat' and 'Point Break'. However what differentiates this from them is the equal dosage of characterisation and adrenaline. The brotherly love between the two lead characters is conveyed to be a complex conflict for authoritative power within their unit. Each decision made by one is being questioned by the other. It's a ferocious relationship but one that is fuelled by love and respect, two traditions valued heavily within Boston raised families. Then to embed the intricate blossoming romance with the hostage that inevitably crumbles into desolation is just genius storytelling. Allowing us to become invested in these characters who do anything to survive the harsh environment of Charlestown. Affleck manages to use Boston as an incarnation to represent his own character. Rough around the edges with a warm bustling centre. His directing style is taut, tense and thrilling and certainly cements him as a talent behind the camera. His performance onscreen is then unequivocally matched by everyone. Hall, Hamm, Cooper and especially Renner all deliver exceptionally gritty portrayals as they bring life to these damaged individuals. The robberies and chase sequences were electric with frenetic editing to keep the action thrilling. There are certain sub-plots that are underdeveloped such as Lively's character, trying to pack too much into a two hour runtime. However, this heist thriller remains one of the best."

","The Town is a crime drama starring, co-written(together with Peter Craig and Aaron Stockard), and directed by Ben Affleck.Jon Hamm,Rebecca Hall,Blake Lively,Jeremy Renner,Pete Postlethwaite and Chris Cooper play key supporting roles.The film was adapted from Chuck Hogan's novel Prince of Thieves and it was one of a number set in Boston, Massachusetts over the past decade that have formed a ""sub-genre"" of crime films like The Departed and Gone Baby Gone.<br/><br/>Boston bank robber Doug MacRay falls for a woman his gang had previously taken hostage after feigning a chance meeting with her to ensure that she can't identify them. The son of a tough Charlestown, MA thief, Doug passed on his chance to walk the straight and narrow in favor of becoming a career bank robber. Not only is Doug's crew one of the most ruthless in Boston, but they're also one of the best; they never leave a trace of evidence, and always make a clean break. Over the years, Doug's fearless partners in crime have become something of a surrogate family to him. Jem,who is the most dangerous of the bunch is the closest thing Doug has ever had to a brother. But a divide begins to open between the two career criminals when Jem takes bank manager Claire Keesey hostage during a particularly tense heist, and the group subsequently discovers that she hails from their own tight-knit suburb. When Jem proposes that the gang make an effort to find out just how much Claire recalls about the crime, Doug fears that his volatile partner may do more harm than good and volunteers himself for the job. Later, Doug turns on the charm while pretending to bump into Claire by chance, and becomes convinced that she doesn't suspect him of being the same man who just robbed her bank. As the feds turn up the heat on the gang, Doug finds himself falling for Claire, and searching desperately for a means of cutting his ties to his criminal past. But with each passing day, Jem grows increasingly suspicious of Doug's true motivations. Now caught between two worlds with no chance of turning back, Doug realizes that his only hope for finding a happy future is to betray the only family he's ever known.<br/><br/>This is a solid crime drama.No question about it.It is tense, smartly written, and wonderfully cast.It may not be original in any sense of the word as it is a deliberately old-fashioned melodrama that echoes the pulpy mix of violence and romanticism of gangster films.But the director,Ben Affleck does a marvelous job executing all of the pieces and is easily one of the best films during its year of release.Also,it happens to be one of the most entertaining films ever released.Watch it and see it for your self.Definitely,it is highly recommended."

","A movie featuring Ben Affleck without his real life bromance partner Matt Damon in the mix is usually an easy way to sink a film. This time it is anything but a disappointment. True, The romance side of the story is interesting but really could have been cut out all together. ""The Town,"" is a movie that Ben Affleck can be proud of, and is a good direction for his fizzling acting career. Also showing great performances are Jeremy Renner, and Blake Lively. Anyone who likes movies about bank heists, crime drama, and mob connection movies will delight in this movie that successfully incorporates moments of an action thriller and intelligent drama.<br/><br/>As I said before, the romance portion of the movie is the only real downside and the movie could have stood alone without it, but it doesn't destroy this movie either. Jeremy Renner probably outshines Affleck, but he does bring out a better performance in Affleck, who let's face it, is just a little eye candy to bring women into a guy's movie. <br/><br/>""The Town,"" delivers as a crime drama with plenty of action even if you are biased against pretty boy Ben Affleck and is a do not miss if you want to watch a smart, well executed heist movie."

","THE TOWN is a great heist film by Ben Affleck. Affleck starts out by laying out some basic facts here which sets up the movie nicely. It States that Charlestown has created more bank robbers and armed robbers then anywhere else.<br/><br/>The beginning starts off with Doug McRay going over the plans to rob a bank. When they break into the bank as soon as it opens Doug and his partners force the bank manager a lovely young lady named Claire to open the safe. Claire does so and as they leave someone trips the silent alarm earning a Teller a horrible beating which Claire witnesses. She Sees a tattoo on the back of the man's neck and keeps it to herself. The Gang take her hostage. To guarantee their safety. They blindfold her and take her driver's licence. They inform her that someone will hold onto it and will watch her in case she tries to talk to the F.B.I or the Cops.<br/><br/>Doug doesn't like how the gang treated her and takes the licence. What begins as a simple job of watching her becomes complex when Doug falls in love with her. Claire falls in love with him and Doug gets pulled into another Job. Against his will and better judgement. Doug takes the Job. Warning them that if anything goes wrong he warned them. The Job goes badly and they almost get caught. By now the F.B.i have a interest in Doug and his partners. Doug alarmed by how close they came to getting caught Swears this was his last job. Until the neighbourhood Mob Boss Fergie the Florist gets them a job that'll put them into the big time. Doug wants out but Fergie has other plans and Doug knows he's backed into a corner. Fergie threatens Claire and to keep her safe Doug takes the job. Meanwhile the F.B.I inform Claire that Doug was one of the robbers and suddenly the world changes for both of them. The Last job goes wrong and Doug is now on the run trying to get to Claire.<br/><br/>The Town has it's flaws. But it flows smoothly enough. The Acting is very good and draws you in. The Story could be considered Clichéd. But Affleck puts enough fresh touches to it to make it feel new. The film succeeds in what it sets out to do. Entertain you. Ben Affleck shows off the talent he showed back in Good Will Hunting. He can write. We knew that. Now we find out he can direct. And THE TOWN. is proof of that."

","The Town is a movie about a group of bank robbers lead by Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck). It is based on a Chuck Hogan novel ""Prince of Thieves"". When they abduct the manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall), Doug starts interacting with her to see is she can testify to any of their identities. FBI Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) begins investigating who the perpetrators bank heist are. While Doug and Claire's relationship starts to develop, James ""Gem"" Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) insist that they rob another bank. This time the heist goes terribly wrong and the get into a firefight with the police, but manage to escape. Doug tells Fergus ""Fergie"" Colm (Pete Postlethwaite) that he wants to quit robbing, but Fergie intimidates them into robbing Fenway Park. The robbery goes horribly wrong and everyone dies except Doug. He then kills Fergie for making him be involved with the robbery. Finally, Doug takes the money and hides it in Claire's garden with a note saying she can spend it better and he'll see her again ""this side or the next""(Affleck, 2010). <br/><br/>The main theme of the movie is an internal good vs. evil struggle. Another movie that is related in theme is ""Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde"". The internal struggle between good and evil is played out in this very well. Doug is trying to turn his life around but it seems like he keeps getting sucked back in. One technique that helps drove the theme is dialogue. From this we gain the most insight into the workings of the theme. One part in the movie Doug meets with Gem and says he's done. Gem doesn't want to believe this but Doug is firm in his wanting to quit robbing and start a normal life. After he tells Gem, he goes to Fergie and also tells him that he's done. Fergie and Gem do not take his wanting to straighten up his life good, Fergie even goes as far as threatening Claire's life to make him stay. Without this important dialogue the theme of the movie is lost. The other important technique in this movie is the setting. Setting is defined as, "" The time and place in which a film's story occurs"" (Boggs & Petrie, 2008).Boston and the surrounding area is well known for infamous robbers and criminals. ""Whitey"" Bulger is from the area and he was arguably one of the most famous from there. ""The Departed"", another Boston area crime movie, is loosely based one his life. Boston has been the setting for many great crime dramas, because of its reputation. The movie could have been set anywhere, but that location gives some extra believability and justification to the story. Although the theme is good vs. evil, this is also a very good film for its pure entertainment value. I hope you see it and enjoy it as much as I did.<br/><br/>References Affleck, B., (Writer/Director). (2010). The Town Motion Picture. United States: Warner Bros. Boggs, J.M., Petrie, D.W. (2008).

Of course we have graphic scenes of where people are shot or close ups of beatings. That is the new realism. In the end there seems to be no point. It is in some ways TV like. Shows such as the Sopranos dwell on psychology and soap opera stories. Even the vaunted God Father was mostly talk.

"RossRivero99","9","2","3","14 April 2017"," One of Ben Affleck's best movies
","""The Town"" isn't the very best heist movie that I have ever seen but it is one of them and is also a very interesting movie to watch, and it has a plot line that can be pretty hard to follow at times but despite that it still works as a whole movie. This is the second movie directed by Ben Affleck before he directed ""Argo"" (2012) which is the best of the two movies that I saw that were directed by him. Not only does Affleck direct but he also stars as a man named Doug MacRay a native of Boston, Massachusetts who is a criminal who specializes in robbing banks and other places. MacRay's best friend since childhood and trusted cohort is James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) of which they get along very well and treat each other like the brothers they never were. As the film opens we see a bank robbery in progress in a Charlestown bank where the robbers dress up in creepy costumes and they force the bank manager who is a young woman named Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) who is then abducted and then released. After the first robbery MacRay starts to fall in love with Keesey after seeing James's sister Krista (Blake Lively) who also happens to be a drug addict. After the first robbery the case is sent to the local FBI and the investigation is headed by Special Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) and then a whole lot of other robberies happen probably in order to screw up the investigation which is my personal interpretation. The man in charge of the robberies is a flower shop owner named Fergus Colm (Pete Postlethwaite)who may have Irish mob connections. The backstory to this movie the relationship between Doug and Claire which is really nice to watch despite knowing the fact that violence will eventually happen. The most effective scene in the movie is where Doug talks to his father Stephen (Chris Cooper) in prison and is wondering about his mom and then that gets his dad really mad. I congratulate Affleck for making this movie and succeeding because in my opinion he has entered an elite class of directors who know how to make a really good heist movie (the other two being Spike Lee and Sidney Lumet), there are many good things about the movie which is the story which was adapted from Chuck Hogan's novel ""Prince of Thieves"" which I didn't read before seeing this movie, the performances are very good throughout, and the heist scenes and the love story keep this movie on the high ground. The one major problem that I had with this movie and prevented this movie from getting a 10th star was the feeling I had that Affleck and his writers rushed into things while making this movie without explanation of what was going on throughout the movie, otherwise there was nothing else wrong with the movie. Ben Affleck is a very skilled director, writer , and a good actor, and I hope that someday he does another really good heist movie but one that is even better than this one."

The cast has great chemistry especially between Ben Affleck and Jeremy Renner. This is one of those movies that I can watch over and over. The Town is reminiscent of The Departed and like The Departed there are some violent scenes that aren't for the squeamish, if you can tolerate moments of violence watch it. The movie stays as true to the book as best it can with the main difference being that the back stories have been dropped. To me, however, this did not detract from the movie."
"manusanchez90","9","2","3","1 May 2013"," My favorite movie of all?! 9,7.
","I was stunned when I first saw ""The town"". It was at a cinema in my town with an old friend of mine, a cloudy and humid day in Autumn. I did not still read the novel on which it is based, but I know there are some divergences between them two. This is the best realistic thriller I have ever seen. It takes inspiration from another masterpiece titled ""Heat"", but ""The town"" is just a bit superior. Also, from ""Ronin"", which to me, is a good heist movie, but rather worse than these two. It is wonderfully directed and starred by Ben Affleck. He is better as a director than as an actor, but he is a very good actor, as well, who was and is very lucky with the movies and people he has been working with. The movie is tense, has some unexpected twists and is not slow or boring at all. It contains the right amount of action, very crafted and realistic, like the initial heist, the car chase, the final heist at the arena... Apart from Ben, nobody from the cast was really a star when the movie was released, but nearly all of them are well-known (Chris Cooper, John Hamm, Rebecca Hall, Jeremy Renner and Blake Lively among others). All of them are perfect in their respective roles. Maybe, Jeremy Renner delivered the best role in his career. He is as believable as scary, but I love the character. The profoundization in the characters is very present, that is why good performances were required. Ben is not the most expressive actor in Hollywood, but we cannot say he overacted at all. The length and pace of the movie are perfect. The photography of Boston is very adequate and is convenient to know that Ben Affleck grew up in this city. There are some amazing twists. I do not know much about the novel, but the ending is unexpected because partially, it is not the same as in the book. I highly recommend this movie for those who like realistic thrillers with action (but not just action, also drama, suspense and good dialogues). I cannot tell more about the movie, but it is so intense and thrilling... 9,7."

","The Town is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.This is another great directing job from Ben Affleck,who proves once again without any doubt that he can direct movies,this is his second project after Gone Baby Gone and,besides being crime movies,they are quite different,this movie is much more adventurous and thrilling,the conflict between the characters and the situation they are in will certainly keep audiences at the edge of their seats.The case all deliver great performances,particularly Ben Affleck and Rebecca Hall,who had great chemistry,as well as Jeremy Renner and Jon Hamm,who I found to be the two most interesting characters,Renner was unpredictable,while Hamm was willing to do anything in order to catch these criminals.It can be a bit slow at times,but the Town is still mostly intense and dramatic from start to finish,and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good crime film or thriller. <br/><br/>While planning a complicated heist,a career criminal develops feelings for the victim of his latest robbery.<br/><br/>Best Performance: Ben Affleck Worst Performance: Blake Lively"
"ashi-lance","8","2","3","6 February 2013"," The Town (2010)
","I must admit that I hate Ben Affleck and don't watch his movies usually because I personally think he is not a good actor, but I watched this movie just because of his good show as a debutant director in Gone Baby Gone. And I must say he did a wonderful job here continuing from where he left in 2007 and if you ask me he could possibly be the next Clint Eastwood in the making if he keeps growing from here in the field of Direction. Adding to that, I think his effort out here will definitely earn him the Oscar nomination this year. Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) was born and raised in Charlestown, a blue-collar neighborhood in Boston, where crime is a part of life. Charlestown is the world's capital for carjacking, kidnappings, and armed robberies. The tricks of the criminal trade are passed down from father to son. Doug is the brains and ruthless leader of a gang of bank robbers who have been able to get out clean after each bank robbery. But Doug knows that his luck will not last forever, and he is looking for one last big heist that will give him the chance to leave the town in his rear-view mirror. But no one will let him, especially, his right-hand man Jeremy (James Coughlin); because he believes that it would be a personal betrayal to him, and he is not going to allow that. In a recent bank job, Doug forced the bank manager Claire (Rebecca Hall) to open the safe, and then took her hostage as leverage for the getaway, eventually setting her free unharmed. Doug knows that he should leave Claire alone, but she only lives four blocks from him, and he can handle it, but he begins to fall for her. Their romantic involvement is about to take them down a perilous path. The film also has a terrific pace to it. It does have very little action scenes in it and they are not really needed to make this film more exciting. I say this because the lives of these characters become so involving to us that we really want to see what happens between them and what decisions they make and we do get in a sense to even care for them. It is so involving and fascinating that the over two hour running time is rarely felt because everything is so captivating. I would not single out a single performance as being the best because I think the whole cast does good work here. The direction is tight and focused and really brings the film together and makes for a really entertaining and thrilling watch. I personally liked The Town better because I really felt we got to know these characters better and the on screen chemistry was great. This film also successfully blends different genres including drama, action and even romance and all were pulled off terrifically and it felt more human to me. The Town is one of the best films of 2010 and I am glad it is doing so well with audiences and at the box office.<br/><br/>My Rating- 8/10"
"patryk-czekaj","8","2","3","18 December 2012"," Ben Affleck's directorial win
","The Town is a deliberately old-fashioned, pulpy crime drama that serves its purpose as a romantic heist picture, where character-driven narrative intertwines with many action-packed sequences of utmost suspense. With this film Ben Affleck surely hit a second spectacular home run (right after Gone Baby Gone), assuring that his directorial career will be more rewarding than his acting one. <br/><br/>What's surprising is that the story depicted in The Town comes as a rather familiar and simple one, but the way it's presented and acted promises many splendidly entertaining and downright thrilling moments. Right within the first few minutes of the picture the tension mounts to unbearable levels, as a group of masked criminals robs a bank and takes one of the female workers as a hostage. The woman, Claire (Rebecca Hall), quickly becomes the object of interest of the mastermind behind the heist, Doug (Ben Affleck in his most promising role to date). Yet still unknown to her is the fact that Doug was actually the one, who commanded the operation and caused the whole mess. As the two begin their burning love affair, Doug - along with his three partners in crime - plan another dangerous robberies. His sudden affection towards the girl and gradual loss of readiness to go into action makes his partner anxious and relevantly angry. Jem (Jeremy Renner; the guy really had a good few years), his longtime friend and former jailbird is trying to convince him that money is worth more than a girl. Apart from the personal conflicts, Doug is followed closely by a FBI operative Frawley (Jon Hamm), who is eager to put the guys behind bars and stop the Charlestown criminal ring once and for all. Because, after all, it's a business of relationships, and what happens in the family stays in the family. Doug walks a thin line between freedom and imprisonment, and this one final action might be all that he needs to finally take the matters of his life into his own hands.<br/><br/>Being a smartly written and captivatingly shot (many great aerial shots of Boston) thriller, The Town brings about all that's best about the genre, without referring to any clichés per se. Through combining its modern, violent crime nature with an appealing 30's vibe, The Town advises the audiences to look closely into the substance of the film and react to a many of the intense and gritty sensations that cleverly fill the core of the film. Every actor has a room to maneuver, and - decidedly so - each and every one of them finds a way to be a considerable part of the whole picture."
"jafar-iqbal","8","2","3","16 October 2012"," A great crime thriller
","Ben Affleck is probably most remembered for things like Daredevil (bad) or Gigli (atrocious), so you'll probably be forgiven if you didn't really want to go and see this movie. You'd be forgiven, but you would be asked to reconsider. Because 'The Town' is one of the best crime thrillers to come around in a helluva long time.<br/><br/>Affleck writes, directs and stars in this story about Doug, a bank robber struggling between the demons of his criminal past, and a hopeful new life in the form of love - and former heist victim - Claire (Rebecca Hall).<br/><br/>There are lots of action sequences in this movie. You've got the bank robberies and the car chases and the gunfights. All the good stuff you'd expect from a crime drama. But 'The Town' is so much more than that. It is a study of the hopeless, pigeon-holed lives of working class criminals, having nowhere else to go and nothing else to do, and what happens to these people when the chance for redemption rears its head. And at the heart of it all is a spectacular performance from Ben Affleck himself.<br/><br/>It's funny, because the last great Affleck performance I remember is 'Good Will Hunting'; and, lo and behold, he wrote that too. Affleck is seemingly at his best when he is control, and he calls all the shots here. The result is fantastic. He's helped, too, by some equally fantastic performances from Rebecca Hall and Jeremy Renner, and what could be a career-defining role for Blake Lively.<br/><br/>What probably lets the film down is its length. At two-and-a-half hours, it requires a lot of patience and attention, but it's worth it in the end. Maybe there could have been half an hour shaved off, but I then also can't recall any sequences that felt dispensable. Everything was there for a reason, meticulously written and wonderfully shot.<br/><br/>I remember reading somewhere that Ben Affleck was starting to become the Clint Eastwood of this generation. I scoffed at it. But watching this movie, and knowing what Affleck had done with 'Good Will Hunting', my opinion has begun to change. If writing and directing will make Affleck churn out films like 'The Town', then let the man write and direct at his leisure. A must-watch."

","A single square mile in Boston called Charlestown contains more bank robbers than any other municipality in America. And it is here where the setting of one of the best films of 2010 takes place.

Even though the film does not contain intense action and robberies, the film progresses at a very exciting and good dose with three basic robberies.

","The story...here...has more holes in it than a golf course. That is sad, because the movie is quite watchable. Ben Affleck directs it well, and his acting is reasonable. He is backed up by an interesting cast, but it is all superfluous ...when the script and story are sub par. It is a bit like ""Heats"" (a similar and much better movie made in 1995 starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino) little brother. The pace---the guns the taking down of scores. Affleck should look for a tale which is totally different...this type of movie has been done (better) many times before. What about a remake of the Wizard of Oz ??. Or Tarzan and the Chocolate Factory ??."
"tomgillespie2002","7","1","1","9 November 2011"," Clichéd tale that brims with heart and authenticity
","Charlestown, Boston - a gang of bank robbers are preparing a heist. They break into the bank, rough up some of the employees, and gain access to the main vault. They escape, taking bank manager Claire (Rebecca Hall) with them. They eventually release her, telling her to walk until she feels the sea at her feet. It seems they have gotten away with it, but gang member Jem (Jeremy Renner) is restless and wants her taken care of after discovering she is from the same neighbourhood and may be able to identify one of them. Doug (Ben Affleck) takes responsibility, and he starts following Claire. They eventually start talking, and Doug finds himself falling for her. With FBI agent Frawley (John Hamm) closing in on the gang, Doug becomes disenchanted with the life of crime and longs to give it up, but will Jem, and more dangerously, will notorious big boss Fergie (Pete Postlethwaite), let him?<br/><br/>There's been a lot of interest in Boston of late. Most have focused on the element of crime and the way it seemingly flourishes there. The most popular are Martin Scorsese's The Departed (2006) and Ben Affleck's debut film as director, Gone Baby Gone (2007). Affleck originated from Boston himself, and although he depicts it as a dangerous place to live and a place that bleeds criminals, he clearly has a love for the place. The Town benefits from this fact, as although its storyline is seeped in cliché, the film has a genuine authenticity to it that gives the film heart, and a real feeling of place.<br/><br/>Michael Mann's Heat (1995) is the main source where The Town takes its influence from. Without capturing the same neon beauty of Mann's crime masterpiece, The Town films its bank robbery set pieces with the same attention to detail, and exciting, breathless shoot-outs. It also has it's fair share of impressive performances - Renner, as the films token loose-canon, brims with subtle menace and eagerness to harm. He is very good, and fully deserves the attention he got from The Hurt Locker (2008), and the two Academy Award nominations that came from that and this. Jon Hamm looks like the film star he could become once he's done with Mad Men with a performance of fierce determination and arrogance, as his FBI man looks to catch these career criminals before they rob any more banks.<br/><br/>But with the good, comes the cliché. The central romance between Affleck and Hall is believable - they're two lost souls looking for someone to help them escape the existence that they currently hate - but you can't help thinking how gullible Hall is and how stupid Affleck is for getting involved with someone who could put him in jail for many years. Yet while the movie is ultimately formulaic, and contains character archetypes seen many times before, it remains frequently riveting. Complete with mumbling, Boston-accented dialogue, and real locations, the film's authenticity lifts the film out of the good and into the very good. Affleck may be a better director than actor, but he gives a strong performance here. If he does ever decide to go back into acting full time, let's hope he doesn't forget about directing, and hopefully he's sacked the agent that brought him the likes of Pearl Harbor (2001), Bounce (2000) and, of course, Gigli (2003).<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"tieman64","Null","1","1","26 September 2011"," Very fun, but formulaic
","Ben Affleck directs ""The Town"", an entertaining crime picture in which a band of thieves rob banks, fall in love with women who endanger their lives, are tracked down by police detectives, engage in ""one risky last job"", get caught, take part in a bloody police shootout and die. In other words, the film is wholly derivative of Michael Mann's ""Heat"" - itself a film which deliberately stockpiled clichés - and to a lesser extent Kathryn Bigelow's ""Point Break"".<br/><br/>The film may be nothing but a clothesline of clichés, but like his earlier crime picture, ""Gone Baby Gone"", Affleck's style is low key, gritty and actor-centric enough to differentiate it from most mainstream, action fare. You know what's coming, but ""The Town's"" faux verisimilitude and faux naturalism keeps things somewhat fresh, even if Affleck's view of tough types and working class Boston is merely cookie-cutter underclass romance.<br/><br/>The film is so shamelessly generic that it seems to tap into not only recent ""heist"" and ""gang movies"", but old, black-and-white Warner classics (eg ""White Heat"", ""Public Enemy"" etc; notice the similarity to Mann's titles), in which we salivate over daring hoodlums and their blaze of glory fade outs. For this reason, the film's pleasures are mostly archetypal.<br/><br/>8/10 – ""The Town"" is part of Affleck's calculated ""re-imaging process"" (""Hollywoodland"", ""Gone Baby Gone"" etc), the actor, after a decade of being a Hollywood laughing stock, desperate to reinvent himself as a ""serious artist"". Worth one viewing."

The plot was well executed even if it was a little predictable. Ben Afleck gave a great performance as the conflicted Macray while wearing the second hat of director. The character was fed up with his life as it was and wanted to improve it, but didn't have much incentive. <br/><br/>The idea that Claire could fall for him was a stretch but was convincingly justified because he was there when she needed someone. The action scenes were engaging. Just when the bank robbers seemed to have their backs against the wall something happened to change the situation. Blake Lively showed her acting skills in her portrayal of an addicted ex-girlfriend that was still not over Doug. There were a few unexpected twists, one being the scene where he was talking to Claire on the phone about meeting with her. It was her response that I didn't expect. His friendship with Coughlin led me to believe the film would end differently. It was a very entertaining film."

It's amazing how Affleck could make a car chase in the US with a Jeep Cherokee and Ford cop cars look like it was taking place in Europe. I guess Ben decided to copy the look of his friend Matt Damon's hit movies. I hate when people do that kind of cheap imitation.<br/><br/>The interior scenes looked like I had switched channels to one of the many current cop shows, the lighting, the dialog, the clichés, the boredom.<br/><br/>Dontcha love it when pretty boy actors deliberately try to rough up their looks and butch up their acting in 'bad guy' roles?

"Rodrigo_Amaro","9","1","1","8 February 2011"," Powerful and Outstanding Performances, Reasonable Thriller. Affleck succeeds it again in the direction.
","Ben Affleck is a great surprise behind cameras since his directorial debut in ""Gone Baby Gone"", and here with the thrilling ""The Town"" he takes some of the same characteristics that made of his first film a good film about crime events in a city where the connections between ordinary people and criminals are very close. The film is very good but for some reason I thought that more could be added to make it a great film, more thrills, more violence and an excitement in a few moments but at least the dramatical parts are among the best in a film of this genre.<br/><br/>""The Town"" of the title is Charleston and the crime flies high there from the first scene presented in the film in a tense and well executed bank robbing made by Doug (Affleck), James (Jeremy Renner) and a few other partners. During the heist they decide to take a hostage with them, a female manager (Rebecca Hall), fearing that the cops would appear. After her release, Doug gets involved in a relationship with her, trying to see if she can give informations to the FBI (his inside level), and starts a romance with her (on the outside level he revels to be a very nice guy), hiding the fact that he kidnapped her, at last he starts to reevaluate his life as a robber and thinking of a new future in another town along with this great woman. Doug's problems while trying to reach this illusion are: 1) his dangerous friend James who doesn't like this relationship fearing that she might tell something to the police; 2) his boss (Pete Postlethwaite) who keeps sending more and more ""jobs"" for him to execute; 3) a young woman (Blake Lively) interested on him that only knows how to provoke this guy 4) and, of course, a headstrong FBI Agent (Jon Hamm) who is getting closer to the group of thieves. <br/><br/>There's nothing new in the plot of ""The Town"" except for the important fact the drama takes a new and interesting level that was more captivating than the suspense built through the whole story (based on the book by Chuck Hogan ""Prince of Thieves""). Among the great dramatical moments are all the scenes between Affleck and Hall, where his character shares with this frightened woman many things of his past without giving away about his life of crimes, and a surprising sincerity in his talks that makes her unarmed against this guy, who simply appeared in her life in her worst life moment and he created that terrible moment. This contrast was excellent! And a scene where he visits his father (the excellent Chris Cooper) in jail, another great moment. The heist scenes, the car chase and the conclusion are among the nice action sequences, but I was expecting more energy coming out of it, to make me glued in the seat wanting more. It delivers something good, it is well made but it had potential to be more. <br/><br/>""The Town"" performed well at the box office, and that's why everybody heard things about the film and the awards nomination (including Oscar) to the great Jeremy Renner. While I do think there's things to be praised about him and his acting here (the accent and a different tone of voice, his mannerisms and a dangerous look), I still think that there wasn't so much for all this awards buzz. Why's that? I expected him to be a more menacing character with violent and shocking moments, and someone with more important lines, more than just mumbling words. He should be the character of who we can't take our eyes off, with a powerful screen presence where we would have the chance to be surprised with his next moves because he's a very unpredictable guy and we haven't seen much of that (except in his scene with Hall and when he and his friend beat up a guy in the apartment). Jon Hamm was much more effective and interesting as the FBI agent and he should be the one nominated for the awards (even though my preference between the ignored names would be Andrew Garfield for ""The Social Network""). But, again, Renner's is quite good here but not enough for this Oscar, SAG and Golden Globe talks. Affleck is amazing in the main role in a very mature character, he's the element of surprise here; Rebecca Hall also amazing because she has the ability in playing such a high range of different roles that you forget about the actress and think more of her performance, her character, she totally disappears behind them and that is a great work. The late Pete Postlethwaite delivers an outstanding performance here, sad that his screen time is so short but he stole the show for himself and gladly Bafta was gentle enough to remember of his performance here, and instead of Renner they nominated him, a name that didn't make it in these awards lists.<br/><br/>It is a good film, with powerful moments. More could have been made to be a more appealing film to me. 9/10"

I would have to temper that with, ""If you are skittish at blood, not the movie for you"" and I wouldn't suggest it for children.

","There's a lot to like about this movie. Not the least of which is simply the knowledge gained that Charlestown, Massachussetts - a suburb of Boston - is apparently a breeding round for bank robbers. That may not be a great selling point for Charlestown, Massachussetts - and it may not be an issue that's really addressed or explained in any way in this movie - but it's still an interesting piece of knowledge. One also has to appreciate the performances in this. Ben Affleck was very good as Doug MacRay - a local bank robber who's involved in a heist in which a young woman (Rebecca Hall) is taken hostage, and who then falls for her and begins to develop a relationship with her (she not knowing who she is.) It's an interesting premise and - while the relationship does develop - this never falls into the trap of being a formulaic romance. The story really is about MacRay, whose growing relationship with Claire makes him want to leave the life, much to the chagrin of many of his partners in crime. That was an interesting story, made even more interesting by the fact that Claire discovers from the FBI who MacRay is and then obviously has a choice to make. The choice itself was the proper one, and the movie I thought ended on the proper note as a result.<br/><br/>What I didn't like was the depiction of the last job the gang did. It went on far too long and became (I thought at least) unnecessarily violent; little more than a shootout eventually that went on far too long and detracted from some of the very real human interest that was involved in MacRay's personal story. Yes, it provided an opportunity for a truly hair-raising car chase, but I still thought it was overdone and a bit inconsistent with the rest of the story, which was quite good."

One of his crew is childhood friend Jim Coughlin(Jeremy Renner), who is quite volatile and obviously has a very short fuse. During the latest heist a bank manager Claire(Rebecca Hall)is kidnapped. Creating a major problem is the fact that Doug falls heavy for Claire thus causing doubts of judgment from mad dog Jim. That is not the worst; a head strong FBI agent(Jon Hamm)has MacCray and the recently fired bank manager under surveillance. Some very good car chases and gun battles. A strong supporting cast features: Pete Postlethwaite, Blake Lively, Owen Burk and Chris Cooper."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","1","1","24 January 2011"," Town of Thieves
","After seeing a series of bad Hollywood movies released in 2010 (with one exception called 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'), finally I find something worthy. Ben Affleck's 'The Town' is gripping, gritty, suspenseful but above all, human. While the film is very much plot driven as it revolves around a series of bank robberies, it is the excellently carved characters that stay with the viewers.<br/><br/>While I do see some resemblance to Michael Mann's 'Heat' especially how the romantic angle juxtaposes with the heist angle and the sequences leading to the conclusion, 'The Town' still remains its own film especially regarding how it's been written (storytelling and characters). Moreover, in addition to being a suspense thriller and a human drama, 'The Town' has plenty of dark humour.<br/><br/>While the story and characters are properly developed, 'The Town' is a well-made film with excellent editing, lighting, cinematography and score. The heist sequences are executed brilliantly. However, the sex scenes appear a little rushed.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck springs a surprise, both as actor and director. Even though he has delivered a few impressive performances (such as in 'Changing Lanes', 'Extract', 'State of Play' and 'Hollywoodland'), I never expected him to pull off someone as complex as Doug MacRay, but he does it effortlessly. It's good to see him develop into a fine actor. Likewise, I wasn't sure whether he, as director, would be able to pull off such a big movie with a complicated story, but he's done it.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast, that includes Jeremy Renner, Rebecca Hall, Chris Cooper, Pete Postlethwaite, Jon Hamm and Blake Lively are first rate. I never thought of Lively much as an actress but here she is brilliant as is Rebecca Hall, the traumatized bank manager who falls in love with one of her 'attackers'. Jon Hamm and Jeremy Renner are terrific as the no-nonsense copper and ruthless psychopath, respectively. Postlethwaite and Cooper are scene stealers with their couple of scenes.<br/><br/>'The Town' is among the best heist movies of recent time. I would be looking forward to Affleck's future directorial ventures."
"davidshort10","4","5","12","5 December 2010"," Good in parts, but characters don't ring true
","Thank the Lord Ben Affleck wasn't allowed to make the four hour cut. It's too long as it is. But this means the drastic cut makes the plot-line jumpy, and one presumes it has shortened character development.<br/><br/>No-one could seriously care about, or identify with, any of the characters, either the cops, the robbers or the Rebecca Hall character, and so the movie falls down at the most basic level.<br/><br/>The bank robbery and car chase sequences are enjoyable, but then again so what. Most robbery and chase scenes tend to be so, but that doesn't make it worth two hours of your time or money.<br/><br/>There can be absolutely no comparison to the French Connection, as some people here make. Doyle and his sidekick were driven, dedicated cops against the harm done by Charnier and his heroin traders.<br/><br/>But nobody could care less about the banks who are robbed (especially nowadays, so the special agent played by John Hamm may as well be a bank collection agent for all we care. The point is made more than once in the film, when they say things along the lines of 'it's not your money, don't be a hero'.<br/><br/>And the criminal characters live such crappy lives, you wonder what they do with all the money. At least in the Sopranos, Tony lives in a big, comfortable house, and his wife has lots of expensive jewellery and high-end vehicles, though of course his family lacks the respectability that property level, which is why is wife is so unhappy.<br/><br/>Here, these guys just live in grim apartments and drink in down at heel neighbourhood bars, so what's the point of taking the risk that you'll end up in jail for the rest of your life? And none of them seem to have any identifiably different personality from the others, apart from the psycho Florist, played as an Ulsterman by Peter Poslethwaite.<br/><br/>And a young bank manager would never in the world associate with the Affleck's working class character, even in America.<br/><br/>I think this film will sink without trace. Seems to me Affleck was over-indulged by the studio."

","The point of heist movies is that they are pretty much the same. From the Aussie gem Money Movers to the classic Heat, it is another way to view the relationship between man, woman and money.<br/><br/>The Town - following on from The Wire - bases itself in a single urban area. We are introduced to its bad denizens. Affleck is vaguely convincing - in parts - as a lowlife criminal. Well, he isn't truly with it but he doesn't actually do harm.<br/><br/>Rebecca Hall performance as the innocent moll is a bit strong, but like Affleck she is watchable.<br/><br/>Yes, this tears off a great deal from Heat - but that is no bad thing. Heat could be remade every two years and I'd probably see it all the time. The Town is predictable but well put together, which makes you wonder what genre Affleck wants to try his hand at next."
"st-shot","5","4","9","5 October 2010"," Actors and film could use a shave in this cops and robbers fairy tale.
","Director Ben Affleck displays a much better grasp of storytelling and film grammar in his second time (the belabored Gone Baby Gone) out as director but his overbearing le petit Marlon Brando lead eats up too much celluloid and The Town loses its grip not far from the finish line before convulsing in mawkish sentimentality as it takes incredulity and perverse optimism into another stratosphere. <br/><br/>Doug MacRae and his gang are an efficient quartet of armored car and bank robbers operating out of Charlestown MA. He foolishly becomes involved with a bank employee in one of his robberies and this sets off all sorts of alarms for the gang and the FBI. Mercifully in between we are treated to some hair raising chases and shootouts climaxing at Fenway Park.<br/><br/>Afflecks cloying Doug is all moody torpor and the sadness of his childhood and newly uncovered information about it are met with dumbfounded and inexpressive stares. It's embarrassing Brando in need of a shave. Also in need of some facial landscaping is FBI pursuer Adam Frawley played by Jon Hamm with a refreshing touch of sadism. As Mac Crae's trigger happy sidekick Coughlin, Jeremy Renner is Cagney 2000 and the worse for it. Peter Postlewaite as a Whitey Bulger like florist walks away with acting honors. Better to watch two hours of an ugly grand actor emote than the flat handsomely chiseled features of the melancholy Townie Affleck who has as much range as Ahab at short. <br/><br/>Director Affleck does have a good eye for capturing the congested New England Town of Charlestown as well as Boston and his chase scenes really screech with suspense but the weight he accords the unreality of the films romantic aspects puts the breaks on The Town allowing it to advance no further as this self indulgent noir has a head on collision with a fairy tale ending that fades to a folk song over credits. <br/><br/>This is the second example of more is worse in The Friends of Eddie Coyle wanna be stakes. First there was the bloated The Departed with a roster of Easter hams and regurgitations of Scorcese violence and now this slick looking slam bang / implausible romancer. <br/><br/>The minor masterpiece Coyle choked with realism and an unromantic mood of taedium vitae that today's cool and Affleck's incurable romanticism just won't allow. It may look and taste good but that's because its filled with sugar."
"lasota_44","10","4","9","26 September 2010"," Affleck blows my mind again...
","The Town- Some of the best directors were former actors: Clint Eastwood, Robert Redford, Mel Gibson, and now the name that pops into my mind when I think of actors turning great director is Ben Affleck.<br/><br/>The Town is about a long-time heist criminal named Doug MacRay, played by the director Ben Affleck, who falls in love with a former hostage and now witness for the FBI with the only information that could get Doug's crew thrown into prison for life. And as if that wasn't enough drama, Doug's best friend and fellow crew member James Coughlin, played by Jeremy Renner (Hurt Locker), is a trigger-happy box of loose screws that is more than a little upset about Doug's new girlfriend and the fact that he wants to leave their hometown, Charlestown, for a simple life together in Florida.<br/><br/>Pursuing Doug and his crew is F.B.I. Special Agent Adam Frawley, played by Mad Men's John Hamm. Frawley is the classic asshole fed that we always see in the movies but with more of a dark-side. He doesn't exactly follow the rules and he has no qualms with shooting first and asking questions later.<br/><br/>As if that cast wasn't impressive enough, add Blake Lively, Chris Cooper, Titus Welliver, and Rebecca Hall as Doug's love interest and you know you're going to have a good time watching this.<br/><br/>The movie 'The Town' is based off of Chuck Hogan's novel 'Prince of Thieves' and while I have not read this movie I must assume that after watching this movie that it will be just as much as a thrill-ride.<br/><br/>I first got a taste of Affleck's directing skills when I bought the movie 'Gone Baby Gone' on recommendation from a friend. It quickly became my favorite movie which led to me reading the book by Dennis Lehane who quickly became my favorite author. So already, I was excited to see Affleck's next work.<br/><br/>The Town is what we like to call a ""comeback."" After Affleck did Gigli he was cast down on the mountain of fame left to do short cameos in films like Smokin' Aces where he was killed off in the first twenty minutes. And then in 2009 he was given a small role as a stoner in the Jason Bateman film 'Extract.' But now Affleck has reached the mountain peak again with his new movie at the top of the box office.<br/><br/>Who would I recommend this movie for? Well not for children, but everyone else, sure. While it may be a ""man's"" movie with hardcore action and plenty of violence to keep you cringing in your seat, there's still a thick plot and a love story being told within the film. The love story is enough to make female go ""ooo-and awww"" but not enough to where the men feel uncomfortable. I have to give Affleck one big piece of credit, this movie isn't a Jason Bourne, it's not anything with Jason Statham. It's not an attempt to get the blood rising and then leave you hanging. Ben brings you the thrills you want, but he never loses touch with the story and he always keeps the plot engaging and realistic.<br/><br/>With strong performances from all the cast, especially Renner, I have to say that this movie is definitely top notch. And for you ladies, there's a scene where Ben is doing some chin-ups, and it's obvious that Ben's been working out because his abs possibly rival Ryan Reynold's.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It had everything a good movie needs: Action, Crime, Humor, Romance, and a little bit of nudity. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 and I'm excited for Affleck's next directed movie."
"zardoz-13","10","4","9","19 September 2010"," Affleck Helms A Tour-de-Torce Bank robbery Thriller
","Ben Affleck sheds his perennial pretty boy image for the Boston-based crime thriller ""The Town"" that he stars in and co-scripted with ""Gone Baby Gone"" scenarist Aaron Stockard and freshman scribe Peter Craig. Instead, Affleck casts himself as an unshaven, blue-collar, day-laborer with close-cropped hair who works at a rock-breaking company. When he isn't smashing rocks into gravel, he leads a crew of criminals that gives the FBI a run for their money. This realistic, bullet-riddled, bank robbery/armored car heist actioneer qualifies as the best since director Michael Mann's ""Heat"" (1995) with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. ""The Town"" bristles with compelling characters, suspenseful situations, superbly staged robberies, but no special effects. This sizzling, white-knuckled, cops and robbers saga takes cinematic bank robbery capers to the next level. Indeed, ""The Town"" makes ""Takers"" look like the work of rank amateurs. The procedures that ""The Town"" criminals follow to pull off a heist constitutes the kind of material those old Hollywood movies could never have condoned for fear of serving as a tutorial for crooks. At the same time, ""The Town"" doesn't glorify the notorious characters that Affleck and co-star Jeremy Renner play. They pay for the consequences of their larcenous life style. Actress Rebecca Hall plays an innocent bystander who becomes Affleck's unlikely love interest, while Jon Hamm delivers a first-rate performance as a tenacious FBI special agent intent on taking down Affleck. The worst thing that you can say about ""The Town"" is that adheres to the police procedural formulaic, but Affleck directs with such verve that you won't be thinking about the formula.<br/><br/>""The Town"" opens with the factoid that the one-square mile area of Charleston, Massachusetts, has bred more bank robbers and armored-car thieves than any place in America. The first scene depicts the considerable attention to detail that these criminals take to keep themselves from being nabbed. Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck of ""Reindeer Games"") and his gang splash bleach on the crime scene to remove traces of their DNA. They don ghoulish Halloween masks and outfits, wield fully automatic submachine guns, and destroy anything that might help the authorities to identify them. First, they confiscate all the cell phones from employees and customers and then immerse them in an aquarium of water. Second, another gang member sabotages the surveillance cameras and zaps the memory storage devices for these cameras in a micro-wave oven. When somebody activates a silent alarm, the robbers take a bank employee, Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall), as a hostage, blindfold her, and bind her hands behind her back. Later, after driving her around to disorient her, they turn Claire loose. Naturally, they torch the stolen vehicle used for their getaway. During the heist, however, Claire catches a glimpse of a tattoo on the nape of the neck of Doug's psychotic, trigger-happy partner, James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner of ""The Hurt Locker""), but she doesn't divulge this important detail to FBI Special Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"") when he questions her. Basically, Coughlin warned her he would kill her if she informs the Feds about anything. Afterward, Coughlin wants to kill her, but Doug intervenes. He assures Coughlin that he will handle Claire.<br/><br/>Doug follows Claire to a laundry mat one day, and they strike up a conversation. Before long they are seeing each other casually. Doug doesn't tell Coughlin he is dating Claire. The relationship between Doug and Claire blossoms. Claire tells Doug that she works as a volunteer at the Boys and Girls center and saw a photo of Doug as a youngster. Doug remains guarded about his background He doesn't want to alarm Claire who eventually takes him home for an evening. Previously, Doug drank, gambled, and barbecued with his closest friend James and his sister Krista Coughlin (Blake Lively of ""Accepted""), and they regard him as family. Krista and he have been casual lovers. Although she has had a baby, Doug denies that the child belong to him. Krista thrives on Oxycontin and cocaine. Earlier, James killed another man who had planned to kill Doug. James spent 9 years in prison for the killing. He uses this incident as a means to cement the bonds between Doug and himself. Doug, James, Desmond Elden (newcomer Owen Burke) and Albert 'Gloansy' Magloan (George Carroll of ""The Crack Down"") work for a genuinely sleazy individual, Fergus 'Fergie' Colm (Pete Postlethwaite of ""The Usual Suspects""), nicknamed 'the Florist,' who has an inside track on all the jobs they pull. The Feds have never been able to nail either Fergie or Doug, but they have piled up mountains of information about them. For instance, they know Doug's dad, Stephen MacRay (Chris Cooper of ""The Kingdom""), is a convicted criminal in prison, and they keep tabs of every visit Doug makes to see his father.<br/><br/>Eventually, Frawley discovers Claire's affair with Doug. If this doesn't complicate matters enough, Coughlin demands that the crew pull another robbery. This time they are taking down an armored car, but Doug has already developed a case of cold feet because of the impact that Claire has exerted on him. Doug wants to quit, leave Boston, and start anew with Claire. Doug has always been plagued because his mom left him when he was age six. Stephen has struggled to make Doug forget about his mom. Matters come really come to a head when Doug and Coughlin almost botch an armored car heist. Meanwhile, the sagacious Feds play their ace card to obtain information about Doug and James. They go after Krista. They threaten not only to bust Krista for illicit drug use, but also they send her young daughter into state care. Finally, Fergie has a really big job planned that will land them $3.5 million. Doug refuses to pull the heist until Fergie threatens to kill Claire and chemically neuter him. ""The Town"" erupts with a bang and ends with a bang with surprises galore in between."

","I saw this melodrama and I failed to get excited about it. For some reason I was unable to connect to the characters, nor to the story of this group of Boston native young Irish bank robbers. Even the bank robbery scenes seemed boring, despite of how cleverly they were devised. Despite that there is redemption for some of the characters' whose sad life stories I heard in the movie, I failed to feel any consolation even when revenge was exacted upon them. The love story between the kidnapped bank manager and the leader of gang was unrealistic, at least to me. What I think was also a goof in the film was that the bank manager lived in an apartment complex, but at the end of the movie she is seen digging in a garden that I never saw before in the film. Here she finds a duffel bag full of money and an orange that looked as fresh as if it were just picked off a tree, despite that weeks had gone by since her love interest left town. Steve H."
"ron-fernandez-pittsburgh","5","3","6","20 December 2010"," Not bad...but
","This could have been a better movie if it were not so improbable. At one point several police cars are chasing the ""baddies"" and they can't even blow one tire out let alone capture them? IMPROBABLE for sure. Also, seems something was left out when the Feds found out the Claire character is seeing the Affleck character. Wouldn't they assume she was in on the bank robbery? They DID ask her to contact her lawyer, but there was no development there. Obviously they did believe she was innocent of knowing him before the robbery, but it would have been an interesting point delving into that plot point. Also, in the credits there is a cast listing of CLAIRE'S LAWYER, so there must have been a scene of some sorts proving her innocence. Still, a pretty watchable movie if one can suspend reality. Some have mentioned the Kris character should have been deleted, but if it were, how would the Feds know about the Fenway robbery? She's the one who told them."
"supah79","7","3","6","9 December 2010"," Solid effort, but still flawed
","I am actually pretty conflicted about Ben Affleck's new feature 'The Town'. I liked his previous effort Gone Baby Gone. Like The Town, that movie was filled with dangerous looking characters, good actors, an interesting script and the steady hand of a director in control. The surprise of Gone Baby Gone is well, without trying to be funny: Gone. We now know that Affleck has the capacity to make Eastwood- or Lumet-like movies. I'm disappointed that Affleck hasn't made the real step to become that topnotch director. A director who works out improbabilities in the script. But to say that The Town is a bad movie would do it no justice. It's actually pretty good. It tries to be in the same category as Heat, but has too many improbabilities to be in that category.<br/><br/>I am not all that surprised that Affleck made a 4 hour (!) first cut of this movie. Because I think this movie needs that kind of running time to make it's full impact. I had the same feeling with Copland. Because of different reasons Affleck had to trim his movie back to it's 2 hour and somewhat minutes for the studio to give it the go-ahead. The 2 hours left on the cutting-floor have to be character development. It's that simple. We hardly get to know all the interesting characters in this movie (including the 2 other members of the gang). We find out at the very last (well, me at least) that it's his best friends sister who clings to him with her baby. His character MacCrady does the moody-thing just a bit too much, without really explaining. Too bad the studio couldn't compromise. A 3 hour cut could have made this better. But I guess only Cameron and Mann are allowed to make 3 hour movies.<br/><br/>Also, some action taken by it's characters had me scratching the back of my head. The FBI seems to work with tactics from the 1970's. When the ambulance leaves the stadium, it is not riddled with bullets, when there was an intense exchange of fire not long before. But the driver dies in the following crash. Trainstations are not riddled with cops, so a convict can just take the train to freedom? The cops on the street don't have MacCrady's profile and face implanted on their brain, seeing he shot at cops and all? And the biggest one: the girl really falls for him? Really? Like Gone Baby Gone, the ending is too soft, too pleasing and too easy.<br/><br/>But let's not be too negative. Affleck gives his The Town an authentic (as far as I can tell, never been) feeling. The character speak and move like they have lived in Charlestown most of their lives. There isn't a line a dialog that sounds cheesy or out of place. Although I really don't know what the FBI-man meant with the size of bills thing.<br/><br/>The actors are their characters. That's because they are good actors working with good material, but Affleck knows how to get it out of them. The action-scene's are well photographed and not implausible just to make you go 'whhooaaa'. But with the always excellent Robert Elswitt behind the lens, that's a certainty.<br/><br/>If there's a way to get the studio to sign off on a 4 hour cut on Blu Ray, let me know Ben. Because I would love to see that one. With the version we have now, I still recommend it, but I still feel that bits and pieces are missing."
"Ryan_MYeah","9","3","6","6 December 2010"," A tense, and gripping crime thriller from start to finish. Ben Affleck is no one hit wonder.
","Recently I got a chance to see Ben Affleck's latest crime drama, The Town, based on the book ""Prince of Thieves"" by Chuck Hogan.<br/><br/>In the film, Affleck plays Doug MacRay, a man in league with a band of bank robbers recruited by a threatening flower shop owner, and crime boss. After a recent heist involving taking a bank manager (Played by Rebbecca Hall) hostage, and later releasing her, Doug begins to charm her, and the two seem to hit it off well. However, complications arise from not only Doug's closest friend, Jem (The Hurt Locker's Jeremy Renner), but he's also ceaselessly pursued by FBI agent Adam Frawley (Played by Jon Hamm), who will do any and all things possible to bring Doug to justice.<br/><br/>The movie is essentially two things: A) Proof that Affleck's directorial debut Gone Baby Gone was far from a fluke, and B) In my opinion, a better movie than Gone Baby Gone. His film is expertly structured, and set up, thanks to the efforts of he, and his co-writers Peter Craig, and Aaron Stockard. It can be a risky move to write, direct, and star in your own movie, but Affleck handles them all with adequate balance, and the result is a film that suffers from very few faults, most of which aren't even worth noting.<br/><br/>He really is making a comeback into the acting world, taking on a role perfect for him, and always taking it just as serious as is necessary, and shares great chemistry with Rebbecca Hall, who is also a great fit for her role. One of the more interesting mentions is Jeremy Renner, who leaves a lasting impression with his chilling, but quietly careful performance, and also worth mentioning is Jon Hamm, whose character is not quite afraid to embrace a subtle dark side of himself while trying to capture these criminals. Other fine examples of casting include small, but vital supporting roles by Pete Postlethwaite, and Chris Cooper.<br/><br/>It's expertly cast, and scripted, as well as handsomely crafted. The action scenes of the film are pretty nail-biting, fast paced, and well staged, specifically a very tense car chase through the narrow streets of Charlestown, complimented brilliantly by Robert Elswit's energetic cinematography, the highly involving sound mix by Gregg Landaker, Steve Maslow, and David J. Schwartz, as well as the brooding underscore by Harry Gregson-Williams and David Buckley.<br/><br/>It's a great film that's not only an engaging crime drama, but also a gripping action thriller.<br/><br/>And for that, The Town earns ***1/2 out of ****"

","THE TWON – CATCH IT ( A ) Wow Ben Affleck directed another exceptional good movie after ""Gone Baby Gone"". From the first scene till the end, The Town keeps you on the edge of your seat. The thrill, excitement, fear, aggression and emotions are well presented in the movie. Boston car chase scene and the ending was captivating, I was literally holding my breath the whole time. Ben Affleck, after a really long time shine on the screen not only as director but as an actor too. Jeremy Runner gave a brave performance after ""The Hurt Locker"", he truly kept me captivated and though he is playing a Bad Guy, you still feel bad in the End for him! Rebecca Hall was the emotion and love in the movie, I think standing up next to Jeremy Renner & Ben Affleck is in itself an achievement. Blake Lively, I'm a huge Gossip Girl fan and initially its hard for me to take her out from her Glam Doll Serena Van Der Woodson Avatar but soon she just rip off that image with her Southern Boston Dirty body language. Though, she didn't have much scope in the movie but still she gave power house performance in her role. Jon Hamm did a good job along side Owen Burke, Slaine and Chris Cooper. Overall The Town is a great, edge of the seat thrilling, emotional and memorable ride. One of the best movie about Bank Robbers. Must Watch it!"
"Likes_Ninjas90","9","3","6","1 November 2010"," The Town is a mature and intelligent thriller, layered with subtext relating to crime cultures developed and extended through family ties
","In one Boston neighbourhood, Charlestown, there are more bank robberies committed than any other area. We are told this is because of the legacies of crime forged between fathers and sons, as crime cultures are passed down from one generation to another. Lowly crim Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) is part of a professional bank robbing gang. He and his men are assigned jobs through a thug named Fergus (Pete Postlethwaite), who runs a flower shop as a front for his operations. One of the key members of Doug's group is psychopath James (Jeremy Renner) whose sister Krista (Blake Lively) might also be carrying Doug's child. During a bank robbery, complete with skeleton masks on their faces, the gang take a bank manager in Claire (Rebecca Hall) hostage in case she saw anything but then free her without harm. To keep tabs on who she is contacting Doug follows her and then asks her out as she has not seen his face. He discovers that she is in contact with the FBI and that honest cop Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) is hot on the gangs' heels. Doug's relationship with Claire starts to sweeten, even as he tries his best to keep it a secret from the rest of the group and he starts to think about turning his life around. <br/><br/>This adaptation of Chuck Hogan's crime novel ""Prince of Thieves"" is a thrilling follow-up to Ben Affleck's directional debut Gone Baby Gone (2007). The Town, like its predecessor, has both a level of authenticity and appreciation for its sense of place. Boston is evidently a place close to Affleck's heart, not only because it is his hometown, but because of how critical the working class culture of the area is to his screenplay again. The criminals here are not just caricatures of thugs but regularly people with some resemblance of an inner life. The men have jobs from construction workers, to security experts and florists. Krista too has to balance handling the stolen money from the gang, along with raising her baby by herself. These might seem like trivial additions, but they work to build the humanity in some of these characters and why we should be interested in them. They are ordinary people, who somewhere along the line, have become misguided about what is acceptable in society. The film smartly attributes this to their upbringings and there is a very moving back-story relating to Doug's parents that compliments his need to change throughout the film. Impressively, the film works as both a social comment and a thriller too because the action scenes are intensely staged. The daytime bank robbery at the beginning of the film, not unlike the opening of The Dark Knight (2008), is a violent and viscerally charged heist that skilfully captures the spontaneity and professionalism of an armed robbery. Some of the procedures by the crims here, like pouring chemicals over the equipment to eliminate fingerprints, suggest that a lot of research went into this aspect of the film. Given the power of this sequence and several others, it is thankful that Affleck is intelligent with the film's pacing and momentum. Lesser films tend to clump action sequences together so that they become indistinguishable. Here, each set piece is deliberately placed to drive the narrative, rather than inflate it, and as such they hold a much greater and lasting impact on the audience's involvement. <br/><br/>The same grittiness applied to the setting is evident in the characters and performances themselves too. Ben Affleck impresses in front of the camera, as much as he does behind it. With a shaven head, a baggy tracksuit and thick Boston accent, his image as a low ranking hood is thoroughly convincing because he has entirely removed the gloss of his early career. More significantly, he contrasts his slow burning intensity and toughness with genuine sincerity. From the very opening his compassion towards Claire is visible. His performance is therefore essential in developing the idea of ordinary people on the wrong path and he succeeds entirely here with a quietly restrained human performance. Jeremy Renner too tops his performance in The Hurt Locker with a role that is even more reckless and unpredictable than he was in that film. It is quite an accomplishment that we still care about lowlifes like him in the film though. Rebecca Hall is suitably tentative as Claire and Jon Hamm, who might have been given a more superfluous role in a lesser script, is characterised interestingly with more sinister aspects to his character. The way that he works to trap people to break open his case is indicative of this. <br/><br/>The Town is a mature and intelligent thriller, layered with subtext relating to crime cultures developed and extended through family ties, which work to corrupt the lives of ordinary lower class people. Ideas such as these provide the film with a platform for a number of exciting and intensely staged action sequences that are purposefully placed and constructed. Adding to this are a host of top performances, including Ben Affleck in a career best role, making this very gritty crime film sophisticated entertainment."

","A good-guy bank robber? It actually works if you have some empathy for the characters and the environment they come from. Ben Affleck is completely credible, with a back story to support why his character does what he does. As an actor, his basic likability makes it possible to understand the internal struggle, and his difficulty in being the caring boyfriend and a brutal thug.<br/><br/>The film has been faintly praised by some for its Boston backgrounds, but that is unfair. With those streets, populated by the likes of Pete Postlethwaite and Chris Cooper, this is an environment that drags you in by your collar.<br/><br/>The action of the heists and the inevitable car chases are as good as Ronin, and that says a lot."
"FilmRap","8","3","6","27 September 2010"," The Boston Police Department is not going to like this movie.
","Ben Affleck obviously dove head first into this film, being director, lead actor and co-writer. His character Doug MacRay is a home grown product of Charlestown section of Boston where there have been more bank robbers per capita than any other place in the U.S.A. He and his buddy James Coughlin played by Jeremy Renner and a bunch of other guys blast open the movie pulling off one of those heists. There is plenty of action in this movie including one of best car chase scenes that we have seen since Gene Hackman in the French Connection quite a while ago. You really get to know and understand MacRay and can't help caring about him and rooting for his relationship with Claire Keesy (Rebecca Hall) the bank manager of the opening robbery who end up being sympathetic bed fellows. Casting Jon Hamm (of TV Mad Man fame) was a great choice as the opposing FBI agent along with Titus Welliver (the ""bad"" DA in the Good Wife TV series) who is his trusty assistant. The entire cast of characters is quite believable which is a tribute to their great acting, fast pace and the outstanding directing by Affleck who kept us on the edge of our seats. There also is a sensitive insight into how in some communities and families, young people get drawn into a life of crime from which it is very hard to extract themselves. The question is whether you can suspend reality and swallow the story line when the band of thieves faces down what seems to be the entire Boston PD including their SWAT teams and our hero ultimately attempts to do a payback to his beloved town.<br/><br/>FilmRap.net"
"goicuria","7","3","6","19 September 2010"," Average heist/action movie is not bad, not great.
","""The Town"" is OK, though nothing special, really. I just don't, or rather can't ever buy Affleck or Damon for that matter, as leading men. They simply don't have the skill, charm, or charismatic appeal of the seasoned pros for my money. In my opinion, their strengths are writing, producing, and directing. Those things and Robin Williams' performance is what made Good Will Hunting a good movie, not Ben nor Matt's acting abilities. The other thing that needs to be pointed out, is that the movie is based on a best-selling novel, which is basically almost always a sure-fire hit at the box office with a pre-built-in audience; which amounts to taking the safe road. The story is superb, and an added bonus is the authentic Boston location shots (although if you are a Bostonian, you can easily pick out some of the flaws in the location sequencing. During car chase scenes, for example, one frame they are in the North End, the next it is Bay Village, then Beacon Hill, back to the North End, etc. all within seconds. I know this is nitpicking, so that really is not a big deal. Of course, it is great to see Fenway Park in any movie and this one is no exception and delivers. Even though I did not read Prince of Thieves, (the novel that the film is based upon) there were quite a few times when I got the feeling that too much license may have been taken with story incidentals and plot development for the sake of the action-movie dollars and for fans of Affleck's work. The music soundtrack is almost non-existent or not very memorable, sounding at times like what used to merely be referred to as ""stock"". Jeremy Renner (who steals the show), Rebecca Hall, and Jon Hamm are far more interesting to watch than Affleck here, and their performances are about as solid as it can get in an action/heist drama of this sort. Is it a bad movie? By no means, if you ask me. Is it a great movie? Certainly not, in my opinion. Maybe as an inexpensively priced matinée, it succeeds, but I am happy that I was not prepared to pay top dollar and wait in a long line to see it. Although I had no expectations entering the theater, I still exited feeling that this is one of those films that is probably best left to DVD, cable, or large screen in the comfort of your home. As a heist movie, it is no ""Killing Zoe"", ""Dog Day Afternoon"", or ""Reservoir Dogs"" that's for sure. Give Ben Affleck a few more years or miles under his belt as a dramatic actor, and he just may someday develop into a great actor/director who doesn't feel the need or desire for so many close-ups and takes of what amounts to, well, Ben Affleck's rather limited repertoire of Ben Affleck faces."

","The Town takes us back to the lower class Irish Boston area backdrop from the Departed and puts it in a heist movie somewhat reminiscent of Point Break. The end result is a captivating and engrossing thriller that owes mostly to the interesting characters, action sequences and presentation than to the done to death heist movie Swiss cheese plot. We are asked again to sympathize with a bank robber Doug who's a heart of gold kind of guy that carries his automatic rifles to rob banks and to shoot at engine blocks of cop's cars.

"TonyHurtado","10","3","7","5 December 2010"," The Town, Great Movie!
","You know not allot of people say that they are excited to see a movie, but I was extremely excited for this movie to come out, since the get -go. I thought I would ruin the film for me if I continued to watch trailers and behind the scenes, but honestly it didn' reveal anything to me. I was excited for many reason's, one because my second favorite actor Jeremy Renner is in this film, I haven't seen Ben Affleck for a while, and it was from the producers of ""The Departed.""<br/><br/>The Town is an instant classic in my book. There were no mistakes through out the progression of the film. John Hamm was perfect in his role as FBI Agent Adam Frawley. There was some comedy in the film that I enjoyed, and the good thing is that the comedy did not ruin the film. There are also some many twists and turns in the film that you have to pay attention to the film. The film has many genres, love, deceit, action, drama, and adventure.<br/><br/>The basic gist of the story is Ben Afflecks character, Doug MacRay is trying to get out of the robbing business, he had been grown up with because of his father Stephen MacRay (Chris Cooper). Although he wants to get out he has to face many obstacles, like family, friends, FBI, and fellow robbers. James Coughlin (James Renner) is the major factor in preventing Doug from leaving the mob. He is the loose cannon, who just wants to rob rob rob.<br/><br/>I loved this film, I truly believe it is one of the best films made in 2010. I would rate this with a solid 10 out of 10 stars for all the effort put into the film. One last thing I want to comment on is the gun fight towards the end. It was great because they included no music to make the fight seem more realistic, which I thought was a great idea. Now allot of people will say the just wanted to copy the gun fight in the movie Heat. I think they didn't, but if they did, they did a hell of a better job than Heat did so yeah I loved this film."
"lizziebeth-1","10","3","7","7 November 2010"," Oscar contender is Ben Affleck's second bite at a hometown magnum opus. Exhilarating and honest film about how children inherit the sins of their fathers
","We all know Affleck the actor.<br/><br/>In his latest crowd-pleaser, and only the second feature he's directed, Affleck the actor limbers up like he's practicing Tai-Chi. He simply glides through his character Doug MacRay in The_Town(2010) like the hockey skater he is in real life, never breaking as his cameras shoot him unblinking through confession scenes.....daring himself repeatedly to spot past camera. Many good actors still can't do that (eg Javier Bardem, Eat_Pray_Love(2010)). According to IMDb, Affleck has ""21 wins & 38 nominations"" in addition to being an Oscar-winning co-writer of Good_Will_Hunting(1997), yet he's probably a much better director than that. It'd be critically blunt (and a little naive) to charge Affleck with lacking acting ability at this late stage.<br/><br/>The real surprise is that he has a VOICE. Audiences can appreciate Affleck's contemporary-yet-timeless directorial themes of children inheriting the sins of their....parents (mother and father respectively, so far).<br/><br/>For The_Town, he's attracted top-grade talent both in front and behind the camera---prime example being his Oscar-winning (There_Will_Be_Blood(2007)) cinematographer, now DoP Robert Elswit, whose fly-on-the-wall camera lingers in one scene on a fight, leaving the baby in the room to cry off-camera. Another throwaway beat was his filming the obstructed face of a coin-op laundry attendant, flagging that MacRay's inner focus is on something else. Audiences are charmed by the intimacies set up with such carefully casual imprecision amidst the bustle. Can anyone say ""Oscar""?<br/><br/>MacRay/Affleck's divergent reactions to his two girlfriends in The_Town(2010)---his face captured by Elswit---reveal the wrung-out young lover struck by the wrong kind of sex---or life---he's having. Touches of Affleck's Holden McNeil from Chasing_Amy(1997) now show up in MacRay's confession to Claire (Rebecca Hall), as his romantic transition painfully crystallizes MacRay's inner shift from his ""Townies"".<br/><br/>The wonderful Second Unit (Directors Alexander Witt and Dylan Tichenor, uncredited) also threw in everything from 10"" hand-helds to helicopter shots, and zippy car-chase masters to explicate all the skittering vehicles. This eye for editing is obviously thanks to the talented Tichenor doubling as both SUD and film editor....another Oscar right there.<br/><br/>The_Town's silence/feedback signals effectively squeal across the audience's distress over its violent robberies; Affleck and Aaron Glascock's sound design succeeds precisely because this technique is now so little-used.<br/><br/>But a film that adorns MacRay's jailhouse visit of his father with real orchestral violins deserves serious kudos (another Oscar nom).<br/><br/>Affleck's second bite at a hometown magnum opus boasts an amazing cast, a gift to fans of his universalist films. His leading ladies, especially the adaptable Ms.Hall, allow The_Town to sidestep the gender-challenged sins of most similar male-demog films. <br/><br/>Titus Welliver (""local crime-fighter"" Dino Ciampa) is still the camera's darling even minus his mo' from GBG(2007), but I'm craving more scenes of Ciampa's career.<br/><br/>Pete Postlewaite looks haggard, which just hands Affleck a quip about 'Fergie''s features as an ex-boxer.<br/><br/>However, as action fans are bound to complain, this isn't wall-to-wall adrenalin; it's a drama-thriller only seemingly full of heists. There are only three, so it effortlessly avoids The_Hurt_Locker(2009)'s episodic traps. Affleck, Peter Craig & Aaron Stockard's authentic screenplay adaptation of Chuck Hogan's ""Prince of Thieves""---about America's most bank-robbery-ridden square mile---brings Charlestown's ""Irish omerta"" underworld richly to life. The action and drama are exquisitely balanced, and the film, thankfully, takes its own observations about generational criminality seriously.<br/><br/>The narrative does editorialise towards the end, but with an exemplary pace and universal appeal, The_Town plays like a contemporary Shawshank.<br/><br/>The pacing is so good because the director keeps most of his mysteries only for so long; the storytelling isn't manipulative (overly reliant on revelations). Affleck gives us enough information so we're unworried by unanswered questions, and his hints advance the plot. For instance, we know MacRay left that note for the FBI, but FBI SA.Frawley (a too greasy Jon Hamm) then passes it off onto Claire's loser lawyer---producing the biggest laugh of the film.<br/><br/>In homage to Yves Simoneau's 44_Minutes(2003) (true story fictionalised as Heat(1995)), Affleck climaxes the film with a realistic/exhilarating street shootout, with innocent cars driving in the police's line-of-sight. I don't know HOW LONG I've craved such a realistic GSW, but Affleck delivers an amazing smashed jaw effect in the hail of bullets. His well-adjusted action even guarantees some ironic visual comedy, as first a little boy, then a lone cop in a black-and-white get alternatively mesmerised/gobsmacked by a carload of bank-robbers in creepy nun drag.<br/><br/>This type of organic (unforced) gentle humour turns out to be one of the best things about the film. Affleck's comedy is situational, logical and fresh, and always a surprise. It's wonderful to sit amongst an audience whose peals of well-tracking laughter release all their stress. Tongue-in-cheek, Affleck deftly has MacRay utter incognito concern for his robbery victim, then has Claire let him off the hook with ""It wasn't your fault""---when it literally was.<br/><br/>The clever director has learned lessons from his prior success: this time Affleck's prologue contains minimal sombre narration. There are no opening credits, but Affleck's gravelly voice does its job admirably. His brogue is Bostonian; perhaps he plumbed actual memories for Jem Coughlin(Jeremy Renner)'s pistol-whipping his surrogate brother MacRay to stop him leaving his criminal niche. Astonishingly, AO.Scott (NY-Times) finds this ""Townie"" relationship not atavistic ENOUGH.<br/><br/>Affleck has even stronger observations about neighbourhoods. What MacRay does to the local crime boss still trying to rule him through his ""lovely new girlfriend"" and his father Stephen(Chris Cooper, looking in his single scene every bit the Walpole lifer he plays) is a lesson to all victims of pyramid schemes.<br/><br/>Naturally, critics are now comparing Affleck to Clint Eastwood, for Eastwood's somewhat similar directorial road, and Mystic_River(2003). <br/><br/>And yet I doubt audiences will buzz about Town(2010) as they had over Inception(2010). This is the more honest/satisfying film, but it's not terribly escapist, concluding that ""No matter how much you've changed, you still have to pay the price for what you've done"".(10/10)"

","This takes place in Charlestown--a small city in Boston. Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) is the leader of a gang of bank robbers. It was a tradition passed down to him by his father (Chris Cooper). At one robbery he falls in love with the manager of the bank named Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall). He starts to romance her NOT letting on he's a robber. His trigger happy gang member friend James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) is not happy. Meanwhile FBI Special Aggent Adam Frawley (Joe Hamm) is on hot on his trail.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck (who co-wrote, stars in and directs) was born and raised in Cambridge--a suburb of Boston. He knows the city and towns inside out and puts his knowledge to good use. I was born and raised near Boston too and it was fun to see it on the big screen. He correctly uses locations unlike other movies (1994's ""Blown Away"" had Boston City Hall used as the police department which caused a LOT of laughter when I saw it). He KNOWS how to direct--he uses slow-motion, different pitches of sound and never slows down. There are three exciting fast car chases in the movie which are incredible to watch. The one through the tiny streets of the North End must have been a nightmare to block and clear. There are also tons of shootouts but they (thankfully) aren't that bloody and there's a big explosive ending at Fenway Park. So why is this very very good but not great? The plot. It's been done millions of times before. There are no surprises here and it turns into more of a character study than an action movie. But it's well-acted and extremely well-directed so you're never really bored (even though it does have its slow spots).<br/><br/>Affleck easily gives his best performance EVER here. He flawlessly captures the Charlestown accent and his character is multi-layered and sympathetic. Hall doesn't have too much to work with but she's very good and beautiful. Hamm (who can be good) is just so-so in his role. He looks terrible and sometimes just seems to be going by the numbers in terms of acting. The biggest surprise is Renner. He has the meatiest role (the psycho gang member) and he UNDER plays it...and not very well. He seems muted and is always pulling back. Maybe he was directed that way but it doesn't work. There also Blake Lively as his sister. Her accent is a BIT too strong at times but she's very good.<br/><br/>A very very good movie. Just not for kids. There's tons of swearing and has strong violence. I give it an 8."
"bobsgrock","8","3","7","24 September 2010"," The Restoration of Ben Affleck.
","More often than not, an actor in Hollywood will experience severe disability in terms of being able to choose scripts and quality movies. Ben Affleck has suffered from such a problem, taking the easy road during the middle period of his career in such clunkers as Armageddon, Pearl Harbor and Gigli. Yet, he has begun a turnaround with a solid role in Hollywoodland and his directing debut in the vastly underrated Gone Baby Gone. Now he's at it again, taking the same type of material he used in that 2007 film and focusing on the nature of bank robberies in a small suburb of Boston.<br/><br/>In stretching his limits and going beyond his previous work, Affleck takes on the role of director, co-writer and lead actor here and does great work in all three. His acting has been criticized in the past for his lack of toughness and seemingly automatic ability to cry. Yet, here, he holds back much of the melodramatic emotion and lets his expressive face do more of the acting. For that reason alone, he gives perhaps his best performance. It also helps that he's working with great actors here; Jeremy Renner gives another memorable performance as a trigger-happy childhood friend of Affleck's willing to go to any length in a robbery to provide for his family. Jon Hamm is solid as the FBI agent right on the robbers' trail and Rebecca Hall deserves more buzz than she will get for this role as Claire, a bank manager taken hostage by Affleck's crew only to start a relationship with him.<br/><br/>My main problem with this film was the casting of Blake Lively as Renner's younger sister, Krista, a single mother drug dealer and former lover of Affleck's. Lively, as beautiful as she is, gives a very melodramatic and seemingly amateurish performance; at times she is barely discernible. In truth, she is out of depth with nearly all these actors and comparing her to Hall just blows her out of the water. Still, the great Chris Cooper comes to save the day in just one powerful scene as Affleck's father. Perhaps the key scene, it explores family memories, regret and motivation all at the same time. It is scenes like this that prove Affleck's growing ability as a director.<br/><br/>As for the film overall, it's very good but not great. I would hesitate to call it one of the best of 2010 only because we've seen this story before in better films like The Departed. Still, the quiet scenes are moving and poignant, the action sequences are startlingly violent and gripping and the final scene is one of great nostalgia and emotional depth. The most gratifying thing to come out of The Town is the fact that Ben Affleck is back in a big way. This film and Gone Baby Gone prove he's no longer that arrogant punk in Gigli or Pearl Harbor. Here, he's a man proved, tough and worthy. I certainly look forward to his next work as a director; his future is bright in all aspects."
"mattbaxter72","9","3","7","24 September 2010"," I'm puttin' this whole town in my rear view mirror
","According to Scott Fitzgerald, there are no second acts in American lives. Which just goes to show how little he knew; Ben Affleck could tell him otherwise, and it's easy to see what attracted him about this story. This is about a man searching for another chance, and a way of escaping the town that forms his prison.<br/><br/>It's also about robberies, of course. There are three in total, at the start, in the middle and at the end of the movie, but while all three are superbly staged and shot, they're more punctuation than the main point of the plot. It's really about Affleck's character, trapped by circumstance, by family and ultimately by blackmail, and his attempts to escape the very grim destiny represented by his father, who will have to 'die five times' before he gets out of prison.<br/><br/>It's also a romance, of a sort, and one that plays out believably. Without giving too much away, this may be the first movie I've seen that genuinely explores the consequences of a robbery for the victims, and Affeck's character sees for the first time the damage he does. There is no glamour here. Robbers damage people, even if they don't shoot anyone, and in the end they're as damaged as anyone else.<br/><br/>Everyone in the movie is great, especially Jeremy Renner, Rebecca Hall and Pete Postlethwaite in a cameo that moves from minor character to a force of pure, blackest evil. But in the end it's Affleck's film, as actor and director. He's earned his second chance, in spades. It's no surprise that he wanted to make a movie about a man who's looking to atone for his past sins. What will be a surprise, at least to some people, is how good - and how deep and serious - this film is."
"bobbobwhite","9","3","7","24 September 2010"," Best movie of the year so far for me
","Ben Affleck has hit full stride with this taut, scary crime thriller. All aspects ring so true, from the superb caper planning and preparation to the actual caper timing and interactions with victims to after the caper is done and the money is in hand and causing all kinds of divisive thoughts and actions. The ensemble acting was uniquely superb overall, and that shows so true that Ben conveyed exactly what he wanted from the cast, the surest sign of a great director, and a resulting great film.<br/><br/>The best lesson to be learned from this terrific film, if one is learned, is that abjectly insular upbringings such as those shown in the Irish Charlestown section of Boston, are almost totally determining of most people's eventual fate if a fierce and unshakable attitude is not taken to get out and thus eliminate those strait-jacket forces holding one back from liberating self-improvement. That it is exactly the same in Harlem, East L.A, or Bensonhurst is proof positive of its eventual destructive nature. The same can be said of a religious or drunken or drugged or parentally self-absorbed household/community or any other form of severely constricting environment. One must get out forever to fully realize one's true self and destiny.<br/><br/>This film was much more to me than a crime caper. It was a crucial human lesson in how to correct an unfortunate circumstance of birth, that of being forced into a restrictive corner in life due to being born in a certain place. When that happens, everyone must do as Ben did in this story..........work your a$$ off to get out no matter what it costs temporarily. It will pay off in the end much more than any caper ever could, and that is what I thought was the most important message in this terrific film."

","I saw The Town, last weekend and it lives up to its hype. I love Jon Hamm from Mad Men, and he gets to show his acting chops as an FBI agent, with his own demons, chasing a gang of Boston bank robbers. Hamm's character, SSA Farley dubs the gang the ""not effing around"" gang, because they are ruthlessly efficient in throwing the authorities off their trail. The gang hails from an area of Boston called Charlestown, known for producing bank robbers, a ""skill"" passed down from father to son. <br/><br/>The police and FBI are fairly certain they know the members of the gang, but there is never any forensic evidence to tie them to the crime scenes. Ben Affleck does double duty as director and, plays Doug McCray, also known as the Architect, because he plans the heists with absolute precision, so that no one gets hurt and they don't get caught. Of course there is always the crazy, reckless guy in the gang who is itching to shoot someone, and James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) fills that role admirably. He plays crazy very well. Why is it that the sane gang member is always beholden to the crazy gang member in some way???<br/><br/>The plot centers around a bank job that results in Coughlin ""tuning up"" the manager, giving the assistant manager, Clair Keesy (Rebecca Hall) an opportunity to trip the silent alarm. McCray sees her do it, but doesn't let on and Coughlin decides to take her hostage for them to make their getaway. They let her go after they escape, only to find she lives in Charlestown a few blocks away. They fear she somehow might identify them even though they were heavily disguised. None of the others have the stomach for murder, but Coughlin starts talking ominously about ""taking care of her."" McCray assures him he will handle things with Claire, and in the process falls in love with her. Claire doesn't recognize him and still bruised from the trauma of the robbery, is drawn into a relationship with him. <br/><br/>The local mob boss then taps the gang for the heist of a lifetime at Fenway Park the morning after a big game. McCray at first refuses, but after they threaten Claire, he agrees. Can McCray pull one last job, get the girl and change his life? It's a tall order, for sure. <br/><br/>Ultimately the film is about redemption, with some justice mixed in for good measure. In the end McCray, despite the bleakness that defines his life, hangs onto hope, and ""hope"" as someone once said, ""is a good thing."""

","'THE TOWN': Five Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Ben Affleck, like many 'A' list celebrities, has had a career of pretty big ups and pretty low downs. He broke on to the scene as a regular in Kevin Smith movies, first as a supporting antagonist in 'MALLRATS' and then as the romantic lead in the critically acclaimed 'CHASING AMY'. He followed that up by winning an Oscar for co-writing 'GOOD WILL HUNTING', with buddy Matt Damon, and was poised for super stardom as well as critical darling fame but instead he went for almost solely the paycheck and did one big, mostly critically panned, blockbuster after another. Then he made four critical and financial duds in a row in 2003 and 2004 ('GIGLI', 'PAYCHECK', 'JERSEY GIRL' and 'SURVIVING Christmas') and smartly laid low and disappeared for a couple years after that. He took some time to 'reinvent himself' and broke back on to the scene in 2006 with a Golden Globe nominated performance in 'HOLLYWOODLAND' (as well as a small impressive ensemble turn in 'SMOKIN' ACES') and then surprised almost everyone with his critically showered directorial debut in 'GONE BABY GONE' (which he also co-wrote the screenplay). He stayed behind the camera and let brother Casey star in what became one of the most critically acclaimed movies of 2007. Now he's back co-writing and directing again to even more impressive results (as well as starring this time around) with 'THE TOWN' which is easily one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>In the film Affleck plays anti hero Doug MacRay the leader of a team of bank robbers living in Charlestown, a neighborhood in Boston that (as the movie informs us very early on) is the world's capitol for bank robberies (as well as other crimes). Apparently crooks are bread there and the business is passed down from father to son. While pulling a heist, at the opening of the movie, Doug and his crew take a bank manager (played by Rebecca Hall) hostage. They let her go only to discover she lives just a few blocks away from them. Doug takes it upon himself to find out how much information she knows and might be giving to the authorities and ends up falling for her. This causes drama with his best friend James (played by Jeremy Renner, last year's Oscar nominee for 'THE HURT LOCKER') who also is upset with Doug's plans of skipping town (after of course 'one more big job'). There's additional conflict brought on by two FBI agents (played by 'MAD MEN's Jon Hamm and 'LOST's Titus Welliver, the 'Man in Black') whom are trying to find enough evidence to put the boys away for good. Blake Lively co-stars as Jame's single mother sister and Doug's ex girlfriend who's had her problems with drugs.<br/><br/>The film is rich in character drama and intriguing dialog which makes the action that much more compelling and the action is breathtaking; it's believable and gritty as well as thrilling and fast paced. It kind of puts the viewer in an odd place seeing as your kind of influenced into rooting for the 'bad guys', which seems more and more common in film lately. That's the power of film though; a movie like this can present these guys to you, who do horrible things, and you still end up feeling sorry for them and relating to them on some level. A great deal of that is thanks to the writing and Affleck's amazing directing. He has such a key eye for interesting visuals that it's kind of remarkable to think he starred in so many cheesy half ass-ed movies. The acting is all outstanding as well especially Affleck and Renner (who makes a great 'wild card'). The film is based on the award winning novel 'Prince Of Thieves' by Chuck Hogan which won the Hammett Prize in 2005 for 'excellence in crime writing'. The film already has a ton of Oscar buzz around it and I predict it will at least get a best picture nod and hopefully directing for Affleck as well. Some say it might be a little too violent for the Academy's taste but if you think about it three out of the last four movies to win best picture were all violent action films ('THE HURT LOCKER', 'THE DEPARTED' and 'NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN'). This film is in the same league as those, in my personal opinion better, I believe it will be long remembered as a classic crime drama. Yet another masterpiece from Ben Affleck!<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsKmmH2ftXQ"

","Like most of you here, I was very skeptical towards this movie. No way Ben Affleck can pull out something that's even half way decent. So before walking into the theater, I was actually trying to hate on this movie. I went in expecting the worst.<br/><br/>I remember it was a Friday evening. As I walked through the dark corridors to where they are showing the movie, I realized one thing. I realized if something goes wrong with the projector or the stereo, I can get a free pass for another movie. There I was hoping the above mentioned to happen. Please let the film burn out. Please allow the rats to chew that wire connected to the stereo.<br/><br/>I closed my eyes as a brief introduction on Charleston starts playing. I knew this 2-hour picture will slowly kill my eyes. I didn't want to go blind, not over a starring-Ben-Affleck video. But then I have paid $7 for the ticket. I couldn't allow myself to waste $7, so I decided to endure two hours of torture and pain, so the rest of humanity doesn't have to.<br/><br/>A couple of minutes in, we see a bunch of people in skull masks, let's say, repossessing cash which supposedly belongs to the bank. Early on we're already looking at predictable characters. You know one who is unorthodox and mentally off ; one who's clam and nice; and then there is always the damsel in distress. Never seen that before. And then somehow, the FBI would like to investigate on this robbery even though the crew works within the state. Nope, not the cops, but the feds. Of course we need a character from the ""good side"". There we go, a special agent who is a prick. Good.<br/><br/>That is pretty much how the synopsis goes. Bad guys do bad things. One falls in love with the damsel. Good guy tries to stop the bad guys. So yes, the storyline is far from innovative. At this point, you're probably hesitating on actually paying for the ticket. Same old storyline starring Ben Affleck. Hell it's even directed by Ben Affleck. It's OK to be pessimistic towards this movie.<br/><br/>As the movie keeps playing, I can't help but start having this idea of it being a rip off of the infamous Heat. You know the one with Pacino and De Niro, directed by Mann. What I didn't realize is, when I start drawing comparisons to the one and only Heat, this movie is actually good.<br/><br/>I ended up enjoying the movie. Yes, I went into the cinema wanting to hate the movie, and I ended up giving it an 8/10.<br/><br/>What truly made this joint good is its presentation. Like I said, there's nothing that made the script stood out. Ben Affleck did a hell of a job on giving us what we want to watch. Good shootouts, good suspense, interesting relationships. These are what we want in a drama film that doesn't have exceptionally good writing. He did just that. Well the sex scenes sucked but they only last for around 2 minutes in total so you can just look pass that.<br/><br/>The actors did a fine job. However, I would like to specifically point out that Jeremy Renner has the best performance as the sociopath in the film. He successfully became the character and put up an extremely convincing performance.<br/><br/>There is a great amount of adrenaline-pumping moments in the movie. Lots of shootouts as mentioned. These shootouts are executed flawlessly, though not perfectly. Sound effects are nicely done. Somehow Ben managed to keep emotions running high throughout these scenes. You will want someone to be killed. However, it's wasn't done perfectly because it was lacking intensity, somehow. Yes you want someone to get shot but you don't feel the intensity. Don't ask me why. That is the feeling I get from these scenes. Perhaps it's the environment setting or the characters aren't moving enough. I don't know.<br/><br/>One of the larger problems is the character writing. Like I said, the characters are pretty much what you expect from a movie like this one. That fed, however, is unnecessarily not likable. The writer sculpted him as a prick but we don't get to see how does that affect anything. You just hate him because he's rude to everyone, making it impossible to root for him. What made the Heat's plot extremely interesting is allowing the viewers to be able to root for either the cops or the robbers. The Town could have done the same thing here, and I would have seriously thought about giving it a 9/10. But then, it didn't, so no 9. To sum things up, this movie is a great one and you should go see it. There is still no argument on whether if it's right up there with Heat, but it's good enough to draw comparisons. By the way, the ending is extremely uncalled for. Be prepared for that."

","I was one of the many folks who didn't respect Affleck's acting and when I would see he was going to star in a movie, I would avoid it. He was kind of a laughingstock in this regard. But no longer. He impressed me big time in this movie with his brilliant performance as a blue collar criminal in Boston, and was so compelling to watch in the role. I don't know what happened but his acting is top notch here and I can see him even earning an Oscar for this performance. Plus, the other main character in the movie, who is his sidekick and best friend, that actor also gave a worthy performance as a tough, loyal thug. Very good acting from both of them and it made their interplay fascinating to watch. And another good performance was Affleck's love interest in the film, played by an actress I have never seen before. She did well in her role. (Though not up to the standards set by Affleck and his buddy in the movie) <br/><br/>This movie has some heartrending scenes and is touching at times, but is not without its flaws. I feel there was some material that was unnecessary, like the long drawn out shootout at the end. It reminded me of the movie ""Heat"", but was not nearly as good. And the ending is also copied too much from the Shawshank Redemption. I'm guessing Affleck is a big fan of that movie, because he directed this movie, and the ending is basically an echo of Shawshank's ending, though with some minor differences.<br/><br/>Still, overall I have to give this movie high marks as a crime drama with depth and great characters, with an especially great performance by Ben Affleck. Yup, I am now a fan of his and am anxious to see him follow up with more powerful and meaningful movies like this one!"

Ben Afflec was awesome, and the plot kept me on the edge of my seat. A must see movie. Takes place in the mean streets of Boston, with a Great supporting cast.

But when its been done, its been done. I wonder if they considered the similarities before making it. I also heard that the movie is based on a true story but still. Set it Off wasn't a small film. It was nominated for several awards. Sorry I don't get how this is something new when Set It off was far more original and interesting. I gave the movie a 5 because of originality or lack thereof.

","After delivering us the beautiful movie Gone Baby Gone, Ben Affleck return to the big screen as both actor and director with his latest action-packed drama ""The Town"". This movie is the another proof of Affleck's intuition and knowledge of what a movie should deliver. He implements an interesting story that revolves around good developed characters by combining thrilling action scenes with dramatic personal issues. The depths of brotherhood and personal ego are explored along with the inner desire for changing which rises in each person in their lifetime.<br/><br/>During his travel to reach personal liberty, redemption and happiness, Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), an experienced thief tries to balance his way out of the business by trying to reason with his violent partner, James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), manage his personal feelings for Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) and leave his old and rusty life behind. The problem is he has to do all these things while Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm), an FBI agent is on his tail. The characters are very well written, the action scenes and the different situations that these thiefs are getting in are pretty realistic. The movie sets a dark tone from the beginning by bringing to the screen the differences between these two partners: James the impulsive one and Doug the reasonable. This conflict seems to take a different turn when Doug falls for a ""witness"" of one of their bank thefts, Claire Keesey. Despite the fights and disagreements, both find a way to remember that they're brothers till the end no matter what happens. Therefore, the subject of ""brotherhood"" has a really realistic approach. That's what impressed me about this movie: the realism. But that alone does not make a movie to be that good as this movie is being praised. What makes that is the perfect intersection of action and emotion. The only movie from this genre that succeeded so well to hit the audience on both the emotional level and pure action entertainment was ""Heat"", and that my friends was long time ago.<br/><br/>All the parts from this movie were chosen perfectly. Stand-outs being Jeremy Renner as James Coughlin, the violent and impulsive thief and Blake Lively as James's sister Krista, which was an actual alcoholic ""prostitute"" who had in the past a close relationship with Doug (Ben Affleck). These two portrayals of their characters got my attention and I'm not being naive if I say that they might have a shot at being nominated at the Academy Awards. Also, Ben Affleck did a great job but his directorial capabilities succeeds his acting skills by far. The cinematography was good, the sound was good, the effects were very realistic but what impressed me was the choice for the score, the background music which was pretty intense. Point is, this movie is easily one of the best action movies in the last couple of years and definitely one of the best in 2010. It has interesting storyline, good narrative drawing of the characters, a very good technical execution and it's both entertaining and touching at the same time."
"Bob_the_Hobo","8","2","4","24 November 2010"," Tough, Realistic, Well-Acted
","I very much enjoyed Ben Affleck's previous directorial effort ""Gone Baby Gone"", set in what seems to be crime filmmaker's paradise anymore, Massachusetts (Charlestown to be exact). This one seemed to be in the same vein and I liked the cast so I gave it a go.<br/><br/>Affleck runs a bank-robbery crew that includes Jeremy Renner, Slaine, and Desmond Elden. They've had a successful run so far, but things change when Affleck falls for a beautiful woman (Rebecca Hall) that the crew takes hostage (but releases). Meanwhile, an unrelenting FBI agent (Jon Hamm) is focused on bringing Affleck's crew down, using whatever means necessary. The group decides to agree on a hit by a gangster named the Florist (Pete Postelthwaite), and plan on it being their last.<br/><br/>This was a very enjoyable movie as well. I liked the absence of the political message and the move for more the ""Heat""-esque action film. Affleck's style is gritty and tough, and he does a great job with his source material. I've often said he's one of the most underrated people in Hollywood, and ""The Town"" reaffirms that belief.<br/><br/>While Ben Affleck is tried and true both in front and behind the camera, the rest of the cast is relatively unknown. Jeremy Renner, the up and coming actor who surprised us all in ""The Hurt Locker"", does a fantastic job as Affleck's second in command. Jon Hamm is much the same way, he's great on Madmen and he's right at home in the movie biz. Rebecca Hall and Blake Lively are beautiful ladies and wonderful actresses as well. Desmond Elden and Titus Welliver return from GBG as well, playing different characters. Finally Chris Cooper and Pete Postelthwaite only have a handful of scenes (Cooper has one) but they show why they're some of the best there are.<br/><br/>""The Town"" made a fine one-time viewing but probably won't stick with me as long as I had hoped. It's got great characters, chemistry, and action. Definitely recommended."
"colebt33-780-179547","8","2","4","28 October 2010"," A tense and gripping crime drama; definitely recommended
","I hadn't realized that Ben Affleck was directing now, I guess I haven't been paying as close attention as I thought I was. Apparently Mr. Affleck had also taken part in the directing of Gone Baby Gone (2007), another highly acclaimed film that I'm very intent on seeing, but for now I'll be talking about the Daredevil's newest film that I saw just last weekend, the current top rated film in America, The Town.<br/><br/>This is probably the best movie about bank robberies ever, and if you are a person who does work at a bank (like my mom does) then this movie will send you into paranoid overdrive.<br/><br/>The movie sets us in the scum infested city Charlestown in Boston, our attention focused towards a single, troubled group of people, who like so many in this god forsaken urban have been secreted to a life of crime. These people are aware of what they are and they accept it, and when you are brought up into this kind of world, the only really comfort you receive is the knowing that you are never alone. There is a sense of family between this torn group of people, an undenying sense of loyalty and responsibility, and when Doug McGray is forced to make the difficult decision to choose between the love of his life and the very people who he grew up with, there is a tensely engaging impute of emotional compelligness and fierce suspense into the wondering of who is going to be the first to pull the trigger on the people they love.<br/><br/>That is a very good script, wouldn't you agree? Involving, well thought through, and not the least bit predictable, and the weaving together of drama and romance is very engaging element.<br/><br/>And how about that cast? It's not often you get such a great team of actors to perform in the one movie. Jeremy Renner was wonderful, and Ben Afflek was excellent as the intense Doug McGray, probably one of his best portrayals ever.<br/><br/>The Town will be one of the most thrilling movies you will ever see in 2010. It's brilliant direction, engaging script, and monumental cast give plenty of recommendation for an Oscar nomination."
"moviexclusive","8","2","4","28 October 2010"," Affleck's return to home ground is a character-driven heist thriller that brims with excellent performances, gripping drama and intense action
","Ben Affleck returns to his native Boston for his sophomore directorial effort, ""The Town"", a tense and thrilling heist movie that, as many reviewers have already pointed out, establishes Affleck as a director to be reckoned with. Whereas his previous ""Gone Baby Gone"" was a character drama smaller in scope and dramatic intensity, Chuck Hogan's novel ""Prince of Thieves"" on which this movie is based offers potential for both intense action and gripping drama- and Affleck delivers on both counts.<br/><br/>The film's opening title card informs of the location of the story- Charlestown- that is very much a character in the movie in its own right. Here we are told, is a neighbourhood that has produced more bank robbers than any other, a bank robbery capitol of the United States, and a place where criminal livelihoods are handed down from father to son. Such is the case of Doug MacRay (Affleck), the smart leader of a gang of vicious and notoriously successful robbers, whose father (Chris Cooper in a brief but terrific cameo) is behind bars.<br/><br/>Doug and his buddies- most notably his hot-headed trigger-happy childhood friend Jim (Jeremy Renner)- are through and through products of their environment and they know no livelihood outside their lives of crime. One particular job (the film's brutally efficient opening sequence) leaves Doug questioning if he's ready to call it quits and start anew. Unlike Jim, there is genuine humanity in Doug, and it is this humanity that causes him to reach out and take bank manager Claire's hand (Rebecca Hall) to calm her down when she is too terrified to open the vault, to intervene later when Jim threatens to kill Claire and to finally establish a personal heartfelt connection with her.<br/><br/>The subsequent relationship between Doug and Claire is the heart of this morality tale and kudos to Affleck for handling it with much finesse. Indeed, it is to Affleck's credit as a director that their budding romance develops convincingly without any over-sentimentalising. It is also to Affleck's credit as an actor that he is able to keenly illuminate through this unlikely relationship the inner struggles his character Doug is going through. Affleck too shares a lovely chemistry with Hall, his brooding intensity complementing Hall's refreshing simplicity.<br/><br/>Almost two-thirds of the movie is spent carefully delineating Doug's attempt at a redemptive change in his life and the effect of the various characters in his life. With Claire represents the only upshot at this change, Doug has to contend with the borderline psychotic Jim, the local crime kingpin Fergie Colm (Pete Postlethwaite) and a zealous FBI agent (Mad Men's Jon Hamm) fast on his tail. Affleck does a fair job balancing these disparate plot threads, though, compared to the book, parts like Doug's poisonous past with Jim's sister and single mom Krista (Blake Lively) as well as Doug's other partners in crime are given particularly short shrift.<br/><br/>Still, Affleck has done marvellously at translating the atmosphere of the book to the big screen. That shouldn't come as a surprise to those who have seen his earlier ""Gone Baby Gone"", but interviews have revealed his depth of research into the blue-collar criminal subculture of Charlestown and it shows in the movie's distinct sense of authenticity. He has also coaxed wonderfully authentic performances out of his ensemble cast- in particular Jeremy Renner's dangerously menacing portrait of Jim- and the strong acting here from each and every one of his actors effectively keeps you engrossed throughout.<br/><br/>Affleck reserves most of the action for the last third of the movie, which crackles along at a sizzling pace. An exciting car chase sequence aside, the highlight of the high-octane action is most certainly the climactic shootout at Fenway Park, one of Boston's iconic landmarks. Affleck doesn't rush the action, building it slowly but surely, letting the intensity grow, and finally lets it out in a thrilling showdown between the Feds and Doug and his crew. By then, the investment Affleck has made in developing his characters pays off nicely, as you'll find that the movie's finish turns out unexpectedly poignant.<br/><br/>Of course, Affleck's gift as a director in crafting complex character dramas was already apparent in ""Gone Baby Gone"" but his accomplishment here further reinforces his abilities in this regard. It also reveals a fresh side in Affleck's directorial skill as an orchestrator of gripping action sequences attested by the brilliantly executed heists and car chases. Though it isn't as accomplished as Michael Mann's ""Heat"" or Martin Scorcese's ""The Departed"", Ben Affleck's ""The Town"" is a perfectly entertaining heist drama in its own right and is most definitely a glowing addition to his fortunes as a director.<br/><br/><ul><li>www.moviexclusive.com</li></ul>"
"colinrgeorge","8","2","4","26 October 2010"," Action for Adults
","Simple, focused, and perpetually entertaining, Ben Affleck's ""The Town"" plays like the best Michael Mann film in years. It stands apart in the summer spectrum, maybe because the MO for action in 2010 seems to so heavily favor high concept; Affleck's second directorial effort is like a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>But how could he hope to score the fickle fanboys' attention without the dream-spelunking of ""Inception,"" the gratuitous violence of ""The Expendables,"" or the retro gaming nostalgia of ""Scott Pilgrim""? For one, he sidestepped those direct competitors by releasing his film on the very last Friday of the season. Second, he instilled the film with one vital element the other three lack: heart.<br/><br/>Sure, ""Pilgrim"" is a romance, but the relationships in ""The Town"" resonate on a deeper level. Affleck plays protagonist Doug MacRay, a brilliant bank robber who becomes romantically involved with one of his prior hostages against his better judgment. Claire (Rebecca Hall) recognizes neither his face (which was masked during the theft) nor his voice. The scenario makes for an inherently suspenseful courtship, playing our desire to see a 'happily ever after' against our knowledge that Doug cannot sustain his lie indefinitely.<br/><br/>Grounded by the simple, relatable contrast of Doug's optimism for a brighter future and his dim present, ""The Town"" is free to alternate between elaborate heist sequences and intimate conversations. It works because Affleck understands what so few filmmakers seem to: that something real needs to be at stake for our characters. For Doug, it's his relationship. For his buddy James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), that risk is hard jail time; the character has already served nine years.<br/><br/>We care about these people, and it is for that reason the action sequences deliver. There may not be anything as impressive as in the final forty minutes of ""Inception,"" or as many explosions as ""The Expendables"" was packing, or even the creativity of ""Scott Pilgrim,"" but Affleck outshines them all with straight good storytelling and classic one-upmanship.<br/><br/>There are three heists in ""The Town,"" each more elaborate than the last. Costumes play a major role in all three, ranging from cliché (skeleton masks) to bizarre (nun habits) to ingenious (Boston police uniforms). In terms of suspense, Affleck expertly paces himself. The first heist leads to Doug's involvement with Claire, whose relationship ups the stakes for a considerably messier second outing. It devolves into a citywide car chase with the police and FBI in hot pursuit. The tension is ratcheted even higher for the final heist, which takes place at a locale described as the ""Cathedral of Boston"" and concludes with the largest, most visceral action scene in the movie.<br/><br/>My gripes are few and far between. ""The Town"" does feel perhaps a little longer than it needs to, and the outcome of Doug's last job and his relationship with Claire feels somewhat inauthentic by comparison to the pragmatic whole. Nevertheless, neither issue amounts to more than a minor grievance, and Affleck concludes the film on a beautiful, somber moment that emphasizes his strength as a director.<br/><br/>""The Town"" is one of the most pleasant sleeper surprises of the year. Like Anton Corbijn's ""The American,"" it offers a grown-up alternative to action, a compelling cast of characters, and confident filmmaking. That Ben Affleck, who was once a punchline in comparison to his accomplished buddy Matt Damon, has emerged so triumphantly as a director in the past three years is a development few if anyone saw coming. Both his vision for this film and his performance therein are incredible, and ""The Town"" is the best, most compelling action film of 2010.<br/><br/>Whatever project Affleck takes on next, his ability to perpetually entertain isn't going to expire anytime soon."
"jpschapira","9","2","4","24 October 2010"," Affleck's movie directing growth
","Ben Affleck's second film is one of the best movies of the year. I'll try to tell you why. First off, it's better than its predecessor ""Gone Baby Gone"". I find impressive that Affleck decided step it up in almost every aspect: ""The Town"" runs longer, cuts deeper, increases in action scenes and in character development. We remember more characters and the romantic relationship at the center of the film is given more time and because the script is morally consistent, ""The Town"" is one of the few crime movies in which we care more about the criminal's life than the success of the robbery of a bank or a truck. Dramatically, it's irresistible. <br/><br/>Talking about increasing risks. After years of trying to build a better reputation as an actor by participating in films that wouldn't stain his image, and after directing a film that gained him respect even when his acting skills weren't as recognized still, Ben Affleck decides to be himself the star of the show. He plays Doug MacRay, an expert robber that works with a very skilled gang in Charlestown: instructed by The Florist (Pete Postlethwaite), they tackle the best jobs in town and, because something always goes wrong, in the middle of a bank robbery, they take the manager, Claire, (Rebecca Hall) as a hostage. They drop her in some beach and start watching her to make sure she doesn't say anything to the police. Because she knows, we know. Doug starts seeing her and later on Claire recalls the robbers told her to walk until she felt the water: ""It was the longest walk of my life; I thought I'd fall from a cliff"". <br/><br/>Doug starts dating Claire because his impulses tell him so. He can't fight it. Women in both of Affleck's films tend to present this quality that goes beyond beauty: either they are independent and kind, women you want to fly to heaven with; or self-destructive and troubling, women you inevitably want to save. The common factor is that they are both very vulnerable. Both women co-exist in Doug's life, and we can see that he's trapped; he wants to do something. But at the same time, ""The Town"" is about the things we can't help. I mean, of course, the things we shouldn't really do when we think about them.<br/><br/>Name a character and I'll point out a weakness. The script of the fillm, based again on a novel and written by Affleck and Aaron Stockard alongside Peter Craig, provides characters with huge moral dilemmas. In ""Gone Baby Gone"", this aspect made its crowning way towards a climatic ending, and it worked. Here it's all over the place, because every decision is apparently life-changing, because every conversation holds a secret. Because the past, never absolutely revealed yet always present, is devastating. <br/><br/>Writing always from the heart but this time without the intention of generating impact, Affleck might have achieved his best screenplay. The genre conventions we find in the story are the ones that make the movie 'activate' (to just say something), but a whole different thing makes the movie breathe. The way Affleck has of capturing, again, a specific place and making it his own. He masters a special mood (thank you for that score again Harry Gregson- Williams), he dominates the codes, he drives the streets and he walks the roofs in order to leave no doubt that he knows, again, what he's talking about. <br/><br/>The characters, and their involvement in a story that we need to see told show the growth and the natural flowing of a director who's as generous as every great actor/writer/director that, from time to time, decides to be the hero. That generosity is expressed in a way that we can realize he's the main star but everyone who stands by him is perfectly chosen to shine and still not surpass him. That's why Jeremy Renner turns in a stupendous performance as Doug's best friend, a fine step to follow his Oscar nomination; that's why Affleck gives Blake Lively of ""Gossip Girl"" the –up to now- part of her life; that's why John Hamm feels at times underused and a bit caricaturized as a federal agent; and that's also why major names like Postlethwaite and Chris Cooper have only a couple of scenes.<br/><br/>I believe these are the right calls, by a director so confident that in the end truly becomes the brightest (in intelligence and in light) star. I honestly think Affleck's performance is the winning one: I believe in everything Doug says and does and I root for him all the way. I found myself touched by ""The Town"", a film not intentionally made for that effect, but with all the elements in place to end up causing it. If you don't agree with all this none sense, it's only fair to say the film is a part action, part crime, romantic and dramatic feature with family/friendship subplotsStraightly told, visually appealing, Hollywood-ish if you prefer. That should also be enough if you want to make one of the year's best films."
"TheMovieGal","9","2","4","22 October 2010"," The Town - Ben Afflick's Smart Action Picture
","It seems that most of us grow up with some version of the family business. Hollywood in itself is a prime example. The Barrymore name has been ever present as long as making movies has been a business. As a child is raised into the family business there comes the time to make the ultimate decision. Do you rebel and become something else? Or do you find comfort in the continuation of way of life? But what is a person to do if there is no way to rebel from the family business without dire consequences.<br/><br/>This is the theme explored in Ben Affleck's new film The Town. Ben directed, co-wrote the screenplay adaption and stars in this film about the most dangerous family business: crime. Ben's character, Doug MacRay, is a crook. His one chance to make a difference in his life by being drafted to play professional hockey was stopped short by his own cocky behavior. Left to live in a crime-ridden area of Boston, nothing was left to do, but go into the family business.<br/><br/>Doug belongs to a crew that orchestrates high stakes robberies in return for great riches. But this crew belongs to the old man that Doug's father worked for and with his father in prison for the remainder of his life, Doug knows that it is only time before he will be joining dad in the pen. It's obvious that Doug is the brain of the crew and his best friend James, played perfectly by Jeremy Renner, is the hot-tempered wild card. After Claire, the witness of one heist gets too close, Doug starts following her to make sure that she doesn't know too much. He moves in to acquaint himself with her and a very touching romance develops between the two. Claire is unaware that this man that appears to be a gentle young man is the same masked man that robbed her bank and scared her to the core.<br/><br/>It's obvious that once Doug and Claire become close that Doug is planning to leave. Only one problem: you don't just quit this family business. With his life in danger from his own boss and the FBI closing in, and his unpredictable friend, Doug finds it hard to manipulate the situation to his advantage. Just when his plan is underway, Claire finds out his true identity and a girl from the neighborhood, a drug addict named Krista becomes too talkative, just all may be lost.<br/><br/>But Doug's dream of a new life and a fresh start with the woman he loves propels him to complete his most dangerous job, and find a way to escape the hold his home town has on him. The rest of the film plays out unpredictable in a smart and intriguing way. Perhaps, for a few of those who have gone down the wrong path, a new and more pure path awaits.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck shines on many levels with this film. His acting along with his cast mates is well executed and all the characters are believable. The script, adapted from the book ""The Prince of Thieves,"" by Chuck Hogan is craftily adapted by Affleck, Peter Craig and Aaron Stockard. The story is well paced and Affleck's direction adds another depth of realism to the film. This is not Affleck's first turn as Director, his film Gone Baby Gone was one of 2007's best film.<br/><br/>This is a great film and should not be missed. I predict that Ben Affleck is on the path of being one of Hollywood's best directors and will have a long presence in Hollywood. His directing method is reminiscent of Clint Eastwood's work. For those of you who have not seen Gone Baby Gone, give the DVD a try, you will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>The Buzz: When award season comes around, I don't think The Town will garner any attention. If it does, I see a nomination for best adapted screenplay and /or a nomination to Jeremy Renner for best supporting actor.<br/><br/>For more film reviews by Kay Shackleton, see here: http://www.examiner.com/movie-awards-in-national/kay-shackleton"
"Troy_Campbell","9","2","4","21 October 2010"," A superbly made drama.
","With sophomore effort The Town, Ben Affleck has well and truly confirmed that he's a directorial force to be reckoned with and that his astounding Gone Baby Gone was no fluke. He handles the story, location and characters – all of which are unglamorous – with a deep affection and sincerity. These issues, places and people clearly mean something to him and consequently, through his earnestness in portraying them stripped of any falsities, they mean something to us. We shouldn't care about these bottom-feeding members of a criminally abundant community but Affleck – who also wrote the screenplay – sees to it that we look past face value, at least for a little while, to ascertain whether our initial judgments were in fact correct.<br/><br/>With the help of DP Robert Elswit – who gives the streets of Boston a dim, shadowy look – Affleck generates an ideal atmosphere for his characters to inhabit. His shots allow as much of the city in the frame as possible to emphasise the world, that is rife with potential, passing these people by. Contrastingly the action scenes are filmed with an immediate and claustrophobic feel primarily from the robbers' point-of-view, underlining the urgency of the situation they find themselves in and the lack of options they have once the first bullet is fired. With three heart pounding, brilliantly staged set-pieces – two that bookend the film and one at the halfway point – Affleck leaves no doubt that he can do tense action when required.<br/><br/>To round out his involvement, Affleck also takes on the lead role of Doug MacRay, a man who desperately wants to ameliorate his life but isn't sure how to go about it. He turns in a career-best performance that, along with his impressive work in last year's State of Play, may just be the birth of a comeback he's long needed. Elsewhere, a myriad of on-the-cusp-of-A-list-stardom actors put the icing on the cake. Academy award nominee Renner (The Hurt Locker) is both scary and sad as the quietly explosive Jem, British actress Hall (The Prestige) invests her distressed bank manager with a touching vulnerability, Gossip Girl Lively excels in her first serious acting gig as Doug's drug-addicted former flame and Mad Men's Hamm announces his arrival to the big screen with an impactful turn as the uncompromising G-man.<br/><br/>A superbly made, gritty drama that stamps Affleck as a director to watch in the future.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"

"Top10Movie","10","0","0","2 July 2020"," So Intense And Great, Yet So Very Underrated
","""The Town"" is just simply one of those movies that never received the recognition that it deserved. I know that I'm not a professional movie critic or anything like that, but just hear me out.
Ben Affleck, a person who most movie fans either love or hate, directed, wrote, and acted in the lead role of ""The Town"". The movie follows the character Danny McCray (Ben Affleck), who has been exposed to a lifestyle of crime since he was born, which, being from Charleston, Boston, MA, and having a father who has been imprisoned for a very long time, explains why. Crime runs in the family in Charleston, from father to son, uncle to nephew, grandpa to grandson, etc.... McCray had the opportunity to, and for a short time, did, play in the NHL, until his rage, which was most likely learned from his roots, broke out and left him battling not the opposing team, but his own teammates in a fight. After losing his opportunity in hockey, McCray moves back home and reboots his old, criminal ways, this time turning his attention to armored trucks and banks, rather than his past dealings in dope. He may be young, but do not take McCray's intelligent plots for granted. He is clever and efficient with his jobs. McCray's only setback was his experienced yet impulsive right hand man, James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), who was McCray's childhood friend. It is sort of how Nicky Sanroro (Joe Pesci) becomes Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein's demise in ""Casino"" (1995), although Coughlin wasn't quite as severe or ruthless as Santoro. Coughlin is the type that shoots first and thinks later, and although a guy like that may be handy to have around in certain situations, in the end, he can, and mostly will, bring bad circumstances to a crew that is already small and outnumbered compared to the entire Boston Police Force. Other than Coughlin, who I am not saying is a bad crew member, rather an unpredictable one, the other two crew members are solid. One was smart with technology (in accordance to hacking bank records, cameras, and that sort of thing), while the other was smart with vehicular mechanics, serving as the getaway driver and handyman. With that kind of crew, and the smaller sort of jobs that they hit, they were lethal to say the very least.
On the other side of things, ""The Town"" features a heavy does of screen time from the Boston Police and the FBI's point of view on the investigation of what eventually became McCray's crew, very much like ""Point Break"" (1991). Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) is the lead FBI agent assigned with the task of pursuing McCray and his crew. This aspect of the movie provides an incredible balance of crime versus law, while adequately portraying both sides. Although McCray and his crew are the main part of the story, it is intriguing to witness the law's point of view on the crime's happening in Boston.
I'm not going to sit here and ruin the end for y'all, even though I did mark this review for spoilers due to the amount of plot that I discussed. But in the end, ""The Town"" features multiple great shootout scenes, a thrillingly clever story, an impracticable yet passionate love story, and a skewed brotherhood between two men who grew up in a crime ridden family. How can it get any better?
If you're one who loves intense yet gut wrenching heist movies like ""Heat"", this movie is a top pick for you. I do believe that ""Heat"" is the best of its genre, I mean it does have the greatest cast of all time, but ""The Town"" is a suitable second. It is much better than ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992), ""Inside Man"" (2006), and ""Den of Thieves"" (2018), and holds a slight rank over ""Point Break"".
Now that you have my unprofessional opinion on one of my favorite movies to ever be released, I encourage you to take the 2 hours to sit down and watch ""The Town"". I guarantee that it will not disappoint, and will leave you in a somewhat cheerful yet melancholic state after the conclusion. Take the time to watch this above average movie that has received unfairly low ratings. It will in time, if not almost instantly, become a film that you want to add to your Blu Ray collection or just watch often whenever you get the chance.
""The Town"" is a fantastic movie that has been sincerely underrated since it's release in 2010. It is time to shine the light on what a great film this actually is. Take the time to watch it, and I promise that you won't be disappointed. I don't just rate any movie 10/10, but ""The Town"" easily made the cut, it is up there with all of my favorites and easily contains a spot within my top 10 movies of all time. Give it a watch and thank me later."

"MarianoJuniper","6","0","0","16 February 2018"," The Town had potential but the characterisation was poorly executed
","When I had first heard about The Town, I thought it offered something a bit zealous; yet when I actually watched it, I was a little disappointed in that it did not meet the expectations I had for it. This is not to say the film is bad, by no means, but rather I felt it was a little 'half-baked' as a final product or a little rushed. It has been received fairly well among critics and audiences alike so for me to consider this film bad would mean I am contesting the majority of people who did in fact think this was a well-made film. So instead, perhaps this review should begin in this sense: a good film but with some issues - to put it lightly. <br/><br/>The plot and narrative of The Town is driven by Douglas ""Doug"" MacRay played by Ben Affleck who is the 'mastermind' behind a series of bank robberies at which he engages in with his life-long friends. During the course of the film, we get to know Doug as someone who is looking to 'get out' of his current situation and live a normal life. He becomes infatuated with the manager of the bank of his previous heist, Claire Keesey played by Rebecca Hall, and begins his journey out while trying to not do any harm to anyone in his path. <br/><br/>On the outset, The Town offers an engaging action-crime film that certainly elevates Ben Affleck as a capable director in this field. Gong Baby Gong, his directional debut, shows he has kept within the safety of the crime genre but The Town delivers the action and demonstrates Affleck is capable of going further. <br/><br/>What troubled me is the issue around characterisation. I felt this was poorly executed where Doug's past around his mother, father and his supposed child with his ex-girlfriend simply did not match up and in turn I did not feel I could engage with his character. After a quick conversation with the manager, he sets off to find more about his mother whom was never found when she disappeared. His bad childhood is established but it is not enough to engage and sympathise with a character whose troubled life and bad past is not fulfilled with enough information for the viewer to grasp and hold on to. It almost seems that it was thrown-in as opposed to something that develops and over time naturally in the film world. Instead we learn of his character at random which therefore gives this out-of-place feeling. <br/><br/>Besides Doug's character, this issue is also seen with James ""Jem"" Coughlin played by Jeremy Renner, where when asked why he does not get out of his situation, he replies ""This is all i know"". I guess the effect of this was a dramatic and emotional one, yet I felt a level of involuntary cringe that immediately prevented me from liking his character further. This is due to this idea that his situation is inescapable and ultimately his ending (as it turns out to be) and foreshadows his death. Maybe I expected the foreshadowing of his death with a little more punch instead of that typical 'all I know' gaff. <br/><br/>If we also take a look at Special Agent Adam Frawley played by Jon Hamm, there appears (or perhaps not) to be a rivalry between him and Doug. Little is known about him and his motifs or background; this ultimately, in my opinion, let The Town down when the Agent was clearly an important character in the film. Even the manager's difficultly in coping with the aftermath of her short ordeal is only demonstrated in one scene in the Laundromat; thereafter she appears to have been 'cured' by Ben Affleck's romantic persona - where ever that came from. But why have the characters loosely established? It could be possible that it was intentional; adding to the mysteriousness about Charleston that is further echoed by its residents. But with this, there is a lack of engagement with the characters and thus falls short of being a film worthy of any awards.<br/><br/>While I am very critical of the characterisation of The Town, I do not consider it to be a bad film. It delivered the action, the crime and strong narrative that will keep the action-goers happy. Yet the characterisation is rooted with issues that if needed, could be further dismantled and a harsher review would suffice."
"jeffrymiranda-25858","7","0","0","16 January 2018"," Great story, the police-related scenes a bit flawed.
","From the beginning, the movie grabs the attention by taking the viewer through well played scenes, however, as you go along the movie, you start to see some flawed scenes, especially during the investigation since the FBI starts following them but then suddenly you get to see this interesting element of the investigation anymore . To me, that's not coherent with a real police investigation.<br/><br/>By the end of the movie, when Doug McRay escapes during his last robbery, he, in the eyes of FBI Agent, Adam Frawley, takes a police car from and escapes from the scene. In a real, robbery scene, if you do this, they won't even let a police leave the scene like that. These two tiny elements, in my view, undermines the credibility of the whole plot. But, in overall terms, not a bad movie."

Renner was much better, and his performance was quite enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>The story was straight forward, and Affleck did a great job at keeping the viewers interest at the necessary level to luxuriate in 150 minutes of blossoming love, painful pasts, tough realities, betrayal and of course, loss.<br/><br/>Rebecca Hall and Blake Lively. Beauty, talent, admirable, like- ability and attractiveness all rolled up in... two.

","I can't remember the guy's name, a radio commentator who is generally conservative, but more ferocious in his humor and delivery than a Limbaugh or a Hannity. Geez, I wish I could pull up his name. He was talking on air about how it's irrational to discount a performer's work if one finds his personal life and opinions offensive. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck is a flaming liberal. If he makes great movies, why would you say you hated his movies because you hate his public leftist dribbling. That was the commentator's point, and he was, in fact, talking about Affleck.<br/><br/>I think Ben Affleck is over-rated as an actor, but has a pretty good handle on directing a movie. That's cool. If he ever crashes and burns as an actor, he's got a backup plan.<br/><br/>Now, to bring this around to his The Town, an entertaining but predictable crime drama, set in Charlestown in Boston, and populated with characters you've seen before in other flicks--Kiss of Death (1947) and it's 1995 remake come to mind. Affleck has crafted a serviceable robbery crew/FBI/love story story. Nothing stood out except or two items of interest:<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner was one item. He breathes some life into an ordinary character (the violent friend of the protagonist). <br/><br/>The car chase at the start of The Town is so claustrophobic, with cops and crew careening down the narrowest streets this side of, say, Italy. I was actually dodging and weaving as the cars slammed and screeched down one street and onto another road.<br/><br/>There are lots of actors and actresses here who are so good, so comfortable in their respective roles. Affleck is the weary robber; Renner, his friend who believes that Affleck will always owe him for taking a fall for him; Rebecca Hall as the frail love interest who Affleck wants and Renner wants dead; Jon Hamm is the predictably vicious fed who went to the Richard Jordan School of How to Play a Repulsive Fed.<br/><br/>Did you get the reference to a better Boston crime drama? <br/><br/>The Friends of Eddie Coyle.<br/><br/>Which The Town isn't. It does hold it's own, delivering a satisfaction that lots of crime dramas can't or won't. I wasn't so much impressed with the movie as I was pleased that the 125 minutes I invested in Affleck's movie were not wasted.<br/><br/>Which brings me back to Affleck on screen, behind the camera, and making political poopoo in his occasional interview. So what if he's a dope in real life? His work works. <br/><br/>If I had my way, Jane Fonda would be rotting in Supermax for treason, but her performance in 1971's Klute was brilliant.<br/><br/>What's a movie-lover to do?<br/><br/>Oh, I got the name, I think!

"scottleonk","7","0","0","17 May 2015"," Much to Say About This ""Town""
","Say what you want about him, but Ben Affleck does have the acting chops to pull of various amounts of roles. In ""The Town"", he shows us through directing, writing and acting credits just how much of a talent he is and what he can offer us in the upcoming Batman V. Superman.<br/><br/>It's now 2015, so it took me 5 years to get around to this movie, and I have to say it was a welcome surprise. I've never been to Charlestown and don't know if the crime is accurately portrayed in the movie, but if it is, it's the kind of story that helps you connect and understand the robbers, why they do what they do, how it's a taught behaviour, how it's all part of growing up in certain places, how it's a legacy business.<br/><br/>I switched this film off thinking about money. Money is just paper, and all these guards and police, why are they putting their lives at risk for paper? Why are robbers being shot and killed . . . for paper? Isn't that an insane thing for humanity to fight over, for people to be killed over? Not all the robbers are saints of course, but they're not all bad either. The FBI in this movie came off more like the villains for me because they used every slimy, ratty method they could to try and bring these ""bad guys"" down.<br/><br/>This film is rich in its ability to show a different kind of class than many would be used to, and gives an insight into why some people take the path of lawlessness. I highly recommend it for people who like to see different sides of the fence."

After a lot of meetings the crew have to do one last job that will define Affleck's future. First in the leading role I thought Affleck was great and his performance was a real step up from his acting before his film. The supporting cast is also really good with Jeremy Renner as the crazy member of the gang and he worked well with Affleck. Rebecca hall was really good as Affleck's love interest and she does a very good job in what could have been a throwaway role. Jon Hamm is the policeman going after the crew and he does a convincing job in his role against the crew. Also Blake lively does a good job in her smaller role and was good for what she needed to be. The story is okay as it focuses on afflecks life with lesser stories involved that are good. However, I found that the reasons for the robberies not being compelling and took a bit away from the film.

Behind this group is an Irish florist who finds the jobs and assigns them to these guys.<br/><br/>After the job, the guy, Doug, follows the manager around and invites her for a drink. They become close.<br/><br/>The FBI investigates and quickly discovers the identity of one of them and quickly also discovers the whole crew. But they don't have a case against them. No evidence was left behind. The only information they have is the tattoo that the girl saw on the back of the neck of one of the guys. That would be James, Doug's best friend. James killed someone for Doug and now Doug owes him. He is also involved with James' sister and treats her child as if it were his.<br/><br/>Now that he's met this girl, Doug is getting reluctant to do criminal work. Still, he takes the next job, robbing an armored car. He is worried because one of the guys is ex-military and trained. Still, James keeps the pressure up reminding Doug about the guy he killed for him. So Doug accept. This time around violence ensues. The cops chase them but they manage to escape. The FBI interviews them but lets them go.<br/><br/>Doug tells the florist he's out, no more jobs. But the florist threatens the girl so he accepts one more job. The FBI meanwhile discovers about the relationship between Doug and the girl and they let her know who he really is. The crew robs the vault at a stadium and on their way out they run into heavily armed FBI.<br/><br/>The Town is a strong crime action drama very much in the vein of Heat but set in Charlestown. Doug is the brains of the operation, James the violent one. We learn some background about Doug, his criminal dad and his disappeared mother. All the heists are exciting and well-filmed. Some of the drama and family business is very cliché. This is review based on the short version of the film. Too much attention is placed on Doug, who isn't really all that interesting and doesn't appear to be all that bright either. We learn little about the other two members of the crew nor about the FBI and their investigation. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't go into depth either about what causes Charlestown to be the source of most bank and armored car robbers."

","Switches from 'seen-it-in-Point-Break' to some genuinely tense moments, and from occasionally jarring accents to some sharp and sassy dialogue. A good cast is headed by an on-form Affleck and an engaging Rebecca Hall, with a solid and likable Jon Hamm, and a suitably on-the-edge-of-control Jeremy Renner – but they are all outshone in his brief moments on screen by a peerless Pete Postlethwaite. It's a good crime drama, not centring on the mechanics of the job, but on the personal relationships that drive events, and that elevates 'The Town' above other crime thrillers of recent years, making it highly watchable."

","""The Town"" is a 2010 film written by, directed by, and starring Ben Affleck. Needless to say, it's set in and around Boston.<br/><br/>Affleck plays Doug McRay, a robber whose specialty is robbing payroll and bank trucks, though he and his buddies have done a couple of banks. On one of the robberies, an assistant manager (Rebecca Hall) is taken hostage by one of the gang (Jeremy Renner). When he sees her driver's license, he realizes that she only lives four blocks away from one of the gang and starts getting worried she'll recognize him, although they both wore masks.<br/><br/>Doug manages to run into her at the laundromat; she doesn't recognize him, and the two start a relationship. Meanwhile, the FBI, led by Jon Hamm of ""Mad Men"" is closing in, and Doug wants out. However, he finds that getting out isn't as easy at it seems.<br/><br/>Affleck and his cowriters haven't penned the world's most original script, though it has some interesting features. It was fun to see the Boston and surrounding locations, and the car chases were terrific. You have to accept a certain amount of dramatic license as there are a couple of holes. The acting is good, from Affleck, Hall, Renner, Chris Cooper, who plays Affleck's imprisoned father, Hamm, and Pete Postlethwaite. Hall has gone on to become a major leading woman in Britain.<br/><br/>Affleck has proved his directing mettle with ""Argo"" and ""Gone Baby Gone"" certainly and he just needs to continue his good work in this area. I'm sure everyone thought his career was over after ""Gigli"" -- I think Affleck has even more surprises in store."

","Most of the thriller movies have one or two side stories going on with the main story. The Town is not any different. Its main story is about a gang of people who specialize in robbing banks. The side stories are about Doug (Ben Affleck)'s mother and his unrealistic romantic relations with the bank manager Claire (Rebecca Hall) of the same bank he had robbed earlier. While the planning and carrying out of the heists is very thrilling, the side stories are boring and slow paced.<br/><br/>Doug and his gang successfully carry out two robberies but in the third robbery they get surrounded by the police and the FBI. Unable to find a way out they wear police uniforms and try to walk out. All of them are shot dead by the Police, except Doug. He plans to escape the town with his bank manager girlfriend Claire. But FBI is closing on them both, so he leaves for Florida alone. The criminal couple stays free. This ending leaves the viewer very much unsatisfied.<br/><br/>An alternative ending where the couple tries to run away from FBI with lots of car chasing scenes, jumping through buildings and culminating in the death of both of them by police firing would have been more fitting to a thriller movie."

","Made in a very realistic style which, as with his directorial debut, 'Gone Baby Gone' (2007), matches the mood of the piece really well. All the performances were excellent, but I particularly liked Rebecca Hall as Claire Keesey, Jeremy Renner as James Coughlin and Blake Lively as his sister, Krista Coughlin; all three put in sterling performances. Of course, Ben Affleck proved once again what a fine actor he is as Doug MacRay. Also worthy of note were; Jon Hamm as FBI S.A. Adam Frawley, Slaine as Albert 'Gloansy' Magloan, Owen Burke as Desmond Elden, Titus Welliver as Dino Ciampa and finally a mention for Pete Postlethwaite as 'The Florist', Fergus 'Fergie' Colm in one of his last roles.<br/><br/>A complicated plot that's quite heavy on dialogue in places, but there are some very nicely put together action scenes in there too. There are several threads to the story that all tie up in the end, although the poignant ending does leave the audience guessing to some extent. I must say I did enjoy this film with its multi-layered plot and, at times, edgy style. It's certainly one I would give another viewing to at some point in the future Recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 8.3/10.<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 7.6/10 (based on 118,712 votes at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 94/100 (based on 210 reviews counted at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 83/100 (based on 110,251 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."

","I was amazed Ben Affleck directed the whole thing including writing. The outcome is absolutely great, simple as that. It has a very good plot which develops intensely and drags you into the story. It is not rushed and it gave me a sense of ""Heat"" (with Robert Deniro and Al Pacino), because the story is about bank robbers. Realistic action, cruel at times, all that is well contrasted by the tendency of the main characters - Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) and Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) to live a normal live.<br/><br/>This is the first movie when Ben Affleck is playing a very mature and serious star role, not his usual ""whining"" style. I really hope he will continue to make more movies.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner has perfectly caught the ""bad boy"" aggressive and offensive attitude, and what's interesting is that at the beginning he is put in a negative light, while at the end you come to sympathize him.<br/><br/>Overall a 9 for The Town has well worth it and I definitely recommend it."

","Ben Affleck follows up his excellent directorial debut, Gone Baby Gone, with another winner in The Town. It's perhaps not quite up to the standards of his first film but it is very good in its own right. Affleck goes back to the world he knows best, Boston. In this case specifically the neighborhood of Charlestown, perhaps the nation's most notable armed robbery hot spot. Robbing banks, holding up armored trucks, it's a way of life for the residents of Charlestown. Well not all of them of course. But enough of them to make the area's reputation well-earned. From this neighborhood comes the group of four thieves our story will follow, the crime lord who holds the crew under his thumb and the strung-out girl clinging to the dream of a romance that has long since passed her by. It turns out there's one other important character who calls Charlestown home. Claire is the manager of the bank our crew robs in the film's opening. She ends up being taken hostage but is released unharmed. When the thieves find out she's from the neighborhood what are they to do about her? The hothead of the group would have no qualms about putting a bullet in her head. The more reasoned leader of the group decides to track her, find out what she knows, see if she can implicate them. He ends up doing more than tracking her, he falls in love with her. This, needless to say, provides complications.<br/><br/>Affleck himself plays the lead role of Doug, the bank robber looking for a way out who may have found it in this new romance which blooms with Claire. But getting out is never easy. Not when hot-tempered Jem finds out Doug's fooling around with the girl who could put them all away for life. And not when crime lord Fergie always has another job for the crew. And not when Doug's old flame Krista, who happens to be Jem's sister, refuses to let go. It's a very tangled web, one which seems to have Doug well and truly trapped. Charlestown keeps a strong hold on those who call it home.<br/><br/>Affleck does a reasonably fine job with his portrayal of this somewhat tortured character. There is the nagging sense that his time in front of the camera here may have detracted a bit from his work as the director. This movie is not nearly as focused as Gone Baby Gone, a little sloppy at times. Character development is rushed or in some cases nonexistent. Jem, played with a wonderful spark and clear menace by Jeremy Renner, is the only character other than Doug who we really feel we get to know much at all. Crime lord Fergie, played by a scarily gaunt Pete Postlethwaite, obviously holds a powerful sway over Doug and his crew but we never know why. It's left rather unexplained how such a sickly old man could hold young, powerful toughs so firmly under his thumb. Old girlfriend Krista, played by a seemingly miscast Blake Lively, is woefully underdeveloped. All we know about her is that she's a train wreck and that she longs for Doug. And Lively is a little too glamorous to do train wreck very well. Jon Hamm plays the lead FBI agent who is no different from any other FBI agent you've seen in a movie like this. And even Claire, the new love of Doug's life and the woman who is really the key to the whole story, is pretty much a blank slate. Doug obviously forms an emotional connection with her. We in the audience never do.<br/><br/>So there are some things you wish The Town did better. But there are many things which it does very, very well. It opens with a Dark Knight-esque bang with a thrilling opening heist scene. The other robberies later on in the film are well done too, Affleck proving he can be an action director. While we may struggle to identify with some of the other characters Doug's plight is very easy to relate to and with his portrayal Affleck creates a very sympathetic character out of a guy who is involved in some rather nasty business. Well done that is. There is the sense that the movie drags some between the big action sequences. The romance between Doug and Claire, and the conflict it causes between Doug and Jem, isn't always enough to sustain the film's energy as it moves forward. Affleck and Renner work together very well, and there's really nothing wrong with Rebecca Hall's performance as Claire either, but the story never fully engages the way you'd hope it would. And with so much of the focus on these three characters everyone else gets the short shrift. And that comes back to bite Affleck in the end when train wreck Krista is put in position to make a decision that sets the whole final act in motion. We haven't spent enough time with Krista for it to ring true that the whole movie suddenly gets tossed in her lap. It all can be a little frustrating at times. You know this movie could've been better. Maybe by starring as well as directing Affleck stretched himself a little thin. But even accounting for the flaws it does have The Town is still an entertaining, well-made film. Could've been better but still manages to be pretty good when all is said and done."

","Ben Affleck directs, co-writes, and stars in ""The Town"", a movie about crime, robbery, and betrayal. Affleck has organized a brilliant cast, a dark script, a clever directing duty, and tons of thrilling moments. Now, although this movie has a few side effects, this is still one of 2010's best films. Ben Affleck stars as a professional bank robber who falls in love with the manager of a bank that he recently had robbed with his team. He tries to juggle his personal life and robbery game, and tries to make sure the F.B.I. doesn't catch him in the act. Ben Affleck really knows how to direct a movie! There are so many brilliant performances in this movie. Besides Affleck's awesome performance, the rest of the cast includes Jeremy Renner in an Oscar-nominated performance as Affleck's robbery partner, Rebecca Hall as the bank manager recently robbed by a gang, the late Pete Postlethwaite as the local crime boss who runs a flower shop, and Chris Cooper delivers a pleasant performance as Affleck's prisoned father. There are some moments to be had, thanks to a dark script that actually knows what it wants to be, and some very cool robbery scenes that make the movie stand out. But, the only problem with the movie is only kept in a minimum. The movie starts off too slow, and starts taking away my focus for half of the first act. But that's when things start to progress, and the movie gets better. This movie is also an hour and a half too long, and some moments were just silly. But I didn't care about that, because this is still a great film. Ben Affleck deserves all the credit given to him for this movie. That just proves actors can be awesome directors. They can make sure a movie has a great premise, a terrific cast, and some thrilling moments. That's exactly what Affleck has accomplished for ""The Town"". This is an exciting and dramatic bank heist movie. ""The Town"", in my review, ""an exhilarating robbery movie, but sometimes dragging""."
"jody-ann","6","0","0","4 January 2012"," Short of memorable
","Despite it's great reviews, Ben Affleck's The Town falls short of memorable. Affleck plays Doug McRay, a notorious bank robber from Charleston, Massachusuetts, who was forced into the business following the imprisonment of his father, also a noted bank robber. McRay grows up learning the ropes with his nominal brother James Coughlin, played by Jeremy Renner, a belligerent, unruly ex-con who has become completely hardened by his life of crime and his stint in prison. The film begins with an intense, chaotic opening scene. McRay and several accomplices run a heist on a bank, kidnap one of the bank tellers, Claire Keesey , played by Rebecca Hall, and release her later with the admonition to keep her mouth shut or they will find her and kill her. Coughlin, not entirely convinced that Keesey will cooperate, suggests to McRay that he follow her around to make sure she doesn't give incriminating information to the feds. Knowing Coughlin's whimsical nature, and believing that he will probably kill Keesey, McRay suggests that he watch her instead.<br/><br/>What unfolds from here is part love story, part crime-drama. While the scenes are full of action and violence, the storyline is predictable and one dimensional. Affleck's performance in his star role is good, but the film would benefit greatly from further character development to provide greater intellectual stimulation, or perhaps an interesting twist at he end. Overall, I am not a big fan of The Town, but I still have hope that Affleck's future films will get better as he continues to grow as a director."

","Affleck's follow up to Gone Baby, Gone is both a successful heist drama and a disappointment. Affleck certainly loves his home, once again exploring Boston with a lot of love and attention for detail. I had trouble connecting to the love of where you're from/grew up, as this seems to be a very American sensibility. I doubt anywhere is as closed minded as somewhere in this film, but I'll take Affleck's word for it. The film also seems to be lingering around Heat territory for far too long. Affleck and Renner are just too different to really care. Affleck is the sweet criminal, and Renner is the sociopath. Drawing the parallels between them just makes you question why they were ever friends. What the film does achieve is showing Affleck as a director with an excellent eye on style and pacing. He shoots the character driven scenes with just as much attention and thought as he does the action scenes. Gone Baby, Gone was a real grower for me and I hope The Town will be the same."
"Buddy-51","8","0","0","28 November 2011"," a potent mixture of crime procedural and human drama
","Based on the novel by Chuck Hogan, ""The Town"" is a superb drama set in Charlestown, Massachusetts, a neighborhood in Boston that has the dubious distinction of being the bank and armored-car robbery capital of the world. Writer/director Ben Affleck plays Doug MacCray, the leader of a sometimes unruly Irish gang that routinely engages in both those activities (the other members of the team include Jeremy Renner, Slaine, and Owen Burke). On one of their robberies, one of the members goes rogue by kidnapping an attractive bank manager and taking her along with them as a hostage. Although she is blindfolded the entire time and is eventually set free, several of the robbers fear she may still someday be able to testify against them were they ever to come to trial. To protect her against the more dangerous members of the group, Doug insinuates himself into her life and quickly finds himself developing a serious attraction to her.<br/><br/>""The Town"" works beautifully on so many different levels at once: as a thrilling crime-and-detection tale, a complex human drama, and a richly textured account of life in an individual neighborhood. Doug may be torn between his criminal background and the love of a good woman who offers him a chance at a better life - but that doesn't stop him from still partaking in many of the foul deeds that have come to define his life over the years. If anything, ""The Town"" shows just how deeply planted are the roots that bind us to the soil (i.e., neighborhood) of our past - and how hard it is to rip ourselves free from them and still continue to flourish. In other words, it may be possible for a man to redeem himself in the eyes of God and his fellow citizens, but it may be a long and faltering journey on the way to that outcome.<br/><br/>As a character, Claire (Rebecca Hall) is equally three-dimensional and complex. She's a decent, hardworking young woman who tends her own garden in the city and volunteers her time in helping the youth in her community. When she meets Doug, she is still traumatized by the events that have happened to her and is initially unaware that Doug had any part in them, believing him to be just an easygoing, compassionate man with whom she's falling in love. How she'll react when she finds out the truth about Doug and how that revelation will affect their burgeoning relationship provides the key emotional focal point of the drama.<br/><br/>Running contrapuntally to the romance is the attempt on the part of the FBI, led by John Hamm (minus his Don Draper Brylcreemed hair), and the Boston Police Department to capture the band of thieves. There are moments of breath-bating suspense as the law inexorably closes in on its target, and Affleck proves once again that that much abused standby known as the ""car chase"" can still be a potent storytelling device when we actually care about what happens to the characters – even those it is not always all that easy to like."

","The Town was one of my most anticipated movies and while it wasn't quite as great as I thought it would be it was still very good with some outstanding areas.

It is a slick and stylishly made movie, complete with some smart scripting that made me chuckle at times as well as on the edge of my seat, confident direction and a taut and suspenseful story.<br/><br/>For me, The Town also contains some of the best ensemble acting of 2010. Ben Affleck is surprisingly subtle, and Rebecca Hall and Blake Lively manage to be cute and sexy without their performances being overly reliant on these factors. John Hamm, Chris Cooper and Pete Postlethwaite also give fine work, but it was Jeremy Renner's brooding intensity that captivated here.<br/><br/>All in all, very good. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

The start of the movie is pretty good and raises our hopes for whats going to be next. I watched the extended cut and may be that's why it felt boring somewhat and long in the latter first half. But soon after that it picked up too good. Jeremy Renner playing James Coughlin has delivered an amazing performance and the rest of the cast is pretty good as well. The screenplay is very good and on the whole its a great robbery movie. The movie surprisingly connects emotionally as well. The character development is superb.

","Starring Ben Affleck as a bank robber from the Boston neighborhood of Charlestown, The Town is far more polished than the average crime thriller. <br/><br/>Affleck, who also wrote the script, plays Doug MacRay, the leader of a group of bank robbers from the Irish-Catholic neighborhood of Charlestown. Doug and his friends Jem, Gloansy and Dez carry out big time bank heists. Doug and Jem live together and have been best friends since childhood. <br/><br/>The film opens as the gang robs a local bank branch, taking a teller (Claire) hostage. When they realize that she lives in their neighborhood, Doug decides to keep an eye on her. Doug and Claire end up falling in love, which worries the other members of the crew.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the FBI, led by agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm), is building a case against the crew, unbeknownst to Doug. Throughout the rest of the film, Doug and his crew carry out several more heists. All the while Doug struggles with a desire to get out of ""the town."" Doug's life of crime begins to eat away him. The stress is becoming too much and he wants out. However, it turns out that the world of crime is much harder to leave than Doug imagined. Affleck turns in a fantastic performance though the character was certainly not difficult for him to play. Having grown up in Boston, Affleck wasn't so much playing a character as drawing from personal experience (think Eminem in 8 Mile). Affleck deserves praise though, not for his acting, but for his directing and script writing. The film isn't driven by the performances of the actors (though Jeremy Renner is fantastic as Jem). Rather, Affleck creates a convincing portrait of the Boston crime world. The characters are as believable as they dysfunctional. The characters Affleck creates are incredibly complex. Doug, for example, is a bank robber, whose father is in jail, whose mother left him when he was 6, he was a star hockey player in his youth but his bad temper cost him a shot at the NHL, he dated his best friends sister, she has a child who she says is his, he says it's not, and so on and so on. <br/><br/>At its essence, this is a crime movie. The bank robbery film has been done several times before. The film has all the shootouts and car chases you expect from a thriller plus all the strong characters and moral conflict you expect from the best dramas."

","""Charlestown, Massachusetts's reputation as a breeding ground for bank and armored-car robbers is authentic,"" this quote from Chuck Hogan's novel The Prince of Thieves. Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) along with his three friends James ""Jim"" Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert ""Gloansy"" Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond ""Dez"" Elden (Owen Burke) pull off a bank robbery in downtown Boston. When the situation gets sticky, Jim takes the bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage. To their surprise, after letting Claire go, they find out she lives in their hometown of Charlestown. As a precaution, Doug befriends her to make sure she doesn't know anything that could incriminate them. However, in doing so Doug falls in love with Claire, and keeps it a secret from the gang. The clock is ticking for them as FBI agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) gets closer to them.<br/><br/>Although action packed, this film demonstrates the complexity of human relationships between friends and lovers. Doug has to make a choice to turn his back on his life of crime and his friends, or his new found love Claire. The pressures build between Jim and Doug when he tells him of his plans. It isn't has easy to get out as Doug thought. Yet to keep the balance between action and drama, the film incorporates thematic techniques such as lighting. In various scenes the characters are having secretive conversation where the lighting is low to enhance the intimacy and dramatic intensity. When Doug is in a room looking into Claire's apartment just before he is about to leave town, the camera zooms in to his and her face. Although it is light out, there are still some shadows around their faces. Their conversation on the phone is dramatic, because the audience knows that Doug can see her, but Claire doesn't. Will she warn him?<br/><br/>The scene at the same time displays symbolism. They want to be together, yet separated by boundaries, the windows. Which signifies the fact that although they want to be together, Doug's life has made it so they cannot. Along with this scene, the title is symbolic. The Town, it is an inner struggle for the main character Doug. Charlestown is where he grew up, where he was from, but it is also his damnation. It is either to be true to his roots, or make a change for the better. Overall, it is a good film that is credible and suspenseful. The use of the thematic elements complemented the plot and enriched the film experience.<br/><br/>-Gladys H."

This addition to the story makes it more interesting, for it adds both romance and tension. Will Ben Affleck's character say something that will take him and his crew down because of this woman? Will the woman figure out who he is? Will he come clean and tell her who he is? All of these questions make for a great movie. <br/><br/>The performances are solid. The actors make the sympathy lie with the robberies and our disgust with the police, especially with Jeremy Renner as the loose cannon Jem and John Hamm as the lead FBI investigator. I even liked Ben Affleck in this movie, whom I'm not a big fan of. He proves himself both a decent actor and a witty director. <br/><br/>The only problem I had with this film is some of the plot holes and the lack of common sense in some of the characters. For instance, why do the robbers stay in Boston and not hit other cities to help trip up the police? When the feds are closing in, why don't they tap the phones of the robbers? They very easily could have caught them all before the big, bloody finale. Then again, this is Hollywood. As viewers, we have to suspend our disbelief for two hours when seeing a movie. Even so, little things like these nag me throughout the movie. Nevertheless, ""The Town"" is a good movie to watch. It has enough humor, action, violence, suspense, and drama to make it move at a solid pace.<br/><br/>My rating: *** out of ****"

","This past month, this movie was on the movie channels, over and over. I trust that people who had not seen it got a chance to do so by now and if that wasn't enough, word of mouth should also have sealed the deal of the financial success of the movie. I loved it. I'd be suspicious of those who did not; avoid these people because who knows what they're capable of. Yeah yeah everybody's entitled to their opinion and I certainly don't hold back writing mine, but it's like the Goth people, if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>Affleck did a superb job directing and was also quite good in his role as Doug MacRay. Jeremy Renner has proved again what powerful characters he's capable of playing. Renner is as believable an Irishman as he can be a redneck. In Renner's lesser known flicks he's also played some scary dudes (guidelines preclude me from using the word M**F**) such as Fred in ""A little trip to heaven"" and Jeffrey Dahmer in ""Dahmer"". As Brian Gamble in ""S.W.A.T."", he was not as scary as he was intense. I was most pleased to see the see the luscious Rebecca Hall; I'm sorry if using the term offends some but I can't help it if I think she's hot as well as an accomplished actor.<br/><br/>Affleck has managed to do what very few actors have over time, utter words, a line or an expression, that becomes famous in of itself, and that line was: "" I need your help. I can't tell you what it is; you can never ask me about it later and we're going to hurt some people."" It's as classic as Eastwood's ""Do you feel lucky punk?"" or ""Go ahead; make my day!"""

","So I watched ""the town"" written, starring, and directed by the poor man's Matt Damon, Ben Affleck. I am not a huge fan of Ben Affleck, he has done some good work chiefly ""Good Will Hunting"", but overall his work is more like the idiotic Paycheck (I have got to read the Philip K. Dick story it is based on it can't be as bad as the movie). So is it good, well yes and no. It is a brilliant, taught, suspenseful, well acted crime drama. It also has an interesting twist in that Ben Affleck's character falls in love with a hostage he takes on one of his bank jobs. However, what happens later in the movie is complete and total B.S. I am not going to say it, anyone who has read a review or two of mine knows I try to stay away from specific plot points and sometimes even the plot in general. I don't like to spoil the adventure. This movie is one of several recent gritty movies to take place in the bad part of Boston where apparently America's non hillbilly white trash settle down (read my review of Eddie Coyle). So this is a good movie, with one glaring unrealistic aspect, but if you can get past that, and if you like crime dramas you should like this movie.

"frankopy-2","Null","0","0","5 August 2011"," Affleck's Heist
","What Ben Affleck accomplishes in ""The Town"" is to inject life into his prospects as a director -- and even more surprisingly -- as an actor. In the first endeavor, not much could be expected, his experience being non existent; in the second, his less than convincing body of work was his cross to bear. Surprising or not, Affleck pulls off with passion and dexterity his dual role as actor/director. This is good work. While I would have ended the film with his demise, it wouldn't be because of the Hollywood cliché that crime doesn't pay; I would like to think we have grown out of that Cinderella thought process by now.<br/><br/>I found myself wondering, near the end, if Affleck had contrived to let his hero move onto a new life. That he did so bent believability a bit, but what doesn't these days, the real world giving solid evidence at every turn?<br/><br/>What Affleck has done here is put together a film in a genre that has been particularly popular of late, and, in this opinion, finished ahead of the competition. I found this grittier and more provocative than ""The Departed"" and ""Mystic River."" Affleck in the company of the Scorseses and Eastwoods? Really? Yes, it says here.<br/><br/>The performances of Affleck's ensemble are excellent down the line. Rebecca Hall is appealing as the apple of Affleck's eye, in the role of an innocent bank manager whose life is bent out of shape by the heist. Blake Lively is profoundly effective as the whoring mother of Affleck's child, a woman whose dignity was robbed from the get-go. Jeremy Renner, whose forte seems to be that he will implode ala his ""Hurt Locker"" persona at any moment; Pete Posthelwaite, one of those magnets who electrifies in any scene; Jon Hamm, as a believable FBI straight shooter out to gun down his contemptible target, Affleck.<br/><br/>This is good stuff, and I must admit, that even though he's a Red Sox fan, Big Ben has homered here. If you know anything about Yankee fans, you know I'm biting the bullet, as it were, here."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Doug Macray (Ben Affleck) is one of a group of career criminals who plan and carry out bank robberies in the Charlestown area of Boston. On the latest heist, bank worker Claire (Rebecca Hall) is taken hostage and released under no uncertain terms that her life will be over if she talks to the cops. But with FBI Agent Frawley (Jon Hamm) on their trail, Doug finds himself, as the most level headed and compassionate of the group, forced to work his way into Claire's life to keep tabs on her, especially when it emerges she identified a tattoo on the back of the neck of James (Jeremy Renner), a more aggressive and ruthless member of the group. As Frawley intensifies his chase, and the truth looks set to come out, Doug must work to stop everything exploding into hell around him.<br/><br/>Action is a genre that's started to feel especially generic and interchangeable in recent years, bereft of a lot of the inspiration and colour it enjoyed in it's halycon days of the 70s and, certainly, the 80s. It's high time something came by that resembled the days when it truly felt like an event, like something really thorough and satisfying. And even better that the emphasis isn't all on the big explosions and shoot outs, but with more than a dash of human dynamics thrown in, which gives the story that bit more edge and verve and makes you care about it and the characters that bit more. Ben Affleck's second directorial effort after the amazing Gone Baby Gone manages this, as well as further cementing him as a new directing talent to be reckoned with, competent and compelling, able to tell a brilliant story and charge it with enough emotion to make you stick with it to the end. It could certainly be argued he is a much better director than he is an actor.<br/><br/>Affleck, Hall, Renner and Hamm are the main players of the story, and it certainly helps that they are all on electrifying form, but even better that they have such a strong supporting cast in the shape of Balke Lively, Chris Cooper and, in what may have been his last role, the late Pete Postlethwaite, fierce and powerful as ever, but admittently looking rather pale and gaunt, on account of his deteriorating condition. Still, if it was the case, this is certainly a fitting swansong to head out on, one cog in part of a very well built machine. ****"

","I love that there was romance in the movie. I didn't see the other one he did with his brother as the lead, 'Gone Baby Gone'. But I thought it was really awesome that he let his little brother Casey star in the movie. It's not like Casey is a movie star. He would be unknown if not for Big Brother Ben. I'm not saying Casey isn't talented, it's just the way it is. Nepotism is nice. Anyway, I saw the movie out of curiosity, not knowing what to expect. Wowser, was I happy with the movie. Nice work. Yep, I'm rooting for the bad guys and I'm hoping they get away with it. As a woman, it broke my heart that she was going through with setting up Ben at the endA WOMAN SCORNED LOL! I thought the scene where they are in the middle of the robbery, in disguise, and they are right in front of a cop on a detail...the world just takes a breath...and then the cop looks the other way. That was it for me. I was sold. I love that he put a moment like that in the middle of such an action packed scene, and it wasn't a moment that felt contrived or overly set up, but a moment that could—and would—actually happen in the middle of all the chaos. It added a level to the characters. They didn't want to hurt their fellow Bostonians, they just wanted to rob banks and only shoot who they needed to, and hopefully not kill them if at all possible. The unspoken moment said something about the character, as did many in the movie. I think Affleck was on point for this movie. And, of course, I loved the unconditional love that Ben's character showed by still leaving the money in the end for her."

","I can take or leave Big Ben as an actor, at times. Sometimes I believe him and sometimes I feel like he's a little inhibited in his work and he starts to act. But as a director, I think he has some great potential. And acting-wise, this is one of the movies he nails. Yes, perhaps he was playing a guy from Boston and all that, but there were things going around him that were not just a guy playing a guy from where he's from. People need to understand this. He's directing a movie and he's acting in it like many greats have done, such as the masters Clint Eastwood and Mel Gibson (despite any personal viewsand who gives a sh*t about thatleave the dude alone already). Not saying Ben is on the same level of these guys, but he has some years to get there. So, my hat's off to Mr. Affleck and his directing AND acting work in The Town. If I was his personal entertainment agent, I would take my time and focus on his strong points, and pick what he can do really well. He should do a couple of really strong acting roles next, get the respect level up to where it needs to be, and then direct (and if the role is right, act) another movie he understands the backdrop that the story stems from. Two thumbs up Ben, you've done well."

","The one thing that this film has going for it is a kind of realism that bypasses the typical glamour usually attributed to stories of this kind. That is not to say it's a bad script with nothing more to recommend it. Not a bad script at all. But not particularly stunning either.<br/><br/>The entire concept (which dominates the plot) is of a couple of amateur but undoubtedly talented bank robbers who go around breaking banks around the city (Boston, Charlestown). Admittedly far from an original concept, as they've been many similar plots throughout movie history.<br/><br/>However, what sets this concept a little apart boils down to characterization, setting and circumstances. That quality which I stated earlier provides something praiseworthy.<br/><br/>Unlike most bank-robber flicks, The Town has no suave, impeccable, super slick big city rebels putting the ""cool"" in clever robbery. Rather, the leading/supporting roles here present the reality of the bitter disenfranchised, downtrodden by economic hardship who either striking back in protest of the general unfairness of life or simply adhere to the low expectations given them by birthright as natives of the projects of Charlestown.<br/><br/>Yet in spite of steering away from the stereotypical, there remains that quality about the movie that fails to set it above mediocrity, something not helped at all by certain discrepancies of script that detract from what is a clear attempt at circumventing the ""commercial"" arena into the possibly literary. And that basically means, it's a film that tries to be ""literary"" but misses the mark by painfully mere inches because of key plot factors that are a little absurd.<br/><br/>There are two of them, these little unrealistic key plot factors, and for the sake of not being a total spoil sport, I will mention only one: The developing connection between Doug (Ben Affleck) and Claire (Rebecca Hall). This comes about in a way that is outright absurd, to be a harsh but factual critic.<br/><br/>Claire is forced face to the floor in a bank robbery stick up; watches a man bludgeoned to death by one of the robbers, and is taken hostage after sounding the alarm, to be ditched by the edge of the ocean with a blindfold, and, this same Claire – after such a horrendous ordeal in which she glimpsed none of the men who'd carried out the attack because of the frightful masks they had on – this same Claire meets a random guy at a laundry mart – she doesn't know him from Adam; she should be at least a little on guarded/hesitant in meeting random guys who could easily be the still at large bank robbers that traumatised her, but, oh no, this Claire immediately attaches herself to this random guy, spilling every little detail about herself, including how she's working with the FBI on the robbery case! Absurd? I'll say.<br/><br/>And in the end it gets even more incongruous – something I'm not even going to get into.<br/><br/>So, my final statement is this: well-made + well-executed (by fair characterisation and good acting) + an alright script = promising, but not a must see."

The pretty, spirited and understandably traumatized Rebbeca Hall (Keesey).<br/><br/>Whilst bumping off witnesses is not high on Doug's to do list, he is after all a living oxymoron, a caring bank robber, his somewhat psychotic cohort ""Jem"" has no such scruples.<br/><br/>Doug pacifies the requirement to do something by befriending the witness on the pretext of learning what she knows and this rapidly turns into a relationship. Much to the concern of ""Jem"" who also sports an easily identifiable tattoo noted during the robbery.<br/><br/>There is much to like here, the action scenes are believable and well staged in a urban style that ""Heat"" pioneered. The interaction between the characters is believable and the dialogue rings true. The group are actively and almost obsessively pursued by FBI agent Frawley (Jon Hamm) who again presents a seemingly realistic portrayal.<br/><br/>Blake Lively (Krista Coughlin) adds some ""trailer trash"" vulnerability to her character as Doug's casual ex, in love with him for all the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>There is an obvious feeling of inevitability that this cannot and will not end well and it is obvious that hard choices, disappointments and loyalties will be questioned. Doug remains trapped within an imagined destiny, knowing he should break away whilst weighed down by inertia and guilt.<br/><br/>There are flaws, seemingly the robbery crew can spray police cars from point blank range with automatic weapons with little or no discernible casualties. The tattoo reveal is somewhat wasted, being replaced with yet more hi tech firefights which is disappointing bearing in mind the good plot ground work that has come before.<br/><br/>Renner shows again he can act and Affleck is solid and certainly does not let the side down in his dual role. Postlethwaite proves once again what a fine actor he was but if there is a stand out, Keesey shows a very impressive mix of vulnerability, steel, hope and disappointment, in a role that will do no harm on her CV.<br/><br/>The film is slightly let down by an over busy and noisy denouement, subtlety would have had a more profound effect.

Cliché thought it may be in it's depiction of the ""rough and tough"" crims of Boston and despite the somewhat contrived love story, I nevertheless found myself drawn into the world of career-criminal Doug MacRay, portrayed superbly by co-writer and director, Ben Affleck. Supporting him, is a superbly casted group of actors, including the sublime Jeremy Renner, who is thoroughly deserving of his various award nominations for his violent and menacing portrayal of MacRay's lifelong friend and cohort, James ""Jem"" Coughlin.<br/><br/>Taking just enough inspiration from Michael Mann's Heat without it becoming overtly distracting, Affleck's direction is tight and self assured, with the action scenes being particularly impressive. There is little to no ""shaky-cam"" here, just tight shots and lean editing, leading to a kinetic yet clear portrayal of such fast paced events as robberies, shoot- outs and car chases. The film certainly doesn't lack pace, with the FBI's pursuit of MacRay and co, growing ever closer and more tense, along with the motives and emotions of the group, clashing and intertwining.<br/><br/>This is a movie that I maybe expected to impress me, but not to immerse me in the way that it did.

","Some extraordinary statistics greet us upon the beginning of Ben Affleck's film The Town, statistics more broadly linked to that of career choices those whom inhabit the film's set city of Boston are seemingly limited to. Specifically, if you're not a criminal or a thief or an armoured truck targeting bandit then there aren't many other things that you are. Like the lone monument, or cenotaph, which is the first image we see, standing tall amidst a sky full of clouds eerily rushing by, it is a career choice placed at the forefront of a sea of despair or despondency; a lifestyle perpetrated by a gloomy backdrop within which it seems there is precious little choice. Affleck's film is a studious observation on the limits a group of men face in this regard, a team of crooks who take down various instalments of cash held within banks and other such places connected to that of money exchange; people that are caught up in this city and this choice of life, again amidst a dank and unwelcoming backdrop of despair. The pillar appears as more than scant iconography, it is an item Affleck utilises and revisits on a number of occasions in the form of inserting it back into proceedings as characters progress and appear to want to escape onto something else; that monument coming and coming again as the insatiable force that is 'the life' drags our man backwards and backwards and back into the mire of it all.<br/><br/>Affleck here assumes the role of young Irish-American crook Doug MacRay; a young, pent-up but brutally methodical young heister with a father in prison, a mother, who he holds bittersweet memories of, whom is dead and is currently stuck in what is an unnurtured and unfulfilling relationship with a co-worker's sister named Krista (Lively). MacRay is involved in a crew with three others, one of which is Jeremy Renner's James Coughlin, of whom is the more sociopathic and violent of the group; a man whose credentials and legal situation in that he is a step away from serious penal related consequences is later verbally highlighted to us by the authorities. With Coughlin and MacRay is Albert Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Burke), whom form the rest of the gang. Their jolting introduction is the robbing of a bank in masks and cloaks which typify evil in their demonic appearance; the preceding sequence as they go over things one final time complete with intense contingencies allowing for brief glances over one or two of the men as trepidation creeps sparingly over their faces and we're informed that here is a film not preoccupied with the slam-bang thrill of a robbery or a heist pertained by just anybody, but a group of men thinking and cultivating something through.<br/><br/>Ensuing complications during the opening sees English actress Rebecca Hall's bank employee Claire Keesey taken hostage, her frightful reaction to the F.B.I.'s questioning firmly establishing how deeply the experience affected her and as of the moment tags the crooks with an easy labelling of blind to all emotion, nameless, anonymous thugs without much due concern to others. The film goes some lengths to deconstruct this notion, a getting under of the proverbial skin and demythifying the gangsters whilst keeping all the police procedural stuff led by John Hamm's agent Adam Frawley deliberately quick; methodical; cold; metallic and emotionally lacking. As we come to bond more with MacRay, as he himself infiltrates Keesey's life on his crew's orders to check up on her problematic relationship in regards to them, we come to somewhat reverse our view to form more of an understanding with him; his life and their intimate bond. An early incident in their relationship sees MacRay utilise his criminal mindset to get one back on a group of hoodlums whom previously wronged Keesey, challenging us to get behind Affleck's character and exemplifying his disdain towards such people as officers of the law stay stuck on the back-burner going through the motions.<br/><br/>The film is rich in its finer things. Pete Postlethwaite delivers a stern and aggressive, in all the right ways, performance as local mob boss Fergus Colm, who has seen mostly everything and now works out of a florists. There is an affecting sub-plot to do with MacRay coming to tie up a bond with his father, who himself offers a further example of the film's demythification element when he confirms to our Doug that his mother was nary the proverbial angel he always saw her as - thus underpinning the film's core thesis. There is also a quite wonderful sequence between two characters, one overly violent and whose background at this point is occupied by deathly gravestones in a cemetery,; the other, having reiterated his desire to leave this life behind, shot to a backdrop of a community centre suggesting a straighter, more legitimate desire for a lifestyle possibly in which the helping of others features. Sadly, all appears lost and the brawling results in the would-be 'straighter' of the two men quite literally being dragged back to the 'side' of the nastier criminal: graveyard infused background et al.<br/><br/>People are surprised at the competence of director Ben Affleck, here doubling up as the co-screenwriter as well. Glancing back at Affleck's acting credits, the man has most certainly worked with some well known and rather well renowned directors of both his and our time; John Woo and Frankenheimer on some occasions, the likes of Gus van Sant, Martin Brest and, while there are many more people who admire him than I do, Kevin Smith on others. It's true to say that he hasn't necessarily caught the majority of these director's during either of their finest hours, or indeed worked with them on their best work, but if the man has observed and listened and formulated the ideas and methods that he's most probably put into practise for something such as The Town, then who's complaining?"
"webmaster-3017","6","0","0","14 March 2011"," HK Neo Reviews: The Town
","It seems like 2 Hong Kong films that I have seen before Call it déjà vu or whatever, but the fact is clear. The latest Ben Affleck's directorial and starring effort in The Town, seems far to alike to a Andy Lau's vehicle and a separate Richie Ren's movie combined. Sure, the film is well paced, quite entertaining, but one cannot stop thinking about the aforementioned motive. Putting this aside, The Town is actually quite decent, well produced, well directed and a story that is complicated enough to keep the audience at their seats. However, something seems to be lacking to elevate the film further up the scale. The chases are fun, so are the masks (most notably the ironic nun's masks to rob the bank), but one thing that is safe to proclaim is that Ben Affleck is officially a better director than actor. Whenever on screen, Affleck is far too wooden to convince, but the film is extremely well directed.<br/><br/>Basically, The Town tries hard to be creative and goes the route normally not taken by Hollywood standards. However, when put into context, this is really one simple film expressed in a complicated fashion. While this isn't a bad thing, but the characters despite plenty of focus, we feel nothing for. There is no emotional connection that made Affleck's previous directorial effort far more effective and touching. The film also does not seem real and rational. I know love is not meant to be rational, but the guy is a murderer, bank robber and kidnapper for god sake. Will you still want to be with him? For me, this film seems to focus too much on Affleck's wooden range and subsequently even discounting the déjà vu factor, The Town is at best average and nothing more(Neo 2010) <br/><br/>I rate it 6/10<br/><br/><ul><li>www.thehkneo.com</li></ul>"

","""The Town"" is fairly standard cops and robbers cinema -- enlivened, however, by color-rich shots of Boston and its once down-and-out neighborhood of Charlestown, the Town of the title. The Bunker Hill monument, Fenway Park, and assorted second-floor walk-ups never looked so good. Ben Afleck and Jeremy Renner play a Mutt-and-Jeff pair of local mobsters, the tall one pensive and troubled, with a dad in the pen and a mom who left him as a kid, the short one just mean and trigger-happy. Renner well deserved his best supporting actor nominations in 2011. The level of violence throughout is convincing.<br/><br/>Afleck improbably gets involved with the comely bank manager of the gang's most recent heist, played here by Rebecca Hall. She tends a communal garden, so you know she's sensitive. That sets up a contest for Afleck's character's soul in which the FBI, its special agents having apparently abandoned snap-brimmed fedoras in favor of T-shirts that read ""FBI,"" intervenes. It all ends predictably, but getting there -- thanks to Affleck's direction and the cinematography -- is more than half the fun. Eight stars."

","If you're looking for a action film that tells a good story with developed characters, then look no further than 'The Town'. For the past couple of years, Hollywood have been spitting out rotten films with predictable stories and flat characters. But now, we have this film which while it holds the typical credentials of a Hollywood film E.G the ending and at times whiny love story, it manages to shy away from the audacious crap spews out from the teats of Hollywood's money cow Ben affleck as an actor is like marmite. Personally i'm not a massive fan especially after the gobble gobble anecdote but thankfully in The town he is at least bit likable and while the film progresses, secrets begin to unveil and you start to have some affection towards him. As a director, well this is where he really shines and his first two major films rambunctiously showcases his talent behind the camera. He knows how to pace a film, knows how to capture the atmosphere and most importantly , knows how to shoot some fantastic action scenes.<br/><br/>This film will hook you straight from the start. Towards the end you will be rooting for Affleck. If anyone could pin point an leak in the story, it would be why a guy like Doug, would risk his own freedom to make his unaware victim happy. Of course, you could say i'm being argumentative seeing that his true shelf is revealed but one could easily say the story is OTT.<br/><br/>Anyways, There enough attention to character to keep you hooked and enough action to keep the visceral eye catching"

","The Town has revitalized my thirst for all things cinema. After a horrible summer of films failing to make the grade, I can honestly say that this movie has redeemed 2010.<br/><br/>From beginning to end this movie has great ebb and flow, so much so that it's almost perfectly in sync with how the film is shot. During action scenes when characters tend to become angry or stressed, film clarity is increased and every detail stands out, while in moments of high emotion everything has a very grainy dark feel.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck and Jeremy Renner have so much chemistry in this movie, I bet Mr. Wizard crapped himself when he saw it.

I understand that he took her hostage and accidentally fell in love with her, but at what point did that happen? It could have only happened at three points, none of which make sense. 1. When he held her hand while she opened the safe a gun point 2. while she was blind folded in the van at gun point 3. When he stalked her to make sure she didn't remember anything ""accidently meeting up with her at the laundromat.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","0","9 December 2010"," Heist or romance?
","Nobody says that a heist story cannot have romance, or romances cannot have heist as a backdrop. It's just that this one is split right in the middle. Here's how the simple plot shapes up.<br/><br/>The venue is Charlestown (in Boston) with its motif of a monument showing up in about a hundred times throughout the movie (well, a slight exaggeration). Doug (Ben Affleck) is a second generation bank robber working with a close-as-own-brother buddy Jim (Jeremy Renner) plus a couple of other goon, with their loot laundered by local underworld boss Fergie (Pete Postlethwaite) while his own father (Chris Cooper) is serving jail terms.<br/><br/>During one particular job, the grab a hostage into the getaway truck just in case, but drop her off after they have shaken off police pursuit. Despite the normal trauma, Claire (Rebecca Hall) would have gotten back to a normal life but for the fact that she lives right in the neighbourhood, hence a sufficiently significant risk for the gang to have Doug befriend her at a ""chance meeting"" to see if there is any danger that she 'might recognize one of them (despite their masks and her blindfold). Well, she doesn't, but what else but a romance developing between the protagonists? This is the essence of the plot which culminates, quite predictably, into Doug wanting him out and Fergie wanting him to stay on, threatening to hurt Claire who, in the meantime, finally finds out that her new-found lover is also her one-time abductor. Equally predictable is the one-last-job climax.<br/><br/>If you have watched enough of this genre, you can probably easily devise three endings. One, a little bit politically unwise, the protagonist make up and get away with the loot. Two, he is caught but with a reasonably lenient term for her to wait for him to get out. Three, he dies. Will it be one of the above or a different one? You'll have to watch the movie to find out.' Ben Affleck's second time in the director's chair allows him to prove his worth. At the helm, he has everything well under control and produces a movie that is exciting and interesting. While some critics don't like this, I don't mind at all the almost equal split between romance and heist. Why not? There nothing inconsistent or conflicting between the two elements in this well paced and capably edited movie. Maybe if I were to find faults, it is out of the realm of credibility that a professionally hardened criminal like Doug can be so NICE. But when was the last time you saw a movie that is truly realistic? <br/><br/>The cast is better than capable. Rebecca Hall is a very DIFFICULT role, ironically because it's so ORDINARY. That actually reminds me of Minner Driver's role in ""Owning Mahowny"" (2003). In addition to being a very ordinary character that doesn't really give the actor anything to sink her teeth into they are both in love with a criminal. Both Hall and Driver have demonstrated their exceptional acting ability. Easier by comparison is Blake Lively's (who made a good impression playing teenager Pippa Lee in ""The private lives of Pippa Lee"" (2009)) role as Jim's sister Krista, and also Doug's lover. She has some wailing and screaming scenes which she does quite well. As temperamental Jim, Jeremy Renner who made a name for himself in ""Hurt Locker"" last year shows that he really can act. Chris Cooper appears in only a brief, jail visiting scene but if anybody can make an impression under such circumstances, it's Cooper. And those who have watched Postlethwaite knows that HE can make an impressive simply by his looks. On the law enforcement side, you have two reliable veterans Jon Hamm and Titus Welliver.<br/><br/>Finally, while there is not a lot of humour, they do try occasionally. In talking about keep a close eye on the suspects, one or the law enforces quips, ""You'll get 24 hour surveillance right away if one of them converts to Islam""."
"DICK STEEL","8","3","8","24 October 2010"," A Nutshell Review: The Town
","The question on everyone's mind is whether Ben Affleck makes a better actor or a director? The Town is his second directorial effort after his excellent Gone Baby Gone, and in this one he also puts himself in front of the camera leading an ensemble cast which includes the likes of Rebecca Hall, Jon Hamm, The Hurt Locker's Jeremy Renner, Blake Lively, Chris Cooper and Pete Postlethwaite. Quite the power-packed cast in a riveting drama about a gang of robbers with three superbly shot action sequences that are as violent as they are vividly real. <br/><br/>I'm tied with this one, because Ben Affleck shows he's just as good as he is behind the camera as he is in front, delivery what I felt was one of his best performances undoubtedly lifted by playing off the wealth of talent at his disposal, that he had to up his game, and came through rather successfully. There's only a handful of contemporary films about bank robbers that stick and become memorable, in my books being Katherine Bigelow's Point Break and Michael Mann's Heat, and joining that small list will be The Town, with its high drama and high octane action sequences, both aspects not overshadowing each other, but complementing the entire narrative experience.<br/><br/>The titular town referred to is Charlestown, Boston, reputed to be armed robbery capital of the world, where this tale zooms in on the quartet of robbers James Coughlin (Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke), led by de-facto general Doug MacRay (Affleck) who take their orders, direction and opportunities from another local gangster Fergus Colm (Postlethwaite) who fronts his shady background with a legitimate florist business. The film opens with a daring bank robbery where the team take Claire (Hall) the assistant manager hostage, only for Doug to unexpectedly fall in love with her and vice versa in time to come with what would be a twisted variation of the Stockholm Syndrome.<br/><br/>Based upon the book Prince of Thieves by Chuck Hogan, The Town has plenty of rich subplots such as the unquestionable yet unspoken love between the MacRay father (Chris Cooper) and son and the mystery behind the disappearance of their wife/mother, the camaraderie, brotherhood and loyalty issues between the robbers especially that between James and Doug since the latter has relations with the former's sister (Blake Lively) who demonstrates the extent of a woman scorned, and the biggest story here will be the love story between Doug and Claire, which propels much of the narrative since it plants a thought with Doug to deem it time to quit a life of crime.<br/><br/>I suppose a budding love life that potentially promises a lot more hope than one Doug is currently in, will make him think twice if it's time to go back on the path of righteousness. But like all gangsters, going down that right path always prove to be difficult, as the beneficiaries of his and his gang's exploits will want anything but their cash cow to stop producing milk. Threats get set up and we're left riveted in witnessing just how the largest scale heist the team had ever executed get underway. It's one thing wanting out, but another in being sucked right back in because of circumstances.<br/><br/>While I couldn't care too much about the romance between Doug and Claire which is hinged on dishonesty and secrets, it is the action sequences that made this film stand out. Unlike Takers which had over the top action and an infighting central to its theme, The Town boasts more violently realistic battle sequences between cops and robbers, and although only a handful of them, each are just as memorable and builds up in tension and adrenaline from the last, each with a little bit of throwback to Heat because of its gunfights down busy streets where countless of rounds from automatic weapons get randomly sprayed around, with really ugly outcomes. It doesn't glamourize violence, but shows it as is.<br/><br/>And Jeremy Renner once again stands out in the film as the highly volatile gangster who dishes out punishment without remorse, and his performance here is excellent par none. Besides Affleck's competent direction in pulling this film off, Renner is the live wire here that sets the film ticking, and I will for one be keen to follow what he does as a follow up to this, as with what Ben Affleck will be directing next. One of the best crime thrillers seen this year, so do yourself a favour not to miss this in cinemas right now."
"blacklist-1","8","3","8","29 September 2010"," Ben Affleck triumphs in his second directing debut. A terrific heist movie mostly all round
","Ben Affleck made his first directing debut with Gone Baby Gone in 2007, which is rumoured to be fantastic as I haven't seen it. If that is the case and after watching The Town. It looks more like the case. Ben Affleck has always been a pretty solid actor but never one to get my guns blazing in my book, which just goes to show his real talent lies in directing.<br/><br/>The Town is set in Charlestown, USA where a group of men led by Douglas MacRay (Ben Affleck) including his best friend James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner from The Hurt Locker) for a living, storm armoured cars and rob banks for money. One bank they rob, they end up taking a hostage of pretty bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall). Meanwhile the FBI including the head of the investigation Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) has been after Doug and his men for years and is determined to bring them down. Things become complicated for Doug when he falls for Claire and they embark on a romance. Will she find out the truth? As he also has to deal with his boss Fergus, a drug lord who poses as a florist (Pete Postelthwaite).<br/><br/>Iniatally some of the weaknesses of this movie that stopped me giving this higher than an 8 is the formulaic script that needed a lot more work and the over familiar story. But the action heist sequences are top notch and manage to create suspense and tension and are exciting to watch due to some terrific stunt driving and being exquisitely shot and edited to perfection by Affleck. He has a keen eye when it comes to these scenes, but he also manages to pull out excellent performances from his cast all round, which refreshes the over-familiar plot. Affleck himself gives a reasonable performance of a man torn between his life, friend and the woman he cares about. Jeremy Renner gives a solid supporting performance, whilst Postelthwaite is memorably creepy as Fergus and Blake Lively as tarty mum Krista who has the hots for Doug perfectly portrays a woman constantly high on drugs but feels trapped by the life she leads and wants to escape but can't or won't. The two strongest performances though come from Jon Hamm as FBI Crawley, who gets some terrific one liners, but is determined to catch Doug and Rebbeca Hall as Claire who is warm and intelligent and makes you feel for her predicament. <br/><br/>What is surprisingly elitist about the film is from a basic script the actors manage to turn the dialogue into something more meaningful and heartfelt, which is a incredible accomplishment. The cinematography is brilliant of the town being hard, gritty and realistic and the violence itself is handled maturely, where it is never glamorised but shown in all it's brutality. The music is superb and there are some clever disguises when they pull off the bank heists and a few moments of laughter particularly when Doug and the others have the masks of nuns and after pulling off an armoured heist, they get out of the car with the money and automatic weapons and a cop sitting in a car in the next lane sees them. They stare at each other and then he looks away was funny. The romance between Doug and Claire, though I never believed they were in love and there isn't as much romantic chemistry between them. They care about each other and the two actors are comfortable enough on screen to make us think that. But also it's more of a romance of need almost, where Claire is fractured emotionally after her hostage experience and Doug who wants to get out of the life he leads. They are like two lost souls, parts missing from each other and when they meet they are whole.<br/><br/>One other surprising aspect, which makes this film refreshing is the ending, which keeps you guessing. Will Doug gets away from the police with Claire at his side? Well watch The Town and find out for yourself. This is a great movie all round and is better than average thanks to superb directing, acting and suspenseful bank heists. Thanks to Affleck (and lets hope he directs more films and that they are just as good). This town is well worth visiting and a film that is worth your own time to see."

Well-executed sophomore effort by Affleck – going the full Eastwood (acting/directing/co-scripting adaptation of Chuck Hogan's novel ""Prince of Thieves"" with Peter Craig and Aaron Stockard) – about a team of Boston-area bank robbers whose latest knockoff has them in hot water namely in the lovely form of Hall (aces), a bank teller they hold hostage (and Affleck falls for) that has the feds (led by tenacious Hamm) hot on their tracks. Affleck pulls off the yeoman workload with finesse and allows his characters room to mix and mingle (notably a superb turn by hot-headed Renner as his childhood chum and loose cannon).

The chases scenes while avoiding the typical cheap choreographed traffic set up, also is both better in terms of the in your face experience, yet also lazy in terms of the lack of continuity (much like how Olympic down hill or slalom television coverage is obtained with periodic cut away shots with some of the continuous experience cut out. One irritating weak point is the unclear specifics in how (not by who) the FBI is apprised of one of the specific crimes is going down. The emotional connections between crime partners, the risky over the top use of a hardened criminal with a murder mentality is also too much while the delicate balance of Ben Affleck's character is both good and bad, especially in how he ends up dealing with ""women."" Are there really good and bad criminals in this movie or more a shade of gray here? In one pretty impressive climax sequences, the ending series of scenes almost turns into a BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, nevertheless, the movie is able to pull of one better. This movie understands how to push the audience buttons, making members feel involved in being upset, anxious, fearful, and anticipatory for the outcome.

","The Town refers to Charlestown, Massachusetts; a poor Irish neighborhood on the outskirts of Boston - its claim to fame, spawning more bank robbers than any place else in America.

Their string of flawless robberies runs into a hitch when Jem kidnaps a beautiful bank manager, Claire (Rebecca Hall). They release her. But soon come to realize she lives four blocks away from them and is talking to the FBI (John Hamm). Doug's decision to check her out leads to a foolish and dangerous romance. She awakens in him the desire for a life without crime and violence, but Doug's world is not one you can simply walk away from.<br/><br/>What makes The Town so interesting is the authenticity of the characters. Affleck has stuck to what he knows in his previous films and takes that to a pinnacle here. The neighborhood, its people, they are so genuine. I didn't recognize Blake Lively as Jem's drug-addicted, single mother sister. The accents, the dialogue, swagger, it's as real as it gets. So when the character conflicts begin to emerge, the doomsday events that unfold have weight to the audience. This is a fine ensemble cast, but the specificity of the performances seems like marionette strings being pulled by Affleck. As the lead actor and director, you can see him shaping these performances into precise delivery on screen.<br/><br/>The action scenes are slick and well paced, but not set up to add a bang to the script every ten pages. These are criminal acts for money, dangerous activities driven by a ruthless man. You'd have to be crazy to attempt any of this stuff. This point is hammered in. Doug has lived on the edge of the knife for so long, resigned himself to the fate of a criminal, that when Claire opens up the possibility for a different life; it is truly an epiphany.

"dfranzen70","5","2","5","4 February 2011"," Ghost Town - missing solid central character
","Although tensely made and full of explodey goodness, Ben Affleck's The Town suffers from a knack of reaching into the cliché sack a few too many times. It also suffers from being directed by Ben Affleck, who surrounds himself here with people who can act circles around him, making him – as the central character – look really one dimensional. It's as if Carrot Top made a movie with Laurence Olivier, Michael Caine, Ralphe Fiennes, and Greta Garbo.<br/><br/>Affleck plays a bank robber named Doug (ha! a thug named Doug!). A rather successful bank robber, at that. (It's noted before the titles that that the Boston neighborhood of Charlestown is notorious for turning out scads of bank robbers.) During a holdup, Affleck's masked gang temporarily takes bank manager Claire (Rebecca Hall) hostage; believing her to be a loose end who might be able to identify them, Doug trails Claire and meets cute with her, hiding his secret. Concurrently, an intrepid FBI agent – no other kind in moviedom – played by Jon Hamm is closing in.<br/><br/>Among Doug's gang is Jem (Jeremy Renner), a loose cannon who enjoys the thrill and violent nature of their escapades and who spent a nine-year hitch in prison, so you know he's tough as can be. While Doug is portrayed as thoughtful, careful, and caring, Jem is the foul-mouthed jerk who supposedly shorter on brains than Doug. Jem immediately questions the wisdom of dating their former hostage; if he had his druthers, he'd just kill Claire and be done with it. But that would go against the gang's mantra of not killing people, so Doug gets to keep seeing Claire. You know, to find out what she knows. Or if she's talked to the feds.<br/><br/>The movie asks us to believe two conflicting things about Doug: that he's amoral (he is a bank robber, after all) and yet moral (i.e., cares for Claire, cares for his buddy Jem, cares for Jem's sister Krista, cares for almost everyone. He's sort of a sensitive Clyde Barrow. Affleck's not a terrible actor, but it's tough to really buy into him in this role. He has the accent down (big surprise there), but he seems to equate speaking softly and looking pensive with a multilayered performance.<br/><br/>Another problem is Claire herself. Seems like a nice person, although she falls for Doug pretty quickly (they meet in a laundromat shortly after the robbery). And although she's pretty upset when she eventually learns the truth about Doug, she still gives him a chance. Why she would do this is anyone's guess. If they'd been together years, it still wouldn't make much sense. He's a bank robber, not Robin Hood. He's not a good guy.<br/><br/>The movie is fast paced, so these plot problems aren't really that big of a deal. By the way, while Dougie is trying to get in good with little miss Claire, he's still robbing banks, so of course you can see the standard ""this is my last job"" deal coming from a mile away. Doug's group gets its jobs from The Florist, played by Pete Postlethwait in his final role; he gives them all the intel they need, and they pull off the job. It's a working system, so why break it? I just think we'd have a little more sympathy for Doug if, say, he had to rob banks in order to pay the mortgage in a terrible economy, or he had a wife and two kids with a third on the way and his wife was dying of some lung disease, like in Brooklyn's Finest. You know, a fairly good guy forced to do bad because of circumstances. But that is not the case here. There's no reason for us to like Doug, and so he's a pretty unlikeable person. Sure, he treats Claire well. Except when he lies to her. Best line: ""I'll never lie to you again!"" That's right, trust the nice bank robber. Renner (nominated for an Oscar), Postlethwait, Hall, and even young, lovely Blake Lively (as Krista) completely outshine Affleck, making him look befuddled most of the time, as if he can just about put things together but can't quite get there.<br/><br/>And final odd question: are there no razors in Charlestown? Everyone has three-day old growth. It doesn't make them look tough. It doesn't make them look like they've been pulling all nighters to get the job done. It just makes them look like hobos."

","Ben Affleck with Irish accent - it is tormenting to watch. He tries so hard, but he can't do it. He should have stuck with directing.<br/><br/>Second, bits and pieces of this movie remind me of the epic DeNiro/Pacino movie, ""Heat"". That movie remains consistent throughout, and characters remain true to themselves and are brilliant on top of that.<br/><br/>Here, characters start out OK, but then they forget who they are supposed to be. The character that least remains true to himself is Ben Afflec himself.<br/><br/>Jeremey Renner's character, James Coughlin is the BEST and is consistent and never wanders for a moment. Same could be said about character Slaine, although it is not as prominent as other characters.<br/><br/>Ben Afflec falling madly in love with a cliché good-girl and putting all his BROTHERS at risk, simply doesn't jive. No self-respecting bad-guy/bank-robber would allow that to happen.<br/><br/>A line from heat is that you can't let yourself get attached to anyone or anything that you can't walk away from. Now that is how you maintain your edge.<br/><br/>Not saying it is not OK for Ben Afflec's character to be weak, but it is simply not consistent. When you are able to take people out at moments notice, you are supposed to operate at different plane, then normal good guys.<br/><br/>Why does Afflec's character want to be a good guy so desperately? Why not just turn yourself in? Also, even when he discloses to the girl he is a bank robber, she is so madly in love with him, that she is OK, with the man who kidnapped her and threatened to take her life? Is that Stockholm syndrome on roids? In Heat, DeNiro's character never admits to the girl what he does, and remains consistent.<br/><br/>Also, character played by Blake Lively is inconsistent. It didn't appear her and Ben Afflec's character had strong relationship and it was mostly about sex, but as soon as she hears about Diamond Necklace he has given to another girl, she gives away supposedly her son's father, her brother and her friends out of anger? No way. If a character that is supposed to be cool with a man being bank-robber, then despite cheating or not, she won't resort to throw her own brother and her child's father to FBI.<br/><br/>Problem is that Ben Afflec got hung up on a TYPICAL Hollywood cliché, ""bad guy wants out"". So he tried hard, ignoring natural instincts of characters to form the story where the guy just wants out at all cost, because he is in love with cliché good girl, who plants community gardens.<br/><br/>In real life, how many successful bad guys want out, specially when they are doing great? Who wants to risk prison, and throw their best buddies in jail for a woman? Better story and more consistent story would have been if the girl he fell in love with, comes to realize who he really is and she turns the whole crew in, which she tried later on as well, and not Blake Lively's character. Afflec's character being true to himself, should have realized he is in fact bad guy, and should have gone after that girl to revenge the death of his friends due to her and taken out the FBI guy and her and then we would have a proper ending and a better movie."

","Charlestown is the bank robbery capitol of America. The trade is passed down from father to son. Doug wants out. He's good at it, but he wants a chance at a proper life. That is no easy task; there are people who don't want him to quit, including childhood friend Jem(a volatile man, played to perfection by Jeremy Renner) who does jobs with him, and the crime lord The Florist(Pete Postlethwaite who is never seen without flowers near him, and yet he truly inspires dread... that takes serious stones). Things are complicated when he falls for the hostage(that white chick from Vicky Christina Barcelona who wasn't Scarlett Johansson) they took on the most recent heist, and the FBI begin to track them down. Right from the get-go, this grips you. The story moves along at a very good pace, giving you room to breathe after a scene of tension(frankly, it gets so thick, you'll be walking out of the theater with a friggin' ulcer), the character development has you caring whenever something big happens, and the acting(Cooper makes an impact with a tiny amount of screen-time) is great for all concerned(best ensemble cast I've seen in the last few years). Yes, Affleck himself does well(and is charming), as he can when he is at his best in that field... and his direction is something you should *not* miss(and hey, maybe he'll eventually branch out to dealing with plots that don't have any kidnappings in them... just kidding). He handles all the elements beautifully. The twists hit you like blows to the gut. This is filmed and edited incredibly well. The brutal violence(of which there is a ton) is all in close-up and often with hand-held cameras, and this makes it immensely effective. And the way this uses cuts to silence or to seemingly uneventful images in the sequence is evidence of considerable skill. It hits the balance impossibly well, and we truly get a compelling experience at the theater, where the emotion feels genuine and it really stays with you after you leave. The bits where we see the gang engage in their craft are intense and swift, with many of tiny details that really hammer home how professional these people are. It makes the inevitable confrontation between them and the police all the more grand. The shootouts have a Michael Mann quality to them. Authenticity, realism and a real sense that any of the bullets could prove fatal. The dialog is clever and well-delivered, and though it comes close to being ""overwritten"" at times, it always works... oh, and brush up on slang or bring a dictionary or something... I'm grateful there were subtitles. Oh, and I'm not qualified to judge the accents... I can say that several people go for it. This has an appropriate amount of humor in this, and without anything losing its seriousness. There is a lot of strong language, a little sexuality and brief nudity in this. I recommend this to everyone who can handle it. 8/10"

","Wow. If Ben Affleck has lagged behind his Boston buddy Matt Damon in the acting stakes, he's making up ground behind the camera as a director.<br/><br/>This latest film THE TOWN has him acting in the lead role as well - and he's pretty good. Jeremy Renner (THE HURT LOCKER) is better but he's got the richer role. In fact - give Renner an Oscar now. The guy is good. His style reminds me of Russell Crowe. And his easy way with props - IE high-powered weaponry - is ballistic and balletic. An assault rifle is a true extension of his arm.<br/><br/>Is THE TOWN another love letter to Ben's home town of Boston? Yeah. The stats on inherited criminality in Charlestown set the scene. People have been going into the family business for centuries. The family business of Charlestown is bank robbery.<br/><br/>The cast is solid. Pete Postlethwaite is a florist - but not just a florist. Mad Men's Jon Hamm leads the FBI team (they should have changed his hair from his Mad Men side-parted cut. For a minute there I thought they called Don Draper from Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce to come and solve a major crime spree.) Blake Lively got the girl role but it didn't sink into a straight stereotype though she came a bit close for comfort from time to time. And Chris Cooper. Great actor. Does he ever put in a less than authentic performance? I haven't seen it happen.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of the costume criminal. Great to see a bit of a homage to LOTR Ringwraiths - or perhaps the Grim Reaper. And the 'nuns with guns' theme went down a treat.<br/><br/>There are some genuinely comedic moments that didn't feel contrived or forced. And while I enjoyed every moment of the suspense, I knew some other people might have a moral objection to what the film tries to remind us of - that crims have careers they care about; that sometimes they get burned out and need a sea-change; that they have families, romantic dilemmas and of course - feelings.<br/><br/>For fans of 2nd unit action - you can look forward to a high body count - car bodies. I haven't seen this much mechanical carnage since maybe THE BLUES BROTHERS.<br/><br/>So overall - a great film that had the audience totally engrossed and dead silent.<br/><br/>Well, almost.<br/><br/>A couple of annoying numb-nuts behind me decided the soundtrack during act 3 would benefit from their fat fists digging around a garbage bag of crisps then loudly masticating and digesting the shoddy fake food. Why can't people just go watch a movie and put down the feedbag for 2 hours? I mean, not even newborns need that much constant food.<br/><br/>Can't wait for cinemas to sell giant bags of shut the hell up.<br/><br/>Anyway - go see THE TOWN. It's a good ride."

","It works. Ben Affleck plays a likable robber. He personally doesn't seem to hurt anyone. The FBI agent played by Jon Hamm is a worthy antagonist, dedicated to his job. The real old villain gets his in the end, well the front end. Strong performances all around. <br/><br/>The heist scenes are the highlight, the exposition talk scenes were often tedious. In one case Ben the director was clever or lucky to have a guy sweeping the street in the background out the window.<br/><br/>The film requires more then average suspension of disbelief. Did they really need to take a hostage? Only for this story. The ""uncle apartment"" seemed like a line to get the girl into the bedroom but Ben needed the apartment toward the end for the view. Chris Cooper was wasted as his father with one dropped in prison talk scene. The AA like meeting that showed Ben a girl is more important then religion seemed to come out of nowhere.<br/><br/>Ben and his crew had access to masks, costumes, ambulances and weapons. They had super intelligence on the background and their victims that made everything too easy. The thick Boston accents that came and went sometimes needed sub titles to understand.<br/><br/>The movie is a tad too long but ties up into a neat package that is ultimately satisfying. See it."

","The Town was able to find the perfect balance between telling a great story and exploring some very interesting relationship while still having some great action! First of all I have to give credit to Ben Affleck! He did an exceptional job with the Writing, Acting and Directing of the film! Every single actor in this film pulled of a great performance! Although the entire cast was good I think the two standouts were Obviously Ben and Jeremy Renner. I would not be surprised at all to see either of those names on the list come the Oscars. The story revolves around Ben's Character Doug Macray who is being pulled in many directions with his relationships and work. On one hand he is trying to leave his life of crime behind him to go away with his new girlfriend. On the other hand he is pulled by his lifelong friend James or Jem who is his brother in crime. I found the inner struggle of Doug very interesting. He had to try to balance these two parts of his life well trying to keep both secret. Then finally when the two sides clash e has to come to terms with the inevitable outcome of his life's choices. I highly recommend the film and will be looking for it when the Oscar Nominations come around."

","Ben Affleck has had many ups and downs in his career. Some people love to hate on the guy because of some of his choices and the crap he has been in (Daredevil and Gigli). The Town however, is an excellent movie. It really does not do anything that we have not seen before in any other heist movies. What does stand out about it are the characters. That is where Affleck sets himself apart from many other mediocre directors. In The Town they made characters that the audience cared about. They made us care about the bad guys when they were getting shot at. It is a tough thing to do to make a bad guy the center of a film and have the audience care about him.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner is great in this movie just like he was great in the Hurt Locker. The rest of the cast does an admirable job as well. The relationship development and the shot at redemption are what truly set The Town apart.

","First of all, The Town is a no – gimmick film. It is straightforward, sincere and believable. It is no Kubrick or Nolan but this Ben Affleck's sublime film led me back to see the beauty behind the mundane. It is honest to its core showing the dark realization beneath the real town of Charlestown.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck playing Doug MacRay, a heist master designing every detail for a team of bank robbers and who after surveying a bank manager intrinsically involved in their latest attempted heist, inexplicably falls in love with. Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) the bank manager who is involved and abducted, is completely unaware of the man he's about to meet and cling with days just after her traumatic experience at the bank.<br/><br/>Series of events led Affleck to re – assess himself to life. He wants out of the team as he utterly falls for Claire, but as we all know it is always easier said than done. Variables in his life like his best friend and brother like half James Coughlin played effortless by Jeremy Renner, makes it hard to tear the chain off. Added up by having an unfinished business with Fergus ""Fergie"" Colmes an institution in the robbery business played notoriously by Pete Postlethwaite (The Usual Suspect and Inception), makes it ""unrivetedly"" harder.<br/><br/>Heist has always been a topic of film. But as for the self – confessed critics only few have accomplished to succeed and deliver. This newest said film however, pleases to its hype. At this point, you would already know just by hearing and reading every praise and complement it deserves. I can speak for myself, and I say it has proved its worth.<br/><br/>The direction is superb. Its heist presentation is believable, something I haven't seen in this type of films for a while. Affleck is a serious director and from now on, I see him as a director to be reckoned with. As for the cast, everyone lived up to its bill. Special mention, Jeremy Renner who's a heck of an actor here and proved to me that Hollywood needs him, another is Jon Hamm proving that he could stand on his own far from his comfort show Madmen.<br/><br/>This film is quite moving, far from any heist movie ever made today with an exception of few. It flow its power through its gutsy screenplay and a climax that depicted the brutal road to redemption. Thanks to Chuck Hogan for letting Affleck transform such a magnificent book into a powerful medium. Film."
"michael-linder-858-11835","8","2","6","29 September 2010"," Ben Affleck is an incredible director, and I'm expecting a blizzard forecast from the bowels of Hell any day now..
","The director is the most important single person in the production of a motion picture. Like on a football team, each player has a role, but the Quarterback is the difference maker. A director has to be exceptional at two things to master his craft, the first being that they must be able to overcome the limitations of the camera. By this I mean, most people think of the camera as a tool, the cinematographer would certainly say that it is – but to the actual story-teller (i.e. the director) the camera, and the limitations of its movement and the constraints of the frame, are an obstacle, one that must be traversed with deft skill to get the story across. The second element to master is what I call ""building a set,"" this is not to suggest actual physical set construction, but rather an atmosphere on location of the shoot that allows your actors to achieve their best work. This last element is very difficult. If you've ever been on a motion picture set, you know that literally everyone except the director and actors involved in that shot – from the camera operators, to the sound techs, to the grips and teamsters are all tapping their feet, impatiently waiting to go to the Kraft Table and get some food. It's amongst this atmosphere that a director must ask his actors to pretend they are someone else, somewhere else – with all the subtleties of 'reality' interjected – and make it completely believable. The director must make the actors feel no rush, no pressure, and to gently ease them into the skin of another person. Its even far more difficult than it sounds. Usually the best directors at this second trait are often former actors – for obvious reasons. Once you've worked in the craft, you respect the subtleties required to master it. Hollywood has a laundry list of Luke-warm actors who turned out to be excellent directors for this exact reason – both Richie Cunningham and Dirty Harry come to mind. Well, believe it or not, Ben Affleck now belongs on this list. And the two traits I mentioned above, he possesses in spades. I know, I know impossible to believe, right? Mikey's lost his mind, right? Go see 'The Town,' and tell me I'm wrong. The Town, co-written, co-produced, directed by and starring Ben Affleck is a by-the-numbers heist thriller, that has no real surprises or twists – and yet is exceptional for one reason = Affleck. Scenes where you know the outcome before it begins are still gripping because they are so well acted and shot. But Ben's not alone in his brilliance – almost every actor involved gives one the best performances of their careers including both Blake Lively and Jon Hamm (who jigs like Nero with his Fiddle while playing a wicked evil cop) and part of that must be attributed to Affleck's direction. And Chris Cooper has only one scene, but his gravity is so severe I felt myself being pulled into the center of the Earth by it. But the stand-out performance here belongs to Jeremy Renner who plays the type of friend you love because he's your ally, yet you'd fear and loath him if his loyalties lied elsewhere. A dragon of a friend, one who would eat you if he didn't love you. Now don't get me wrong, this isn't a landmark film (like say Inception) or a possible Best Pic nod, in fact the film is very simple and straight forward. If you like action films with razors' edge dialogue and a healthy dose of moral ambiguity – you are going to love this film, but it ain't Citizen Kane. It didn't reinvent formula or advance the genre or anything like that, instead its proof that a well made film doesn't have to break convention or change the way scripts are written to be worth the price of admission. What I loved most about the picture was it had some of the best dialogue in a film since Tarantino convinced everyone with Pulp Fiction that campy, unbelievable dialogue is how people in action movies are supposed to talk. Instead the film portrays dangerous, uneducated, unpredictable people who talk like dangerous, uneducated, unpredictable people. It was so refreshing it felt like cool spring water from a hose in 110 degree weather. Furthermore, it convinced me that Affleck wrote more of Good Will Hunting's epic dialogue than I ever thought possible beforehand. Frankly, I thought Damon wrote that script while Ben smoked weed on the couch. The Town proved I was wrong, in fact some of the best dialogue in that film was Affleck's alone – cutting riffs and dry comebacks are Ben's literary specialty. So tomorrow you might look out the window and see a pig flying to work, or Dana Carvey might wake up with monkeys literally flying out of his butt, because Ben Affleck is a major directorial talent. Who knows maybe Carrot Top is waiting in the wing with a script that will become the next Rashomon, at this point I believe anything is possible... but I doubt it."

For the most part, everything seemed authentic to me. This film has it all. A good story,great action sequences and for the most part, the Boston accent is not murdered. I generally cringe when I hear the accent in the movies as it is never correct and always over the top. The robberies and car chases are expertly filmed, but it is the relationships of the characters that truly mesmerize. Ben Affleck does a great job of not only acting, but directing this very enjoyable film. As a matter of fact, every actor in the film did a great job of making their character believable.

Ben and Jeremy were Doug and James throughout the movie. They were their characters till the end. I thought Jeremy Renner was great in Hurt Locker. In this movie he's nothing short of perfect. John Hamm, Mad Men fame, is adequate given the role. He did a fine job. Blake Lively is eye candy on Gossip Girl and in The Town is all that and then some. She gave an extraordinary performance and looked very hot. I wish her character was a bit more longer.

Ironically Ben Affleck's movie deals with something equally clannish in the shape of 'neighborhood' loyalty in Charleston, Boston. It's essentially a 'heist' movie through the plot of which you could drive a bus let alone an armored car if so moved. For one thing the small 'gang' of robbers seem to have no motivation for knocking over banks and armored trucks other than perhaps an adrenaline rush. In between jobs they pursue everyday jobs and there is no talk of political motivation, getting back at the system, etc. They take a hostage when there is absolutely no reason or need to and so on.

"wakethenuns3","6","2","6","23 September 2010"," Something to be desired...
","Having seen the IMDb rating and reading reviews likening The Town to ""Heat meets The Departed"", I must say I was sorely disappointed after viewing this film. That is not to say, of course, that The Town is a horrible film. I was a sobbing mess after seeing Inception. The thing is that while films these days are dashingly mediocre at best - that is - not too sore on the eyes but always leaving something to be desired, they are chopped up to be too much too fast. How long did they preview this film before it dropped? How much hype did it receive? More often these days than not, the answers to those questions are a lot more than the overall satisfaction the film itself delivers. We'll see what value these films hold in time, but me not being here to criticize the movie industry as a whole – let's get right down to it. <br/><br/>The Town is a movie more based on story than anything. There are really no quirky one-liners (save the usual crap talking and drug/sex references). No outrageous car scenes (those that do occur are mild). No dainty, prolonged sex scenes. Although, having said that, The Town isn't really a thinking man's movie either. While the story is what the film's strong point is: the brutal honesty is there isn't much there. But then again, as my girlfriend who I saw the film with tonight pointed out, maybe that's what's great about it. It's clean and good, quick and simple. Fair enough, but then, this isn't what this is about, is it? It's about being tricked into believing Mr. Affleck has made the next catholic classic. Jeremy Renner toting a Tec-Nine and bursting it randomly in his coke-head characters quirky fashion easily has to be the best part of this movie, and I CAN'T STAND Renner. Anyway, nothing about the plot differs much from ""Set It Off meets any-run-of-the-mill-girl-gets-with-her-hostage-taker"" flicks out there. The real evidence in this is that Casey Affleck chose not to appear in the movie. That's what I asked myself before, and answered shortly after watching this film. Would Michael Mann's brother miss out on a pivotal role in a movie such as Heat to follow Joaquin Phoenix around? I think not.<br/><br/>**Also, the flashback scenes didn't really affect the movie and were thrown in at the oddest, most redundant of times. I only say this because they added no real knowledge or meaning to what was already known."
"TheUnknown837-1","7","2","6","23 September 2010"," A smartly-written, fascinating character study (and good movie) with a few easily-forgiven flaws
","A great many people now seem to have forgiven Ben Affleck for not-so-satisfying works from him the past, now that his new film ""The Town"" (a fascinating, tautly-written character study disguised as a bank heist nail-biter) is out. I am not incredibly familiar with Mr. Affleck's work, but this very enjoyable movie has a parallel for me. Most of it is so good that I can easily forgive the fundamental flaws that it does have.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck is not only the director, but the star of ""The Town"" in which he plays an experienced, methodical, charismatic (and concerned) bank robber in Charlestown. During one of his heists, things go awry and Affleck and his men must take the bank manager hostage. They escape and release her and later on, concerned that she might have learned something that could sell them to the FBI, Affleck tracks the manage (Rebecca Hall) down and eventually meets her. In the process of deciphering information from her, he also forms a slow but inevitable romantic relationship with his onetime hostage and things take a turn for the worst when the FBI gets involved.<br/><br/>Mr. Affleck is a highly talented filmmaker as well as an actor. Actually, if you were to ask me to list his pros and cons, I'd say he's an even greater director because there is not one single poorly-done moment in ""The Town."" There are some flaws with the screenplay and some character-to-character relationships, but he is able to command his cameras, cast, and crew with kinetic proficiency while giving a more than commendable performance all at the same time. Mr. Affleck is not yet the masters such as Clint Eastwood, who do the same time, but he is quickly rising to that status.<br/><br/>However, I think some people will be misled by the advertising. This is not really a nail-biter like ""The Bourne Identity."" It's more of a straightforward, focused character study on our central character. There are obligatory scenes of action, including a very exciting climax at the finale, but it's the human relationships that are the core of the picture. Mr. Affleck is almost always on camera and it is his relationship to the character played by the gorgeous and talented English actress Rebecca Hall that is the most fascinating and compelling element of the entire picture. The scenes between them have so much power, so much fresh dialogue, and so much romantic persuasiveness that it makes up for the lack of real development say between Affleck and his childhood pal played by Jeremy Renner or his boss, played by Pete Postlethwaite. Mr. Affleck and Ms Hall are so perfectly cast for their roles and they do a wonderful job at developing this at-first kinetic and then complicated love affair. I loved and cherished every single minute where these two were on-screen and frankly, I wish there had been more of them because it's between these two characters that we have a solid connection. With the others, it's kind of dicey.<br/><br/>It is because this movie is a character study and that some of the connections between characters is underwritten that I cannot give ""The Town"" a higher rating and why I think it doesn't realize it's full potential. The friendship between Affleck and Renner shows promise and has originality in its moments, but there are not enough scenes of them together and not enough is learned about Mr. Renner's character to really care what becomes of their friendship. And although Pete Poslethwaite is one of the best actors of modern times, he doesn't have much more to do here than he did in the remake of ""Clash of the Titans."" I'm sorry to say that he was a rather boring villain, as was the FBI agent played by John Hamm. In addition, I felt Affleck's relationship to a one-time flame played by Blake Lively was fascinating, but underdeveloped and that the sex scene between the two of them, like many, was a complete throw-away.<br/><br/>""The Town"" is a very enjoyable movie and I do owe it a lot of gratitude. Because before I saw this picture, I had seen three absolutely detestable movies right in a row, one of which was making me feel abandoned by the cinema and wanting to resort to staying home and watching my old favorites. Thankfully, Mr. Affleck delivered a very well-directed film with mostly hits (and a few misses) in his story and my love for the movies has been restored. The film does have its flaws, but they are easily forgiven and the second hour of the picture strikes with so much kinetic energy and (more importantly) emotion that I instantly and gladly recommend ""The Town."""

","Ben Affleck does a surprisingly good job as an actor and the director of The Town. I've come not to expect too much from him. It's a solid crime movie with plenty of suspense and action and good performances all around - who knew?"
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","6","1","2","18 May 2018"," Its action set-pieces are high-notes, but the overall effect is a weak and fairly forgettable one.
","'The Town (2010)' is a thriller centred around a gang of bank robbers residing in the supposed 'breeding ground for armed robbers', Charlestown in Boston, Massachusetts. As is usual for most of Affleck's fare, and for most of the features set in that particular city, there is a distinct air of 'localism', highlighting a close-knit community with almost patriotic levels of commitment to one another. This sense of pride for a place is pushed hard, with the ground-level - and usually criminal - elements elevated to a pedestal even above the country - and, certainly, law of the land - in which they reside, almost like those jingoistic military flicks if they were to replace their flag with a back-yard barbecue. It is a strange choice, to put so much emphasis on the setting of the piece when it isn't even all that relevant to the story. Stranger still, is to feature TV-style sweeping shots of the skyline. Still, the handling of the environment is practically a trope for features set in the director's home-town at this point, so it's understandable why the choice was made. Demonising, or pseudo doing such, the FBI does feel like a missed opportunity, though. It feels generic at this point to make the 'good guys' bad by having them be general jerks, if they can't be outright corrupt (though it starts heading that way at one point), and makes for a less interesting feature. If the FBI guys were more nuanced, the flick could've played as a nice two-hander, a cat-and-mouse with conflicting sympathies on the part of the audience. As is, the audience is only meant to root for Affleck and company, whom are all 'bad guys' and don't do much to change our perception from that. Personally, I did empathise with the protagonist, but the other members of the crew aren't fleshed out enough to care for and some of their actions aren't ones you'd want to see go unpunished. In this way, we don't always root for our 'heroes' to get away with it, which means that the switching of the 'good and bad' has kind of failed. Arguably, this would make a more nuanced piece but nuance isn't being aimed for in this aspect. The feature is fairly slow, too. Its central romance feels doomed to fail, fleshed out only so that it can fall apart, and isn't gripping enough to be a main focus. It also isn't given all that much attention despite its time on-screen. The handling of character development is nice in some select scenes, but much of the 'masculinity gone awry' has been done better before. The action set-pieces are all fantastic, though. The finale, especially, is a taut and tense affair with frenetic violence escalating from some fairly suspenseful moments. It leaves you on a relatively high-note, despite a slow and stop-start ending - that's also very clichéd, and does make up for some of the less interesting segments. Still, the lasting impact of the piece is a quite weak and forgettable one. 6/10"

"CinemaClown","Null","1","2","23 June 2017"," Another Strong Vehicle For Ben Affleck To Showcase His Filmmaking Aptitude. Tense, Exciting & Thrilling.
","Riding on the momentum provided by its consistent dose of intensely gripping action, The Town is a tense, thrilling & entertaining crime thriller that, despite leaving none of the genre clichés on the sidelines, succeeds in keeping a firm grip on the viewers' attention and is more engaging than one expects.<br/><br/>Set in Charlestown, a breeding ground for armed robbers, the story of The Town follows a gang of four lifelong friends who, after a series of successful bank robberies and close encounters with the police, set out to finish one final heist. But monitoring them closely is an FBI agent who's all set to bring them down.<br/><br/>Co-written, directed by & starring Ben Affleck, The Town serves as another vehicle for the actor to showcase his filmmaking talents and there's plenty in the picture that attest to his eye for creating kinetically charged sequences that brim with excitement & tension. Affleck's direction is quite lean during moments of action but not so in the dramatic portions.<br/><br/>While Michael Mann's Heat is an obvious inspiration, the overcast ambiance & setting is lifted from other notable crime thrillers. The story is riveting when it's dealing with the group's interactions or next assignments but loses interest whenever it attempts to focus on their separate lives. There's a lot that it could've done without, for those scenes only end up hampering its overall effectiveness.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, The Town packs a talented ensemble in Ben Affleck, Jeremy Renner, Rebecca Hall, John Hamm, Blake Lively & Pete Postlethwaite, with Renner leaving the most lasting impression of them all with a strong, stellar input. Affleck plays his part responsibly, Hall does well with what she's given, Hamm is just as good while Postlethwaite greatly impresses in his brief part.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Town is thoroughly captivating, is expertly directed & benefits a lot from Jeremy Renner's show-stealing performance but it could've been much more if its drama was half as compelling as its masterly choreographed action segments. Nevertheless, Affleck's sophomore directorial effort further sharpens his filmmaking skills, has got more positives than negatives, and is going to satisfy most viewers, if not all. Definitely worth a watch."
"fersan-07958","6","1","2","26 July 2016"," A flawed, yet interesting effort from Ben Affleck
","To clarify I just want to say that I like Ben Affleck's work. I have nothing against the guy and believe that his work in Argo and Gone Girl are pretty respectable. This is why I was excited to watch The Town, his one big return to Hollywood after the warm yet unnoticeable reaction Gone Baby Gone received. The premise appears to be intriguing with some great talent involved. Affleck, Rebecca Hall, John Ham, Jeremmy Renner and a pretty respectable cast of background characters seem to promise at least a decent pay off in terms of the acting department. When the film starts with a very well filmed bank robbery, the films starts very promising. The opening sequence appears to set the tone amazingly, yet, the film never picks up after that. We are supposed to care about this developing relationship between Affleck and Hall and it never delivers. The relationship looks more like a lazy chick-flick rather than the backdrop of a crime drama. What is respectable of this movie are the robbery sequences, which shows that Affleck is more suited for the quick paced actions rather than the drama. Still a nice try, but now it feels nothing but a community theater rehearsal to prepare for the critically acclaimed Argo."
"jrdragon40","6","1","2","9 February 2016"," A street smart invigorating action crime thriller on the unrealistic side
","This movie is fast paced for the most part, and very satisfying when it comes to action, thrills, and just a tinge of drama. The main cast gives a convincing and chemistry bound performance, in a story set to depict a inner crime-wave stricken Boston focusing on the inside (and criminal) perspective.<br/><br/>While the film gives well executed scenery and action movement, it strays too far outside the realm of plausibility, and falls to closely to the crime-drama movie cliché. It lacks the realism depicted in say, Good Fellas, but will give you action sequences that rival that of the Departed."

"Mr_Sensitive","7","1","2","9 November 2012"," Good But Not Great
","Despite many positive reviews by fellow movie lover which lead me to watch this, I rather find this film a mediocre at its best.<br/><br/>Synopsis: A robber fell in love with the bank he just robbed while at the same time tried to distance himself from the crime business and the rest of the gang.<br/><br/>The story is nothing new that we haven't already seen or heard. And this movie makes sure it stays that way. You can very much predict from scene to scene what going to happen next who die and who lives, but despite from that it is still mildly entertaining that two and the half hours went by quite fast with decent amount of action sequences.<br/><br/>The casting was alright though for me not a single person was really stood out in their performance. Only two days went by and I hardly think about those characters and the movie anymore. I don't even understand how Jeremy got the nod from the Oscar, he hardly has any screen time and his performance was hardly remembering (despite the fact I watch the unedited DVD).<br/><br/>As for the direction and everything else was also very ordinary. Ben tell good story but he has no artistic vision. Everything was very straight forward, man shoot a man, man kill a man, man love a women etc. Everything else is just bland.<br/><br/>All in all it is another ordinary movie. I can't really understand why people find it to be very good drama/heist movie, to the point that they even compare it to HEAT. This film is not even close to HEAT and I don't think I will likely watch this again anytime soon.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Sure, you might it more than I do. Worth a rent!! Rating: 6.5/10"
"StevePulaski","8","1","2","19 October 2012"," Do the people cause the town pressure or does the town cause the people the pressure?
","It's an understatement to say that Ben Affleck's first directorial effort, Gone Baby Gone, took audiences by surprise. Here was the man who, just a few years back, was Matt Murdoch in a rather hokey adaptation of Daredevil, was plastered on the cover of tabloids with Jennifer Lopez in his arms, which brewed untold ridicule, and was caught up in a whirlwind of uncertainty as an actor. I hate to continue to ride on Affleck's past, but after seeing Gone Baby Gone and The Town, two films promoting the fact that the man is serious about coming back to the industry with a serious, no-nonsense persona, I'd love for him to be the poster-child of actors turned directors that can show others change in the industry can come whenever and, if you're serious, you can be accepted and praised highly.<br/><br/>For the most part, The Town works on both the levels it wants to, which are as efficient action entertainment and commentary on the world of robbery and the culture of criminality. We are introduced to Charlestown, Massachusetts, a gray, gloomy city built on crime and robberies. The town is known for its explicit burglaries conducted by four men, unidentified by police. To us, they are Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James ""Jem"" Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert ""Gloansy"" Magloan (Slaine), and Desmond ""Dez"" Elden (Owen Burke).<br/><br/>The film opens with the men, strapped with masks and automatic weapons, conducting a robbery on a bank and finishing the job by taking the manager, Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall), hostage, only to release her shortly after. Not long after the robbery, Doug becomes romantically involved with Claire, keeping his relationship a secret from the mob and the mob a secret from his relationship. In the meantime, Doug consistently contemplates leaving the mob life in Charlestown behind to favor smaller, less stressful life in the suburbs. If only he wasn't burdened and constantly threatened by the unpredictable Jem, who goes from calm to belligerent in an instant. Jem is played wonderfully by Renner, in a performance light years away from his character in The Hurt Locker. Doug's pressure also continues to skyrocket when he learns that FBI Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) is explicitly tracking his mob crew and is slowly closing in on them.<br/><br/>Affleck takes on triple duty in the film, playing the lead role, director, and co-writer for this large project. His directing talents are employed greatly during the chase sequences in the film, which are photographed with piercing kinetic fun and stunning visual clarity. Affleck forgoes quick-cuts and a shaky camera, and instead, uses the tactics of two to three second cuts and realism in the chase scenes in order to elevate the picture's use of them. And what I mean by realism is, when a police car turns a tight corner in a compressed alley-way, he doesn't slickly turn but almost completely spins out. In a time where chase scenes look too clean and special effects the prime tool to construct an action movie, it's strikes me as refreshing to see one rely on wit and realistic movement.<br/><br/>The film's first act is equipped with a fine eye for detail, specifically in the shootout sequences and the robberies, and includes seriously compelling character development on McCray. The second and third act continue to focus more on the character aspect, which at times, unfortunately, feels a little weighted, but those scenes can not bog down what is clearly a fun, incredibly entertaining action film, with depth and style at its core. Again, much like in his debut, Affleck feels comfortable directing a picture of this caliber, and he feels confident assuming the lead role and penning the script as well. The way he makes Boston's murky grayness into its own breathing character is something along the lines of Clint Eastwood's directorial efforts, which is a remarkable and admirably talented feat. As long as he isn't distracted by dead-end projects, it would appear that the man has a long, eventful career ahead of him in his later life.<br/><br/>Starring: Ben Affleck, Jon Hamm, Rebecca Hall, Blake Lively, Jeremy Renner, Pete Postlethwaite, and Chris Cooper. Directed by: Ben Affleck."

","After the success of Gone Baby Gone, this is the second movie by Ben Affleck. The movie is good in bits and parts but on the whole it fails to live up to its promise. Though it is still much better from most of the other movies that have been released this year, it is not as edgy and thrilling as Ben Affleck's directorial debut. The best performances in this movie are given by Claire(Rebecca Hall), James (Renner) and Krista (Blake Lively). It could have been another memorable movie if it was handled in a better manner. A good thing about the movie is its music that is one of the highlights. Ben Affleck needs to make sure that his movies are edited in a better manner as that will do real justice to his talent as a good Director."
"MikeyB1793","5","1","2","2 March 2012"," Explosions and gun-fire aplenty
","I found this move to be a pastiche. It starts as a crime caper – bank robbers in Boston who grew up in the slums. At the beginning we witness one such robbery where they abduct a female bank employee, Claire (Rebecca Hall), and eventually release her.<br/><br/>The robbers are worried that she may be able to identify them – so this falls to Doug (played by Ben Affleck) to determine how much Claire knows. He does more than this and they start to be attracted to each other and we have a romance developing. So far OK - the dialogue is well done and this all seems credible. One of Doug's partners, James (Jeremy Renner), comes to be aware of this budding romance and expresses concern – one of the ""townies"" going out with a yuppie-uppity is disconcerting – besides she was the kidnap victim in their robbery. James witnesses the happy couple in a bistro (as opposed to a ""townie bar"") – and there is a confrontation between the two crooks after Claire leaves; that again is well done. Also Claire is providing evidence to the police, who have launched a full-scale investigation of the robbery. Claire is unwittingly in a conundrum so the tension starts to mount.<br/><br/>What ruined this movie for me are the two high-powered shoot-outs – one in the middle of the movie, and the other at the end – both are a cataclysm of gunfire, cars overturning and/or shot to pieces. I am sure more ammo was exchanged than in a typical day in Afghanistan. It was just out of proportion to the rest of the movie. The movie was gritty and approaching realism- but then Hollywood stepped in and said lets get some explosions and shoot-outs – and away we go. Sometimes all the noise and fine weaponry can be enthralling, but please save it for the appropriate movie."
"tnrcooper","7","1","2","16 April 2011"," Fair-to-middling heist/drama
","This is a fair heist movie. Ben Affleck again shows a light touch in teasing good performances out of actors, in pacing movies, and in writing a movie with a fair degree of sensitivity. He is very good as a director. I wouldn't say that this is the best heist/drama that I've ever seen. However, it's a fair way to spend a couple of hours and this isn't a film that is a great waste of time.<br/><br/>Affleck gets some good acting from Jeremy Renner as his best buddy James and from Blake Lively, a down-on-her-luck girl supposed-to-be-the whore with the heart of gold. He is also quite good himself as the cool, tough leader of his crew which is composed of long-time friends who have worked in that group for a long time. Jon Hamm is serviceable, though not particularly notable as FBI investigator Adam Frawley. He's a competent, focused detective up to the task of tracking down very skilled bank robbers. Affleck is Doug, the leader of a successful, accomplished bank robber crew composed of longtime friends who have operated as a group for some time. The group's security is compromised when, in a heist gone wrong, Doug takes a hostage, but then, in order to insure that the hostage does not give away the crew, he tracks the hostage down but then becomes involved with her (Rebecca Hall of ""Frost/Nixon"" as Claire). This relationship ultimately puts the crew in Frawley's cross-hairs.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Doug and Adam are both sniffing around all available options, looking for clues as to whether their opposite number knows what they are up to. I found myself comparing the film unfavorably to ""Heat"" in that the crew was not as sophisticated. I also thought that the plot of ""Heat"" was more byzantine and brilliant, but that said, this is a serviceable crime drama with good performances, fair writing, and an interesting plot. I think that Affleck has again shown himself to be an excellent director although I do think his crime drama here is a bit derivative."

"Robert_duder","8","1","2","22 February 2011"," Well made, stylish crime caper with a great cast
","The Town seems to be highly appreciated, well received film by critics and movie goers a like. It has received some awards although the main awards have only gone to Jeremy Renner as he is a critic favourite since his turn in The Hurt Locker. I think where The Town is successful is that it appeals to the main stream action thriller audience but also has a powerful cast, great performances, a lot of depth and something critics can sink their teeth into and that isn't an easy feat. The film focuses on anti-heroes and you will root for the bad guy despite yourself. Boston, of course, plays a huge part in the film as the entire back drop and makes you feel like you are right there with them feeling the adrenaline of the robberies and the intensity of being chased. Part mystery, part action, part thriller and with a dash of drama it is one of those films that has a little of everything to please everyone. However strange the romance in the film is, it still plays itself out throughout the film.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck directs and stars in the film proving he still has a lot of talent left in a career some were surmising was washed up. Affleck's Doug is a powerful character that is both a bad-ass villain and an anti-hero at the same time. His character has a lot of layers and definitely easy to watch. Jeremy Renner makes Affleck's character look like a hero. Renner's ""Jem"" is twisted and disturbed and really creepy. He is the perfect villain to the entire story. Renner and Affleck have a palpable chemistry. Rebecca Hall is decent as the bank manager who is victimized unknowingly by Affleck's crew and then begins a relationship with Affleck. Her character is a little less interesting as the male cast, she is more means to an end as far as Affleck's character goes but she does well and has good chemistry with Affleck. I've never found Jon Hamm to be a very versatile actor but the role of business man or in this case a determined FBI Agent fits him very well because he is an intensity about him. The great character actor Pete Postlethwaite is excellent as the mobster of the film. Every scene he is in is terrific and its unfortunate he isn't used more. Another great character actor Chris Cooper has a good cameo as Affleck's father although he doesn't get a lot of screen time.<br/><br/>Say what you will about Ben Affleck's career but as a director and as an actor he has proved he knows how to show some intensity. His previous directorial Gone Baby Gone showed some really great intensity and now this film proves he can direct great action as well. He has a passion for films and sometimes it works and sometimes he stumbles but as long as he keeps finding or making films like The Town he will be the star he deserves to be. To top off the trifecta he also co-wrote The Town ensuring that everything happens the way he wants it to. He knows what people like at the movies and action thriller fans will love The Town. Although it easily fits into the crime caper genre it doesn't feel like a re-hash of other similar films like Heat for instance. The Town stands on its own and is well worth seeing! 8.5/10"

And FBI agent Jon Hamm wants to bring the boys down before striking again, which happens in two rushed scenes liken to Michael Mann's HEAT: lots of gun-fire between drawn-out dialog (the film's bulk), establishing characters more than driving them."

","The Town is definitely one of the best movies of 2010 no doubt about it. I am disgusted that the Academy decided to overlook this movie with only one nomination. Why the heck didn't it get the nomination for Best Picture? Also Ben Affleck is slowly bringing back his name to Hollywood. He has been in or directed some good pictures as of late.<br/><br/>This is about a group of bank robbers in Charlestown who are on a mission to not get caught by the FBI. There's also a love story between one of the robbers and a bank manager who was a victim.<br/><br/>The acting is amazing. Ben Affleck certainly is regaining his name. At least Jeremy Renner was nominated by the Academy. I loved his hardcore character. In fact the rest of the cast was fantastic.<br/><br/>My favorite scenes had to do with the robbery of Fenway Park. I hate the Red Sox so I watched these scenes with glee. The way this offseason went for Boston they deserved to have their money stolen.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a gritty crime thriller that works on all levels. Too bad the Academy didn't recognize this like it ought to. I rate this film 10/10."

","I don't know which actor commented that Ben Affleck was overlooked for an Academy Award nomination for The TOWN, but he was RIGHT! This movie was the BEST movie I have seen in a long time. It held my interest from start to finish--suspense, romance, danger-- my heart was pounding through most of it cheering on the bad guys, the robbers. I cried in the END. All great actors. Renner's performance was excellent right up to the end. The FBI leader was pretty good and easy on the eye. This movie was well directed and it's great that movies are being made in and around Boston. Ben Affleck is an all-around Awesome Guy--Way to go Ben!"

","Well what can I say well done Ben Affleck this was probably the best film of 2010. The acting was magnificent, action scenes intense while at the same time being quite dramatic and keeping you wondering what's going to happen next. I watched the extended cut which was quite long (148 mins) but I wasn't bored at all, I felt sucked in the whole time..very well directed and the supporting cast were perfect. I think we can expect more great things from Affleck if he continues rolling out films of this caliber. I Did enjoy and will watch again for sure, a lot of people are saying it's a rip off of the film ""Heat"" I guess I can see a similarity but who cares this film is just as good. If you are into gritty crime drama's with excellent story lines then this one is for you for sure"

","Better than your average caper movie, ""The Town"" focuses on a group of four career criminals (led by Ben Affleck and Jeremy Renner, who is quickly becoming a favorite of mine) from Charlestown in Boston. They're smart and good at what they do—until Ben Affleck's character falls for the bank manager they rob. Wanting to leave his criminal past behind him, he appeals to his cohorts, who refuse to let him get away before pulling off one last job. Commitment to friends becomes compromised with his developing love for the bank manager, and the authorities, in the form of Jon Hamm as an FBI agent and the always under-appreciated Titus Welliver as a Boston PD detective, begin closing in. The story is smart and well-developed, and the action sequences are explosive and exciting. Not quite sure this movie is Oscar material, as some have argued, but it certainly affirms that Affleck has matured considerably as an actor and a director."
"dayspring-one","9","1","2","22 January 2011"," Welcome Back, Mr. Affleck
","It's no surprise to anyone that Ben Affleck has been off the map for quite some time, despite minor roles in other movies lately. Could it be that putting on that different hat, the director/actor one, was the change this guy needed? As a director he made his point with 'Gone Baby Gone', but now I must say he deserves a standing ovation for 'The Town'. <br/><br/>Who knew, right? I mean, the guy was puked and mocked in tabloids, and I won't mention what me & my fellow comic-fans thought about his Daredevil stint. Honestly, I don't give a rat's behind who he dates. Let me judge his acting instead. Well, add directing now, too.<br/><br/>This movie simply blew me away. As a director, Affleck took me to Charlestown, where you can almost taste the downwards spiral of mess the characters find themselves in. A raw picture, raw characters, and a raw story. As an actor, Affleck and his co-actors convinced from the start, you just want the 'bad guy' to succeed. And those accents! It gave that little bit extra, without overdoing it. At times you would almost think of the plot twist possible with Jon Hamm. Luckily this isn't the last movie that will feature Pete Postlethwaite, but he did one heckuva job as usual. Jeremy Renner portrayed that zealot the story asked for. I was surprised to see 'Gossip Girl' Blake Lively in the movie, as well. To me, she was bit of the weak link in the ensemble. I felt she did a good job, but didn't convince me as much as the rest did. Almost as if she tried to hard. Rebecca Hall however was a positive surprise. After in my opinion, forgettable roles in major productions, she gave us a character to remember. <br/><br/>All and all, Affleck made the movie into one of my favorites. <br/><br/>Good job..

","""The Town"" showcases Ben Affleck's potential as a director, but it also highlights the qualities about his style that have so far prevented that potential from fully blossoming.<br/><br/>Set in the dreariest, gloomiest parts of Boston, much like his directorial debut ""Gone, Baby Gone,"" ""The Town"" is a moody character study disguised as a heist film. The authentic feel and raw edges Affleck brings to his story go a long way toward masking the fact that it's full of pure movie cliché. A sensitive criminal (played by Affleck himself) becomes conflicted and dreams of starting a new life once he begins to receive the love of a good woman (Rebecca Hall, lovely as always but stuck with a somewhat thankless role). Affleck seems to have gone to the Clint Eastwood school of filmmaking, where everything -- both in the actual physical production and its tone -- must be gray and drab and ponderously ""important."" It's a slow and talky movie, and I found myself wishing Affleck would just get on with things already. I didn't dislike it, but I did find that my opinion of it began to gradually sink after I'd let the memory of it settle in my mind for a few days after watching it.<br/><br/>Affleck clearly wants to be taken seriously as a Filmmaker with a capital ""F,"" but he needs to remember that the best filmmakers manage to make movies that are both important and entertaining.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

","I just finished watching this movie, and it was simply worth to watch. The movie was not just crime movie, it contained some human drama, and shooting the movie from view point of the criminals definitely made the movie one of a kind. <br/><br/>Despite the fact that most of people probably think the best part of the movie is the human drama, my best part of this movie is the exciting gun fights. The machine guns were basically used in the movie, and for me who was getting bored with the recent movies' dull hand gun fight all of the gun fight in this movie was definitely worth to watch.<br/><br/>However, I have a reason to put 7 on this movie, which is Blake Lively. I'm not one of the haters of her at all, I even like her and her acting, and I'm not gonna criticize her performance here. But she plays a hooker? Come on, even if she had a heavy make up, still she is too hot to be a hooker, don't you think? I know it totally depends on person's taste in women, but it seems to me she is even way hotter than the heroine in the movie!

"TxMike","Null","1","2","17 January 2011"," Bank robbers in Charlestown, Boston.
","The title ""The Town"" is a reference to that area of Boston, on the north side, called 'Charlestown', or to locals, 'The Town.' It was settled back in the early 1600s, later was annexed by Boston, and built up a heavily Irish Catholic population after the potato famine of the 1840s resulted in many Irish settling there. As the introduction tells, per square mile this area has historically produced more bank robbers than any other area in the world.<br/><br/>It is presumed that robbery is a family trait, passed down to the kids. Ben Affleck is Doug MacRay, his own father is in prison, and his mother disappeared when he was a young boy. In present time he leads a small band of 4 who rob banks, working for the ""florist"" who comes up with leads and helps to launder the stolen funds.<br/><br/>As the movie opens they are robbing a Boston bank, and in the process find themselves required to take a hostage, British actress Rebecca Hall as Claire Keesey, the assistant bank manager. Blindfolded, she is driven in broad circles and let out near the water, told to walk until her feet feel water. But when they look at her drivers license they stole, find she lives in their neighborhood, and worry that she might recognize them, so they need to consider eliminating her, something they never do.<br/><br/>Through some wise detective work they isolate the guys they think did the crime and begin setting up surveillance to get evidence for a grand jury. This effort is led by Jon Hamm as FBI S.A. Adam Frawley. <br/><br/>This is a very good movie, not simplistic in its approach or in its outcome. There is a sympathetic member of the gang, who wants to make sure Claire does not suffer, and there is a hot-head who seems to have nothing to lose, after 9 years in prison for murder. It is a delicate balancing act to keep the group on task.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck directs and stars, and had a hand in writing the script. <br/><br/>Fine British actor Pete Postlethwaite is a key character as Fergus 'Fergie' Colm, the florist who has his hands on the operations. He died recently, this January 2011, and it was a mixed blessing seeing him in one of his last performances. Chris Cooper was Stephen MacRay, Doug's dad in prison. <br/><br/>SPOILERS: Doug takes it upon himself to watch Claire, to see if she has anything to identify them. Unexpectedly they meet at a laundromat when she asks him if he has change, then they form a friendship which leads to a love affair. She thinks he is a rock-breaker, a laborer. They both decide they want to get out of Boston, maybe to Florida. But when Doug tries to get out of the ""business"" Fergie threatens him and those he cares about, so he agrees to do the last job, a $3.5Million heist of the Cathedral of Boston, Fenway Park. It doesn't go well, an alarm is tripped, police arrive, a gunfight ensues, eventually all are killed but Doug who escapes in a police uniform. He makes it back to the florist and disposes of him, hides a satchel of money in the community garden that Claire works in, and heads out of town by train. We see that Claire used the money for improvements to a community center for the kids. We see Doug on the bayous of Florida, and the orange he left with the money is her clue to look him up."
"ghost_dog86","8","1","2","15 January 2011"," The Town: Boston must be the most dangerous place on earth.
","With intense stylized action and a suspenseful pace, ""The Town"" shows (once again) how gritty and violent life in Boston can be. In Ben Affleck's (Pearl Harbor) first attempt behind the camera, he seems to have struck gold doing what he does best, a film that highlights his home turf. Starring Jon Hamm (Mad Men), Rebecca Hall (Vicky Cristina Barcelona), Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker), Blake Lively (The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants) and Affleck himself in the starring role, ""The Town"" continues the legacy of Boston crime genres. And the end result? Worth seeing, but not quite best picture award winning caliber. In fact, this is the type of movie that may alienate some viewers into thinking that maybe they didn't like it as much because they didn't grow up rooting for the Red Socks.<br/><br/>""The Town"" centers around what was said to have been one of the most crime ridden towns in America, Charlestown, Massachusetts. Doug MacRay (Affleck) and James Coughlin (Renner) were childhood friends and, as adults, are now apart of a long legacy of criminals to come out of Charlestown. After one bank robbery, in particular, MacRay becomes infatuated with the bank manager (Hall) and (what do you know) she happens to be the only one who can connect MacRay and Coughlin to the robbery. The one person who can send MacRay and Coughlin to prison for life, but will she do it? Or will love supersede all? Yeah, by the end this movie does get a little too sappy for its own good.<br/><br/>""The Town"" is a throw back to the look and feel of movies like ""Heat"" or ""Training Day"" (just not as developed as those examples). The problem here, aside from the so-so written script, is that half way through the film the love story between the bank manager and MacRay takes over the story. In saying that, this film is still worth seeing.<br/><br/>The huge buzz around this film may be because this is Affleck's directorial debut (yes, he should have been nominated for best director) and Jon Hamm's feature film debut (who is nothing special here. Do you hear what I said, all you fans of ""Mad Men""!?), but Renner and Lively are the real reasons for this films success. Lively gives a performance (as small as it is) that will remind audiences of how multi-faceted of an actress she is. As for Renner, he absolutely out acts everybody on screen. He needs to be nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actor. If anything, he is better here than he was in ""The Hurt Locker"".<br/><br/>Final Thought: This may not be up to par with ""The Departed"" or movies of its own Bostonian crime genre, but I will say that for its few shortcomings ""The Town"" is the most underrated film of 2010. Affleck's directing style is that of a seasoned vet. The storyline may have turned from action film to melodrama all too easily for some who expected more action, but don't let that stop you from renting this very good film.<br/><br/>Please visit my page on Examiner.com http://www.examiner.com/x-52464-San-Jose-Indie-Movie-Examiner and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

You don't care because you never get to know them.<br/><br/>The Ugly: The scene of Doug following Claire to the laundry mat almost ruins the film. Why would he stupid enough to try and hookup with someone he robbed at gunpoint a few days ago?

","This is one of those movies which were all the rave in the 70's, with idolized bank robbers that lived fast and hard. However, in 2010 it feels dated. They have cell phones and flat computer screens, but not much else. The skillset used on both sides of the conflict is the same as in an old movie.<br/><br/>The film stars Ben Affleck who is also the director and part writer and a bunch of other people, Pete Postlethwaite being the only notable, but with a real small part. Everybody does their parts, the movie is well acted, well directed and the feel of things just right; however, I can't help but feel a bit disappointed by the setting. Maybe things are just like this in Charlestown now and maybe the fibbies are just as dumb in real life, but I kind of doubt it.<br/><br/>Conclusion: good enough film for its category, but not exactly my piece of cake.

"DaveDiggler","7","1","2","6 January 2011"," Entertaining Heist Film
","""The Town"" is an excellent film that does have its flaws. It is, however, one of the best films made of 2010 (maybe the best film of th year). Ben Affleck really proves himself as a serious filmmaker with his follow up to ""Gone Baby Gone,"" which was among the best films of 2007. The direction is amazing and Affleck really impresses me here, far more than the aforementioned ""Gone Baby Gone,"" which was standard fare that is the exact opposite of ""The Town."" ""Gone Baby Gone"" relied more on story, dialogue and acting whereas ""The Town"" relies on great execution of a rather unoriginal script. If there is a major negative aspect of the film is it's complete unoriginality. It's a remake of ""Heat."" Plain and simple. Thats what it is.<br/><br/>The shootouts are phenomenal and they're the best since ""Heat,"" which are, pretty much, the best ever. It's a great little crime movie that yes, we've seen done before, but the performances and the craftsmanship are impeccable. That's really what makes it quite good. Its an extremely entertaining film, and for people who gravitate towards the genre (such as myself), should really enjoy it (unless they have some hatred towards Ben Affleck). <br/><br/>Jeremy Renner, who plays a Joe Pesci spawned stereotype, is truly amazing. He takes a blandly written character and makes him a really intense, nearly unpredictable person. He steals scene after scene he's in. It's the one true standout performance of the film. Affleck, the actor, is much better than expected, but not completely convincing as the leader of the Charlestown heist team. <br/><br/>You can enjoy it for what it is: a well done crime film with heavy action and good acting, or you can pick it apart for being unoriginal, which it is. If you sit and think about all the flaws of the film you can convince yourself it's an average to terrible movie. When I sit and watch it, I'm drawn in and entertained from start to finish. <br/><br/>The robbery sequences are gripping thanks to top notch directing, editing and sound mixing. The suspense is amazing. The ensemble cast is terrific. It's the kind of movie so entertaining that it will constantly bring me back to it. It's a magnificent achievement that does everything it sets out to do. It's one of the best films I've seen all year."

For me, his stocks have arisen after seeing this movie. I already kinda expect what he is coming up next.<br/><br/>I liked the movie mainly for few things. First, it's a great entertainment. It has good chase scenes. The bank robbery scenes were also great. Some of the dialogues are quite intense. I mean, whatever you expect from a great action-movie, you'll find it here.<br/><br/>Boston is the town. In my opinion, one the most fascinating cities of US.

","Powerful and distinct characters richly portray a life of crime in Boston in this gripping tale of expert bank robbers trying to stay one-step ahead of an ever escalating police manhunt.<br/><br/>It's a challenging tale of Good vs. Bad vs. Worse when our mastermind bank criminal (Ben Affleck) decides he's had enough of his seedy, immoral life and wants to change for the better. But can he escape from not only the cops who are banging at the door, but the cohorts who depend on him and refuse their blessings for his departure? ""The Town"" is a well-done movie which is sometimes hard to understand the thick accents and mumbled words. However the storyline is easy to follow, mostly linear, well-acted with some tense moments as we fear discovery and capture for our criminals. Interesting that we root for Ben Affleck's character, because in spite of all his robberies and crime he has a soft heart and desires change. It's revealed that he fell into this lifestyle, and so we feel forgiveness is allowed.<br/><br/>Compared to something like Oceans 11, the heists pulled off seem relatively simple - especially the grandest theft of the movie, which was just too easy. I also felt a little more could have been done with plot elements like the give-away tattoo and the potential for the intelligent girlfriend to discover the true identity of her boyfriend.<br/><br/>But what little there is to criticize is easily compensated for with excellent action and an intriguing plot. We seem to be eternally interested in geniuses (even if their smarts are in the field of robbery.) Car chases, ambushes, gun fights, disguises, crime families... what's not to like!"

","If you think Ben Affleck is a great Actor, you should take a better look at ""Good Will Hunting"" (1997). If you think Ben is a great Screenwriter, you should see ""The Town"" more thoroughly. In thiz last movie, he also becomes the Director. For me, Ben is the third talented Actor-Director in the past decade, beside Clint Eastwood and Mel Gibson. Thiz is his second long feature after respectable ""Gone Baby Gone"" in 2007. The town is Charleston Boston, where everybody knows everybody. It revolves around the bank thief Doug (Ben Affleck), his partner in crime James (Jeremy Renner), along with their former hostage Claire (Rebecca Hall) who will be having a love affair with Doug later, and a FBI agent Adam (John Hamm). All of them get tangled into a cat and mouse situation. First half of the movie, it introduces the characters and situations. Then the second half, it flips over nicely by explaining the motives behind those characters. I think Ben is success with his directing method because he does not exaggerate things up, he just let every thing flows naturally. Yes, he plays save here. The factors that empower thiz movie are simply a good script and consistent Actor performances. Ben himself shows a very calm and convincing performance. As well Rebecca Hall as his love interest, Hall delivers a precise fragile and lovable character. Jeremy Renner is deathly awesome with his street gang attitude. Most of the supporting Cast members deserve honorable mentions as well. Blake Lively as Doug's ex-girlfriend and single parent, I have never seen Lively blends into thiz kind of troubled character. Chris Cooper as Doug's behind-the-cell father, it takes only one scene but it's definitely memorable. And the last but not least for me, it's Pete Postlethwaite as Fergie the flower man who is the brain behind the crime. There is strange feeling by only hearing his intimidate and unique accent. In the end, we realize that the town could change people, and the people are just victims. It's harder to change the system than the person itself. But to change the system, it should start by changing the person as well. And thiz will be a never-ending circle. But finally, it's totally out of our control. But we can control something for sure, for me it's waiting for another Ben Afflecks's next project.

Even while I haven't been there myself, I can feel the weight of the town.<br/><br/>Predictable it may be, not really having a big story or anything quite great to say either, this thriller will entertain you.

"andy-933-696608","9","1","2","28 December 2010"," The Town movie review
","Its more invoking than ""Gone Baby Gone"", brining viewers back into the rough streets of Boston. Charleston has been classified as the bank robbing capital of the world, where the very act has been passed down like a cultural custom. Its streets are plagued by both poverty, drug use, and the desperation of the residents to survivce. Ben Affleck stars as Doug MacRay a man who's time in Charleston is about to come to an end. In an effort to further get out; his new outlook on the life he's been mostly living so far has given him the thoughts of making a change for himself, considering the damage his father Stephen (Cooper) brought him through his own crime spree of tradition. The film opens with a bank robbery, beautifully executed by Doug's crew, in both their timing and research of the guards and the bank itself. Out of a desperation to escape with no chance of getting pinched, the crew decide to take the bank manager Claire Keesey (Hall) for a little hostage joyride. Being both traumatized and riddled with anxiety, Claire finds peace with Doug as he follow up on her, just to tie up loose ends. At first it seemed like a routine process of keeping things balanced, turns into a relationship that further pushed Doug's hopes of leaving town. It may sound nice, being able to say goodbye to a place that did nothing but screw up most of your life, and leave you nothing but bad memories, whether it involved some coke snorting nights with your mule of girlfriend Krista (Lively), or out fighting on some hockey rink with the very teammates you played with. Basically Doug's life has been a living Hell, he only now wishes to escape after his longtime sobriety. It's too bad a thought like that doesn't sit too well with Doug's brother by heart Jem (Renner), a hot head with a temper beyond sanity or control. I'm serious you f with this dude, be ready. Doug's plans to escape the blackened memories of Charlestown go to Hell, for his desires to leave have not only attracted the attention of his bud Jem, or even vicious FBI agent Adam Frawley (Hamm). Fergie (Postlethwaite), a known florist in Charlestown, and furthermore a crime boss who's been the reason for several of Doug's own bank robberies. He may seem like a man regular small timers pay their respects to because he knew several of their father's, but his ability to manipulate anyone on sight for his own goal can be devastating. His resentment towards Doug's refusal to cooperate with him, forces his hand on his new girlfriend, feeling no regret for he's had no problem taking someone from Doug before. It all goes Fergie's way, thus pushing Doug to take the risk that could further push him to dying in a federal prison cell. In an attempt and somewhat success of robbing millions from Fenway Park, the crew barely makes it out with the very few chances of evasion, leaving old Dougie to be the only survivor. Our hero's story comes to end not with his demise, but with his escape to wherever he may be waiting, and waiting, hoping he'll see Claire again. It could be on this side or the other. When watching ""The Town"" viewers will be invoked by the very story of a tormented man looking to find a chance at better happiness. Ben Affleck's performance can be described a unique way of silent torment, seeking a much more enlightening path, while already taking the right steps. Renner, on the other hand is as astounding as his character, both crazy, and yet charismatic through his wild nature to take a shot or a stab at anything that pisses him off. Director Ben Affleck has once again proved his talent as a Director, that I honestly cannot feel any ounce of patience for whatever he might throw us next."

Being jealous of Clairre, Krista decided to rat Doug and her brother's bank heist to the FBI resulting in a lot of stylized gun fires and great driving scenes. The end is obvious but it has a sad element that Ben Affleck wants the viewers to feel.<br/><br/>Writing, acting, and directing the whole film, Affleck's got a lot on his table but still manages to pull off every single role. As a writer, along with two others, Affleck was able to collaborate his knowledge of the Boston language and the wit of actual screen writing. As a director, he was able to direct a great gun fire sequence and a stylish car driving scene. As an actor, Affleck's performance would place second behind Jeremy Renner's. The Oscar winner continues to boost up his already impressive career with The Town.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner isn't new to playing a cocky yet violent guy, but he especially stood out here with his badass attitude. Blake Lively's role was small but she gave it her all. You couldn't see her cuss in a Boston accent and have sex with Ben Affleck in Gossip Girl, could you? Well, there's the other reason to check it out.<br/><br/>While filled with much thrillers, the film also showed emotions. Helped by one of this year's best ensembled cast and stylish directing by Ben Affleck, The Town is an award-winning film.<br/><br/>OscarBuzz: Best Picture (good chance for a nod, not win), Best Screenplay (guarantee a nod, good chance for win), Best Supporting Actor (Jeremy Renner, good chance for a nod and win)"
"napierslogs","9","1","2","19 December 2010"," Thoughtful, character-driven crime drama thriller
","Take a crime-ridden community with gritty streets but with young men trying to get to a better life and the hopefulness of a possible romance, and you get ""The Town"", a thoughtful and discerning dramatic thriller.<br/><br/>Going beyond ""Gone Baby Gone"" (2008), Ben Affleck has created an extremely well done film. Yes, it's a crime thriller, but better than that, it has real characters who each have their own motives. Most of the advancements in the plot are done rather subtly, and they are also mostly character-driven. And that's the sign of a great crime thriller.<br/><br/>""The Town"" should be in the running for all the major awards of the season. Affleck, Rebecca Hall, and Jeremy Renner all portrayed interesting characters that had their own reasons for getting into and out of the town full of crime. ""The Town"" is one of the best crime dramas made, especially for those wanting to see more acumen, consideration and distinction in the genre."
"gradyharp","8","1","2","18 December 2010"," A Fine, Smart, Well Made Drama
","THE TOWN, the title refers to Charlestown, a section of Boston infamous for the crime and criminals who hail from that area, and Director, Actor, and Co-Writer (with Peter Craig and Aaron Stockard) Ben Affleck knows this area well as is evident in not only the accents of all of his characters but also in the choices of locations for this fast moving bank heist drama. Affleck knows how to bring out the best in his cast of superb actors - never forgetting that despite the crusty surfaces of his people their lies beneath a bruised psyche. <br/><br/>Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) leads a gang of bank robbers - James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Gloansy Magloan (Slaine), Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) - carrying off a series of successful heists dressed in costumes to conceal their identity, laundering their stolen money at the guidance of florist Fergie (Pete Postlethwaite) in a manner that eludes the police. During one of their heists they take a hostage, the bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) whom they release after the heist. Knowing that she may inform the FBI Doug decides to makes friends with her but instead of assuring his fellow gang that she will not be a problem Doug instead falls for her. The FBI - Frawley (Jon Hamm) and Dino (Titus Welliver) - remain hot on the gang's trail, attempting to get information from Doug's old girlfriend Krista (Blake Lively, in a breakout performance!). Doug is conflicted and thinks of leaving the gang so that he won't end up like his father (Chris Cooper) who is in jail, but James is the baddie here and demands the gang stay together for at least one last major heist. A schism arises between Doug and Claire and uncovers a deep scar from Doug's past. From that point on through the end of the film the story is filled with conflicts, chases, the gang's outwitting the FBI and Boston police, all with the gang's penchant for changing disguises frequently. The ending is full of surprises. <br/><br/>Though not a great movie, THE TOWN is far better a film than many that are gaining award nominations. One of the reasons is the tight ensemble work by this surprisingly fine cast who together give us a slice of Boston we'll not forget. Well worth watching. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

","I would give this a 10/10 had there been more scenes of the very talented Blake Lively,not only is she beautiful,but she really did perform her character really well.. So other than Blake,what else stood out,obviously the ""gem"" that is Jeremy Renner,and Mr Affleck,not just for his acting,but his direction in this movie is mesmerizing. I don't do many reviews here in IMDb,although I love reading reviews here, so this really does show that I appreciate this movie. <br/><br/>You might feel that you probably have seen movies like this,and you are probably right,it is not some brand new idea,it is a simple movie with simple plots done RIGHT,there's the thing that will differentiate this movie to others,it is done near perfection,the dialogs,actions,plot lines,everything just done right,I've always found heist movies fascinating,though most of them rarely brings the emotion The Town brings,so for this I will have to say it is among the top movies of 2010,probably only below Inception.<br/><br/>I hope Ben Affleck could receive another Oscar,preferrably one that is not shared,he really deserves one."
"bryandipiazza","7","1","2","20 September 2010"," Almost really good
","Ben Affleck's sophomore attempt at directing is solid. The characters are examined and expanded upon from beginning to end giving the audience a reason to care for the outcome, unlike many action movies these days. but wait, is it an action movie? This question is pondered the entire film. Is it a drama or an action film? Many times these can never both be true, at least successfully. Affleck, who focused on the pure authenticity of Boston in ""Gone, Baby, Gone"", seemed to have been confused by this same question. For the first hour and a half the film is shot as a realistic, no bull crap story, not to the same extent as ""GBG"" but still. Yet as we reach the climax it completely switches gears leaving the audience puzzled and unsure.It loses all the this-is-really-happening emotions and instead strives for this-is-pretty-cool.<br/><br/>If Affleck, who also co-wrote it, had stuck with the this-is-really-happening feel, and lost all the poorly aimed gun battles then it'd be an 8. But despite the acting quality, especially of Jeremy Renner, and the sheer beauty of the direction, it is lost in the ongoing battle of action vs. drama."

","Great movie, despite starring, and being directed by, Ben Affleck. Decent plot, gritty, character-based but with plenty of action. Gritty, though maybe a touch unoriginal and too trite, especially with regard to the romantic angle.<br/><br/>Excellent direction (that's the biggest surprise) - the car chases are gripping but not overdone, the action is frenetic but not gratuitous, characters have time to be sketched, and some of the scenes could be straight out of the Tarantino playbook.<br/><br/>Excellent performances, all round. Ben Affleck is solid in the lead role - and it takes a lot for me to say that. I am generally not a fan of his work. Rebecca Hall is also very good as the romantic interest.<br/><br/>Performance of the movie must go to Jon Hamm though, as the clever, tough, no-nonsense FBI agent.

Extremely realistic and the kind of approach that people take in real life.<br/><br/>Thrilling, keeps you on your toes throughout and is one of the best heist films. The best thing about it being that right through, till the very end, one gets the feeling that the guy will not be able to flee and would eventually get caught, but he doesn't. Throughout you deal with a fear, yet in the end it proves out to be nothing. A thing where it differentiate from a lot of heist films is, the guy/team were never shown to be any smart players, or masterminds of any kind. It was all so real and it just happened, you know.<br/><br/>Again, in short, a brilliant film!"

","This movie was the perfect criminal movie and with a soul! The entire cast gave amazing performances and I really liked the emotion in this classic.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck plays Doug MacRay, a professional Boston bank robber, where the movie takes place by the way, Jeremy Renner plays James Coughlin, Doug's ruthless criminal buddy, Rebecca Hall plays Claire Keesey, a bank manager who foolishly falls in love with Doug, and Blake Lively as Krista Coughlin, a young and beautiful slut with a 19 month old daughter. This movie was one of the best I've ever seen, with a wonderful performance by Ben Affleck, Rebecca Hall, AND Blake Lively! The soul part is the fact that Doug falls in love with a bank manager and will do anything to keep her safe. Their love is very strong until Claire finds out the truth about Doug. Blake Lively gave a surprisingly touching performance as the young beautiful woman trying to do right for her 1 and a half year old girl. This movie is the PERFECT film for most!<br/><br/>I loved this movie and I'm sure you will too if you watch it. Directed by Ben Affleck, it's a must-see movie with action and emotion!"
"joker-4","10","1","3","19 July 2012"," A great spotlight for Affleck's talents
","Let's admit to a solemn truth here: heist flicks are as formulaic as any other genre film. One grand heist leads to another, more often than not there is at least one car chase, the alpha male falls for a woman, said male decides to leave his life of crime, which leads to his final escape, be that successful or not. <br/><br/>Let's now subscribe to another truth, this one more recent: Ben Affleck has matured well beyond his Armageddon and PEARL HARBOR foibles both in front of and, perhaps even more importantly, behind the camera. THE TOWN, then, is beautiful example of the craft of the heist formula executed perfectly and proves that Affleck, his second outing as a director, is one helluva storyteller.<br/><br/>Based on the Chuck Hogan novel ""Prince Of Thieves"", THE TOWN follows a bank robbing troupe led by Affleck with Academy Award nominee Jeremy Renner along for the ride and overseen by the late, great Pete Postlethwaite all while being pursued by Jon Hamm's G-Man. Aside from the life-as-a-criminal angle, significant insight is given to Affleck and Renner's relationship, complete with daddy-issues – performed in a killer scene by Chris Cooper – and the budding romance with Rebecca Hall. The drama in these characters' lives proves to be just as strong and important as that of the robberies themselves. <br/><br/>And that grand heist? None other than the theft of ticket sales from Fenway Stadium and Affleck even films inside the holy internal works of the Green Monster. Affleck's direction throughout the film is meticulous and tight showing the audience his exact view on the story itself.<br/><br/>THE TOWN is an entertaining, well-executed movie and a great vehicle for spotlighting Affleck's talents. Also, it should be noted, this is the film that got Renner his recent super-hero and spy gigs and, more importantly, should have brought him an Oscar as well, the absence of which is the true crime here."
"alanjj","4","1","3","2 January 2012"," implausible caper/love story. female lead doesn't belong in this movie
","The Town was written & directed by Affleck, and it's pretty watchable, about a bunch of bank robbers from an area that produces the best bank robbers in the nation, Charlestown. Affleck is one of those robbers, but his cover that he works as some sort of quarry worker. In order to pull off a robbery, he has to temporarily kidnap a beautiful bank officer. Turns out, she lives in Charlestown, and he has to keep an eye on her to make sure she doesn't cooperate with the cops. Wouldn't you know, they fall in love, and she is so stupid that this sophisticated, elegant gal who could easily land a successful dot-com entrepreneur has no idea that this was the guy who kidnapped her, and that he is a bank robber rather than a quarryman. The movie ends with another robbery and a series of chase scenes, and it looks like Affleck gets away with something, and the girlfriend picks up a bunch of stolen money when she's digging in her garden. I was not really following it at that point. The woman, Rebecca Hall, does not in the least convey a naive Charlestown girl. It's a terrible bit of casting."

","Yesterday, I saw the South Korean crime film ""The Chaser."" I spent 2 hours staring pale-faced at the screen. After it ended, I stood up with my head in my hands, drew a ragged breath and stumbled out into the hallway.<br/><br/>""The Town"" won't have that effect on you. The standard Hollywood grammar signals you from behind every frame, so even as cars slam into each other and crates of bullets sink into brick and metal, none of the russle and tussle on screen catches you particularly off guard. The people you expect to live - live, the people you expect to die get offed in genre-appropriate ways. The character that was going to hang it all up gets pulled into ""one last job,"" the feds are tipped off by the person you expect to cave under questioning, and so on.<br/><br/>That being said, there's nothing wrong with a formula movie done well, and Affleck delivers. The movie is well-shot, well-written, well-directed and well-acted, with individual nods to everyone's new favorite trigger-finger Jeremy Renner, and Pete Postlethwaite, reduced in body, who makes up for the lost volume with concentrated Kobayashi malevolence. This was Postlethwaite's last film credit to see release before his death, and he plays it like Slayer's farewell concert.<br/><br/>Bostonites would be in a better position to comment on its authenticity, but the movie does give a good sense of location and flavor. Between ""Mystic River,"" ""The Departed"" and now this offering, Boston has been working up a somewhat gritty reputation in the movies, though Detroit and Baltimore are laughing and shaking their heads.<br/><br/>All told, this is a perfectly fine formula caper movie with an almost-authentic blue collar burnish. You could do worse on a snow day."
"recoltes","8","1","3","8 November 2010"," Heist movie has soul
","Ben Affleck was superb as Doug MacRay and as the director takes most of the plaudits for The Town, Jeremy Renner however as James Coughlin is a scene stealer with a coiled spring tension about him. Renner could double for Eminem and it's his energy and menace that keeps viewers on edge for much of this movie. Rebecca Hall as bank manager Claire Keesey does well though her youth and unbusiness-like nature make her unconvincing as a bank manager. The assistant bank manager some 30 years her senior would have made more sense as manager while Hall as his assistant would have been more believable. Later on when she quits her position it would again make more sense as her job would have been more disposable. Would have liked to have seen more of MacRay masterminding the heists as opposed to being told that he was the mastermind. Jon Hamm as FBI Agent Frawley is perhaps bringing too much Madmen to the table, more than Denis Leary did in a similar role he fairly nailed in The Thomas Crown Affair. Blake Lively as bank robber sister Krista Coughlin brings reality to every scene she features in. Gripping movie, the heists are nerve wracking, well balanced throughout with both action and emotional cost. The direction was seamless though maybe the ending with the cash going to an under surveillance ex-bank manager was less satisfactory than it might have been, charity donations included. Worth watching."
"bnwallace7","8","1","3","1 November 2010"," Worth the money
","I enjoyed this movie, one of the best I have seen at the actual cinema since Inception. The story line is simple and easy to follow, a quick read of the description on this site or have a look at the trailer is pretty much all you need to understand the plot. I was a little skeptical of a Ben Affleck directed film, although admittedly this was the first film I have seen which he has directed. I thought it was very well made, the dialogue was excellent and no scene played on to long. The acting was almost flawless, Ben Affleck, being from Boston was obviously a big factor in this. I think one of the most notable performances goes to Chris Cooper, Doug's (Ben Affleck) father. Only in one scene, he added to the tension brilliantly and gave the film an edge. All in all, good film, worth the money, honestly can't say anything bad about it, only thing I would have changed would be to have had the film end in the florist, but you will have to watch to see what I mean!"
"thepunisher181","9","1","3","30 October 2010"," Solid heist movie, not the ripoff it's being called
","Being a hard-core movie goer I'm not much of a reviewer, this is my first review and it's because I really felt I had to do it. There's a lot of people out there calling The Town a Heat ripoff, and being a fan of Michael Mann's Heat I completely disagree with this statement. First of all, both movies don't share the same lead characters (or the focus on one over other), while Heat deals mainly with Hanna and his personal family/job struggle (and I'm no going to detail the difference's between Hamm's and Pacino's characters, their depth, relevance and involvement on the development of the story is completely different) , The Town involves mainly MacRay's issues, there's no similarity whatsoever between MacRay and McCauley, not even on the concept they've got over the profession and don't get me started on their personality... Then we've got the Affleck/Hall phone scene, which is being compared with the Val Kilmer/Judd scene...absolutely ridiculous, the relationship between the characters isn't even the same (come on, Kilmer was married to Judd and they both had a son), and well, cops often go to the thieves family to check contact, I mean, they want to capture them after all, right? Oh and of course, the socioeconomic status of Affleck is deeply involved with the background topic of the movie, a topic that has no relevance on Heat...I could go on all day. The only point I can agree with is that the dynamic is similar, but being both heists movies and recognizing the ""Golden age of originality"" that surrounds Hollywood these days (sarcasm here), It is almost valid to say that it's just the concept what was taken from Mann's masterpiece, I mean, being clear it's not a ripoff at all, I dare you to call it a remake, if you do it you should get a doctor man.<br/><br/>All in all The Town is a 20th century heist movie that stands on it's own, somewhere between Heat and Reservoir Dogs, it's a solid thriller that manages to create a solid suspenseful atmosphere from the very beginning, an achievement Affleck can be proud of, it is a memorable movie, it is a FRESH heist movie, and you guys should evaluate all the aspects of a movie before calling it a ripoff, it's two different movies you're comparing.<br/><br/>8/10"
"ihrtfilms","8","1","3","26 October 2010"," terrific second film
","This is a really terrific thriller that backs up Ben Affleck's career as a director after his first film Gone Baby Gone. It wastes no time in setting up the premise of a gang of 'serial' bank robbers and the volatile state they find themselves in. Of course a hostage is taken which leads to some very clever plot devices, including a spot of romance and hidden truths.<br/><br/>The film looks great and never gets too bogged down in the harshness of 'The Projects' or the reasoning behind the bank robbers. The robberies themselves are executed brilliantly and are full of tension as is a scene where Afflecks character and Clare have coffee only to be interrupted by another of the robbers who of course is mates with Affleck's character Doug. Clare is of course unawre of the fact that she is dating her captor and the friend is the one she saw the tattoo one. It's so well played out, I think I was gripping my arm a little too tightly. The whole cast are excellent in this and there are great turns from Jon Hamm and Jeremy Renner.<br/><br/>The ending is perhaps a little expected, but right up until then it moves along seamlessly. Affleck does well handling the scenes where tension is needed, car chases through narrow streets are remarkable. There are also a couple of nice moments: when the robbers park the car only to notice as they jump out a cop car right opposite and also when Doug calls Clare at the end and asks if he can meet her and we see him watching her across the street as she lies that she is alone but is surrounded by FBI.<br/><br/>Affleck himself also shines in this, not only has he never looked better, but he actually acts well in this. You can almost forgive him for Gigli. Almost.<br/><br/>More of my reviews at iheartfilms.webly.com"
"starlit-sky","8","1","3","25 October 2010"," The Town is a successful crime thriller
","The Town is a crime thriller about a team of bank robbers in Boston area. The story centers around 3 main characters, Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) and James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner). Doug and James are professional bank robbers but they are opposite characters. Doug, even though a criminal, is portrayed as a likable, charming character. We see more of his positive qualities: he refrains from harming other people. Doug, on the other hand, is a truly corrupt character who enjoys hurting other people.<br/><br/>A lot of people point out the similarities between The Town and Heat and claim The Town is an imitation of Heat. Although there are some similarities I think this is inevitable since both movies are about a team of bank robbers and there will be bank robbery, shoot-out and car chase scenes and a romantic love affair always adds a flavor to stories. I actually liked The Town better than Heat. I thought Heat was too long; the story was drawn-out needlessly which ruined its pace and took away from the action. The Town, on the other hand, focuses more on the action. I also think action scenes in The Town are better and more suspenseful.<br/><br/>If you like crime thrillers, you should definitely check this one out. You will find The Town is a decent, well-directed, entertaining movie."

"mrdedwalker","8","1","3","21 October 2010"," A gritty American film for international, mature people
","I had been waiting for a movie that would gave me the same feeling of the good old ""US of A"" that the original ""Taking of Pelham 123"" did back in the seventies, and when I saw the shorts for this film, I was pretty sure that this was it. . . I wasn't disappointed. There are so many movies that bore the older person (50ish) who actually watches a lot of movies these days, from Hollywood (or the USA). E.g. the 2009 version of ""taking of Pelham 123""; I just couldn't stomach going to see it. It would make me feel sick to see such an original film; so gritty American - no pretense to know the rest of the world, redone in ""Hollywood"". Without telling you any spoiler, or anything that adds to what is already known from the short or the synopsis; this film, while I rate it 8/10 (the averaged estimate is perfect), I would for instance rate a new Harry Potter film, or Avatar at about 6 or maybe 7 /10. So this gives you some idea of how 'suited to the mature, international person' (I'm Australian), that wants to see a well made, unpretentious American film, likes this type of film. The Boston accent is so good an Australian actually can't walk away not speaking partly in Boston accent. The scenes and filmography are cleverly done so as to also be unpretentious - just raw Boston (I imagine). The story is smart enough to leave plenty of questionings at the end, while still creating its own clichés that help the watcher understand themes, feelings, and results. All actors performed well. Mature people are able to ignore bad past media (press), and know when they are seeing good actors, and all were excellently cast, and did their jobs incredibly believably in this film. Remmer was great as the 2nd 'lead' - Hamm fantastic as the hard cop with conscience, Hall also great as a wholesome bank clerk. I just could not take my eyes off her lips - the shape of her lips and the accent (she as others) had, were engrossing. Affleck - totally believable in his part and his making of this film shows great depth and maturity of understanding the movie business. He's not lightweight in his films, like so many coming out of USA these days. If you are a mature person, with intelligence, who knows the world a bit, and can take USA as it is, you will *certainly* enjoy this film."

","Younger viewers may not remember this but back in the mid to late nineties Ben Affleck was actually considered pretty cool. Between starring in Kevin Smith's ""Chasing Amy"" & ""Dogma"", he won an Oscar for co-writing ""Good Will Hunting"" and hit the big time in Michael Bay's ""Armageddon"". However, as the saying goes, what goes up must come down. Following repeated embarrassments like ""Reindeer Games"", ""Pearl Harbor"", ""Daredevil"" and especially ""Gigli"", Affleck's cred just about vanished. In recent years, though, Affleck has slowly picked himself back up and even branched out into directing with 2007's well-received ""Gone, Baby, Gone"". Now comes ""The Town"", which sees Affleck handling acting, directing and co-writing duties.<br/><br/>The story takes place in the Charlestown neighbourhood of Boston and has certain similarities to Michael Mann's ""Heat"". Here, a group of skilled bank robbers find that their latest heist has become complicated because the woman that they took hostage lives in the same neighbourhood and could possibly identify them. When the leader of the group (Affleck) approaches the woman in an attempt to keep the situation under control he begins to have feelings for her. For the remainder of the film, the group continues to carry out ever more daring jobs as the authorities close in on them.<br/><br/>Despite similarities to ""Heat"", the film stands on it's own due to the novel relationship between robber & hostage. The robberies themselves are well-staged and serve to propel the action of the film. Helping to bring the script to life is a well-stocked cast. Affleck gives his best performance in years but he's upstaged by Jeremy Renner. Rebecca Hall is also a standout while Jon Hamm, Blake Lively, Pete Postlethwaite & Chris Cooper all lend quality support.<br/><br/>Affleck's direction is well done, too, and I'd say it shows a bit of improvement over ""Gone, Baby, Gone"". The soundtrack & score didn't stick in my memory but they were serviceable at the very least.<br/><br/>In the end, ""The Town"" is a captivating crime drama that nicely balances action and emotion. As critics proclaim that Affleck has re-discovered his muse I can only hope that we see more like this from him."
"wildgunslinger","8","1","3","17 September 2010"," Heat like
","Ben Affleck is already a good director. Since ""Gone baby gone"", he made his place as a director. ""The town"" is a really good action movie, breathless, exciting. Affleck made a good choice with the casting: the amazing Jeremy Renner, himself for the essential. Affleck already knows how to direct a movie, he has got a really good talent for that. No doubt. The problem with ""The town"" is the screenplay: it looks like ""Heat"". A lot of events and twists are the same, but no spoiler here. Affleck is not as good as De Niro, and Jon Hamm not Al Pacino at all. So the comparison is not good for ""The town"", which seems like a little ""Heat"". The bad guys are more developed than the good ones, and that indicates the limits of the movie.<br/><br/>If we forgot this big default with the screenplay, this movies keeps good things: nice directing, rhythm, and empathy for the characters (the bad ones only)."
"eneyeseekaywhy","7","1","3","19 September 2010"," Affleck belongs BEHIND the camera
","Ben Afflecks decade long fall from grace was almost a thing of beauty. In 1997 having written and starred in the smash hit Good Will Hunting Affleck, along with co-writer and co-star Matt Damon, was seen as one of Hollywoods great new hopes. But the curse of having ""next big thing"" preface his name in almost every interview for a year struck Affleck pretty badly. Matt Damon chose some great roles to further his career and has given us some excellent performances. If you don't agree with me, watch the criminally overlooked The Informant!, Damon's portrayal of idiot Mark Whitacre is on a par with William H. Macy in Fargo.<br/><br/>Ben, on the other hand, went on to act in some truly awful films, hitting his lowest point in what is arguably one of the worst films of this decade, Gigli. At that stage it seemed all the votes were in and counted; Ben Affleck just could not act. A somewhat solid performance in Hollywoodland did little to change peoples minds about his acting ability. Then in 2007 he stepped behind the camera for Gone Baby Gone, and his younger brother Casey showed us who had the real acting skills in the Affleck household. However it was the surprisingly good direction of Gone Baby Gone which caught a lot of peoples attention. Surely the man who played a plank in Pearl Harbour could not be such a competent Director?<br/><br/>The Town, like Affleck's directorial debut, is an adaptation of a novel. The story centres around Afflecks character Doug MacRay and his criminal friends living in the blue-collar neighbourhood of Charlestown, Boston. Together they form a team of bank robbers with a 100% success rate so far. MacRay knows that his luck may not last so decides to do one last big take before leaving Boston forever. His friends and family seem to take this as an insult and do everything in their power to make him stay. During his next heist he takes bank manager Claire hostage but eventually allows her to go free unharmed. A chance meeting in a launderette re-introduces the two, although obviously she doesn't recognise him. The two begin a relationship and against his better judgement he begins to fall for her. In the meantime his friends and family begin to resent the new MacRay and plot to bring the criminal out in him again.<br/><br/>Comparisons to The Departed are plenty and justified. The three bank heist scenes also echo the gripping action of Michael Mann's Heat. Whilst the one-last-job storyline is somewhat hackneyed, it is the direction and acting which make The Town a must watch. Like The Departed the cating of the supporting roles is close to perfect. Jeremy Renner does a fantastic job playing MacRay's unhinged best friend, James. However the character is a little close to William James in The Hurt Locker and once again shows that Renner needs a more challenging role to really show us what he is capable of. Pete Postlethwaite and Chris Cooper, as expected, give stellar performances and, in the scenes they have with Affleck, expose just how little on-screen presence the man really has. Whilst The Town will hardly make us reassess our opinion of Ben Affleck's acting abilities, it does show us that when he steps behind the camera, he's a man to watch."

Nothing diminishes or excuses their violent behavior. I guess I shouldn't be surprised that this is a Ben Affleck film."

","The Ben Affleck saga is well chronicled in these reviews. Pretty boy hunk, to blockbuster star, to paparazzi darling, to yearly ""razzie"" nominee. I'm not sure the ""razzies"" were warranted, by his movie choices got decidedly weaker as his star was falling. Eventually he took some strong supporting roles to get back on track and now has grabbed the director reins with both hands.<br/><br/>""The Town"" is placed in and about my loved Boston. ""Ahh, ahh, Boston you're my home"". By choosing Charlestown (now a yuppier ""Chuckville"") as its base, the North End for a car chase and the bowels of old (1912) Fenway for the climactic ""last job"", he is at home in his surrounding. Anyone who has walked thru the North End, stopped for a ""slice"" and checked out the streets knows that's the last place you'd ever expect a high speed car chase. Ben's camera work and editing makes it a thrilling, crash filled event. Pity the poor stunt drivers who has to careen around those corners!<br/><br/>So, lots of reviews tell the plot points. I'm just writing to voice my opinion on the entertainment value and that is very high. Though its over two hours, it never drags. Ben gives each of his excellent cast a very strong scene or two. Chris Cooper gets 5 minutes of screen time and is excellent. Rebecca Hall, the prettiest average looking person you'll see, is terrific. Jeremy Renner is calm and explosive, at the same time. Jon Hamm gets to look cool, be cool and stay cool. He is a different FBI than we are used to. Smart, but with a meaner edge. And, for me, last but not least, Blake Lively. I hear she's a glamor girl on TV and red carpets, but here she absorbs the role of broken, damaged and desperate, with a glob of mascara in each eye. One review I read said ""she's no Amy Ryan"" (see:""Gone Baby Gone""). Maybe not, but that's pretty unfair and she is well up to the task here.<br/><br/>So, action, anti-heroes to ""root"" for and Fenway Park (a diamond on the outside, pretty scruffy underneath)!! What's not to like? But I've got to nit-pick one thing. Does everyone in the world have a 3 day beard??? FBI guys go to the office unshaven for days? Ben even has some uneven moments where he goes from 2 to 1 to 3 day beards in the same caper! Hey, what can you do, its not one big long shoot, but it was a lot of stubble!"

","In The Town Ben Affleck got to do another big screen tribute to his home town of Boston and even better got to shoot a good deal of this film at his beloved Fenway Park. Directing, writing, and starring in The Town who could ask for more except to shoot the film in places that I'm sure meant a good deal to him personally.<br/><br/>But The Town isn't some hazy nostalgic type movie, not by any means. It's a hard hitting crime drama about the lives of a heist crew and what it took for the FBI to bring them down.<br/><br/>The Town is brutally realistic in its depiction of these robbers who grew up in the tough neighborhood of Charlestown where people enter the trade of thievery from generation to generation. Ben Affleck is such a person whose father Chris Cooper is currently doing a life sentence for a robbery that was planned by neighborhood crime boss Pete Postlethewaite from his florist shop. Pete's character must have been steeped in crime lore and took as his model that other noted florist of Irish descent who also ran a crime organization, Dion O'Bannion.<br/><br/>At their latest robbery where the crew is completely masked, a hostage they took and released after safely getting away was seen talking to the FBI in the person of agent Jon Hamm who has made it his life's crusade to take this bunch down. They took her driver's license and note that Rebecca Hall is from The Town. Just to make sure she isn't telling anything that could lead to their arrest, Affleck arranges an accidental meeting with Hall. Even though he's already involved with Blake Lively sister of friend Jeremy Renner and fellow crew member, Affleck and Hall start getting involved to the surprise of Affleck.<br/><br/>The Town as elements of classic films like White Heat and The Asphalt Jungle and what I like about it is like The Asphalt Jungle, director Affleck got some well rounded, three dimensional portraits of his characters without sacrificing either suspense or action. Jeremy Renner who is up for Best Supporting Actor is great as the best friend and fellow crew member who is determined not to go back to prison for life as he's already a two time loser. Postlethwaite is as lethal as Dion O'Bannion was and in his own scene with Affleck visiting him in prison Chris Cooper is unforgettable. Cooper is one of the best actors we have currently, I've never seen him bad in anything he does and The Town is no exception.<br/><br/>The climax involved the gang pulling a heist on that noted Boston shrine Fenway Park. That's almost sacrilege in Boston, but this is one nervy crew of professionals. And the FBI is not stupid either. The climax should satisfy any action fan.<br/><br/>I really recommend seeing The Town which is a film that succeeds on numerous levels and can be enjoyed by all kinds of film fans with all kinds of taste."
"steve_koenig","5","1","4","23 January 2011"," Technically well-done but not terribly original
","A technically well-done, but largely unoriginal, and overlong, film. Most of it was still enjoyable-- at times it even seemed like Affleck was content not to make his character the most prominent or even most likable character-- but towards the end the story became less credible. Afflect seemed to remember he was the star and the director. The ending, which was reportedly a substantial change from that of the novel on which the film was based, seemed a cop-out (no pun intended). I also learned that even if a character sprays automatic weapon fire indiscriminately, if the camera doesn't expressly show his bullets hitting someone, and they express some remorse, the person can still claim he never killed anyone, and he can be seen, all in all, as a good guy. The Irish-American accents seemed overdone to me, but I did read that much work was done to ensure that the accents in the film were authentic."

","This is one of the better heist films of recent years. The cast is strong and look of the film is gritty and realistic. The weakness is the romantic subplot between the team leader (Ben Affleck) and a hostage (Rebecca Hall). Their entire relationship was implausible and they shared little on screen chemistry. Since the ""Townies"" are depicted as working-class people sharing intense loyalties and clannish devotion to their Irish code of honor, I would have preferred to spend more time with Affleck and his team, particularly his loose cannon best friend, Jem(Jeremy Renner) and Jem's druggie sister. Their relationships and significant history (Jem's family cared for Affleck's character when he was young and he was romantically involved with Jem's sister) were more interesting to me than anything that occurred between Affleck and Hall. The heist build-up and action were terrific, but since so much emphasis is placed on the romantic storyline, the film isn't as good as it should be. A solid effort with a terrific cast."

An average movie, with average acting, the cool environment of Charlestowns tougher areas and loads of bank robbing clichés. It's the: ""The crew teams up for one last big heist"" kind of story. And some love problems between the heists. Jeremy Renner is the one that really stands out, and I thought his performance was really good. There is also a very cool and realistic looking car chase during the gangs second heist. Ben Affleck does his thing, and plays the kindhearted macho guy, who just wants to leave everything and start over with his girlfriend. Blake Lively is probably playing herself...

"cesarbau","10","1","4","24 October 2010"," A subtle homage to ""Casablanca,"" with a twist
","In this thriller, Doug MacRay of Charlestown, a blue-collar enclave in Boston notorious for producing more bank robbers than any other town in the U.S., knows precisely what the law says. The sentences for threatening a state witness, and for bank robbery resulting in murder, he knows them all by heart. He should: his own father had committed such crimes and is serving five life terms. <br/><br/>Doug (Ben Affleck) is the planning genius and leader of a band for four robbers working for a syndicate boss who runs a flower shop for cover. Doug confesses to his new girlfriend Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) that he has never killed anyone. His latest dossier consists of two bank heists, and a raid on the sanctuary of ""the cathedral of Boston"" -- the money vault of the Red Sox's Fenway Park – that resulted in the fatal face-smashing of a bank officer, the death of a security guard and the serious wounding of another. <br/><br/>To get an idea of what possible jail term he faces in case of conviction, I asked lawyer John Kriss of Kansas. He categorizes Doug's crime as a felony murder. His committing a felony (theft) ""was directly responsible for the murder and injury."" Since Massachusetts's law does not sanction the death penalty, ""Doug could be on the hook for two life sentences plus others for the battery, for the robbery and all,"" says Kriss. <br/><br/>Consequences. ""The Town"" is about the consequences of crime and what happens when love enters the picture. Doug's romantic fling defies Irish ""omerta,"" the Mafia code of silence, putting him and his men in trouble as the feds, led by FBI agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm), close in. <br/><br/>Affleck directs with great intelligence and tackles the role of a criminal on the verge of conversion with muted passion. He manages to be convincing in a tricky monologue where he describes to Claire that day when his mother disappeared forever. His spiel sounds genteel, not the expected working-class chatter, a far cry from his altercation with his second-in-command and adopted brother Jem (Jeremy Renner), where they fire a barrage of four-letter words. <br/><br/>There is scarcely a moment when ""The Town"" does not throb with action, crackles with crisp dialogue or simmer with conflict. The bank heists and the car chase through the narrow streets of old Boston are shrewdly paced, the goons and police dueling intensely, the sound suddenly turning mute and the action frozen, only to ricochet to their bitter end. <br/><br/>Claire, taken hostage in the opening heist, is pivotal since her traumatic experience stokes Doug's feelings, and the interest of FBI agents too. The heavy burden to be likable and believable falls on Hall's lap. She excels in the first task and falters in the other, and she's not to blame. It doesn't help that there is a fuzzy edge to her character as scripted. She plays Claire with a passivity and resignation that's out of sync with her job description as bank manager, as though she had climbed the corporate ladder without some feistiness.<br/><br/>Hall's wardrobe, dark and nondescript, does not serve her well either, oblivious to her being the neighborhood ""toonie,"" the yuppie outsider. For the heists, the costume department had found the right Jason helmets and get-up of Mother Superiors from hell, so why didn't they shop for the smart, say, Gap or Guess casuals for her? The cut-to-cut close-ups that are Affleck's preferred vehicle for dialogue – oh, those talking heads -- also work against her at times as her unease in finding the right tone and emotion is betrayed on the screen. But this much must be said: Hall is electrifying and heartbreaking when she needs to be.<br/><br/>Renner's gives Jem's character perfect shading, menacing at times and sometimes explosive. Jem is the loose-cannon type who's quick to smash a face with a rifle butt in a moment of panic or, stupidly, to bare his masked face during a brutal beating of a Charlestown bully. The zeal that FBI investigator Frawley brings to his job is frightening, but brusque and suave Hamm is more than equal to the task, badgering, cajoling and intimidating potential witnesses to spill the goods on the suspects. His interviews with Claire, Doug and Jem's sister Krista are free lessons in A Dozen Ways to Manipulate People. <br/><br/>As the mob grandfather Fergie the florist, Pete Postlethwaite has the sharpest lines, pornographic in their cruelty, which he delivers with the lilt and rhythm of Irish poetry. Blake Lively plays soaked-in-dope Krista, who is also Doug's part-time lover, slutting, slurring and whimpering her way through the narcotic haze, and revealing herself in the clearest terms as an actress to watch. <br/><br/>So finally, ""The Town"" boils down to consequences. They come fast and furious, and blood flows. For the final scenes, Affleck finds in the ending of the classic film ""Casablanca"" a paradigm, or at the very least an inspiration. ""The Town"" is of course cut from an entirely different mold, from the premise to the atmosphere -- although Affleck tends to bathe Boston in blue and dark tones, recalling ""Casablanca's"" shadows and grays. And while ""Casablanca"" is a psychologically complex film that has kept cinema lovers busy dissecting it for decades, ""The Town"" is more gritty and clear-cut; there are no mystifying issues about it. <br/><br/>But the choices the characters of either film face toward the end do mirror each other and are equally touching: which is it, love or society? A crucial decision taken in ""The Town"" manages to leave a bittersweet taste that comes close to ""Casablanca's."" This is more than a nod to the classic; it's a subtle homage with a twist. And what about the consequences of the thugs' crimes against the people of Boston? Well, truth be told, on a day like many summer days in Charlestown, they don't really matter."

","The Town"" is directed, written and starred in by Ben Affleck. I do not particularly like Ben Affleck. I did not really think I would watch this film. However, when I found out that Jeremy Renner was in it, and with its positive word of mouth, I thought why not check it out.<br/><br/>""The Town"" is a crime drama set in the Charlestown area of Boston. The story though is not about the crimes per se, but about Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), the leader of this group of bank robbers. MacRay is tired of the life of crime he is in and wants to get out, but circumstances would not allow him to. When he develops an intimate relationship with Claire (Rebecca Hall), a bank manager of a bank they robbed, he gains further resolve to really get out of it all.<br/><br/>While Ben Affleck is still generally dull as the lead actor, he gets his cast to perform very well. Jeremy Renner, excellent as the loose cannon gang member Jem, commands the screen whenever he is in it. Even Gossip Girl Blake Lively unexpectedly turns in a gritty realistic performance as Jem's white trash sister.<br/><br/>The action sequences were topnotch. From the first bank robbery scene, then the breathtaking car chase following the second armored car hijack, to the final grand heist in old Fenway Park itself, all of these scenes were executed expertly with excitement and suspense. The best scene overall though was a quiet one, when Jem walks in on Doug and Claire having lunch is a masterpiece of tension. You can really sense the danger as Jem talks to Claire while Doug squirms in his seat.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck does better as director than actor in this. He gets the various elements of the film to cohere into a crisp and exciting final product. I did feel though that certain parts went a bit too long. Oscar nominations are already being predicted for this movie, but I think it is still too early to tell. However, Jeremy Renner seem to be a shoo-in for Best Supporting Actor, at least as nominee. He personified that the tension essential to make this film work."

","The Town, has an uncanny ability to make crime seem very cool. Whether it's dousing a bank with bleach after a hectic robbery, bashing in a bank manager's face with an AK-47 then whispering him something sly, or seamlessly switching getaway cars after tearing through the crammed North End of Boston at breakneck speeds. The Town, or maybe rather it's director, Ben Affleck, is masterful at depicting the brazen activities of the underworld, seen through the eyes of a couple of Charlestown-bred criminal ""brothers"". <br/><br/>The film stars Ben Affleck, Jeremy Renner, Jon Hamm, Rebecca Hall, and Blake Lively. It's a story about a couple of bank robbers who during a heist are forced to take a hostage, who they later find lives a few blocks from them in the small neighborhood of Boston, known as Charlestown. Charlestown is credited as being the bank robbery capital of the world (Which for some reason to me, doesn't seem possible). But, nevertheless this is an intriguing claim and adequately aids to the pacing of the very fast-paced opening of the film. <br/><br/>Affleck and Renner are the main characters, with Hamm, of ""Mad Men"" fame playing the role of the FBI agent charged with the task of catching these criminals. Hall plays the role of, Claire Keesey, the bank manager who is taken hostage. The movie is cast very well, with supporting roles having a very authentic feel to them. Affleck shows his directing prowess by crafting a 2 hour long crime thriller that will show audiences across the country a side of Boston they probably didn't know existed. He blends frenetic paced gunfights with Fenway Park as the backdrop with much softer dialogue heavy scenes between Renner, Liively, Hall, and himself. <br/><br/>The Town is one of the best movies of the early fall season, with some drawing comparisons of it to ""The Departed"". I'm not sure it will have the legs to carry it into awards season, but I wouldn't be surprised to see Renner get an Oscar nomination for his supporting role."

Big Ben has proved one more time that he can pass for a legitimate movie director with another triumphant directorial effort in his sophomoric try behind the lens. His directorial debut was the very good ""Gone Baby Gone"". The narrative of ""The Town"" resides in the blue-collar town of Charlestown; a suburb of Boston where bank robberies are of Boston Common. Affleck stars as Doug Macray, the bank robber leader of a gang of four thieves who habitually steal away in the heart of Charlestown; and you can take that to the bank! Jeremy Renner co-stars as Macray's right-hand hot-tempered robbery man James Coughlin, who will take prisoners and do whatever it takes for his victims to cough up the cashola. Jon Hamm is sandwiched here as FBI Special Agent Adam Frawley, a mad man whose relentless pursuit of Macray and Co. takes center stage several times in ""The Town"". Rebecca Hall is the hall female monitor (whatever that means) in this one portraying Claire Keesey, a bank hostage victim of Macray who falls in love with him; being unaware that it was a Bad Doug that held her hostage during a bank heist. Pete Postlethwaite is Fergie Colm, a malicious Charlestown criminal kingpin who ""not Colmy"" barks the orders to Macray and his crew for their bank robbery gigs. In other words, I have a feeling its not going to be a good night when this Fergie is around. Yep, the gossip is true, Blake Lively co-stars as Krista Coughlin, Dougie's sleazy ex-girlfriend who is also James' sister. But in reality, the main character of ""The Town"" is Boston. Affleck is uplifted by the profound love of his hometown and Bentown, I mean Beantown, becomes the centerpiece to the revolving narrative of the movie. Affleck's directorial skills in ""The Town"" are potent, enthralling, and unpretentious. He is deserving of a Best Director Academy Award nomination for painting ""The Town"" red with some stirring action-packed sequences, and undoubtedly for the story's character interplay. Credit also goes to Ben and co-writer Peter Craig for scripting ""The Town"" with its words. All the aforementioned performances are worthy of Oscar nominations. But I was primarily taken back by Lively's lively emotional punch as Krista, Renner's stellar work as brother James, and Pistol Pete Postlethwaite himself for his brawny performance as the despicable Fergie (that's a first, ""despicable"" and ""Fergie"" in the same sentence). I was also down with The Town's musical score, art direction, and most of all for Robert Elswit's astounding cinematography; the witty Elswit should garner a Best Cinematography Academy Award nomination come Oscar time. So I think it's about time you hit the town and cinematically reside in ""The Town"" for a couple of hours, Big Ben will make sure its worth your time! ***** Excellent"
"OdasCoo","9","1","5","3 October 2010"," The Town - F***ing Awesome
","Blake Lively did awesome, expanding her acting range and ability to take more serious roles. Jeremy Renner nailed his performance and makes the viewer completely buy his whole edgy unpredictable personality. Pete Postlewaite's performance adds some class and depth to the story. The action scenes are amazing, especially the big car chase scene. Overall a satisfying rise, climax, and gradual close of movie that was well paced and well directed by Ben Affleck. This movie has convinced me that he truly has skills with directing and just working on films in general. <br/><br/>Do not underestimate this film, there is true art hidden under all the box office buzz."
"olulu2005","10","1","5","3 October 2010"," Utterly Brilliant
","While I enjoyed the creativity of 'Gone Baby Gone', I just felt that the movie was dragged, especially towards the end. With 'The Town', Ben Affleck highlights his superb directing skills in this riveting movie. He also did quite a good job in the lead role but Jeremy Renner was the star of the movie in my books. Jon Hamm did a quite believable job as the FBI dude and its good to see him take up roles that require more scenes as opposed to his previous movies. The entire cast was superb and I think Affleck did his homework well. The movie goes in-depth, making you actually feel that you are part of this experience; you feel what these characters feel and you ultimately empathize with them. The ending was awesome but I feel like I have seen it somewhere before. I really hope this garners Oscar recognition as it really is one of the best movies I have seen this year."
"daryl42-1","9","1","5","2 October 2010"," The Town is definitely worth visiting.
","8.7<br/><br/>Does social and economic inequity affect crime rates? It probably does. The question is, why do these men and women stay involved in this lifestyle? When your loved ones are at risk, even if they are at risk simply because you are in danger of being imprisoned, why do you continue? Is it because a regular job just isn't enough? Is it because we all, secretly inside, want to be rich celebrities? You only get one life in this world, so why waste it in poverty? That's better than wasting it in prison, but is the risk worth it?<br/><br/>The Town is your typical crime flick. It's got a romantic anchor, and the ending isn't the most original ending I've seen in this genre. But as traditional as it might be, and for everything that it sets out to do, it does it right. It's not the best of its kind, but it's certainly one of the better films of its kind. The movie manages to keep you interested right from the get-go, all the way to the credits.<br/><br/>The movie has a great atmosphere, and most of this is due to the performances, more than anything else. I've never been in Boston, but now I felt like I have. I'm not even sure if some of these actors have ever lived in Boston, either. Their performance allows you to level with them, even though they are criminals. This is the type of movie where you are subconsciously (or even consciously) rooting for the bad guys. The movie rarely relies on Charlestown's scenery, and goes for its denizens to paint a picture of the old settlement.<br/><br/>The Town is a great movie, but doesn't really bring anything new to the table. Not that it has to, by the way. It's a movie that casual movie goers will enjoy, especially with its traditional ending. However, it's ability to capture your attention (and emotions) from the intro of the film all the way to the end deserves to be acknowledged. It has pretty good dialogue between the characters, but it's the bold performances that will stand out. The Town is definitely worth visiting."
"dancer-91","8","1","5","29 September 2010"," As good as Gone, Baby, Gone
","Let me say, I was excited for this movie but I doubted I'd like it. I did. And I don't like movie that have robberies in them, they're mostly boring.<br/><br/>This movie is not supposed to be good. It's directed by and stars Ben Affleck and it has TV stars and a guy that almost won an Oscar. But The Town is a good movie. who would have thought...<br/><br/>The actors do a fine job. Really fine. Ben Affleck is good, he's never been better on screen. Blake Lively surprises as Krista, the single mother / drug addict, Jon Hamm does his best with a character that should have had more screen time but the real star is Jeremy Renner. Renner has always been good, he has an unbelievable presence on screen and he manages to bring humanity in his character Jem. The scene in the graveyard with Affleck is filled with electricity, both Affleck and Renner are just that good in that scene.<br/><br/>I can't say that there aren't any bad things. It felt a little clichéd from time to time and I would have done something different for the ending and there are some scenes that I would have shot differently, I would have also given more screen time and more character to Lively's Krista and Jon Hamm's FBI agent. These were fine characters but they felt thin because you didn't feel the real effect they had on things.<br/><br/>But there are scenes that I bow to. The car chase, you know what I mean, was really good. I was out of breath after it. And the flashbacks where we see when Rebecca Hall's Claire is blindfolded and walking on the beach - like a breath of fresh air. The shots of Boston are heavy and those scenes are fresh and beautiful.<br/><br/>I won't say anything about the plot, go and see it, it's worth it. Seriously."
"hartleydani","10","1","5","24 September 2010"," 'see you again...on this side or the other' - Superb film!
","Just got back from seeing this film today and got to say it is one of the best films I have seen in along time. It had everything, heist, action, police chases, sex, romance! From the very start you are gripped and you know you are going to be in for an edge of your seat type film and it doesn't disappoint. There are no lows and you are kept interested all the way through.<br/><br/>The relationship between affleck and the bank manager is very real and you are watching through your hands hoping that he gets away so they can someday be together.<br/><br/>The actors are all very talented as is the writing and the directorial side of it from Ben Affleck.<br/><br/>Well worth seeing and I would actually go see it again I loved it that much, which I never normally say after I've been to the cinema to see a film."
"nickwalker746","7","1","5","23 September 2010"," Not ""Gone Baby Gone"".
","I went into this movie with very high expectations and sadly they were not met. The movie was surely thrilling, entertaining, and even comedic at times, but Affleck advertised and picked the wrong details to accent throughout the movie. In commercials they portrayed Claire to be psychological torn because of the incident, which would have made a fantastic story to run with after the two of them got together. Or at least, that is how commercials portrayed, this is what I was hoping. Something deeper, something more than just the thrill of an action movie, something like Gone Baby Gone, which is Affleck's most recent notable work, in my opinion. But there was none, The Town was a simple bank robbery thriller with a shallow, not nearly elaborated enough love story and an empty psychological thriller pathway. If you want to see something suspenseful and entertaining, sure, go see The Town. If you were looking something for a little bit more than that, may want to wait for something else."
"melinda2001","8","1","5","19 September 2010"," Surprisingly good
","And not for the reasons most people talk about. I was very skeptical given the plot which made it sound like just another tired heist movie with the lovable hood trying to get out of the game only to get pulled in for one more big job (yawn!). Sure, all those elements were there along with all the shooting and chasing you'd expect. Good cast, acting, directing, aerial shots, special effects; the works. But the one really unexpected thing that really made it for me was the great dialog. Lots of really sensitive touches that really sell the story. I'm not such an action junkie but I'll take more of this stuff any day.<br/><br/>Oh, BTW, watch for Jon Hamm as the main FBI guy. He's been in some nice little fun movies but I never really noticed him before now. He's really quite fun to watch and I'll be hoping to see him get more big parts like this one. Nicely done all around."
"tbl9803","10","1","5","19 September 2010"," Felt it, no need to rate or vote on it!
","Say what you want about Affleck, he creates great, genuine street movies! Through this movie I felt it as I was there, he even puts the little things in there, it caused me to turn to my friends at the movie and say, ""Remember my situation like that""! You feel it with them because you see it in the actors face, body movement, and there crews actions around them, and not many actors can give you that, unless your directed by someone who has away for them to give him that and put it on the camera. I can go on, but never do this and I will keep it short. Of course I loved, Good Will Hunting, he co wrote with Damon, and co-starred? There were plenty of movies in between, some good, and bad. Then, ""Gone Baby Gone"", I was impressed, and he directed it. He caught the large and small meanings of the street, the good, bad, and how it sucks you up, or makes you stronger. I thought the best from Affleck, and his buddy Damon was more enjoyable, and maybe it was the way Damon created himself with the characters in the move, or just his very unique swagger. But this movie is not about the rating, or stupid voting (voted 10 anyways), it actually caught you threw the movie, you were there, you know that feeling, and this is as real as it gets, and you are blown away. Affleck blew me away, and the direction talents are very original and real, you very rarely see anymore. I sometimes think I should put my life on a piece of paper, the streets of Providence are a little different, but there is no other director who would make it realer. So Mr. Ben Affleck, thank you for letting me spend that $10 twice already to see your creation, I will never think or say the negative things I thought in the past about you. you have created a film that really speaks to everyone in the streets, and teaches the streets to the silver spooners. I was born and raised in this type environment, and this is the Bible."
"Tat123","10","1","6","23 September 2010"," Ben Affleck is a God.
","The Man can make one hell of a movie! Ben Affleck seems to never disappoint, first he makes a spectacular movie called Gone baby Gone, then he makes The Town, which is also a brilliant movie, and he is smart enough to give himself the main role, which he played to perfection! Another great factor about the movie is Jeremy Renner, who just seems to be getting better and better as the movies keep on coming. He was truly wonderful in the Hurt Locker and in my opinion his role in this movie was even better. This actor as well as Ben Affleck have something that many actors do not have, true talent. Watching these two men in the movie was a real treat, it was believable and impressive acting. Overall the movie itself had a good plot, it was a great action movie that just kept on giving till the very end. It was without a doubt one of the best movies i've seen this year, it had it all. I recommend this movie to all genders, it was probably more of a guy movie but Ben Affleck's amazing body(sadly only seen for about 5 seconds) will keep the ladies happy the entire time. Go see it! It was Brilliant!"

","Set in rural Boston, The Town stars Ben Affleck as a leader of a bank robbery group that used to hold hostage a bank manager (Rebecca Hall) before letting her go. Years later, she anonymously meets him and falls in love with him, not knowing that he would be one of the most dangerous men in Charlestown. Enter the FBI, intent on stopping the bank robbers from stealing every bank in Beantown. In the end, everything comes to a compromise. The movie is well-done, shot beautifully in Boston, and has great acting by Affleck and Hall, not to mention Jeremy Renner from ""The Hurt Locker"".

"bowmanblue","8","0","2","21 November 2019"," Somehow better than average
","There are so many films out there about gangs of bank robbers versus the law that it's hard to come up with anything vaguely different. And, to be fair, 'The Town' doesn't really succeed. Now, although that may sound like a 'down-point,' despite its mediocre premise, it's actually quite good (if you're into gritty bank robbing films, anyway).<br/><br/>Ben Affleck and Jeremy Renner play the lead bank robbers, while Jon Hamm heads up the FBI task force whose job it is to bring this particular gang to justice in Boston, which is - apparently - the city in America with the most bank robberies in the country.<br/><br/>Again, it's weird, but I can't really think of many major plus points. Yes, the lead cast are pretty 'A-list' (plus you have Rebecca Hall, Blake Lively and Pete Postlethwaite) to add to the heavyweights, but the story really is so little new that I don't understand quite why I like it so much!<br/><br/>I hear the original cut was around a massive four hours and director (also Ben Affleck) had to work hard to trim down the final edit to slightly under two hours. You may think that such a drastic loss would mean that it all feels really rushed. But, again, it doesn't.<br/><br/>There's just something about the film that really does work, even though it never really brings much that's new to the table. Personally, I really enjoyed Jon Hamm's performance, but it was Jeremy Renner who received a nod to an Academy Award for his supporting portrayal of a Boston gangster.<br/><br/>If you like your gangster films dark, gritty and - strangely - watchable, then you should definitely give this one a go. At least then if you like it I'll know it's not just me."

"its_Suvo","8","0","1","29 June 2019"," JUST AMAZING!
","Can't remember a good film about bank robbers other than this. Ben Affleck is really did a great job as a director and screenplay writer, not as much as actor. Sometime his dialogue delivery feels heartless, he just reads his lines loudly, major cons of this flick. But this doesn't takes u away from film's good parts.
GOOD THINGS 1) THE CHARACTERS- They are interesting, Thanks to well written script, Jeremy runner shines, his performance is so much better than other actors, He really captures the essence of a Boston bank robber (his character). He is funny, smart, loves his family but with short temper ( typical ) . Blake lively looked so hot in this movie, she did a good job same as other actors.
2) DIRECTION- Affeck did a great job as a director. First bank robbery scene is really good. He really did a good job maintaining the flow of the movie , so it doesn't get boring. Romance or romantic scenes between Affleck & the girl is really well done, it really doesn't disturb the main plot . The ENDING is perfect to me . Ending wise it is better than heat imo. I watched this on Netflix, worth watching!"

","This is a movie about a group of thieves in a town of bad history about thieves, and of course we see their interactions to the surrounding community, the police and the victims of their heists.<br/><br/>But the story is not the core here as it's very simple related to other heist related movies, however the excellency of this movie stems from paying much attention to the details; the details in the accent of ""Charlestown"" citizens, the details in the costumes which made for us that unforgettable scene of the robbing nuns, the details in making such strong plot with the least weak points.<br/><br/>The length of the movie is a little bit extended without any good reason, it starts well with a great action scene then the rhythm goes up and down till you reach the end which may not be liked by a lot.<br/><br/>The performance of the actors is really great and you see them in new characters and they nailed it specially ""Ben Affleck"" & ""Jeremy Renner"". On the other hand, ""Rebecca Hall"" & ""Blake Lively"" could do better and ""Jon Hamm"" didn't fit that much in the role.<br/><br/>Finally, it's a nice crime/drama movie that the director -who is ""Ben Affleck""- paid much attention to everything except for the thrill which could be added in a bigger amount here,you will enjoy it till the end if you overcome some boring moments."
"imseeg","8","0","1","7 July 2018"," Some flaws in credibility of the romantic story in this movie. But the heist part of this movie is tough and suspenseful. Sum total is entertaining.
","The story is about a town called Charlestown which is famous for being the birthplace of the largest number of robbers in the entire USA. This place spawns criminals like crazy. Ben Affleck is one of them, although he is the gentleman gangster, never killed someone, only has robbed some banks. The latest heist goes awry however and a guard is shot down. The police goes beserk and does everything in its power to apprehend the criminals at large. Will Ben Affleck succeed in pulling off the biggest heist without getting busted?<br/><br/>Movies got to be sold to the masses and I cant think of another reason that in most heist movies there always has to be a romantic story in order to lure the female audiences into buying a ticket. Can't image any guy wanting to see a romance in a tough heist movie. I dont have anything against romances, not even in heist movies, as long as the romantic story is credible. And it was NOT.<br/><br/>The somewhat flawed romantic story is about Ben Affleck, playing a bankrobber, who starts flirting with a female bankmanager of the place that he just robbed. That's just a lot of Hollywood romantic crap. The writer only puts something THIS much unbelievable in the story to sell tickets for females, who wanna drool over Ben Affleck. Females wont mind, guys probably will get anoyed by it somewhat.The rest of this movie is good though. Very good. The heist part of this movie is really tough and suspenseful. Coming close in true to life portrayal of gangster life in classics like ""Heat"" with Robert de Niro and Al Pacino and ""Training Day"", with Denzel Washington. These realistic supsenseful heist action scenes are what make this movie standout above the average heist movie. Acting in it is very very good. From leading characters (Ben Affleck, Jeremy Renner) to some of the supporting actors, acting is on a level that really made me believe in the gangsters world that was portrayed in ""The Town"".<br/><br/>Sum total of this movie is pretty impressive, despite some flaws in the romantic story. If you just wanna see an entertaining action movie, then this hollywood formula film will certainly entertain. And there are some nice twists near the end that make this story surprising and very suspenseful. Too bad about the flawed romantic story, because the rest of this heist movie is really great."

"chetanchopra012","9","0","1","29 April 2018"," A cliffhanger
","Where should I start? This movie was beyond expectations in every aspect. It's about the story of 4 bank robbers who're astonishingly perfect in doing what they're supposed to, leaving nothing behind that could even give any iota of help to FBI in tracing them. The plot takes a twist when Ben Affleck falls for the assistant manager of the bank they recently robbed. They both start seeing each other and everything works smooth until Jeremy Renner, who also has done his role breathtakingly well adorns this film with his Oscar worthy acting, finds about it and a tussle develops between both the leads. 
Rebecca Hall is wonderful as Claire, it fells as if she is really feeling her character and delivers each dialogue with a command which is captivating. John Hamm and Blake Lively have done their part well enough as the FBI S.A. and a drugged out mother of Affleck's child. Another brilliant performance comes from Titus Welliver as Dino who apparently coaxes Affleck to against the grain in the later part of the movie. Although his screen time is short but he does impress in every second he occupies the screen.
The film is evenly paced with a great screenplay. The chase scenes are a treat to watch. The dialogues are absolutely amazing. You'll miss out on something important if blink. 
Watch it for the performances and for the twists."

"barretlee","10","0","1","15 November 2017"," My Favorite Crime Drama of all time!
","This film has its Roots tied to the novel ""Prince of Thieves "", by Chuck Hogan. It's a crime drama that tells the story of a crime crew that's specialty is robbing banks. As with most Crime Drama's, there are cops chasing crooks and this film has a unique set of ""Crime Fighters""! As in the movies as well as real life, many criminals have had a sorted family life. In the case of this film the family business is ""Robbing Banks""! Starring Ben Affleck, the gangs leader as ""Doug MacRay"". His Evil, yet loyal Lieutenant Jeremy Renner ""Jen"", was nominated for the ""Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor"". There's a classic comparison of the ""Good Bad Guy"" & ""Bad Bad Guy, between Dougie & Jem throughout the film. Part of this comparison involves the love interest's, played by Rebecca Hall & Blake Lively. Throughout the film the characters are in two distinct categories, ""Lawful & Unlawful"". There isn't anyone in the gray area, even if they appear to be an upstanding citizen who runs the town ""Flower Shop"". In this case it's ""Pete Postlethwaite"" aka ""Fergie"" playing the ""Crime Boss"". The reason this film is so great is due to both the story & Excellent acting. Postiethwaite Performance is award worthy! Not to leave out our ""Crime Fighter"", (the less than respectful term for law enforcement used by the citizens in the town), is John Hamm aka ""Adam Frawley"" FBI Special Agent. Hamm plays the slick FBI Agent who has met his match with an even Slicker crew of bank robbers! In the end you will find yourself quietly rooting for the bad guys & not so much for the ""Bad Bad Guys""."
"rdoyle29","7","0","1","9 October 2017"," Possibly a good film hiding in there
","I think there's probably a decent action film buried in this really long and ponderous film. As it is, you get some great sequences like an armored car robbery/car chase, but you have to sit through the endless set up of the Charlestown locale, an incredibly implausible relationship drama and a dozen speeches about how Affleck is going to change. Somehow the film never manages to find the time during it's two hour run time to explain how Affleck could plan and execute a robbery of Fenway Park while under constant FBI surveillance."

","This is a very entertaining bank robber movie, with pretty solid acting and action scenes. However, I dock it three stars because Rebecca Hall's character is so boring! Rebecca Hall is ""miss perfect"" and has zero sexual chemistry with Ben Affleck, which makes the romance scenes boring as hell to watch. Ah what a cheese fest! On the flip side, Blake Lively gives a terrific performance as a drug addicted Mother, and her smooching scene with Ben Affleck is top notch. 7/10"
"videorama-759-859391","8","0","1","19 April 2017"," Ben does it again
","You can't fault a movie made by Ben Affleck. He makes good movies every time. He never drops his guard, you could say. This second outing, that should of had a better title, becomes an engaging watch, like his other films, the second half more exciting. Set in Charleston, where the movie Slapshot was set, he heads a band of top line thieves, who've got their s..t together, the way they immaculately work, when taking down this bank, is professionalism at a frightening level. Only they make one mistake, they take a female employee hostage, for some reason, none other than Affleck getting a hard on (again, don't let your d..k run your life). He strikes up a romance with her, while initially tailing her, and sussing her out, as if getting confirmation, that she doesn't recognize his voice. Hey it's a small town and the town di.ks led by a real d..k (a riveting Hamm), who we want Affleck to beat, are quickly on to them, as the robber's locale is within four blocks of the victim's place. Affleck becomes quickly swayed from getting out of this business, and leaving his ex, (a fantastic Blake Lively) the town pump you could say and kid, and taking off with his new found love. The acting really impressed and surprised me, with this movie. Renner, Cooper, and Pete Postlewaite, a really nasty piece of work, who've owned Affleck and his family, he was the icing on the cake. The shootout, heading towards it's climactic end, where Aflleck has cornered into doing another job was beautiful, and so was his fate. Even the masks and hold up garb is impressive- scary nun wear. Like Clooney, Affleck acts better in films he directs, and I have not yet seen The Accountant. In no way, is he the best actor here, him, falling somewhere near the middle amidst this high calibre pool of actors. I'm so glad I caught, this movie. It is kind of overlong, but I really don't see that as a qualm, with a film like this, boosted by engaging performances and a quite simplistic though well worked story. If only for a better title, which a movie as good as this much better title rethink. Five days past, and I'm still thinking about this film. Good stuff Ben."
"lee_eisenberg","8","0","1","16 February 2017"," Boston in all its toughness
","I've never read the book on which ""The Town"" is based, but having seen the movie, I'm impressed. Even the concept of Boston tough can't prepare you for the nasty stuff that the movie depicts. Set in a neighborhood that apparently produces a disproportionate number of criminals, the movie focuses on a bank robber who falls for a woman whom he kidnapped in the process. We get a look both at the lives of the bank robbers, and the FBI agent investigating the robbery.<br/><br/>I'd say that the movie's main strength is how it looks at the lives of the different characters. It's made perfectly clear why the characters are like they are. There's no room for sugarcoating here. Although Claire is a secondary character in the movie, I found her character to be the most interesting. Kept in the dark about her lover's deeds, she functions as a link between the two worlds.<br/><br/>It's not a masterpiece, but worth seeing. In comparison to Ben Affleck's other movies as director it stacks up well. ""Gone Baby Gone"" was kind of empty, so this was an improvement. ""Argo"" was correct in showing the shah's life of luxury while his people lived in poverty, but should've shown his brutality. I haven't seen his most recent movie.<br/><br/>Worth seeing."

","Three years after his debut with Gone Baby Gone, and two years before his Oscar winning success for the film Argo, Ben Affleck directed this film that looked and sounded a worthwhile watch. Basically set in the Charlestown neighbourhood of Boston, the town is renowned for producing a high number of crooks, generation after generation, these armed robbers never leave their own neighbourhood and depend on a code of silence; those caught serve their time. Four lifelong friends Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Jeremy Renner), Albert 'Gloansy' Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond 'Dez' Elden (Owen Burke) treat each other like family, especially to Doug as his mother ran off and his father is in prison, and to James whose sister Krista (Gossip Girl's Blake Lively) takes drugs, is a single mother and has a casual sexual relationship with Doug. The foursome carry out a bank robbery, taking the manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage for a short period, before releasing her physically unharmed, to make sure she did not see anything that could incriminate them if they encounter her again, Claire is followed, she lives in Charlestown. As such, Doug happens to meet Claire in town, he slowly begins a personal relationship with her to find out what she knows and what information has given to the police and the FBI, who have taken over the investigation. Doug learns that Claire has kept some information from the investigation for her own protection, this knowledge could identify James in particular, but as time has passed Doug has fallen for Claire, as she has for him. Ultimately Doug dreams of leaving his bleak life in Charlestown to be with Claire anywhere else, but he has to try and keep his true identity from her, and his colleagues are unaware that he has been seeing her. Leaving Charlestown however is not easy, as he and his gang are tasked by local gangster Fergus 'Fergie' Colm (posthumous BAFTA nominated Pete Postlethwaite) with carrying out a big job, Doug has to go ahead with it whether he likes it or not. FBI Special Agent Adam Frawley (Mad Men's Jon Hamm), the leading investigator, comes up with evidence that links the four men to the earlier bank robbery and a subsequent armoured car heist, and Claire finds out the truth about Doug as well, so there will be a big conclusion that will send them away dead or alive. Also starring Titus Welliver as Dino Ciampa, Chris Cooper as Stephen 'Mac' MacRay, Dennis McLaughlin as Rusty and Victor Garber as Assistant Bank Manager. Affleck is admirably subtle as the central conflicted character, and directs with good pace, and Renner is fantastically intense as the criminal with a short fuse, it is a simple concept, a bank robber carries out a job and falls in love with a victim taken during and is stuck between wanting love and to get away with being loyal to his colleagues, the romantic stuff is alright, but the heist and gun filled sequences definitely pick things up, all in all an entertaining crime drama. Very good!"

","Ben ""The Batman"" Affleck directs The Town an amazing movie with a really great plot and themes where Affleck is amazing both in front of and behind the camera as I think he gives an Oscar worthy performance here as Doug McRay a man who just doesn't know where he belongs in life and that struggle is what carries this movie as here it's not about the heist it's about the characters. Jeremy Renner received an Oscar nomination for this movie and it's very well deserved he's fantastic in this movie just excelling at being incredibly intense and even frightening at times. The film isn't all drama though this is first and foremost a bank robbery movie and those bank robberies are filmed very well as there really fast paced making them feel real. The chemistry between Ben Affleck and Rebecca Hall is perfect as its really believable you feel like these are real people in a real relationship. The Town is amazing extremely entertaining and in a lot of ways relatable it's one of the best bank robbery movies of all time with amazing performances proving that Ben Affleck is just as good a director as he is an actor.

","A story of people having no choices.No choice but to leave the town, put the past away, or even fall in love. Great piece of art. I've always wanted to join IMDb but I never did. This movie gives me the motivation. This is my first time writing a review, and I'm glad and honor it's The Town I'm writing about. Ben Affleck did a wonderful job, both acting and directing. Jeremy Renner is even more eye- catching. Every character was there for a reason.They all have depth and their back-stories are set perfectly well. Last but not least, those masks! Damn they are horrifying. I think I'll definitely see this film again(,this side or the other)."
"troyputland","8","0","1","21 March 2016"," Ben Affleck proves himself as director and actor.
","Certain aspects of The Town assimilate Michael Mann's Heat, as do most heist epics since its creation. Luckily enough for director/actor Ben Affleck and all on board there's plenty of new ideas that help the film stand on its own two feet. Heist expert Affleck and his crew, which consists, infiltrate a bank, kidnapping a member of staff in the process. Affleck's oddly infatuated with the kidnapped Rebecca Hall, who's unaware of who her kidnappers were. The Town follows his working life and personal life coming together. <br/><br/>Affleck has scored as both director and actor, creating tension and feud with animosity. Affleck's is humble, the relationship with Hall is cast in romantic misery. Blake Lively's short but bitter cameo as a 'lady of the night', abusing our criminal- come-protagonist, only coming out her shell when FBI agent Jon Hamm muscles in. The person to watch out for is Jeremy Renner as Affleck's harrowing, temperamental partner-in-crime. The scene's he's in are jaw-clenching.<br/><br/>The Town's packs enough heat to keep my interest the whole way through. Well done, Ben Affleck. Gone, Baby, Gone wasn't a fluke."

The Town is very similar to the movie Heat (De Niro/Pacino) but it holds it's own.

","I'd heard plenty about THE TOWN, a film which lifted Ben Affleck from the doldrums and gave him a revamped career of sorts by revealing him to be an efficient director of modern-day thrillers. One reviewer on here even likens him to Scorsese. So what of this Oscar-nominated film, and will it really stand up to scrutiny? The answer is no, not really. THE TOWN turns out to be a very familiar and ordinary type of thriller that comes across as a Boston-set rip-off of Michael Mann's HEAT. Once again we follow the predictable story of a gang of bank robbers, with the running time split between their lives and loves and the actual heist scenes.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I didn't dislike this film. I particularly enjoyed Affleck's direction in the action scenes, which are vibrant, gritty, and exciting (even if the whole clichéd blue tint look of the cinematography spoils things a bit). There's a top-notch car chase and some quite wonderfully hard-hitting scenes at the (again, predictable) climax. It's the stuff in between the action where this film falls down.<br/><br/>To put it bluntly, THE TOWN is overlong and features characters who aren't particularly interesting. The likes of Affleck and Jeremy Renner are defined by their actions, so watching them sitting around chatting is pretty dull. The romantic scenes are even worse, even if Rebecca Hall does a good job. And the whole sub-plot with Jon Hamm's FBI guy is unnecessary, feeling tacked on and dragging the pace down still further. THE TOWN is a fun thriller, but nothing special."

","The Town (2010): Dir: Ben Affleck / Cast: Ben Affleck, Rebecca Hall, Jeremy Renner, Jon Hamm, Pete Postlethwaite: In his second directional film Ben Affleck visualizes a town that becomes something different to bank robbers who go one too far. The police are out to solve a string of bank robberies but having no luck. Affleck plays one of the guilty who wishes to go straight but takes the dare of starting a relationship with a female hostage they let go. She is played by Rebecca Hall unaware of her boyfriend's crime. Jeremy Renner plays Affleck's psychotic best friend who wants Hall dead but Affleck refuses. Jon Hamm plays a police investigator up on the reputations of the robbers and struggles to convict them. This is the film that allows Affleck to regain a certain level of respect after having been involved in a great many duds. As director and actor he carries out a personality that longs for forgiveness and connection with someone who is somewhat forbidden. Hall is a broken figure from a bank holdup who seeks refuge in someone of deception. Thankfully she is rewarded, which cannot be said of everyone. Renner is fantastic as a brother type on the lower track and seems impervious to the consequences that eventually surface. Hamm seems the bunt of mocked law enforcement but his methods are sincere and deliberate. Pete Postlethwaite plays the real villain working in a flower shop while issuing Affleck his orders but not without a hint of sadism. Perhaps the handling of the law is off putting but the film is a well crafted voice regarding the choices we make and the consequences. Score: 9 / 10"
"midas-jacobs","9","0","1","19 July 2015"," A very well developed drama
","The movie is about a crew who robs banks and armored trucks. But one day they rob a bank and they take a hostage. They set her free, but someone has to follow her. The one that has to follow her is Doug (Ben Afflec) He then falls in love with Claire (Rebecca Keesey) Doug tries to retire but decides to take two more jobs... <br/><br/>The movie is also portrayed by the view of two cops, how they try to track down the crew of Doug. these cops are Adam Frawley (John Hamm) He is like the bad and driven cop. And the other cop is Dino Ciampa (Titus Welliver) he is a more gentle cop.<br/><br/>The directing of the movie is done very well. A thing that I didn't like was the shaky cam. When there where action/ fight scenes there was often some shaky cam. this style of filming made it hard to see what was going on. But the heist scenes were filmed very well which weighs against my previous disadvantage. These scenes were also quite thrilling. The car chasing scenes are pretty good. <br/><br/>The acting in 'The town' was very well done. I really liked Jeremy Renner character (James Coughlin). THis is one of Jermeys best roles (in my opinion). Also Blake Lively did a good job. She was very convincing. Ben acted less good, but his character was very well developed. They start working on his character when Doug and Claire are talking to each other, and Doug starts talking about how his mother left him. This was a very well written scene and also one of my favorites. the dialogue is overall also very well. Another scene that I liked is when Doug goes to Coughlin and says: 'I need your help. I can't tell you what it is, you can never ask me about it later, and we're gonna hurt some people.' then Coughlin says: 'Whose car are we gonna take?' This is really funny in the movie, and this isn't the only funny scene. The moments that were meant funny genuinely turned out to be funny. The movie doesn't have a lot of these moments, but that is just because this is a drama and not a comedy...<br/><br/>A thing thing that I liked is that they also filmed from the view of the police, this gave a interesting take on the movie. The love story of Doug and Claire is also good, it didn't fell to forced. But now something I didn't really like was that you don't get to know the rest of the crew that much. So when they die at the end, you don't really feel sad, or care about them. The only person I cared about when he died is Coughlin. this is because they focus more on him. When Gloansy died it was funny and sad, it was funny because of the things he said, and sad because he gave his own live to save Doug and Coughlin. <br/><br/>Now that I have said what I wanted to say, I'll give you some individual scores:<br/><br/>Directing: 8/10<br/><br/>Writing: 9/10<br/><br/>Acting: 9/10<br/><br/>Thrilling: 8.5/10<br/><br/>That is a total of 34.5/40.On ten that would be a 8.6/10.

"dom-lerose-8","Null","0","1","19 June 2015"," ""The Town"" is a remarkable thriller.
","Boston. The bank robbery capital of the world. ""The Town"" isn't your typical cops and robbers good guy bad guy kind of thriller, but rather a rare piece of crime cinema that raises moral questions and still delivers exhilarating action. Ben Affleck (who usually is a let down) directs and stars as Doug Macray, a life-long bank robber who after a heist reconnects by chance with Claire, a woman taken hostage by Doug and his gang who's played by Rebecca Hall. I know what you're thinking. Don't worry. This Hollywood-like plot doesn't fall into a traditional love story at all. Doug's feelings and motives for robbing banks change drastically after he forms a relationship with Claire, while also battling a ruthless FBI agent played blandly by Jon Hamm. The real superstar of the film is played by Jeremy Renner. Renner is Affleck's best friend who still has a bad side revealed constantly throughout the film. ""The Town"" excels at balancing action with emotions. Affleck raises multiple moral ideas about changing your life around and fighting for those you love. We do get trapped in a little bit of over the top nonsense regarding love and forgiveness. That's the only big issue. Blake Lively also plays Affleck's old girlfriend. Blake Lively, sorry honey, you can't act. Even though there are some flaws, ""The Town' remains consistent in being both entertaining and thoughtful. The final thirty minutes of the film are pitch perfect, resolving all the major conflicts and delivering heart-pounding action resulting with machine gun fire and car chases flying all over the screen. Even though the action is far-fetched, Affleck keeps ""The Town"" grounded in remaining a human drama that reflects the hard life criminals face day to day, and why criminals act the way they do. Affelck's goal isn't to just entertain you. He makes you question and look at crime differently. Boy did he nail it."
"j-penkair","7","0","1","28 May 2015"," Ben The Storyteller
","I think this film is on par with ""The French Connection"". The main reasons are the realism, and that the human drama does not dominate the plot. We know enough to care for the characters, but never to the degree of forgetting that it is indeed a Boston story, and not a story of these individuals. Ben Affleck is successful directing this film, mainly, I presume, because he is a true appreciator of a well-made film. This film does not pretend to intellectually analyze Boston and its crime-related history. It does not even try to present itself as a great film. It simply tells a good story that grabs our attention for two full hours. As a foreigner, I feel strongly that such characters exist and roam around the city, especially in those days. That is how good the film is. Another personal surprise for me is that I have no urge to read ""The Prince of Thieves"", which this film is based on. Normally, I feel like going to the book that inspires a good film. I simply feel adequate about the story and in no mood to know more. This is a success as a film. No need for other supplements to make it worthwhile or meaningful. New filmmakers should learn from this film. You do not need to turn the world around yourself in every piece of film you make. All you need to do is to find a good story, write it nicely as a film, and make the damned film for the purpose to entertain and make us feel. If there is any more morals, we the audience will point out for you. No need to put anything down our throats. I respect you for respecting the art of filmmaking, Mr. Affleck."

","In his second time directing, Ben Affleck demonstrates once again his skill both in front of and behind the camera. In the unique setting of the neighbourhood of Charlestown he creates a great film held together by strong characters and an authentic environment of the crime ridden Charlestown. <br/><br/>We follow criminal Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), part of a group who carries out many high stake bank robberies. After taking a woman named Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage to ensure a safe escape, Doug follows her into a Laundrette to discover whether she knows anything. But as he talks to her he begins to care for her and slowly begins to have feelings. These feelings mixed with his guilt over the harm that his life of crime can cause others and the FBI drawing closer he begins to want to leave Charlestown and start a new life with the woman he loves. <br/><br/>Affleck performs well as the lead whilst juggling both his directing and writing duties with a very restrained performance of a man longing for something different in life. He comes across as very likable in spite of his crimes and does get over the difficulty of balancing his loyalty towards the town and people that raised him with his new found love and longing for a normal life. <br/><br/>Though the highlight of the film is definitely Renner who plays a fairly psychotic, but surprisingly sympathetic character. He plays James Coughlin, a man who is like a brother to Doug who shares an unspoken loyalty with one another willing to put their lives on the line for one another. In spite of this loyalty they are also both very different people with Doug's longing to leave the life of crime contrasted with Renner's acceptance of it and a true product of the criminal underworld. Whilst Affleck's character is often hesitant on harming others, James is constantly prepared for it bashing in a cashier's head for speaking out of turn and being quite ready to kill their hostage at any risk of getting caught without even giving a second thought. <br/><br/>But this film is more than just about it's characters. It's about a place called Charlestown in Boston, which the film states in its introduction that it breeds more bank robbers and armoured car thieves than anywhere else in the world. It's a dangerous environment to be raised in when everyone around you lives such a life it leaves a person with little choice to do otherwise. This is exactly what made Doug MacRay who he is in the film. He's not a bad person, but he's put in an environment where he had no other choice but to turn to a life of crime or betray his father and friends. Even when he tries to leave it seems as if his friends and employers keep sucking him back in like a dark pit with no escape with people like Coughlin keeping him trapped in the world of crime. <br/><br/>On top of his ability to create convincing human drama on screen, Affleck also demonstrates his skill as an action director with several memorable heists throughout the film. Each heist keeps an intimidating atmosphere through the gangs use of threatening masks and the feel that they are in complete control of the situation making them come across as real professionals. <br/><br/>The heists also incorporate an interesting element often overlooked in heist films which is the psychological intimidation being one of the most effective weapons. Whilst pointing guns and yelling certainly creates great threat, for a guard to hear the name of loved ones or their own addresses the level of intimidation reaches an entirely new level. This combined with the impressive shootouts and driving sequences demonstrates how Ben Affleck has really evolved as a filmmaker. <br/><br/>Whilst his career had dipped before, this was a real sign that Ben Affleck was deservingly back in the highlight. He made a great choice of material to work from and uses his expertise as a filmmaker of knowing how to work with his actors along with his ability to keep the story fast paced and exciting to make the film a real standout."
"abercrombie-kendall","8","0","1","11 December 2014"," Great movie
","The meaning of armed robbery in Charlestown, Massachusetts has a different meaning compared to most other cities. In the hit movie The Town released in 2010, crime and criminals are said to be somewhat of a family tradition; or a passed down ""trait"". More specifically, armed robberies. Four men named Doug, James, Albert, and Desmond seem to be experts in just that.<br/><br/>The four men meticulously plan their robberies. In the movie, they perform multiple successful bank robberies. The first bank robbery they complete, they take one hostage named Claire. The men push Claire into a van and drive her to a beach area and let her out, telling her to walk until her toes meet the water. Claire did not see any of the men. After the robbery, the men are nervous about getting caught. To ease their anxiety, they figure at least one of them should follow Claire around to make sure she does not make any moves that would increase their chances of prosecution. Instead of just following her around, one of the men, Doug, starts speaking to her. Since she did not see this face during the robbery, she does not suspect a thing. Shortly there after, Doug and Claire begin a romantic relationship. While he does really like her, he makes sure to subtly ask her about her feelings and the actions she plans to take with the police regarding the robbery.<br/><br/>One judgment that I have about the relationship between Doug and Claire is that while it is incredibly hurtful, scarring, and scary given the circumstances; it is genius. The idea in and of itself that the criminal will interact with the victim is quite risky. However, in this movie it is the easiest and most effective way to be on the ""inside"" without having to deal directly with the police. Claire had no idea that the man she is sharing a relationship with,, is the same man who took her hostage.<br/><br/>Another thing about I have about this movie is how in the very beginning, the neck tattoo of one of the criminals, James, is subtly shown to the audience. It is a very brief showing of the tattoo, but long enough for the watchers to pick up on it and realize that it may be an important factor later in the movie. And it is. Later in the movie, when Claire's bank is being robbed, she notices that one of the men has a tattoo on the back of their neck. Coincidentally, when Claire is on a lunch date with Doug, James happens to be in the area. This is this first time seeing Doug out with the victim from the bank. The tattoo on James' neck is shown to the audience once again, but this time, for a much longer time and more than once. The director really wants the watchers to see this tattoo and recognize it. To me, this is a very subtle yet clever way to reach the audience. It is sending a silent message that watchers really need to pay attention to this tattoo.<br/><br/>A third judgment that I have about this movie is how towards the middle of the movie, Doug recruits James on a mission. The mission is to go to a man's house and beat him up. However, the man that is beat up does not show in the movie prior to this beating. This character is never explained nor shown. He does not tie into the movie whatsoever. To me, this scene is not necessary. The director seemed to add this to only add time to the movie. Not only is the scene not completely necessary, but it is also confusing. For me, as I viewed this scene I was beginning to wonder how this mystery man had anything to do with the movie. I began to wonder if I had missed something earlier in the film. However after reviewing the movie, I learned that I had not missed anything. This scene should not be included in the movie.<br/><br/>The fourth and final judgment that I have about this movie is more towards the end. It begins when the main character, Doug, is brought into police headquarters for an unrelated crime, yet to be questioned about the bank robbery. During the questioning, the officer yells a rude and specific statement at Doug. A few scenes after the police questioning, Doug is the only one left of the four men and he is trying to escape a bank robbery charges for the last time. The police know who he is and they also know that he was connected to the crime. However, they cannot prove it with any evidence yet. They try to trick him and set him up to come clean, however, Doug is one step ahead of law enforcement and plays along to let them think they will capture him. As he is playing along in this master scheme, he writes a note and leaves it on the police car of the officer that questioned him. The note read the exact same rude and specific statement the officer initially said to Doug. This scene in particular was quite funny to me. I believe that the director added in a part of humor to ease the audience of any tension the movie was creating. This scene also created a connection from earlier in the movie that the audience may find humor in. <br/><br/>In closing, The Town was directed methodically. It showed many subtle scenes that would later be important in the movie. I believe that this was a movie that deserved many awards. The director really knew how to connect with the audience in a way in which tells a story."

","Ben Affleck who starred as ""Doug MacRay"" did a phenomenal job in this crime thriller drama, which is perhaps one of my favorite films of all time. In my opinion this is for sure one of the best movies of its kind even better than another favorite of mine, Oceans Twelve, which just didn't display the drama and suspense that was provided by The Town. You sure couldn't tell that Affleck went seven years without having a lead role in a film; not to mention he was the screen writer and director, very impressive. This was only the second film Affleck directed and perhaps topped his first film, Gone Baby Gone. I also must praise Jeremy Renner as ""Jem Coughlin,"" he was a great supporting actor in this film with his hostile personality. Renner was actually nominated for Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in this film. Doug and his life-long friends were big time bank robbers in Charlestown, Boston. A unit assembled by the crime lord ""Fergie Colm"" who was played by Pete Postlethwaite, playing a very intimidating role. After robbing the bank at the beginning of the movie they took a hostage ""Claire Keesey"" who was played by Rebecca Hall. She was considered a loose end by the gang which was strongly influenced by Jem Coughlin. This forced Doug to go and check in on her to see if she needed to be ""taken care of,"" to protect them from getting caught but Doug ends up developing a romantic relationship with Claire. This romance between the two with the current situation added a very interesting twist to this suspenseful film because for the longest time Claire was completely unaware that Doug was one of the bank robbers. Until special F.B.I. agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) that was hot on the gangs trail after setting up surveillance and compiling evidence, shows Claire the truth. <br/><br/>I think all the actors did a pretty good job however, Affleck and Renner had the most impressive performance displaying great acting easily displaying that they were professional bank robbers. A perfect example of this is how detailed their plans were, just like during the last heist when they robbed the Cathedral of Boston, they knew exactly who was in the cash vault, their family, and where they lived intimidating them to open the door without alarming authorities. Detail such as this is what made me realize how much time was put into the film during the screen writing process. They literally had to think like brilliant criminals to come up with the amount of detail and ideas that the screenwriter put into these robberies."

Furthermore, FBI run after them persistently.<br/><br/>Through this movie, for the first time ever, I watched a movie Ben Affleck directed. Before watching this, I don't like him because of his bad impression comes from Golden Raspberry Prize winner and affairs with Jennifer Lopez. However, now, I do respect him. I can't believe he directs so skillfully.<br/><br/>He's really good at filming people and catching the atmosphere of Boston. Even though this is the second directed movie, he is well aware of location and when to insert musics. This is brilliant.<br/><br/>There're many good points in this movie. The scenes of robbery has reality and are thrilling. The climax scene's gunfight is very powerful. It's suggestive of Michael Mann's Heat.<br/><br/>Not only as a crime suspense, but also as a love romance it serves. Dag really suffers. He loves the woman but his boss threatens to kill her if Dag doesn't continue robbery.  I'm fascinated by this psychological conflict.<br/><br/>All of the cast are marvelous. Especially, Jeremy Renner is outstanding. He's a bad guy but I can't dislike him. Besides, other supporting roles are impressive. Gloansy acted by Slain is not only a bad guy but a considerate man for friends like Dag.<br/><br/>Although some critics may say the last scene is not good, I'm very satisfied with it. It makes me moved and I could bask in the afterglow. This movie gives a question to us , ""Can people start all over again even though he commits a crime?"" There's an answer. You should know it through watching.<br/><br/>I'm afraid it may be spoiler, but a tangerine orange plays a great role. I think it's a great direction.<br/><br/>As a similar crime movie, there's one named Heat.

Even someone who isn't particularly fond of action movies can still find this movie entertaining. On a side note, I really liked the portrayal of the FBI character in this movie. Movies rarely if ever create an FBI or cop character that's true to a real life one. The guy in this plays one of the most accurate portrayals of an FBI agent I've ever seen on the big screen.

","Synopsis: After pulling his last heist, bank robber Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) seeks out hostage and potential witness Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall). In finding out what she knows he unwittingly begins to fall for her which angers his partners in crime, specifically hothead James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) who thanks to Doug's former relationship with his sister Krista (Blake Lively), feels betrayed. Doug's problems begin to escalate as he attempts keep his identity a secret from Claire while dodging FBI Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) and local mob boss ""Fergie"" (Pete Postlethwaile) who forces him to pull one last heist. Buzz: The ""Superman"" persona that Ben Affleck usually exudes in every role he plays is actually believable in the Boston setting he's obviously accustomed and comfortable with. Although Jon Hamm's FBI agent comes off as a pompous version of his ""Mad Men"" counterpart and Blake Lively is obviously miscast as former lover who judging from her age would have put Affleck in the can long ago for statutory rape. It is however Jeremy Renner that steals more than bank money as he walks away with every scene he's in. Unfortunately Rebecca Hall manages to get as lost in the shuffle as she did in Woody Allen's Vicky Christina Barcelona. Adding great support are Chris Cooper as Affleck's interred father and of course the very visual Postlethwaile, whose face can be found in the dictionary under ""Character Actor"". Verdict: Although Affleck and Renner's performances are enough to carry the day, it is the story that sells the movie. The twists, turns, double-crosses and downright action are all interwoven into a tight script also penned by Affleck. In addition, Affleck's direction behind the camera has some nice touches of creative expression and style that he obviously picked up after years of performing in front of it. In addition, the film's production values, which include car chases, explosions and various shots of Fenway Park during an actual Red Sox game will leave even non ""bean town"" fans impressed. The ending is somewhat predictable, yet satisfying and all in all, worth the wait. Did you know? Jeremy Renner decided to surround himself with actual convicted bank robbers in Charlestown for research reasons and to help him nail the accent."

","Four childhood friends - Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), Jem Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine) and Dez Elden (Owen Burke) - rob a bank in the Boston neighborhood of Charlestown, kidnapping bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) in the process. They release her after the heist (but not before stealing her license and promising that they would rape and kill her if she went to the police). MacRay befriends Claire in an attempt to learn more about the FBI investigation surrounding the robbery, eventually falling in love with her. After a botched armored car robbery in North Boston, MacRay tells his boss - crime lord Fergie Colm (Pete Postlethwaite) - that he's retiring to Florida. After making a few not-so-thinly veiled threats, he convinces MacRay to do one last job for him.<br/><br/>For the life of me, I can't understand the critical acclaim that this film has acquired (it currently holds a 94% ""certified fresh"" rating on Rotten Tomatoes and was listed on the AFI's list of the top ten films from 2010). Despite Ben Affleck's surprisingly slick direction and several briskly paced action scenes (each featuring a unique set of disguises), the film is ultimately a victim of its own horrendous writing (proving once and for all how little input Affleck had on 1997's ""Good Will Hunting"").<br/><br/>The film's greatest writing concern is its inability to reasonably suspend the disbelief in the audience. While it seems reasonable to take a hostage to ensure a safe getaway from a bank heist, I don't believe for a second that anybody - especially one of the abductors - would think it reasonable to date the abductee. As that is seemingly the moral crux of the film (a case for MacRay's changed life-style and ultimate redemption), the entire production collapses at the failure of that premise.<br/><br/>The denouement of the film attempts to show Claire betraying MacCray by setting him up to be arrested when he comes to visit her (much in the same tradition as 2009's ""Pubic Enemies""). Unlike its immediate antecedent, however, the supposed betrayal is completely unwarranted by the script. The film opens with MacCray kidnapping her at gunpoint, stealing her driver's license and threatening to rape and kill her if she went to the police. The stress caused by this incident causes her to leave her job. Then her abductor begins a prolonged intimate relationship with her. Her proximity to him so soon after the robbery causes her to become suspect in the FBI's eyes (it's not difficult to imagine her as an inside conspirator for the four actual robbers). The film then has the borderline-offensive audacity to paint her - a genuine victim - as a traitor against the implicitly noble MacRay.<br/><br/>Fans of heist films will find this to be a more-or-less worthy addition to the genre. Likewise, those in accordance with the nation's critical heartbeat will find the film more than agreeable. As for the rest, however, this is a tired, clichéd and thread-bare film unworthy of the acclaim that it has generated."
"mcdona31","Null","0","1","18 September 2011"," A review of the movie, ""The Town.""
","First off, the movie The Town, is about the town, Charlestown, and how there are more robberies and armored car thieves in this town than any other town in the world. There is a robbery that takes place in this film and a hostage is taken and released. The main characters in this film are Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), and Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall). Claire Keesey is the woman that is takes as a hostage and then released. She is threatened by James Coughlin because she would be investigated. Doug MacRay becomes acquainted with her to find out if she is going to tell the FBI anything important. Doug MacRay eventually develops feelings for Claire. This creates conflict between him and James. Doug ends up going against James to protect Claire. Claire is unaware that Doug and James are the robbers until later in the movie. Until that part, Claire and Doug become close (Affleck & Iwanyk, 2001).<br/><br/>The theme of this film is about the town, Charlestown, and it being the town with more robberies and armored car thieves than anybody else in the world. The title of this film directly reflects the theme of this movie (Affleck & Iwanyk, 2001).<br/><br/>According to me, the main characters in the movie, The Town, are Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), and Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) (Affleck & Iwanyk, 2001).<br/><br/>I have one example of a short plot point that is in reference to my thematic ideas. This example takes place when the FBI agents are describing how the four bank robbers are products of fathers that are criminals. Unfortunately, they followed in their fathers' footsteps. For example, James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) is one of the main characters and he inherits his father's violence. His father was a murderer and he too tried to commit violent acts especially against Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall). There is additional conflict between James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) and Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck). All three of these actors portrayed their characters in a great manner (Affleck & Iwanyk, 2001).<br/><br/>Furthermore, I want to discuss my reference to one other film with appropriateness to the theme that is for this movie, The Town. In my opinion, the movie Jumper is somewhat similar to this movie. This is because the boy in the movie, Jumper, is a struggling bank robber and haves a past that is similar to Doug MacRay in the film, The Town. In addition, the young boy is pursued by people who want to capture him. There is some romance that occurs in both movies and the ""girl"" in each movie remains safe because of the main character. These are the type of movies that lets the audience know that male main characters that are somewhat seen as a ""hero"" do have a good side, but there can be emergence of their bad sides (Affleck & Iwanyk, 2001).<br/><br/>Additionally, the director in the film, The Town, uses two techniques that I want to discuss. The first technique is the usage of motifs. For example, Ben Affleck uses motifs in this film. When the main characters are introduced in this film, they follow the same pattern of criminal activities that their fathers did. Furthermore, the image of the fighting Irish tattoo is used throughout this film. This image is very important. It is a part of the criminal profiling that goes on when it comes to the bank robbery. According to me, this tattoo is one of the main motifs in the film, The Town. Furthermore, the director uses different angles in this film to add to the suspense in the film. For instance, when the robbery is going on and the robber looks down to look at Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall), this emphasizes the suspense and the acknowledgement of one of the main characters, Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) (Affleck & Iwanyk, 2001).<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie does have romantic scenes, but the theme of the film, The Town, is mainly about robbery. There is somewhat of a bad guy gone good aspect in this film. This is the unexpected ""hero."" Over all, this movie was great and I definitely recommend those who enjoy movies that are about crime to watch this film (Affleck & Iwanyk, 2001).<br/><br/>Reference Affleck, B. (Writer & Director) & Iwanyk, B. ( Producer). (2001). The town (Motion picture). United States: Warner Bros. Pictures."
"patrickwigington","8","0","1","12 June 2011"," Real Irish Action
","Ben Affleck directs ans stars in The Town, an involving, gripping tale of bank robbers in Charlestown, Massachusetts—a ghetto neighborhood outside of Boston. The film starts off with a written introduction, explaining that Charlestown has been home to more bank robbers than anywhere else in the United States. With a realistic and chilling first scene of robbing a bank, the film doesn't stop building itself up until the very end.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck plays a bank robber, and the leader of his particular gang. While robbing the bank in the beginning of the movie, they take the manager, a young lady, hostage and leaver her a few miles away. After one of the robbers realizes she lives right down the street from him, Affleck goes to intimidate her into keeping silent. However, when he talks to her, he finds himself falling in love. It sounds cliché—and it is—but this doesn't impede on the intense drama and action that Affleck has so wonderfully created.<br/><br/>The first robbery in the film has an extremely nightmarish feel to it. From the exaggerated angles to the Halloween masks the robbers wear, the scene oozes creepiness. The second robbery, which takes place about halfway through the film, has one of the most intense chase sequences ever to be put on the big screen. And the masterfully crafted climax keeps the audience at the edge of their seats. Affleck gets his suspenses just right: giving enough to induce stress, and supplying relief just at the right moment, unlike many action films that drag on far too long.<br/><br/>I have always admired Affleck as an actor. His portrayal of George Reeves in the under rated film Hollywoodland was one of the best of the decade. Now he is a sensitive man who lives in a harsh world. As his character gives a small glimpse into his childhood, there is a distinct melancholy that comes out in him, and lingers just under the surface for the whole film. The entire cast has a melancholy to them, highlighting the Irish roots of the town. It is a place of shattered dreams, ruined lives, and rag tag mobs. Jeremy Renner is wonderful as Affleck's best friend and fellow bank robber. He is a stereotypical low life: he drinks too much, he spends all of his money, and he is just a plain bad person. Yet, one cannot feel like Affleck's character and come to like the guy.<br/><br/>The love story remains predictable and rather boring until about halfway through the movie, and the side plot of Affleck's crack-whore ex girlfriend is a bit unnecessary, but they juxtapose the almost unpredictable and exciting outcomes of the final heist.<br/><br/>The film's tone helps tremendously in making it original and interesting, and Affleck's direction of the robbery scenes are the most suspenseful in years. With the blending of so many different ideas, and the originality of the film, it is near impossible to pin it down into any one genre, and it makes for great entertainment.<br/><br/>http://thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com"
"bob the moo","Null","0","1","1 May 2011"," Solid crime thriller that works even if significant aspects of it don't
","There was a lot of positive press for Ben Affleck's The Town when it came out in the UK - a lot of journalists keen to write pieces about how Affleck had grown up and matured into a gritty and responsible director etc etc. I was fine with this as I had been quite taken by Gone Baby Gone, but ultimately I was still coming to The Town as a fresh film. Based on the book Prince of Thieves, I understand that Affleck's first cut of the film was double the length of the released version and I can only assume that there must have been a lot of characterisation and the like in this longer version because, although some remains here, the film is a fairly straightforward affair of bank robbers being closed in on by the FBI while also planning ""one last big score"".<br/><br/>Although plot summaries and descriptions of the film focus on the side of the film that sees ""criminal with a heart of gold"" Doug starting a relationship with bank manager Claire (one of his victims and a possible witness), this doesn't actually make up as much of the film as I thought it would – the majority of it is tension between the main characters and of course the robbery action sequences. This is probably for the best because the ""relationship with witness"" aspect is probably the weakest and never really convinced me whenever the film relied upon it and the only time I really appreciated it was when it was a plot device or when it added to the film's main function as a thriller. This is a weakness to the film but yet it does still work because the thriller side to the film is solidly done and engaging for the most of the time.<br/><br/>The action sequences are well put together without ever making the viewer feel like they are watching a Hollywood action movie – they are noisy and overblown for sure, but they are done in such a way that you sort of accept them as being rather low-key and gritty (although this might be as much of a comment about Hollywood excess as it is about this film). These are the heart of the film but the foundation of it all is the creation of this part of Boston complete with characters with low aspirations, thick accents and attitudes handed down through generations. In this regard it works well and the cast mostly deliver on it. OK they are still very much playing ""types"" rather than characters but their performances are not limited by this necessarily. Affleck is solid in the lead, perhaps a little too sappy and unconvincing but he is still decent enough to do the job. Renner is better as he has none of this ""good guy at heart"" stuff to worry about, likewise Hamm is allowed to enjoy himself without worrying about the details too much. Hall relaxes as much as she can and focuses on having sufficient chemistry with Affleck to make her character work – she can't make it work but she does the best she can with it. Notable names in small supporting roles point either to deleted scenes or to the pull that Affleck has – Postlewaithe, Cooper, Garber and a few others are in there as it goes.<br/><br/>Overall The Town is a solidly enjoyable crime thriller with believable roots in Boston. Unfortunately not all aspects of it are as believable or as engaging because some of it just doesn't work particularly well and ultimately none of it matters as much as it would like to, but it does entertain on the way thanks to good performances, gritty presentation, solid action and an understanding of how the thriller works. Not as brilliant as some of the hype at the time would have you believe but still a decent crime thriller."
"birdieleigh","5","0","3","30 April 2011"," Well, give Affleck some points for trying.
","Quite simply, this was almost a great movie. It had a lot of potential. Not to say that The Town is a bad movie necessarily--it just doesn't live up to its hype.<br/><br/>It wasn't all terrible. The acting was superb, with the performances verging on brilliant. Renner really deserved his Oscar nomination. All of the characters were truly believable. Also, the cinematography was excellent. Visually, it was impressive.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the murky plot line that stole ideas from every other bank heist movie known to man made it nearly impossible to fully appreciate the characters. Not to mention that this movie was way, way too long, which didn't help me follow the plot at all. (I started getting bored enough to tally the f-bombs. There were over 200. I have no problem with profanity and I use it myself, but it's hard to take people seriously when they constantly use the f-word instead of adjectives and nouns) There was simply too much they were trying to fit into the movie. It seemed very ""busy."" They could have focused on one romantic relationship instead of the two and it would have been much easier to follow the heist part of the story.<br/><br/>On that note, I thought that Blake Lively's character (while surprisingly well-performed) was completely extraneous. Granted, she might have been really important and I missed it--but even then I could blame that on the length problem I mentioned earlier.<br/><br/>This was a movie I really, really, wanted to enjoy. It looked great and got rave reviews. But I couldn't help but feel disappointed by it. I didn't hate it, because I didn't really have a reason to. But I didn't love it either. I found it to be a mediocre, room-temperature drama that could have been amazing."
"d_art","9","0","1","1 April 2011"," 'The Town' is a complex, engrossing thriller
","Directed by Ben Affleck, based on the novel Prince of Thieves by Chuck Hogan, The Town takes place in Charlestown, Massachusetts. It is a heist/police thriller about four masked bank robbers--Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James ""Jem"" Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert ""Gloansy"" Magloan (Slaine), and Desmond ""Dez"" Elden (Owen Burke)--who wind up taking a hostage during a robbery--the bank manager, Claire (Rebecca Hall). They release her, blindfolded. Unsure whether Claire might somehow be able to finger them, Doug pays a visit to her (her not having seen him) and asks her out on a date, which turns into a romantic relationship. Meanwhile, FBI agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) is tailing the four suspects.<br/><br/>After seeing this film, as I was stepping out of the theater, an elderly man who just walked in, asked me, ""Was it good?"" I replied with my first two-word review: ""Very good."" He said, ""Okay!"" For some, that short-and-sweet review would suffice. For the rest, the following is my longer version.<br/><br/>If you have seen the trailer, it appears to be the standard Hollywood plot—the sympathetic villain falls in love with the hostage, betrays his own guys, and maybe end with an elaborate hail of gunfire, and so forth. It's the general plot line for films that involve professional killers—This Gun For Hire, The Killer, The Professional, Bittersweet Life, etc. Luckily, this film is more complex. In fact, the love story doesn't take that much of the center stage. The story looks more into the environment, the people, and the relationships that form a person. Advertisement<br/><br/>In terms of style, this film could be considered a close cousin of Heat and a second cousin of Point Break, but with more drama. The action scenes have an efficient coldness to it that makes it look realistic. As impressive as the action scenes are, this film is mainly character-driven. Ben Affleck's direction is top notch. The pacing is nearly flawless. The car chases through small alleyways of Boston is reminiscent of French Connection. The gun-fights are loud and gritty. The film has just enough small surprises and cleverness that makes it unique. The characters' back stories, their history, and the crime culture bring an extra bit of dimension. The dialogue is frequently witty and playful. I suppose it helps that the story was based on a novel. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck is understated and solid as Doug MacRay, the planner of the heists. While it is not an unusual role for Affleck playing the sympathetic one, he feels like a real person. His relationship with his jailbird father played by Chris Cooper adds an extra dimension. Particularly noteworthy is Jeremy Renner's intriguing performance, which invokes an unnerving unpredictability to the character of ""Jem,"" Doug's close friend and cohort. Renner's character is nearly the opposite of the soft-hearted hero he played in The Hurt Locker—here, he is creepy, erratic, and has no problem killing people off.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a character-driven, solid crime thriller with good direction from Ben Affleck. The performances are first rate and while the action is strong, the film's focus on human drama is what brings this film up a notch. I couldn't quite predict where the film was going. The pacing is good. It's been a while since I've seen an engrossing heist thriller like this one. It's good. Okay, very good. <br/><br/>You can find more updates of my movie reviews on http://twitter.com/d_art"

","This movie about a group of four young bank robbers in the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston (the town in question) has a lot of good things going for it, but ultimately it does not rise much above being just another heist movie. The leader of the pack is Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) who was essentially born into a life of crime. But when Doug shadows Claire, a potential witness to a robbery, he falls for her. The ""love conquers all"" theme then emerges as Doug can see his way to a better life with Claire. <br/><br/>The production values are high and the acting is more than good, with Rebecca Hall turning in a fine performance as Claire and Jeremy Renner playing a guy who is a walking danger zone. And there is a great cameo by Chris Cooper as Doug's father.<br/><br/>Given all the good things about this film it's too bad that they could not have been orchestrated into a more meaningful whole. I recognize the entertainment value of the movie, but the insane car chases and unbelievable shoot-outs torpedoed the affair for me--instead of heightening the tension, I found them distracting.<br/><br/>In these films where the robbers wear unusual masks and many other costumes, you might wonder if a couple of guys buying several ghoulish masks and some nun's habits might raise some red flags. And I should think that some banks might be interested in where Claire got that chunk of money to fund the ice rink for children."

","I'm writing this in part to refute the horribly negative comments from some of the other people who give reviews. I blame ignorance, because as it seems, more and more people whom write reviews try to pin every detail from one movie on another. The fact of the matter is, screenplays have been written for quite some time now, a completely original idea is almost impossible to find.<br/><br/>This is the same in technology, there are no new inventions anymore. Instead the world is completely ran on recycling that which was once good, and making it better. If you think of screenplays, or in the common era, cinematography, things don't seem as lackluster.<br/><br/>After that kind of boring introduction, let me first say good job Affleck. I must admit, after his role in the movie ""Gigli"" I swore to myself I'd never pay money to see his face again. However something about the trailer for ""The Town"" and having read ""The Prince of Thieves"", sparked my interest.<br/><br/>To people whom point at this movie and scream loopholes, I say where? In all honesty, you just pulled a heist against a bank, whom is the last person the police, and the victim would expect you to be around? The victim. It's a reverse psychology effect, especially when you are looking at life in prison for 4 other armed robberies. <br/><br/>To the people whom say this movie was just a cliché filled 2 hours, with a stolen plot, no character development, ingrained deeply in loopholes, I say think more deeply about the mindset that Doug McCray and his crew are going through. Everybody has to live for something, even if that something is bad. <br/><br/>I gave this movie an 8 out of 10. While a very thrilling, exciting, and quite twisting picture that unwinds in quite a reminiscent fashion as one of the most indisputably powerful films to every be written in the Shawshank Redemption, The Town simply did not leave me as moved. I assure you, I didn't expect it to, but to be mentioned positively, and to make one reminiscence of the masterpiece by Stephen King, Ben Affleck deserves respect. <br/><br/>The Town is definitely worth seeing, but when you see it, don't watch it from a 3rd person omniscient (all-knowing) mindset. Instead put yourself in the shoes of Doug McCray, even though the majority of people would say that they would never be in his position, if you were, what would you do? Pay attention to detail, the plot is very developed if you pay attention to it. While a review isn't much of a review if it is filled with empty rhetoric, and for that I apologize, but at the same time, these are the questions needed to be answered while watching a thriller film, with more than a just a pretty face. When the actual development of the characters is based on the thoughts of the audience, questions must be asked."

Too much of the usual chaos of robberies gone awry in some way. I found myself confused about the relationships with the ""bad guys"" who forced Affleck's character to do another job. Perhaps that was because I had trouble staying awake...which I don't necessarily blame on the movie. The acting was good, and I did admire Affleck's understatedness. Rebecca Hall did a good job as the bank manager. In fact, the trailer led me to believe (and hope) that more of the story would involve those two characters and the relationship twists inherent in their story. I think that was my biggest disappointment. Too much of the inevitable shoot-'em-up, the predictable FBI involvement. Too many innocents killed without any real character remorse -- which I would have hoped for given the depth of the characters portrayed. This movie obviously succeeded without my approval.

The story revolves as it shows Doug's life and his feelings towards Claire and also their other tasks( robbing o'course).<br/><br/>Ben Affleck, himself, as Doug Macray manages to pull off an excellent performance, so does Rebecca Hall as Claire. But the movie's stand-out performance belongs to Jeremy Renner and Jon Hamm as Jem Coughlin and FBI officer Frawley respectively. Jeremy Renner, ( after a superb performance in ""The Hurt Locker"") as the brutal and a little eccentric criminal, is fantastic. Very well deserved Best supporting Actor Academy Award nomination. Blake Lively as Jem's sister is sexy just as well as brilliant, and one have to mention Chris Cooper as Doug's father in only one scene, just great to watch.<br/><br/>Thumbs up for this one and highly recommended."

","What I liked best about this film is how it stuck with me. Thinking about it the night after I watched it and the next day, I kept testing its premises and events for credibility. It stood up to the scrutiny. I even had a long discussion with my wife, an attorney, about the plausibility of Doug's escape from Charlestown, to wit, is he a fugitive from the law or does he have a possibility of starting his life anew? <br/><br/>What we're talking about here is real suspension of disbelief. Ben Affleck deserves credit for directing a pretty good movie that more than surpasses the critical test of any book or film, namely does it get to its audience. Notably, he met this standard at least once previously with Hollywoodland. I still ponder just how Superman died based on the plot devices of this film. <br/><br/>A couple of picky criticisms: <br/><br/>1) The Town seemed to move a little slow for a heist movie, and one with three violent robberies and chase scenes, too. Every time I paused it to get up for a moment and looked at the On Demand slider, I found myself surprised that so little of the total length of the film had elapsed. <br/><br/>2) The dialog, presumably an attempt at provincial authenticity and possibly an homage by Mr Affleck to his native Boston, got in the way too often. The actors sometimes mumbled important verbal exchanges."
"KineticSeoul","7","0","3","13 February 2011"," Not good as ""Gone Baby Gone"" but still a solid movie
","This film is basically a heist movie with romantic elements in it. This movie proves once again that Ben Affleck has more potential of directing movies than acting in one, he plays the main character in this but he is alright. Although most of the movies he starred in sort of sucked, Ben has a bit of talent for directing. I also enjoyed his past movie ""Gone Baby Gone"" which he directed and I enjoyed watching this movie as well, although I liked ""Gone Baby Gone"" more better. Mainly because it just had a tighter script and more original compared to this movie. The movie basically takes place in a town that is known for breeding bank robbers, and some are forced into it. But during one of the bank robbery, Ben Affleck's character Doug MacRay and his crew take a girl hostage. And later ends up falling for her while trying to spy on her cause the crew lives close by where she lives and maybe a threat to them. Now this plays a part in the story but the whole film doesn't necessarily revolve around this scenario, which is a good thing. Jeremy Renner did a great job in this movie as the loose cannon style of criminal who is also part of the crew. Jon Hamm also did a fabulous job of playing the rough and tough FBI, who play hard since the criminals play hard. Blake Lively was just hot in this, her acting is alright and that is all I can say for her. This is a pretty solid movie, nothing really refreshing or original but the script is still pretty good and I liked the direction and style of it all. The acting is superb and the cinematography is pretty good and has a bit of the ""Heat"" and ""Mystic River"" vibe to it. Oh and the chase scenes and the shoot outs is just amazing to watch, there is some parts that seem to drag a bit but that is about it.<br/><br/>7.9/10"
"kenjha","6","0","5","12 February 2011"," Routine Crime Drama
","Four friends rob banks in a Boston suburb while the FBI is in pursuit. The plot is routine and mostly uninteresting. These guys keep robbing banks and armored cars as if they have no money. It is not clear why they keep taking risks rather than living comfortably with the loot they have accumulated. Afleck seems mostly preoccupied with getting the Boston accent down, with the result being a monotonous performance. Hamm does his acting through his stubble. Renner comes off best, playing Afleck's hot-tempered buddy. It's illogical that Afleck would become romantically involved with a woman that he held hostage. The action scenes feel stale and drawn out."
"katephillips28","6","0","3","12 February 2011"," Hit and miss
","I watched The Town at least a month ago and I have only now (after a second viewing) made up my mind as to what I thought about it. I think I felt confused by all the outrage that poured out from the general public when it was not nominated for an Oscar, while people were blasting the academy for ignoring it I was thinking did I watch the same movie that you guys watched? That is not to say I didn't like The Town, I did, but I don't understand the why people think it is up there with movies such as Black Swan, The kings Speech and The fighter.<br/><br/>The Town gets a lot right. It looks amazing and I think that Ben Affleck has done an incredible job directing this movie, and coming from me that means something because I don't really like him that much. He nailed the gritty, corrupted, underground world of criminals pretty darn well, and some of the filming is simply beautiful. The action and chase sequences are top draw, they are probably the best part of the movie and they have put The Town up there with the best action movies of last year.<br/><br/>The acting is generally good, Affleck is OK, I have never really seen a strong performance for him and that opinion of him still has not changed, but for me what he lacks in acting skills he makes up for in directing talent. Again Rebecca Hall was alright, it was not a commanding performance but also nothing to be ashamed of. If I am honest I do not think she was given enough to work with and it all felt a little restrained.<br/><br/>The stand out actors in The Town are the supporting cast. Jon Hamm is perfect as the determined FBI agent. Blake Lively is a revelation in this, I have only known her as one of the annoying girls in Gossip girl, but in this she shows promise. Her portrayal of a drug addict and desperate mother was one of the stand outs in this film.<br/><br/>The real star of this movie though (unsurprisingly) is Jeremy Renner, his performance is enough to make you sit on the edge of your seat. You never know what James could do, he seems controlled and loyal to his friends and family, but underneath all that is a monster wanting to be set free. Watching him battle with the worse sides of himself is truly brilliant. Renner is deserving of his Oscar nomination although maybe not the win.<br/><br/>But for every great performance and car chase in this film there is still something wrong with it all. The movie concentrates on the romance between Doug and Claire, which feels a bit empty. I get the feeling that this romance was not what the film was really about, the story here was the friendship between Doug and James, but it is not really looked at in detail which is a shame because if it was it could of made the different to the academy, in my opinion at least Also, I feel like nothing is given enough time or explanation and this made me not care about the characters as much as I should have.<br/><br/>I feel almost sad that the town did not fulfil the potential it had, I mean it was there and the bits that were good were amazing, but it was never enough. The Town kind of just floats along showing you glimpses of brilliance but never really giving you the goods."
"sammie_sambal","6","0","3","31 January 2011"," A disappointment
","Like the title already says, i was disappointed with 'The Town'. I expected more. No wait, i expected better.<br/><br/>To keep it short, i liked the action and chase sequences, they are excellent, and also the whole idea of Charlestown being a rat's nest of bank-robbers since the early nineteenth century, i liked that little fact , but what i didn't like was the dodgy plot and the obvious non-believable crush between Ben's character and that of the 'victim'. I mean come on, he looks like he's a troublemaker and she's kind of the sweet shy girl and after one lame and short conversation at a laundrette they are totally in to each other. It didn't feel 'real' and it was just awkward at times. But hey, that's what you get when you put Ben Affleck and a love story together.<br/><br/>So in the end i had kind of a mixed feeling with this movie. I wanted to like it because of the whole theme and the car chases with the shoot-outs but i was held back by a plot that just didn't feel right.<br/><br/>It's unbelievable too that so many people praise it with 9's and 10's, as if they've never seen Heat or any other proper 'heist' movie."

","Town, The (2010)<br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Affleck's second stint as director is a well-made but somewhat flawed crime picture set in Charlestown, MA, which we're told has the highest amount of robberies. Affleck plays Doug MacRay, the leader of a group of thieves who must follow the bank manager (Rebecca Hall) who they just previously robbed. MacRay must find out how she's handling the robbery in the aftermath and soon the two begin to fall in love, although she doesn't know who he is. This here sets forward a wide range of events, which aren't going to sit well with MacRay's crew, the FBI agent (Jon Hamm) following them or the crime boss (Pete Postlethwaite) who oversees everything. THE TOWN isn't nearly as effective as Affleck's previous film GONE BABY GONE and perhaps that's because this was released by a major studio as a blockbuster film. Whenever you release something with a higher budget then you must try and give a large group of people what they wanted. I won't spoil anything in GONE BABY GONE but thing would never have played out like they did had the budget been double and the studio was trying to push a blockbuster. THE TOWN is a very effective movie and it appears Affleck and crew want to really dig deep into families that continue in crime but in the end it starts to pull some punches and we're left with a good looking but entertaining crime picture. The ending has thousands of rounds of ammunition fired, several people killed and of course a lot of other action. I just couldn't help but feel that this was against everything that had led up to this point because there are several characters and subplots that briefly get mentioned and then are forgotten about. This includes a scene where Affleck goes to see his father (Christ Cooper) in prison. There's stuff with Affleck and his best friend and partner in crime (Jeremy Renner), which seems to have a lot of stuff that goes unexplored. Perhaps the longer Director's Cut will contain some more of this stuff. With that said, this picture looks extremely good as the action is held together very well by Affleck and he turns in a strong performance as well. Hall and Hamm are also very impressive in their roles and it's always great seeing Cooper and Postlethwaite even when they don't appear for very long. Renner easily steals the film as the rather cracked out and overly violent partner. Anyone familiar with crime pictures are going to find a lot of the material here familiar. I think what makes the film stand apart are the brief examples of it trying to connect the violence being passed down from father to son. Again, hopefully more of this is explored in the longer cut of the film but this theatrical cut is still worthy of being watched even if it doesn't reach perfection."

","Ben Affleck directs his second film after Gone Baby Gone. The Town is a thriller surrounding a group of robbers, a bank teller, and the FBI agent out to capture the bank robbers. At a laundromat following the most recent bank robbery, Affleck's character falls in love with the employee who they took hostage, played by Rebecca Hall. His accomplice, played by Jeremy Renner, immediately lashes out at him. With his accomplices, former girlfriend (played by Blake Lively), and his disguised-as-florist boss all confronting him, he must make the decision to either leave with Hall or continue his life of crime. The first hour of this film is stunning and phenomenal. The characters pull you into their minds, and you feel as if you are one of the characters in each scene. Every member of the cast delivers a solid-to-exceptional performance. Affleck, Hall, Renner, and Lively are particularly breathtaking, but it's the third of the quartet who deserves an Oscar nomination. Renner infuses the viewer with fear, pity, and so many other emotions. However, the second half of the film feels less authentic. The plausibility of the film takes somewhat of a nose dive, with the story struggling to deliver more character nuances and plot development. As a result, the ending underwhelms especially in comparison to the rest of the film. For what it's worth, The Town is one of the best films of the year and the best thriller of 2010."

","Another Oscar contender is Ben Affleck's The Town. Affleck directed the film ""Gone Baby Gone"" years ago. I liked the movie, but didn't love it. I liked the message. The Town is sure to get nominations. It's not a great film, but its a really good one. And probably one of the years best.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck gives a good performance as a bank robber. Him, and his crew(including Jeremy Renner, who is his best friend) rob a bank which traumatizes the manager(played by the wonderful Rebecca Hall) Affleck feels guilt. He's trying to get out of this business, but can't. So, he pursues Hall as sort of a mole. Hall is talking to the F.B.I.<br/><br/>The Town has more to the story plot. But i've given you enough. The Town has great acting. From Affleck, Renner, Hall, Jon Hamm as the main cop, and surprisingly Blake Lively as Renner's skanky sister, who dated Affleck.<br/><br/>The story plot has a heart. So does Hall. Rebecca Hall is a talented actress, and gives the best performance here. She is the heart of The Town. The plot is unique for this sort of movie. It's mulitilayered, and has a lot going on. For a bank robbing movie that is.<br/><br/>I liked Affleck's character here. He's a bad guy, but he doesn't exactly want to be. Sure, we've seen this before. But he cares about Hall's character. Which I liked. I found this movie to be entertaining. It's filled with some spectacular action sequences.<br/><br/>I think it may be one of the years best. It's not quite Inception material. But it's still a very good film. I admired it. I admired that it's not just a soulless bank robbing movie, but a bank robbing movie with a soul. I recommend you see it before it's too late.

","Well, as there is a lot of money in this movie, the atmosphere is good, the actors are quite good, the sound, the colors and the camera work are good, but the most important thing on a movie like that, a story that seems real and close to life, to make the movie authentic and absorbing, is yet again destroyed by the needs of the average viewer of the big budget movies of our time. Or if the script would at least be somewhat creative. No, that one even less. Seriously, the story did hurt my brain from time to time. A love story? One coincident after another? Again: A love story??? ... Tip: Similar experience, waaaaay better Regie, Music and Script: Badlands(1973). Just as a tip for all you out there that are poisened by Hollywood and think that ""The Town"" is a really good movie. It isn't. It's entertaining, because the thrill and the action are OK, the feeling of the police thread for the bank rubbers is also good (by far the best part), but its far from being a really good movie entirely, mostly because the people in the movie are constantly doing things that seem absurd."
"bob_meg","9","0","1","13 January 2011"," Now THAT's how you make a cops n robbers flick folks!
","I was one of the very few people disappointed by ""The Departed."" Being in the Boston area, folks here can spot fake accents a mile away, and on top of that annoying gaffe, much of the movie seemed too stylized and hyperbolized for its own good. It was Cops n Robbers as HIGH DRAMA, a film that tried to achieve the operatic tone and scale of The Godfather but just wound up feeling cheap in the end.<br/><br/>It needed the gritty, unadorned performances and look that director/actor Ben Affleck has somehow managed to score in spades with ""The Town."" Much of the film's punch rides on the performances: Affleck has never been less self-absorbed and never more absorbed in his character, a master bank robber whose increasing self-disgust finally finds a well-needed escape valve in the form of pretty bank manager Rebecca Hall. Now if only he hadn't taken her hostage in his last job....<br/><br/>Perhaps even more powerful are the drop-dead notes struck by Jeremy Renner, as Affleck's hard-case brother, Pete Postelthwaite as a dirt-bag local numbers runner, and Chris Cooper in a died-in-the-wool performance that is chilling for its brief on screen time. Even Jon Hamm knocks it out of the park as a G-man whose hatred for Affleck's crew courses through his body like motor oil through a piston. Seriously, Affleck is getting to be the Clint Eastwood or Robert Redford of Actor's Equity --- one phone call from him and the A Team shows up at his doorstep. It's all good.<br/><br/>What makes ""The Town"" most memorable though, are its action sequences, masterfully shot by Robert Elswitt. Make no mistake, shooting a car chase in Cambridge is about as easy as parking your car there in daylight hours, only a tad more deadly. It's not photographed showily, just effectively, and you can say that about almost every other element of this film.<br/><br/>It's a throw-back to when Heist movies were about the basics --- simple, violent realism. And that was enough. It hearkens back to the days of Cagney and Bogart, instead of Nicholson and Walhberg."

","A lot of people give Ben Affleck a lot of hate for his work. For his acting, it is totally justified, but for his directing it is quite the opposite. I went in seeing The Town expecting a not so great film because I have not seen too many Ben Affleck features. However, I still gave the movie a chance.<br/><br/>To my surprise, I liked it. The cast is pretty stellar with the likes of Rebecca Hall, Jon Hamm, Jeremy Renner, and Affleck himself. The two worlds of good and bad are depicted clearly, as Affleck rides the fence separating the two. But also to my surprise, Pete Postlethwaite has a medium-sized role as the twisted flower shop owner which in itself blew me away. He shows so much frailty yet summons so much intimidation with a single look. Absolutely fantastic.<br/><br/>Toward the end a memorable action seen ensues to finish the movie off with a bang.<br/><br/>I have no idea what anybody else was saying when the said Ben Affleck couldn't write nor direct.<br/><br/>Rest in Peace Mr. Postlethwaite.

","""So I came here, and I put him in the f*cking ground. Did nine years for it. Now, you don't gotta thank me...but you're not walking away.""<br/><br/>The Town is a heist thriller in the vein of Heat, in the sense that the movie is more about the personal lives of the criminals, and not the heists, themselves. There's plenty of action and conflict, but describing it as only an action movie would be overlooking a lot of The Town's depth. <br/><br/>This is another solid directing job by Ben Affleck, even though I didn't enjoy it quite as much as Gone, Baby, Gone. It's set in the streets of the various Boston neighborhoods that he knows best, and there's an unmistakable authenticity to the settings and characters.<br/><br/>What could have been a fairly typical cat and mouse tale between cops and robbers is elevated by the excellent cast, that includes a fine performance from Affleck himself, as well as Rebecca Hall, Jon Hamm, Jeremy Renner, and others. Interactions between the characters ring true, and their relationships feel complex and genuine as they push the story forward. <br/><br/>I didn't find any particular aspect of The Town to be spectacular, but it's consistently solid and entertaining, as a whole. It's good to see Ben Affleck continuing the career resurgence that he's had in the last few years."
"glawlor","9","0","1","9 January 2011"," A bank robber tries to change his ways and start anew.
","Overall The Town was an excellent movie. It was relatively fast paced (necessary for heist films) but still had a strong plot. The movie takes place in Charlestown, right outside of Boston, which is a place notorious for bank robbing. The main character Dough Macray (Ben Affleck) is a failed pro hockey player who returned home and entered the family business of bank robbing. During the first robbery they take the bank manager hostage with whom Doug later becomes romantically involved with. His relationship with Claire (Rebecca Hall), encourages him to leave Charlestown and change for the better. Unfortunately, the other characters do not take this very well; Especially James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), who is practically his brother. The rest of the movie deals with the difficulties and consequences of committing crimes and trying to escape from the criminal underworld of Charlestown.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is fairly strong because of its famous cast. Doug and Claire's relationship is somewhat strange. Whether this is due to Affleck and Hall's acting or it was intended the relationship was awkward. Affleck's acting is strong in the portrayal of a hardened criminal with a softer side. The fact that he directed the movie probably helped him because he was able to portray the character exactly the way that he wanted. Renner's acting as Doug's best friend Jim is excellent. His character is deranged and extremely violent and was able to play that role very well. His acting was arguably the best in the film. Jim's sister, Krista (Blake Lively), is Doug's trashy ex-girlfriend who claims that her child is his. This role for Lively is different from other role's that we've seen her play. Her character Krista and brother Jim create a good example of what Doug wants to leave behind. Finally, Jon Hamm played a determined FBI special agent named Adam Frawley. Although he is on the side of the law, the movie makes you dislike him for trying to make Doug pay for his actions. The Town is a must see for anyone who enjoys thrillers or organized crime movies."
"estebangonzalez10","10","0","1","8 January 2011"," Affleck is now two for two as a director
","¨I will see you; this side or the other. ¨ Many critics thought that Ben Affleck's successful directorial debut in Gone Baby Gone could have to do with beginners luck, but he proved them otherwise with The Town because he has made one of the best films of the year once again. He has managed to go two for two now and is beginning to prove he may have a better career as a director than an actor. Affleck has brought us one of the best crime thrillers of the decade; I was completely hooked from the very beginning with the heist and chase scenes as well as with the characters. The movie has several tense scenes that will have you at the edge of your seat, and at the same time very well developed characters with good dialogues thanks to a smart script adapted by Affleck himself and a good performance from the entire cast. The screenplay was adapted from Chuck Hogan's novel ¨Prince of Thieves¨ and besides Affleck, Aaron Stockard and Peter Craig collaborated with the adaptation. The screenplay was very well adapted although it differs from the novel in the ending. Affleck also stars in this film and he does a pretty good job, but who really steals the show is Jeremy Renner as the secondary character. The rest of the cast also have an above average performance: Blake Lively, Jon Hamm, Rebecca Hall, and the late Pete Postlethwaite all give very memorable performances thanks to the solid material they had to work with. Affleck seems to bring the best out of each actor as a director and he has proved he has a very promising career ahead of himself if he continues at this pace.<br/><br/>As in Affleck's other film the story takes place once again in Boston. Charlestown is a neighborhood known for producing the most blue collar bank robbers in the world. Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine), and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) have all grown up together in Charlestown and are no exception to the rule. Together they have managed to pull off a series of armored vehicles and bank robberies throughout Boston under Doug's leadership. They receive tips from a florist owner known as Fergie (Pete Postlethwaite) who has controlled the neighborhood for years. During their latest bank robbery things go wrong and they are forced to take the bank manager, Claire (Rebecca Hall) hostage before letting her go unharmed once they have escaped. Things begin to get complicated once James realizes that Claire lives in their same neighborhood and fears she might have seen something. Doug decides to follow her around to make sure she doesn't suspect anything and in doing so they begin to develop a friendship. James would much rather get rid of her because he doesn't want to risk their cover, but Doug has fallen for her and wants to change his life around. Doug will soon discover that getting out of a life of crime will be more difficult than he ever could have imagined. Doug's other concern is that the FBI is close on their tail and they are receiving a lot of heat from S.A. Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) and his partner Dino (Titus Welliver).<br/><br/>The Town is a very tense and gripping movie that manages to balance well crafted suspenseful crime scenes with well developed characters and a good script that adds some emotional drama to the action sequences. It is hard to avoid comparisons between this movie and Michael Mann's Heat since every successful crime film can be compared to that one, the best of its genre. Ben Affleck is turning into a great director and is perhaps doing something similar for Boston to what Woody Allen and Spike Lee do for New York. There is no denying Affleck also has talent as a screenwriter since he won an Oscar for his work with Matt Damon in Good Will Hunting, and Gone Baby Gone was also a really good adaptation. Crime thrillers are one of my favorite genres in film and it has been awhile since I have enjoyed one as much as I did with The Town. It has great action scenes that feel real and interesting characters. Jeremy Renner is really on a hot streak following up on his Oscar nominated performance for The Hurt Locker. In this movie he is once again the highlight of the film. Blake Lively also gave a terrific performance as an alcoholic and drug addict mother from Charlestown who has a casual relationship with Doug. Her Boston accent was right on the mark. The entire cast was great in this film. I really enjoyed this film and consider it to be one of the best of 2010 along with Inception.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

Now we need another with you and Matt!"
"witster18","7","0","1","29 December 2010"," Solid Entertainment. Some unbelievable and predictable moments, but still solid entertainment.
","The Town is about a group of friends from a Boston neighborhood that have evolved into a smash-n-bang robbery crew similar to what we saw in 'Point Break', only this crew is more polished both on the job as robbers, and actors.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck gives another strong performance. That makes two really good performances in 'State of Play' and 'The Town'. What we're seeing before our very eyes is a pretty boy action star turning into a solid actor. The days of small roles, and funny one-liners to support his bigger, more accomplished co-stars, are OVER.<br/><br/>It was far more action packed than I was expecting. 'The Town' is a fast-paced action/drama that is often predictable, and at times unbelievable, but the acting and some of the subplots add to this story and keep the viewer involved throughout.<br/><br/>There were a few nice little tie-ins from early in the film that added to some of the action and dramatic moments. It's just another one of those 'realistic settings and characters involved in unrealistic actions with a little too much going on' type of movies. The kind that you enjoy watching once, but probably won't revisit until there's nothing else on TV that's any better. I think of Pride and Glory, Mystic River, We Own The Night, Dead Presidents, and movies of that guild. This selection has many of the same strengths AND weaknesses that you'll find in those films, but in the end, the clear stand out here is Affleck, and the chains that hold his character back. He breaks those chains, and it's kind of symbolic here as he's obviously breaking into the big-time as a serious, more than capable lead.<br/><br/>I almost wish they had gone the 3 hour route with this one because some of the characters are under-developed as the film concentrates on the love story, and leaves those characters by the wayside. Spending more time in that area and in the ending may have brought this to the 8-9 level. Mild spoiler alert - when the first one of Ben's friends gets shot, or when Ben kicks his ex out of his apartment, we just simply don't care because we don't know enough about those characters. The one exception is Jeremy Renner - who is fantastic in a supporting role.<br/><br/>Good movie, not great. Recommended for at least one viewing.<br/><br/>73/100<br/><br/>You'll like it if you like: Dead Presidents, State of Grace, Dark Blue, We Own the Night, and Serpico."

","This is Ben Affleck's sophomore film as a director, unlike its predecessor GONE BABY GONE (2007), this time he also takes the leading role. Generally speaking, I think Ben is on his way to become next Clint Eastwood and could be more appropriate as a director than an actor although he delivers a quite convincing performance most of the time, nevertheless, in a much more encouraging extent, this film delightedly proves that Ben Affleck is competent as a more versatile director. <br/><br/>The heist story can not be a novelty, the whole return of a prodigal son is a mere platitude, to my surprise I do enjoy the entire process although 150 minutes is a tad too long (I saw the DVD extended cut), the film has yet achieved a sparkling success on the box office, ($91,947,016, North American alone, which is a prodigious leap from GONE BABY GONE $20,300,218). <br/><br/>The shining star of the film is Jeremy Renner, given the fact that his role is a stereotyped bandit, but his portrayal endows his character a very intense collision against others (especially in a positive way to steal the thunder of poor Ben); Rebecca Hall again solidifies her status as the best among her peers, the sparks between her and Ben are adorable and make everything unbelievably convincing. Blake Lively also contributes her dramatic turn as a low-class prostitute with a baby girl; by contrast, Ben's acting is not worth mentioning. <br/><br/>The film is well-done from all aspects (particularly the cinematography and the rapid but precise editing), my only complain is that there is nothing new or ideographic from the genre, good luck on the Oscars next year!"

","It's true Ben Affleck has been in some rather bad movies(cough ""Reindeer Games"") but really his record is definitely over .500 from ""Good Will Hunting"" to ""The Sum of All Fears"" and the underrated ""Changing Lanes"". He's been the butt of a lot of jokes but when it comes to his directorial debut ""Gone Baby Gone"" and this one ""The Town"" no ones laughing. The one thing that shocked me was the real suspense I felt during the movie. One thing directors are doing now that is ruining this is making the audience omniscient. Giving us all the views so we know whats coming around every corner. Here we're left in the dark to guess what's going on just as the characters are wondering what's going on.<br/><br/>A movie like this rely's heavily on the actors and some you'll recognize from ""Gone Baby Gone"". Jeremy Renner who most of you will remember from last year's ""Hurt Locker"" however is your looking for a reprise of that role stop and look for something else. Here he's playing a thug and thief and he does it masterfully. The rest of MacRay's crew is effective in there roles from Slaine as the driver to Blake Lively as Coughlin's drugged out sister with a daughter and no idea who the father is. Also Jon Hamm as the F.B.I. agent Frawley is good even though he seems like the villain in all this you have to remember the heroes of this movie are criminals, that is all I'll say on that subject.<br/><br/>One side note that I've been finding more and more interesting lately is that when people walk out a theatre playing a movie like this there is always one or two people saying ""they didn't need all that bad language"" my first thought is, well when your in a shoot out or running from the cops your not thinking ""oh shoot I really hope I get away"". So be warned if language or violence offends you stay clear of this one or really any crime movie of this sort.<br/><br/>If your still reading then this is your sort of movie and you will not be disappointed I enjoyed every minute of it and was actually on the edge of my seat for part of it. I try to while until I write a review on any movie so I'm not still in awe of the initial viewing. So as I have viewed ""The Town"" again I'm reminded how much I was enjoyed this movie and how it will probably rank up with the greats like ""Heat"".<br/><br/>I'm actually excited to see what Ben Affleck does next, whereas some could argue ""Gone Baby Gone"" was a fluke, I can't see anyone saying it now after this one."
"BenAordure","8","0","1","25 December 2010"," Pretty good job
","The film starts with a bank robbery. Classic. But already you appreciate the realism. Characters go fast, are professionals and are here to take the money, not to show off, they get nervous because someone alerted the police despite all the precautions they took. So comes the story that I don't intend to spoil, so I won't go further.<br/><br/>The film's story won't surprise you a lot anyway. As one of the criticizers say, it is a tentative of imitating ""Heat"" , ""Point Break"" and ""L.A. Takedown"". And this is absolutely right as the film clearly refers itself to ""Heat"" as one of the heros watches the film on TV :) <br/><br/>That said, this would be an error to reduce it to a bad mix-copy of those films. For me, this film achieves to take the value of them and render a pretty good job.<br/><br/>The film doesn't plunge into the easiness of ""grand spectacle"" with multi explosions, unrealistic stunt hot-pursuits or karate fights ... No, here, everything looks real. Even the photo shots of the city. The heros are not genius and just prepare their scores well.<br/><br/>This links the film directly to ""Heat"" . It doesn't reach the perfection of Mann's directoring in dialogs, musics and, how to say, the ""dark atmosphere"". But there are some really good inspired aspects of it. And in exchange we got some nice feelings of Boston and its atmosphere.<br/><br/>We also appreciate the way the film shows how the heros are bounded to their own destiny, even when they manage to take distance with it. Contrary to ""Heat"", it is even documenting here. We actually ""understand"" people's mind of Charlestown and their no-vision lifes. <br/><br/>The film ends on a good last scene. So, no deception.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner is perfect here. Blake Lively really convincing. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck is OK but less convincing as a tight guy from Charlestown. But as a director, Ben Affleck does score this time."

","A well done action heist film. Kind of reminded me of Heat though is not of the same caliber or as ""deep"" (if my memory serves me well).<br/><br/>Renner is scary in his role. One of those performances that gets you tense for what he might do at any moment. Affleck plays a very stoic criminal mind. I got a kick out of the business place of the ""boss"".<br/><br/>If you want to see a movie with complex heists, and typical but good tough guy performances this should do well for you. Not the most original but entertaining and well done. How many movies really are original? Very few. The differences are in the little pockets within the movie where they do things you've seen before but you still enjoy watching how they get there.<br/><br/>Definitely renews my interest in Ben Affleck outside of comedy. I just remembered he did Gone Baby Gone. That was impressive too. Maybe I need to catch up..."
"runamokprods","7","0","1","23 December 2010"," Familiar, but very well done
","A strong, fun and very well detailed crime thriller, but not nearly as subtle or emotionally and morally complex as Affleck's earlier 'Gone Baby Gone'. There's a lot of cliché's here, especially in the third act; car chases, huge over-the-top .shootouts which, while well handled, make this feel much more like a familiar Hollywood movie. Also, some of the supporting characters fall into 'types' we've seen so many times before, something 'Gone Baby Gone' generally avoided very well, despite being a hard boiled detective thriller, hardly an under-done genre. Indeed, a lot of this film, including the main plot itself treads familiar water, but it does it with enough grown up intelligence, good acting, and specificity to let us get caught up anyway. And at least, by the end a few of the 'obvious' set ups, have led us somewhere different than the standard Hollywood treatment would lead us to expect. <br/><br/>I just hope Affleck, an obviously extremely talented film-maker, returns to the kind of thematically richer and more original material he mined in his first film."

","I heard a lot of great things about The Town, both from friends and critics here on IMDb and so I had great expectations for this one when I popped the DVD in. I wasn't entirely let down, but wondered why I found myself forgetting the film right after wards. I didn't want to discuss it right away, it wasn't boring, but still felt like something was missing. But, the film isn't entirely forgettable because I am after all; writing a review on it.<br/><br/>Reasons why the film has it's merits, is in the action, and script. Affleck sure knows how to put together a story. He's a proved script writer with his gold statue and it's his strong point. His directing and acting however, could use work. I would have liked him to cast someone else in the lead role. He can do well in a supporting job, but never once did he steal a scene. And it's not because He's a bad actor. It's because he isn't convincing as a villain, there's just something angelic about him. In my opinion, he was miscast in this film, he should have cast someone else. When the lead actor doesn't fit or act his way into the role written for the character, the good script could wind up being meaningless. It's hard to find the energy to direct and jump into scenes, and it showed here. Ben was just lacking energy I thought. Luckily, the supporting cast was excellent, especially the ""Wild man"" Jeremy Renner. He put a lot of energy into his role. I also loved the job Blake Lively did, she has just gained a fan. Everyone else also did a decent job, but nothing that sticks with you.<br/><br/>The directing was OK, found myself wondering why there were some scenes in the film, and why the timing of some scenes also appeared off. This is no directorial masterpiece by far. But once again, this negative is off set by the great cinematography, in which I loved.<br/><br/>Oh, and the action. This should have been an action movie, and less of a character drama. It would have been better off if Ben wrote it that way, but nonetheless, worth a watch. It is an old school action film which is refreshing, but in this high tech time we live in, old school films should have more of an emotional impact like ""State Of Grace"" That film is a classic, not sure if The Town compares to it. Or even ""The Departed"" for that matter. Nevertheless, a solid rating because I just think it still belongs along those 2 films in the same breath at least."

","Critics have slammed Ben Affleck in recent times, but their criticism is sorely misplaced when it comes to Affleck's latest blockbuster - The Town. Fresh off the success of his last venture, he has starred in and directed a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The Town is the story of Charlestown. A low-income neighborhood in Boston. The people coming out of this blue-collar town have rap-sheets stretching way back. But these gangsters and bank robbers are as savvy as they are violent.<br/><br/>The Town is a great movie, but doesn't really bring anything new to the table. Not that it has to, by the way. It's a movie that casual movie goers will enjoy, especially with its traditional ending. However, it's ability to capture your attention (and emotions) from the intro of the film all the way to the end deserves to be acknowledged. It has pretty good dialogue between the characters, but it's the bold performances that will stand out. The Town is definitely worth visiting."

","Doug (Affleck) and his gang rob banks and armored cars in the town of Charlestown just outside Boston, MA. They are efficient and leave no clues for the police. All is good until Doug falls for Claire (Hall), one of the hostages on one of the jobs. <br/><br/>The only bit of truth in this film is that Charlestown has the reputation of having its banks robbed more than any other town in the country. Some say it's a family tradition handed down. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck directed this movie, and maybe he has found his true calling as he did an excellent job. Hey, we might have another Clint Eastwood on our hands. Who knew?<br/><br/>With any movie where the setting is in the Boston area, one can expect to hear the Boston accent, but here you hear it and not hear it as sometimes the characters forget to use it. Kind of funny. Why bother in the first place? The audience really doesn't care about accents. Well, unless they are over the top.<br/><br/>This was better than I expected. The pace was good and there was the suspense needed for this type of story. The acting was first rate by all, and the stunts were kind of amazing. No CGI, just actual police car chases which were right on. I couldn't help but notice how narrow the streets of Charlestown are. Charlestown was used as the filming location. <br/><br/>Violence: Yes.

","Ben Affleck's 'The Town' is indeed a Damn Good Film. It's gripping, superbly directed, greatly acted & wonderfully photographed. Ben Affleck indeed has come out with a winner! <br/><br/>'The Town' is more of a complicated love-story. It's really not a story of a few robbers, nor about a man trying to clean up his deeds. It's a complicated love-story, where there so many obstacles around it. Ben Affleck goes into the zone of 'The Town' and makes sure he makes a memorable fare.<br/><br/>About a 124 minutes, the film never really loses you. The only moment when the screenplay gets a bit boring is in the middle, but makes up for it with a dramatic and captivating climax. Affleck rocks as a Storyteller, no doubts! He's made a fine film... and in each frame there is a visible stamp of the filmmaker. Bravo! A Special Mention to Robert Elswit, who has photographed the film with flourish.<br/><br/>In the acting department, Affleck, as an actor, also is in top form. One can easily state this performance amongst his best efforts. Jon Hamm is so natural in his part. Rebecca Hall is excellent. Blake Lively leaves a mark. Ditto for Chris Cooper. But the show truly belongs to Pete Postlethwaite & Jeremy Renner, who play their parts with unmatchable ease.<br/><br/>On the whole, visit this 'Town'... despite the violence around it.

","After Gone Baby Gone, Ben Affleck comes again with another film, and with only two films under his belt, he proves he has great talent behind (and in front) of the camera.<br/><br/>I have never really had respect for Affleck as an actor, but I realize that the reason is probably because of the films he comes out in, not because of his actual acting ability. I knew he made a very good film in 2007, but here he made a great one. He is able to direct this story magnificently well, and also direct himself and the entire ensemble cast, which is full of great performances, most notably Renner and Affleck himself. The film has great writing, directing, acting, and is very tense and entertaining, and also has characters you are able to invest in. It reminds me of 2006's The Departed.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a great film, and I do not really have any criticisms. I am very much looking forward to more of Affleck's directorial works, and The Town is as of now one of the best films of the year."
"dvc5159","7","0","1","12 December 2010"," The return of Ben Affleck
","""Gigli"". ""Pearl Harbor"". ""Daredevil"".<br/><br/>These are the films which have plagued Ben Affleck's career as soon as he and his buddy Matt Damon won an Oscar for ""Good Will Hunting"". Having a share fair of hits and stinkers, Affleck suddenly disappeared from the limelight, having only a minor but acclaimed supporting role in 2006's ""Hollywoodland"". More than a year later Affleck returned to the public's eye with ""Gone Baby Gone"", but as the director rather than the star. It shocked everyone, particularly cynics such as myself, because the movie was great in its own right. Was this a fluke or is the ""real"" Ben Affleck coming, we cynics say to ourselves.<br/><br/>Well, ""The Town"" proves that Ben Affleck is not only back, he's at the top of his game.<br/><br/>At it's heart, ""The Town"" is a simple crime drama/thriller about a group of bank robbers, most particularly their leader, and how he let his human side potentially endanger the rest of his crew, in the small town of Charlestown, Boston. It's a story that we've seen and/or heard one too many times before, and one can already guess the ending of the story.<br/><br/>Having said that, a story, no matter how similar or different it is, is worth telling. And ""The Town""'s screenplay is written in a careful and constructed way that we get to know more about our bank robber leader and why he is the central character of the story. Using this method we sympathize with him and we root for his character to get out of the mess he's in. This is not original, I have to admit. But his character, and others as well as the entire screenplay, is written in a realistic and believable fashion, as well as giving it a nice Boston touch to it, firmly placing you in the streets of Charlestown. It is clear that the script is a love letter to Boston, as all the dialects and the people are put into account, and they are written well.<br/><br/>Before I get to Affleck, I'll start out with the supporting actors - particularly Jeremy Renner as a trigger happy but not-so-psychotic robber. Renner delivers a great performance and shows the versatility that this man can bring to a character after the calm yet cocky performance in last year's Best Picture ""The Hurt Locker"". Rebecca Hall is the love interest but she shows strong vulnerability as a victim always should, so her performance is realistic. Jon Hamm plays an FBI agent bent on catching the crooks - here he is slimy and manipulative - but determined non-the-less. Blake Lively from ""Gossip Girl"" really surprised me with her acting talents, greatly show a desperate and ruined woman after playing a glamorous character in that TV show. The rest of the supporting actors do their roles with justice, including Chris Cooper and Pete Postlethwaite. All of the performances are focused, realistic, and believable.<br/><br/>Roger Elswit photographs the film beautifully, showing the Bostonian locations in their splendor while also giving a touch of grit to the intense scenes. The camera work is flawless with very little touches of shaky cam, adding a sense of urgency yet spectacle to the action. The editing is also crisp, the film cuts to many moments at the right moments and it isn't quick enough for incoherence like so many MTV music videos, it's just right. As for the production design Boston has rarely looked this great, you can say that this film is a love letter to Charlestown and Boston in particular. The music by Harry Gregson- Williams and David Buckley are suitable for character building moments, and are rightfully excluded for the action scenes to add more tension and unsettledness. Knowing Gregson-Williams tendency for loud music during many of the action movies he scored it is a HUGE relief to see that he has restrained himself here.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the man of the hour, Mr. Affleck. As a star he shows vulnerability, dedication, street-smarts and a gentle, human side to him, who always never panics and always knows how to be one step ahead of the cops. His performance is a vast improvement over his blockbuster runs a decade ago and it is clear that he has learned from his mistakes. Pulling a two-punch here, Affleck is not only the main actor but also directed the film - normally it would be bland for many movies if you can predict what's going to happen next but here Affleck directs the film with such skill, carefulness and confidence, you'll wonder whether a more experienced director is calling the shots. This is proof that while Affleck has improved as an actor, he may be a dominating force in the director's chair in the near future. Affleck handles the action sequences in a focused, simple and realistic fashion, there's no unnecessary explosions and no extreme blood squibs. But when the shootings starts, the tension is cranked to the maximum. It is handled with just the right amount of tension and violence.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a simple story told extremely well with a great acting ensemble, splendid shooting sequences and top-notch direction. This is not an action movie but I was hooked from beginning to end. I know this may be too soon but if Affleck keeps up this streak and choose movies that is of his true caliber, than Affleck may very well be on his way in following Clint Eastwood's steps as a popular actor but an extremely talented director as well. This is one of the year's best films.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 84/100"

","The Town was very engrossing , watchable and high octane drama that kept me glued to the screen. The film opens with a bank robbery in Charlestown. Ben Affleck (Doug) and his gang loots the bank and kidnaps the manager, Claire Keesey, as a hostage and releases her later. They find out that Claire lives in Charlestown, so they want to ensure that she did not see anything that could incriminate them if they were to ever run into her. As such, Doug begins a personal relationship with her to find out what she knows and what she's told the police and the FBI, who have taken charge of the investigation. He learns that she has kept some information from the authorities for her own protection but information that could identify James in particular. But Doug slowly falls for her, as she does for him. Ultimately, Doug dreams about leaving his Charlestown life to be with Claire anywhere but there. But Doug has to try and keep his true identity from her, and keep the fact that he is seeing her from his colleagues. Doug tries to leave the job and start something new but it would not be easy for him as he other commitments. When I saw the trailer of this film , i thought it would be just an average flick but my curiosity rose up after hearing lot of critical acclaim and reviews of the film and my joy knew no bounds after watching the movie. Though it started on a slow note but later it turned out to be very engrossing and ready - to- chill thriller.

"evan_harvey","7","0","3","7 December 2010"," Decent, but ultimately average
","Just watched The Town. It's not too bad, but lacks a certain something. It's not as good as Heat (Michael Mann's masterpiece), but is more accessible. I read some trivia that it had to be cut quite a bit, which might explain why some of feels a bit too forced at times.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty simple: bank robbers, a girl, cops and so on. It's a little unbelievable, but not so much that you scoff at it.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck, who I previously rated as a completely overrated actor both acts and directs. He does okay, but nothing special in either role. Affleck's character is supposed to be an intelligent, caring, sensitive hardcore thief, but it's completely out of place. These are men who rob and aren't afraid to shoot their way out of a corner. Having the main character as a really decent guy who just seems to be killing time robbing banks defies belief. The other characters are two dimensional, but server well enough. Rebecca Hall does quite well as the love interest.<br/><br/>There's overtones of a deeper storyline going on, such as the florist who seems to run things, but it is only revealed towards the end, and not much is made of it. Maybe that was among the things that got cut, and if so it was a bad choice. It comes up as quite a significant plot point, but is given only superficial treatment. A similar example that worked well was Jack Nicholson's character in The Departed. A director's cut would be worth a look at, although I don't think that the material would support a much longer film.<br/><br/>The actions scenes are okay, but Affleck seems to waffle a little bit. There's a scene where the robbers seem to hesitate for quite a long time before opening fire at some cops. If they're as hardcore as they're supposed to be, they should just get into it. It's another minor flaw that weakens the overall feel of the movie. See Heat for how to really take down the cops in a situation like that. However, they're done well enough to maintain interest.<br/><br/>I keep mentioning Heat because the films are very similar in a lot of ways. Heat is by far the better film overall, although it's more cerebral and The Town is easier to digest as a throwaway flick. Where Heat set the standard, The Town kind of wanders in it's shadow. The director's cut might help address that, but it remains to be seen.<br/><br/>Overall, it's okay. Worth a 7 out of 10 for a breezy action film. Unfortunately, outside of the action sequences, the film lags significantly, but the pace is brisk and it flows quite well."

","I still don't understand all the criticizing that happens with Ben Affleck's directing and acting abilities, i mean their are a hell of a lot worse out there. I for one have enjoyed pretty much all with the exception of a few of Affleck's movies and acting performances. I am also a huge fan of a good heist film but really haven't seen a half decent one since '95's Heat. That was until i sat through this intense little stick up flick. Ben Affleck seems to be doing the directing thing as well as a lot of actors have been, i mean there is nothing wrong with trying something a little new now and then and he is good at it, first Gone Baby Gone and then this. This film is huge in talent let's see we have Pete Postlewaite, Chris Cooper, Jeremy Renner that round out the cast as well as Affleck himself who portrays Doug Macray an experienced thief who along with his team have made it a habit of taking down huge banks in the charlestown area, an area that is re known for producing bank robbers such as himself. In an accidental mishap during a heist his crew end up taking bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage until they make their getaway. Doug ends up getting into a relationship with Claire after being told by a member of his crew (Renner) to take care of her which i guess he does in his own manner. Doug and his crew are chased throughout the film by the FBI as he tries to pull off one more job and still try to run away with Claire as to which i will say no more only that it has a great shoot out scene within that rivals Heat. A great film that even Affleck haters out there should have a look at as they might just change their whole position on this underrated actor."

Now for the things that were missing or overdone. Ben Affleck. There were way too much of Ben Affleck on screen. Frankly despite the fact he's not bad at all, but he's not a grade A movie star who can carry a movie to the top. I found his overacted monologues a bit irritating. Story is a bit too simple - Obvious secondary (""bad"") character death at the end, and a shot of redemption for the main one. It felt as this movie is too ""politically-movie"" correct, as all the ingredients are there, but they are not cooked properly. This one is worth to watch never the less."

","I would like to give this film 8 or 9 out of ten but unfortunately I felt the ending really let the film down.<br/><br/>I am aware of Ben Affleck's talents as a director / storyteller so I was already expecting to be thoroughly engaged in the film and was really looking forward to watching it.<br/><br/>The film is an excellent mixture of character driven story lines and action / romance, it builds tension and the car chase / robbery scenes are simply superb. I really couldn't take my eyes off the screen and it is actually one of those films you don't want to end because of how enjoyable it is!<br/><br/>***Spoiler***<br/><br/>Unfortunately though, I felt that the people responsible for putting the ending together seemed to be at loggerheads over how to do this. That is the impression I got because it ended up being a bit messy i.e. they seemed to not want to go for the happy ending or the sad one so they just kind of went 'in between'. It may work on some films but definitely not this one.<br/><br/>Worth watching for the main experience but I cannot outright recommend a film that will likely disappoint at the end...let's hope the DVD ending is more decisive.<br/><br/>7/10 (rounded up from 6.5)"

","Chuck Hogan's novel ""The Prince of Thieves"" (not too be confused with Kevin Costner's Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves) is converted to a screen play by Ben Affleck, Peter Craig, & Aaron Stockard. Affleck Directs & stars as Doug MacRay the Prince. Rebecca Hall carries the female co-star role well, & Jon Hamm is the FBI agent on MacRay's trail.<br/><br/>Hogan's novel is the fictional story of 4 Irish-American Brothers who are lifelong friends in the Boston area & of Doug, their leader, falling for the manager of one of the banks they rob. The screen adaption mentions some of the men being Irish but only emphasizes one of them as having a close relationship to Doug. It has a couple of men in a flower shop who order Doug around, & who bossed his father. The father is in prison & Doug's mother dead.<br/><br/>In the novel, Adam Frawley, the FBI agent is in love with Claire Keesey (Hall) the bank manager too. This seems to be missing in the movie as perhaps time constricted this story in the film weighs in at slightly over 2 hours. Regardless, the film is pretty well put together & does hit most of the other high points of the novel. Jon Hamm is the FBI agent.<br/><br/>This film is well constructed & a solid drama with little humor. As it lasted in theaters for a long stretch, the film has done well. No complaints from me, it is solid entertainment."

","Charlestown, Boston is not your ideal holiday destination, nor is it a place you'd want to raise a family. It 'boasts' the highest number of kidnappings and armed robberies in the world. For many of its inhabitants, crime is sadly a genetic trait.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck plays Doug MacRay, a stonemason who moonlights as an armed robber. Like him, his gang is disciplined, dedicated and dangerous. During a routine bank score, one of the managers, Claire (Rebecca Hall) is left traumatized. Fearing that she may somehow implicate them, James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), the capricious one, decides that she should be murdered. However, after a chance meeting with Claire, MacRay is moved by her vulnerability and an unlikely chemistry develops between them, prompting MacRay to examine himself.<br/><br/>For once cops aren't dim-witted. FBI agent Frawley is every bit the crime-fighting force he should be. His real life name (Jon Hamm) may suggest otherwise, however, his performance is more lean than streaky. Pete Postlethwaite's cameo as the cadaverous Irish linchpin will unnerve you. His cover is as a florist, but there's nothing flowery about his character.<br/><br/>Watching this film, I was reminded of Michael Mann's 'Heat' and John Frankenheimer's 'Ronin'. Affleck would not be able to deny that his gunfights and car chases were inspired by both films, but he wouldn't have to: they have a flair of their own. The only cliché I noticed was a superfluous exercise scene, but it was so brief as to be almost subliminal (the sight of an outrageously chiselled six-pack is hardly a criticism). <br/><br/>Affleck has partly redeemed himself with this film. Only 'partly' because further penance is required before he can be totally absolved for the sins that were 'Gigli' and 'Pearl Harbor'. Along with his directorship of 'Gone Baby Gone', 'The Town' is a not too tardy reminder that he once won an Oscar for his ability to tell a good story.<br/><br/>www.scottishreview.net"

","When I first saw the trailer it seemed like it was going to be pretty good movie. But this is not only good, this is an intense, dramatic and touching experience that surpassed my expectations by far. Ben Affleck used to be the pretty boy that started in popcorn movies such as Armaggedon and Pearl Harbor, but as a director he has shown tremendous talent. Of course the plot is not original but the performances of all the cast are terrific, action scenes reminded me the best moments of Heat and the way that the story is pulled together leaves you wanting more and most important you care about all the characters. There is no good or bad guys, simply very human people trapped in a concrete prison.

Adam show her the photo from Doug and he arrives There are also some scenes that could be better directed (my opinion) but overall good! The sound was great.

","Along with the ""Hooker with the Heart of Gold"" the ""Criminal who wants to turn his Life Around"" is one of the most popular of clichéd characters in movies. In fairness ""The Town"" is a good example of this genre. Ben Affleck's directorial debut ""Gone Baby Gone"" was a surprisingly bleak. This film is a considerably lighter in tone, even if it does deal with a gang of bank robbers.<br/><br/>Affleck's plays the head of the gang, Doug McRay. They rob a bank but the manager (Rebecca Hall) lives near the gang in Charlestown, the Boston district that gives the film its title. The FBI, led by Jon Hamm, start to investigate the robbery. The gang decide to keep an eye on the manager to find out if she can identify them. She and McRay fall into conversation almost immediately and start going out. A bit unlikely , I know. As they get to know each other we learn the McRay's back-story. He is a good bank robber but is unhappy that he is to going down the path that led his father to be in jail for murder.<br/><br/>He wants to call it a day but his second-in-command and best friend (Jeremy Renner) is a loose cannon and is getting a kick from the lifestyle after being in jail for 9 years. He wants to continue robbing but is determined not to go to jail again. A huge robbery at the Boston Red Sox stadium (Fenway Park) is set up even though the FBI investigation is getting closer to the gang. This leads to a dramatic set piece to climax the film.<br/><br/>The plot isn't very original but the acting is excellent and the chase and robbery scenes are very well done. If you loved Michael Mann's ""Heat"" you will like this film."

","Ben Affleck seems like a big goofy guy in the Keanu Reeves mould - a goodlooking doofus with a bit of charm who remembers a few lines and stands on an X with a camera pointed at him.<br/><br/>Half of Hollywood's elite could be described similarly.<br/><br/>Then I saw Gone, Baby Gone and was forced to admit that I might have been way off. Was it a fluke, a one off, a lucky lightning strike.<br/><br/>""Let's see what he does next"" I sez...<br/><br/>Now before I continue The Town isn't near Gone Baby Gone, the story is more straightforward and a little derivative at times. But Mr Affleck (to you) has proved he is no one trick pony. If anything he has proved to me that his future seems rosier behind the lens than in front of it.<br/><br/>There is a rough area in Boston (pronounced Borrrstun apparently) called Charlestown and as the movie semi-brags it is home to more bank robbers per head of population than any other area. Kids are literally raised into crime as the family business.<br/><br/>The Town looks on one such crew, though to be fair it really focuses on two guys.<br/><br/>Doug (Affleck) is a master planner. He considers the risk vs the reward, the timing and plans for every possibility before the heist commences...<br/><br/>Measure twice - cut once.<br/><br/>His father is in prison for life (you'll never guess why), and his Mother apparently ran out on the family when he was a boy.<br/><br/>Doug knows that violent criminals are more mercilessly hunted by the police so each job has more intimidation and threat than brutality. He also quickly deals with any tracers or dye packs that could prevent or impede a quick getaway.<br/><br/>In / out with minimal fuss. Crime is merely Doug's job.<br/><br/>Jim AKA Gem (Jeremy Renner) on the other hand loves the life, perhaps a little too much. He is a loose cannon. A hothead.<br/><br/>When asked to take a ride to beat up a guy whom he has never met, for reasons he can never know Gem has but one question: ""Whose car should we take?"" Gem is a dangerous man, even among criminals.<br/><br/>The first scenes show the latest job for Doug, Gem and the other two members of the group - everyone bar the afore-named are merely peripheral characters - the bank job goes well, almost without a hitch until...<br/><br/>In light of this unexpected development Gem decides to take a female bank worker hostage until the coast is clear, and they release shortly after the getaway - taking her ID as a parting threat to remind her that if she helps the police they know where she lives... The problem is that the staff member got a fair gander at some potentially identifying characteristics on one of the gang.<br/><br/>Job complete the boys lie low for a while until the to-do dies down a little, reporting only of their success to sinister and menacing Boss of ops Fergie (Pete Postlethwaite, looking seedier than ever).<br/><br/>But Doug being very much a guy that dots the i's and crosses the t's decides to follow up on this bankie to see if she might prove a problem, knowing full well that the investigators on the case will grill her for everything she knows (John Hamm plays Agent Frawley). A twist of fate leaves Claire and Doug face to face in a laundromat, rather than avoid any interaction Doug strikes up a conversation and the two chat, setting up a date.<br/><br/>The next day while Doug struggles with the conundrum of whether it is really a good idea to be taking the person most likely to send him to prison out; Gem openly wonders if they should ""take her Out""... big difference.<br/><br/>So Doug decides it might not be the best idea to inform Gem of recent dating developments in his love life.<br/><br/>The remainder of the film deals with the burgeoning relationship between Doug and Claire and the impact that it might have on both their lives. Doug decides that maybe performing major crimes might not be in his and Claire's best interests - but evidently it is not an easy life to get out of. Gem and Fergie are around to make damn sure of that.<br/><br/>The Town had a couple of solid action sequences during the multiple heists which almost covered up some of the logic and plot holes. Hamm's Agent Frawley always seemed only a step behind the crew at all times but I'm not so sure the real FBI would be ecstatic with the investigation in this film - there seemed to be more than a couple of opportunities to nab someone that were either ignored or overlooked.<br/><br/>The gimmick of the criminal hooking up with an innocent is not new, most recently coming up in another (inferior) film called The Ministers. It is mostly handled well but again there with even the most casual queries Doug's alibi would have evaporated swiftly.<br/><br/>The Town has a little more flash than Affleck's previous effort but still toes the right side of credibility and reality - if he had closed over some of those plot holes Affleck might have had another minor classic on his hands, as it stands he will have to settle for a very good and entertaining second effort.<br/><br/>Oh and as far as everyone lauding Jeremy Renner as Gem - he is OK but not mind blowing or even especially menacing. It seems that if a non-Bostonian has a crack at the accent and semi pulls it off that they are immediately awesome. See Nicholson; Jack.<br/><br/>Final Rating - 7.5 / 10. An entertaining couple of hours. One of many good films to be released lately.<br/><br/>If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com"
"jzappa","7","0","2","21 October 2010"," Contrived, Hackneyed, Schmaltzy, Conventional, Spectacularly Entertaining
","There are certain scenes in The Town that skillfully use the psychological commands we insistently hurl at movie characters. For instance, Ben Affleck's fond of Rebecca Hall. If she sees the tattoo on the back of Renner's neck, she'd find out something she can't find out about him. Jeremy Renner without warning meets the two at a counter. With firm looks and behavior, Affleck hints at him to leave. We do, too. Renner aggressively loiters. He doesn't know the tattoo's a tell. If a film can carry us to this situation and make us feel angst, it's done something correctly. Nevertheless, the dialogue so often feels forced, especially in the film's mid-section. John Hamm is given many lines that act more as self-conscious metaphors and similes---""This isn't Tommy Hopscotch anymore,"" or ""This is the not-effing-around crew so get me something that looks like a print because this not-effing-around thing is about to go both ways""---than as steps to create tension or reveal character. Affleck's alternately somber and confrontational monologues are either too affected to be taken seriously or they're beautifully written and delivered but nevertheless not motivated enough to feel any more than contrived, just as much of the plot is.<br/><br/>The Town opens by directly informing us that Charlestown breeds more bank robbers than anywhere else in the entire world. But rather than showing us real people, we're given crime drama stereotypes, in thrall to a mawkishly sentimental formula. Affleck is the leader of the heist crew with a heart and a burdened conscience who becomes romantically linked with an idealized female figure of innocence, played by Hall, whose personal life seems to only be comprised of volunteering to help children and do earnest day-to-day activities, all purely incidental in order to serve Affleck's character arc. She doesn't seem to have a life of her own at all. The crew's second banana is Renner's unhinged, trigger-happy urban barbarian with an insular sense of honor among criminals. The crew is comprised of two other neighborhood guys as well, but we're given nothing about them at all. We see them intermingle, we see the foursome masked while performing spectacular robberies, but nothing that ultimately happens to these other two matters. They work for Pete Postlethwaite, the emblematic neighborhood old-timer who keeps the subsequent generation's angry young men bound to the eponymous segregated populist environment to do his dirty work.<br/><br/>But The Town is not a bad film. It may be hackneyed, schmaltzy and conventional, but as Ebert once intelligently observed, what makes a movie good is not what it's about but how it's about it. It's certainly not as gritty as its opening words oblige, nor is it exceptional as a crime drama unattached to those words about Charlestown, but don't we watch those gangster films from the 1930s and '40s with the same trite, ham-handed and forcibly conformist scripts, Cagney, Bogart and Robinson spouting the same artificially prosey lines, and enjoy them to the point of rapture? Nostalgia, right? Well that's just what Affleck is going for with The Town: An atmospherically nostalgic, sentimentally driven elegy to the narrow streets of Boston. And in that subjective milieu, it's a very absorbing, highly adventurous entertainment.<br/><br/>Something else that observant movie buffs admire about silver-screen gangster classics, but regard less about more modern films with the same dramatic tackiness listed above, is the technical structure. As over-the-top and ham-handed as White Heat, High Sierra and the great original Scarface are, especially by modern standards, they're shot, edited and directed with more than a deft hand for tension and brutal in-the-moment action. So is Affleck's The Town. For the first half hour, it's edited with a particular, emotional and suspenseful edge that not many romantic Hollywood films are. Of the many impacts provided by the overtonal and associational cutting is its dropping of us, the audience, straight into the initial dilemma of the story. And as the film progresses, there is the occasional suggestive use of editing, not just manipulating the temporal length of the cuts or its rhythmic characteristics, but to elicit a reaction from the audience even more complex than from cutting simply based on the length of a shot or the literal connection from one situation to the next.<br/><br/>The most spectacular entertainment to extract from the movie in terms of narrative are certainly the heists, their getaways and repercussions. The robbery sequences themselves pull few punches. I've often wondered what security guards, law enforcement, bank employees and the like think and feel when faced with films like Ocean's Eleven and The Italian Job. Are they especially detached from the exhilarating spectacle of a witty machination like that, or do they sometimes actually resent the sugar-coated treatment of the sort of experience they've either had or fear to have? The Town is one of those heist films that maintain both the rush of a good movie heist sequence and the ferocity of the armed robbery of an establishment."

","Is there a different language in Charlestown MA? Couldn't understand half of what this crime gang was saying whether it was Blake, Ben or Jeremy. When the criminals were speaking, apart from the expletives most of the dialog was unintelligible.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck does keep up the tension and pace as director.<br/><br/>In the end it is a cops and robbers story which gets you on the side of the robbers. The central romance is unconvincing - in the end I can't see why he fell for her. Also the effort in going into the crime doesn't seem worth the payoff. If they were so smart and well equipped they should have been really rich by legitimate means. The story has a satisfying feel good ending - not too happy and not too depressing. <br/><br/>Ben looks older and acts a bit better than when he was younger. He is no longer pretty so he can do these kinds of roles. Jeremy Renner is a good character actor. Blake Lively makes a good effort to be different from TV but she is a still too pretty for the role. Supermodel types just cannot be the most convincing white trash. Must admit I wanted to see more screen time for her though. Jon Hamm looks suitably haggard and down to earth as a cop - I can see more of him in this type of role. Rebecca Hall is too ugly / intelligent for this role. So the female leads were slightly miscast - but it is the big name cast especially for TV fans seeing Don Draper and Serena Van der Woodsen do different roles that is the main attraction.<br/><br/>This is an engrossing if not perfect thriller."

Echoes Michael Mann's classic genre film Heat, yet still an impressive showing in its own right for Affleck as lead actor, director, and co-writer, creating a worthy follow-up to Gone Baby Gone and adding another memorable addition to the 'Boston crime' genre.

","Whilst I agree with most of what other reviewers have said about the energy and originality of Ben Affleck's movie, I have a real problem with the amazing volume of F-words in the script. OK, I know people use them all the time, but two or three in the same sentence - and over and over - it's like being machine-gunned by the writer (also Affleck, in this case).<br/><br/>Back in the bad old good old days, actors managed to convey menace and even pure evil without the use of profanity - an outstanding example would be Robert Mitchum in the original CAPE FEAR. Nowadays, if a writer wants to show a bad guy, he just chucks in a bunch of F-words. It's lazy writing - and lazy acting. Movies and TV plays where the F-word is used sparingly have a lot more impact.<br/><br/>Call me old-fashioned - and you will! - I just wish there was a bit more SUBTLETY in Crime movies and Dramas."
"gary-444","7","0","2","19 October 2010"," Above Average Heist Movie
","An above average ""Heist"" movie confidently directed by Ben Afleck who also takes the lead. Set in Boston, Affleck plays a career bank robber, Doug Macray, from the run down district of Charlestown, which is home to the criminal fraternity in general, and bank robbing aficionados in particular. The generous running time of 125 mins contains only three raids because, wisely, the story based on the Chuck Hogan novel ""Prince of Thieves"", concentrates on character rather than action and takes time to enjoy the location sets in Boston itself.<br/><br/>Charlestown is a tight knit community to which Affleck's gang return after a brilliant, visceral opening Bank raid. To English ears, the dialogue is sometimes mumbled and difficult to follow, but when a hostage is freed who it emerges also lives in Charlestown, the plot bites as MacRay starts to date the hostage and is easy to follow. Time worn themes of criminal codes of honour, redemption, justice and revenge are explored with a blue collar authenticity which just begs Bruce Springsteen to step out of the shadows at any time.<br/><br/>Rebecca Hall as Claire skilfully unfolds the role of bank official turned unwitting girlfriend ,delivering a compelling, but understated performance even though her own back story is somewhat under written. Pete Postlethwaite is wonderful in a cameo as the local godfather in a ballsy performance, in every sense of the phrase.<br/><br/>No such story would be complete without the Cop determined to bring the hoodlums to justice and John Hamm is convincing as FBI agent Hawley whose task in racking down the offenders is not that difficult. Why both he and McCray have to sport unshaven beard growth is never quite explained.<br/><br/>A gripe is the Hollywood obsession with over the top shoot-outs. Although the opening bank raid, and subsequent security van raid are brilliant, the finale at the Boston Red Sox ' Fenway Park becomes ridiculous and unconvincing, and is wholly unnecessary to a well plotted story. Fortunately an action free, but engrossing and satisfying denouement save the story from the ridicule it risks at Fenway Park.<br/><br/>Strong, and atmospheric, with several nods to ""Heat"" this movie succeeds and delivers in spades suggesting that in the future Affleck will make a film that scores excellent, and not just the ""very good"" plaudits which this story has rightly been credited with.<br/><br/>."
"cultfilmfan","10","0","2","18 October 2010"," The Town
","The Town is based on the novel Prince of Thieves by Chuck Hogan. The film takes place in Boston, Massachusetts and we soon learn that this is one of the biggest bank robbery capitals in America. As the film goes along we are introduced to a team of bank robbers, who after several elaborate heists have always managed to walk away with a lot of money and still have not been arrested, or caught for it. We also meet an FBI team who is closing in on the robbers because of enough background information and evidence they have to finally get their culprits, if only they can catch them in the act. There is also a romance that blossoms in the film, but due to the circumstances of the characters, it is going to take deceit and eventually loyalty to make it work, if it does end up working at all. If you see the film, you will know what I am talking about. The film is all about loyalty to friends, loved ones and even the authorities and all these different characters will be put into a situation of which to choose to best suit their lives and the ones around them. When I first saw trailers for The Town several months ago at the theatre, I already thought then that this looked like it was going to be a really good movie. The trailers and my expectations were correct. What I was surprised by though, was that The Town wasn't the movie I thought it was going to be. The trailers made the film look a certain way and while I was watching it, I discovered that in a lot of ways it was a different film than advertised. This is not a complaint because I loved the final product. The Town works because of it's tight script which has some very good character study and development and it puts the different characters in tough situations and moral dilemmas and watching them decide what to do that will be best for themselves, but also for the ones around them, I found fascinating to watch and fairly realistic and not clichéd, or predictable at all, which I really compliment the film on. The film also has a terrific pace to it. It does have very little action scenes in it and they are not really needed to make this film more exciting. I say this because the lives of these characters become so involving to us that we really want to see what happens between them and what decisions they make and we do get in a sense to even care for them. It is so involving and fascinating that the over two hour running time is rarely felt because everything is so captivating. The acting is all very good here as well. I would not single out a single performance as being the best because I think the whole cast really does good work here. The direction is tight and focused and really brings the film together and makes for a really entertaining and thrilling watch. Last week I reviewed the Australian film Animal Kingdom which is also about criminal activities. In some ways they are the same and in some they are different. I personally liked The Town better because I really felt we got to know these characters better and the on screen chemistry was great. This film also successfully blends different genres including drama, action and even romance and all were pulled off terrifically and it felt more human to me. The Town is one of the best films of 2010 and I am glad it is doing so well with critics, audiences and the box office."

But the trailer for the Town contained all the elements of a great film. This was the difficult 2nd film for Ben Affleck. Gone Baby Gone was received well on release although it did get caught up is a small amount of controversy because of the similarities in plot to the real world tragic disappearance of Madeleine McCann. It proved to be a solid film, well written, well cast and well directed by Affleck. Critics then as critics do, started to suggest it was a fluke. What did Affleck do? He upped the stakes. This time with a bigger budget, much more ambitious plot and cast himself in the leading role. Not only that, but the trailer suggested action sequences to rival one of cinema's finest heist movies, Heat. Affleck stars, directs and co-writes the film which this time is a big studio film with a modest budget of $37 million, of which from the film I watch, you get to see every cent on the screen.<br/><br/>Rest of review here: http://seanryantownreview.blogspot.com/2010/10/town-movie-review.html"

Ben Affleck, both as lead actor and as director, gets to create much adrenaline in a first-rate ensemble. In this story he projects a blend of violence, sadness and discontent that depicts wonderfully the Irish mob of Boston. At the same time the other characters are much more involved than they appear at first. Ben Affleck hasn't certainly overloaded The Town with action, but hasn't avoided it totally. Overall Boston's narrow streets and some Irish faces streets give perfectly the idea of a declining criminal environment."

","I didn't know Ben had it in him, but I have found a whole new respect for him in this film. He not only delivered as a lead, but somehow directed a film which really broke out of the usual mode I think we've seen from him.<br/><br/>The town most definitely kept me very compelled and on the edge of my seat, and I thought that the acting was spot-on. There were,of course, a few minor points that I felt were a tad forced story-wise,but other than that, it was a solid picture throughout. <br/><br/>The action sequences were really intense and had me twisting. The character portrayals were real and gritty. The editing and sound design were up to par, as was the cinematography.<br/><br/>I'm glad I went to see this at the theatre. Definitely the best I've seen so far this year. Very riveting, visually done well, and a great overall theatrical experience."
"cbrookephs-2011","10","0","4","6 October 2010"," The Town
","In the movie The Town, Ben Affleck stars as longtime thief Doug MacRay, who lives in Charlestown, MA he meets a bank teller ( played by Rebecca Hall), whom he falls in love with. As the story goes on Doug and his friends come up with the biggest heist, which means robbing Fenway Park. So they all go over to Fenway thinking that they are going to pull off the biggest heist of their lives, it ends up everyone except for Doug and some member of the FBI being killed. If you have not seen the movie then it is a movie not to miss. The Town I think is a combination of Fever Pitch meets The Departed. So if you are into shoot-em up movies, then The Town is the right movie for you (unless you are underage to see an R-Rated movie)."

","Personally, I have not normally liked Ben Affleck's acting, but his acting, directing, and writing here was nothing less than amazing. He perfectly played an integral role in The Town and it would not have been the same without him.<br/><br/>I went into the movie a bit skeptical, but still quite optimistic due to the positive reviews I had seen. And sure enough, it was a great movie. There are a lot of really great action scenes and the movie flows very well while keeping you literally on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>In the reviews for The Town, Eminem's ""Not Afraid"" played in the background. If you go into the theater looking forward to seeing how they implement the song into the movie, you will be sadly disappointed as no part the song is not played whatsoever. However, the movie is definitely a must see and is definitely on my top five of this year."

","A well done film that had great plot twists and surprises in the action. I was not surprised that actors Chris Cooper, Rebecca Hall or Pete Postlewaite were very good in this engaging, slightly nerve-wracking, yet sensitively-portrayed film. But I was very surprised to see Ben Affleck as a.) for once not being totally irritating, b.) being actually likable and you want to root for is character, and c.) directing and starring in a good film. My, my. Blake Lively was completely believable as a troubled, drugged-up townie girl. Jeremy Renner was menacing and moving.The film was well-written, clever, and done in a very non-judgmental, gritty realism style. I liked it all the way through, save the very last corny shot. Now, Mr. Affleck, was that necessary?"
"tavm","9","0","5","30 September 2010"," Ben Affleck's The Town was a very compelling action drama
","Well, this is the first time I've seen a movie directed by Ben Affleck, as opposed to both starring and co-writing as well, and I must say that I was very impressed with what I saw! He plays the lead character, a heist thief from the Charlestown suburb of Boston, with compelling empathy that one hopes he doesn't step too much over the line when he does the things he does here. I mean, yes, he steals and shoots and doesn't always make the right decisions but he also has a reasonable background that explains his plight. And he's picked the right cast in people like Rebacca Hall, Jon Hamm, Jeremy Renner, Blake Lively, Pete Postlethwaite, and Chris Cooper among others in bringing this action drama to the screen. I don't think I've seen any flaws, story-wise, while watching but maybe that's because I was just very absorbed on just how things seemed really connected that the whole thing just took me away. So on that note, The Town comes highly recommended."
"msbroberts","10","0","4","29 September 2010"," Excellent Story, great acting, worth seeing.
","Mr.Affleck def. deserves kudos. My husband & I went to see it, honestly, to escape the heat. We wound up pleasantly surprised when we both liked it, tremendously, something that rarely occurs.<br/><br/>The acting was excellent. The story was well told and compelling. There were a few holes, but not nothing really horrid or enough to detract from the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>I was really looking forward to Wall Street, but as much as I thought Wall Street fell flat, The Town exceeded my expectations and made for a wonderful surprise, almost like a little hidden treasure.<br/><br/>There were some decent action scenes, but not that horrible bumpy camera work, that is suppose to be 'artistic', but frankly just give me a head ache."
"Capo-idFilm","Null","0","2","24 September 2010"," Good ol' cops and robbers no-nonsense genre film
","A fast, post-HEAT genre vehicle that substitutes the glossy sea-view apartments and wide highways common to this sort of thriller with a more downbeat, old neighbourhood feel (bank robbing is a 'profession' passed down through generations), with narrow one-way streets that hinder any getaway truck and community buildings long in need of grants and refurbishment. If it's heart is in the right place – one can see its intentions firmly written on its sleeve – it settles too often on old-fashioned motion-turning: even the 'moral ambiguity' of the cops and robbers dynamic has point-of-view on its side, and Affleck is too keen on playing the good-guy villain. Scenes between him and Rebecca Hall are driven by shorthand superficiality: personal past parental problems stand in for genuine character depth; John Hamm seems to be on board only to test his big-screen potential. That said, it's an often involving entry into the heist genre that handles its material with much commitment and not much pretension.<br/><br/>Read idFilm: idfilm.blogspot.com<br/><br/>Join idFilm: idfilm.proboards.com"
"TVGuy3","9","0","4","23 September 2010"," Stick With Directing, Ben! TvGuy3's Review of The Town
","The Town is a bank robbery movie about a robber (Ben Affleck) trying to get his life in order. He can't decide between a happy life with his new girlfriend (Rebecca Hall) or staying a crook with his creepy buddy (Jeremy Renner). Renner gives such a good performance as a jerk in this movie that you would think he's a total a-hole in real life. You may know him from The Hurt Locker, last year's best picture (it should've been Avatar). Jon Hamm stars as a cop trying to stop Affleck and his friends but not persuasively enough that they pull off 2 more heists before the movie's over. This movie is elevated by great performances by Affleck and Renner, and Blake Lively is also good when she's on screen. Ben's last film in the director's chair was ""Gone Baby Gone"" and ""The Town"" proves he wasn't a one-hit-wonder. The Town is great and Ben Affleck can direct the hell out of a car chase. Go see it.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"
"jeanpierre15","7","0","4","23 September 2010"," They say don't go into business with friends.
","I don't think this is the crime film it would like to think it is. I gave this movie a 7 on the grounds of it being an action movie. One more sensical than The A Team, Takers, or the like. <br/><br/>I don't think it functions as an effective crime/drama/thriller, because the aspects of criminality are laughable. Either that, or the intent of this film was to portray a bunch of idiots with automatic weapons brutishly ransacking rent-a-cops and incompetently prepared banks. If the latter was the intent, it'd still commit to being over-wrought and sensationalized (the blueprinting voice-overs detailing the guards, the elaborate cosplay, etc.). <br/><br/>People on these boards have pointed out the lack of foundation in the characters; Hamm as a thin hellbent 'detective,' any relational chemistry between Lively and Renner in regards to Affleck. Or even the flame between Lively and Affleck shoddily shoved in to facilitate the plot. But my main concern regarding Affleck and Renner's characters are that they seem to both be very unintelligible. <br/><br/>Renner is crazy--impulsive, like Waingro in Heat, sit his ass in time out, or tell him to cut that sh!t out. And Doug (Affleck), is a moron, willfully compromising his team. So he loves her? Grow up. You don't always live happily ever after. Maybe you shouldn't sometimes. Not that the film made it tangible past words anyhow. If these guys love each other so much, act professional for their own sakes. <br/><br/>I hope there is a director's cut out there so I can make more substantial sense of these inferences. Maybe some transitioning scenes to establish plot elements better. <br/><br/>Thanks for reading."

","In director/star Ben Affleck's The Town, there are too many rounds of assault rifles and too much mumbling among the hardened criminals of Charlestown, Mass., where he grew up. But then there's much to like—the occasional joke and the infrequent but authentic romantic moments as well as realistic ones between old friends who are deeply involved in heists.<br/><br/>Doug (Affleck) and Jem (Jeremy Renner), best friends from youth, head a small gang of bank robbers, who are methodical but suffer from conventional weaknesses such as hot heads and women, in this case the bank manager, Claire (Rebecca Hall), whom they must abduct and Affleck must eventually love. Jem is the out-of-control sidekick to the more sensitive Doug (about his dad crying at his mother's departure, Doug says, ""I'd never heard a man cry before""). Both hoodlums are a modern day Butch and Sundance with swagger and recklessness but missing the sense of purpose those two cowboy heroes had. Bonnie and Clyde are closer.<br/><br/>Surprisingly for a heist film, the romance is natural, as mixed up as it should be with Doug stalking Claire while loving her. He pleads, ""Ask me anything you want."" ""I won't believe you,"" she says. It's tough in Charlestown. No formulaic ending for them either, although the twist has been done before as well.<br/><br/>Charlestown is lovingly photographed, accents are thick, and most everyone is stuck in this notorious crime town (although I worked in Dorchester, I never dared to go to Charlestown). Heists in film have become formulaic—Affleck puts some new humanity in that mix. The Town is his second serious directorial outing (Gone Baby Gone is his first), and it's much better in almost every way.<br/><br/>Given that he does so well in front of the camera, too, I predict he'll be entertainment busy for decades to come."
