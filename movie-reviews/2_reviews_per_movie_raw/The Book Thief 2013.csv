","No extended fight scenes. No unnecessary pyrotechnics. Simply a story of ordinary people conducting themselves in extraordinary fashion when faced with the hell of Hitler's Third Reich and World War II. <br/><br/>The literary vehicle of Death as the Narrator is a masterstroke, as is the overall emphasis of words/books/art overcoming evil. <br/><br/>And it's all done with compassion for children at their best and most vulnerable, and adults bypassing the convention of the era to display kindness, caring and understanding.<br/><br/>An understated classic, there aren't enough movies like this being produced.<br/><br/>And that's a damn shame."

","9.5. I'd love to give it a 10, but having read the book, I know there were a couple of things they could have done to make it even better. The film was stunning nonetheless.<br/><br/>I had very high expectations going in and honestly, from the trailer, I was prepared for a let down. Nothing of the sort. The scenery was breathtaking and captivating, and I felt transported, insulated from the realities of a terrible war in a terrible time by the endearingly human performances of the actors and the depth they lent to their characters.<br/><br/>The only complaints I have would be slight spoilers for both the movie and the book and since I highly recommend both, I'll save them.<br/><br/>A powerfully emotional treat you won't regret. Go see it!"
"mkramer-693-816493","10","203","244","29 November 2013"," Riveting, Thought-Provoking, and Powerful
","This is without a doubt one of the most riveting, thought-provoking, and utterly powerful movies for young people (or any people, for that matter). Unlike most movies for young people, which usually encourage selfishness, lust, and who knows what else, this is a film that promotes such qualities as self-sacrifice, courage in the face of unspeakable difficulties, and using your life to make a difference for others.<br/><br/>Based on Markus Zusak's novel, The Book Thief expertly tells the story of a young German girl named Liesel, who is thrust into the horrors of World War II Germany and its many complications. The scope of the story is seen through the eyes of Liesel, making it quite an intimate tale that is less about war and more about the importance of remaining human in inhuman surroundings, and affecting those around you in a positive and profound way.<br/><br/>The film is hauntingly beautiful, and moves at an effortless pace- not too fast, not too slow- allowing the viewers to become immersed in the realities of Liesel's situation. Lovely Sophie Nelisse is stunningly perfect in the role of Liesel, capturing both the bright-eyed innocence and the eventual world-weary quality needed for the role. Liesel's good-natured friend Rudy is also expertly and realistically portrayed by young Nico Liersch. It is a delight to watch such wonderful young actors at work. Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson, of course, are their usual extraordinary selves as Liesel's adoptive parents.<br/><br/>This is truly a movie that is not just for young people. It operates on many levels, as a commentary on the disastrous effects of World War II or a poignant tale of one small soul fighting for her own sense of humanity. While it might be a bit intense for small children, a film such as this should be mandatory viewing for older children and teenagers- a thoughtful and heart-tugging reminder of the fragility of life, and the importance of looking beyond yourself. It is the sort of film that will leave viewers young and old just a bit speechless."
"drjgardner","9","153","184","16 November 2013"," WW 2 from a child's perspective
","Those familiar with the 2005 award winning and best-selling novel by Australian author Markus Zusak will not be disappointed with the theatrical version which differs from the book in only minor details. Both tell the story of a preadolescent girl who is adopted into a German family living in a small village in 1938, and then by following her life we get to view war on the home front for Germany. Nazi rallies, anti-Jewish pogroms, Hitler Youth groups, conscription, book burning, daylight bombing, propaganda films and posters, and the whole gamut of events are seen from her perspective.<br/><br/>This isn't the first film to adopt this perspective. ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" is the classic example, but more recently, ""No Place on Earth"" (2013) covered some of the same ground as did ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" (2008) and especially ""Lore"" (2012).<br/><br/>""The Book Thief"" has wonderful photography by Florian Ballhaus, an excellent musical score by Golden Globe and Oscar winning John Williams (""Schindler's List"", ""ET"", ""Star Wars""), and best of all, marvelous acting from Sophie Nelisse as the young girl, Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson as her adoptive parents, and Ben Schnetzer as the Jewish boy they hide. Many of the core scenes with Nelisse, Watson, and Rush should be required viewing at any acting school.<br/><br/>Hats off too to young Nico Liersch who plays a boyhood friend of Nelisse.<br/><br/>If the film has any fault at all, it is the decision by the film makers to try to walk a fine line between drama and fable. Having ""Death"" as the narrator right from the start seems to suggest fable, but the story itself veers sharply to drama for most of the 2+ hours, and then, noticeably at the end, reverts to fable. Some viewers may find this disconcerting. But the power of the story and the acting generally compensate for this short coming."
"frozenteeth","9","59","74","22 October 2013"," A fresh take on a solemn subject
","First things first: I haven't read the book. This despite the fact that I've worked in a bookstore for nearly eight years. I've always meant to read it, but when I won tickets to the Mill Valley Film Festival premiere, I had less than 24 hours until the screening.<br/><br/>The Book Thief is a wonderful film, nuanced and thoughtful, and buoyed by strong performances from Geoffrey Rush, Emily Watson, and newcomer Sophie Nélisse. We watch as Germany falls under the storm of war, the country slowly descending into madness as we follow one girl who finds a home in the care of a couple at odds with the Fascist ideologies sweeping the nation. Soon Liesel (Nélisse) meets Rudy, a neighborhood boy, and Max, a young Jewish man her new parents must hide in their basement.<br/><br/>Built around the external drama of the war and its consequences is Lisel's discovery of reading and books. Words are a valuable commodity in her ravaged society, and the care paid by the filmmakers and actors to accentuate the importance of stories to Lisel's survival makes this movie all the more compelling. The cinematography, editing, and script are all excellent as well.<br/><br/>In short, The Book Thief is the kind of film you could show your children as a way to first begin a discussion of World War II and the Holocaust, but it never takes shortcuts from darker subject matter to reach this role. An excellent movie."

","Orange Wednesday's are a weekly escape from the monotony of the working world (New Teacher - Little money - Stressed - Used to do absolutely nothing at Uni). Therefore over the last couple of years, as you can imagine, the cinema has been overused and a plethora of films have been watched, reviewed and loved. Being a sap myself and an ability to completely immerse myself within a movie; the usual comment coming out of the cinema is: ""That was the best film I've ever seen!""...<br/><br/>Obviously that is never actually true, and probably isn't for this film, however I again came out the cinema saying the same thing. Within the first two months of this year: Wolf of Wall Street, 12 Years a Slave, American Hustle and Dallas Buyers Club...Now The Book Thief! <br/><br/>Now I had no idea what the film was about before stepping in the cinema, except a girl who steals books in the war. Even half way through I thought this film was a heart warming film about the war through a child's eyes. I was WRONG! If you know nothing about the story, the film is beautifully written, acted, portrayed (Life of Pi creators, done it again) and has bags of shocks, emotion and heartache. The other lad who viewed the film with me(In the same boat work wise) I have never seen cry. That man was broken!<br/><br/>The young actress, is going to be a superstar. Geoffrey Rush, although portrayed a ""Disney Dad"" as some reviewers suggested; was inspirational and perfectly cast, when compared to the book, which I have now read.<br/><br/>Another reviewer trashed the use of ""bits of German"" - You sir, are a fool. This is not Hollywood tact, the book does exactly the same thing and therefore the film took that same role. <br/><br/>Another reviewer gave the film ""1 star"" (Mainly due to the film not being realistic in 3 parts, which all played no real role in the film and therefore a poor point to make) It's a story based on some real life events, not a true story.<br/><br/>Rant over though, this film truly moved me (23 year old male) I know, I hid it well in the cinema! The film is just a Must see and although I probably wouldn't rate it 10 star (I never rate that highly) I felt I needed to raise the profile, due to people who have too much time on their hands to pick holes in minor parts of films and have to have their films more like a documentary, then a masterpiece for all warps of life and ages.<br/><br/>I will be using this in school as soon as it is out and will be a fantastic tool for developing writing!<br/><br/>Cracking film!"

","This is a flat out amazing film. It's nuanced, extremely thoughtful and features some of the strongest performances of the year. If I had a vote, we'd get another young teenage girl nominated for ""best actress"" in a lead role for Sophie Nelisse's amazing work. Everyone's work here is award worthy. Sure, the subject matter may seem like a rehash (The Diary of Anne Frank""/""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas""/The Pianist"") but it really isn't. It's fresh, and packs the most emotional impact of any film that I've seen all year. Captivating and extremely powerful, the film is hauntingly beautiful. It moves at an effortless pace which allows the viewer to become immersed in the realities of Liesel's situation. That pace may not be for everyone but I found it to be perfect. Everything breaths properly and every connection made is heartfelt and meaningful. The literary vehicle of death as the narrator really is a masterstroke and works perfectly. It starts the film and finishes but is never intrusive. <br/><br/>I honestly feel this film is an instant classic. It really stayed with me after watching it and I'm still moved by its impact."

","If this film is not on most Top 10 Lists then what I think about critics will hold. As the saying goes "" I laughed, I cried, i felt good. This film shows hope in the face of the worst that life serves up, and wants you to come back for more. The acting from top to bottom was fantastic. Geoffrey Rush gives a wonderful performance that should get him an Oscar nomination. This is by no means a feel good movie, and I wouldn't bring younger kids to see it, but it will make them think about. Best of all look for the answer to the many questions this film should leave in their minds. Questions of did this happen, and if it did, WHY? I like that as in other films about this time, it focused on the ordinary people of Germany not just the victims of the Holocaust. How their lives were touched by the insanity of the masses and how some never lost sight of what it was to care about others."
"Palidan400","7","101","135","6 November 2013"," Touching and warm story - for the most part
","For the most part, you will come out seeing this film with what you expect. ""The Book Thief"" takes place during the Holocaust, a subject seen in many other renowned films, but the beauty of this story comes from the perspective viewers get - that of a child's.<br/><br/>There is an excellent blend of different pieces that move the film along well - the violence and the intensity of the time period, the touching relationships between friends and family, and the humor they all share. Though it's nothing new, the writing and lines are still great and make the characters very likable. Performances by the entire cast, no matter how small or large a role they play, are certainly deserving of praise. Even with all the dramatic events surrounding them, it is easy to get caught in the relationship between Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson as the familiar nagging parents of Liesel.<br/><br/>The various sets of the film - backed up with some clean, beautiful cinematography (yet nothing too astounding) - show several different parts of the town, but you are still left wanting to see more of this world. Which is where the film falls in general. For the majority of the movie, you are invested into these characters and you follow their time through WWII, and much goes on. The ending, however, comes rather quickly and you are left with that same feeling of wanting to know more. Not just of the ending, but everything before. It seems every time a moment - of suspense, of sadness, or happiness - comes, it holds on for a short while, but cuts off before you can fully take it in.<br/><br/>Still, the film gives a touching story to watch. The subject matter is obviously very serious, but the story of ""The Book Thief"" allows a wide range of people to watch this and understand, be it a young child or an adult. The characters are the best part of this film and I found them very enjoyable. The film is rather traditional and almost doesn't fit in with the rest of today's movies, but rather reminded me of many other older classics."
"krocheav","8","49","65","26 January 2014"," A Shining Gem In The Darkness
","""The Book Thief"" is certainly a rare kind of film for its day. It gleams like the sun, glistens like rays on the surface of water - for here is a dark tale that lights up the very soul. <br/><br/>I've read several 'professional' reviews for this work and it seems too easy for some Critics to sit in their comfortable cinema seats, or arm chairs in the safety of their homes, and write, what often amount to trite comments. They can read meaning (often their own) into works of crude ugliness, yet feel they have to hide from life affirming warmth. <br/><br/>From the very opening scenes this film draws you in. Some did not like the fact that death (as voice over) begins to tell the story, but this also served to make it all the more compelling. Screen play adapter: Michael Petroni who's been associated with such diverse works as ""The Rite"" and ""Narnia"" is equally at home writing for the BIG screen as well as TV. As is talented Director: Brian Percival (Downton Abbey & North and South) Both seem to have given their all, and with no less than 6 various producers, there seemed to be plenty of money to assure superb production values ~ guaranteeing a great look and feel. Director of Photography: German born Florian Ballhaus, captures the magnificence of the carefully selected locations, lifting astounding images from the pages of the book onto the screen. <br/><br/>The cast all work hard to bring to life the characters from Markus Zusak's novel. Child actors can sometimes be hit or miss but award winning Sophie Nelisse (Liesel) is reminiscent of the great Patricia Gozzi from the 60s (Sundays and Cybele '62 & Rapture '65) She convinces over a full range of emotions. Young Nico Liersch scores equally as Rudy.<br/><br/>Some cynical critics seem to have difficulty in understanding the intellect of children forced to grow up in terrible circumstances and may have been unnecessarily harsh. Rush is reliable as always, managing to convey the emotions of a man living with fear, yet playing it down for the sake of his young adopted charge. <br/><br/>John Williams' multi-layered music score brings to mind the style of strong scores that helped breath life into great classics from the past.<br/><br/>Films of this quality have become rare in these days of often foolish, Hollywood comic book action blockbusters, but it's hoped this, along with 'The Railway Man' might see us treated to more intelligent modern cinema. If I'd change anything, perhaps it could be the anticlimactic style of the closing scenes ~ looked as if more may have been added as afterthought, through one too many fade outs (a very minor point) <br/><br/>But more importantly, perhaps, some cynical critics may also be 'reminded of their humanity'."

","**I don't like to rate movies, because they should be about personal interpretation. But below is what I thought about The Book Thief.**<br/><br/>Really gorgeous film. The actors are extremely captivating, it's easy to watch, there's laughter, there're tears. It's really great. But there are a couple of things that annoyed me...<br/><br/>1) Confused tone: I didn't know if it was a children's movie, a drama, fantasy... The tone is very confused and I was forever trying to decipher where it wanted to sit with the audience... Maybe that's the media student in me.<br/><br/>2) Why must there be a narrator?? The narrator is 'death'. I get it. But it's so unnecessary. Immature. I hated it. The plot isn't so difficult that you need it. I know in the book it works, but it shouldn't be there. Really tasteless.<br/><br/>3) Accents. This one is a bit biased. I have a very specific opinion about movies that try to be authentic by having western actors portray specific accents. Eek. Either use Germans, or get rid of the accent! Also, why do they need to have UNDs and JAs in every sentence... Either speak English or speak German! Urgh! It really annoys me. Would have preferred subtitles to be honest... but of course, no American worth their soul will venture out into the subtitle world unless your name is Mel Gibson. Shame.<br/><br/>That's it. Promise. Besides these annoying traits, it was a beautiful movie. <br/><br/>I cried like a baby when Rudy (the boy with blond hair) dies. He is such a sweet kid! So charismatic. The young actor I also have seen to be quite an impressive little man. Really got me to relate to the character... Gorgeous! I hope to see him in many more movies.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush - awesome, as per the usual. This man makes me love every character he plays.<br/><br/>The end, where we are introduced to her life is a beautiful thing. War movies, they really make you be appreciative of everything you have..."

","I bet you have seen many movies that have narration but I bet you  haven't seen one like this. In this movie, the narrator is Death.  The Book Thief is about a young girl whose brother dies and her mother  abandons her - all at the age of 11. She's adopted by an older couple  in Nazi Germany. Her foster father teaches her how to read which lights  a fire inside of her to read and read and read. Again, since this is  Nazi Germany, books are very hard to find. The only way she can get  more books is to ""borrow"" them. Also, her family agrees to hide a young  Jewish man in their basement which puts the young girl's family at  great risk. But, the young girl and the young man become very good  friends, helping each other through hard times. During this time, there  are many people dying so Death is very nearby and has a lot to say. The  Book Thief is all told from Death's perspective.  The lead characters are the young girl, Liesel Meminger played by up-  and-coming actress Sophie Nelisse and her foster father and mother  played by Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson. These characters try to live  a normal life while fighting for it.  One of my favorite scenes is when a friend of Liesel's, Rudy, goes to  the running track and covers himself in mud so he can look like Olympic  Track Star Jessie Owens. I like this scene because it shows how Rudy  didn't believe what Hitler was saying and supported Liesel and her  family.  The look and sound of this film helps convey the emotional story of  Liesel and her friends and family. The sets and costumes are all  beautiful and really portray 1940s Germany. The music is sad but also,  hopeful. The cinematography is beautiful and also lets us see the  harshness of their lives.  The message of this movie is ""to stand up for what you believe and  don't let a group of people tell you otherwise.""  I recommend this movie to ages 9 and up. Although this is a sweet  passionate film it does take place in Nazi Germany which includes  violence and death.  I give this movie five out of five stars because the idea of having the  narrator be Death really grabbed my attention and held my attention to  this unbelievable story to the very end.

","There is always something distinct and unique about opening a new book. The newly bound, crisp page smell, the vivid and detailed wording of sentences waiting for you to mull over and lose yourself in. From the opening scene in The Book Thief, you can smell and feel the coldness nipping at your nose, unfortunately you can tell the film suffered some major cuts in the adaptation process of the screenplay, but doesn't harm the film too badly.<br/><br/>On the train to her foster parents, young Liesel Meminger's (Sophie Nelisse) little brother passes away. Upon arriving to her new home, Liesel butts heads with her new mom Rosa (Emily Watson), while Hans (Geoffrey Rush) teaches Liesel how to read. World War II then breaks out, and their lives cross path with a Jewish run away, Max (Ben Schnetzer). Hans and Rosa then shelter the young man in their basement.<br/><br/>Sophie Melisse gives a terrific first time performance. Her blonde hair, wide blue eyes and ability to speak English and German add for a truly outstanding, and heart-warming performance. Geoffrey Rush gives another fantastic role. Rush and Nelisse have some of the films best scenes. Rush worked extremely well with the new up and coming actress, their chemistry is flawless. Emily Watson is also superb. Her character reminded me a lot of Watson's character in War Horse. Ben Schentzer gives a breakout performance, hope to see him more films soon. <br/><br/>Brian Percival, of Downton Abbey fame, paced the film well. His directing was beautifully captured by Florian Ballhaus. But how a book gives you so much detail and lets your imagination fill in the blanks, the film does not. The film felt extremely gutted. Towards the end of the film situations unfolded slightly to fast, but what do you expect when you're adapting a five hundred and fifty page book into a two hour movie.<br/><br/>Overall, The Book Thief is a terrific, heart-warming film that everyone can enjoy. Not one bad scene. I give The Book Thief an 8 out of 10."

"TheSquiss","3","35","59","12 February 2014"," Somebody stole its heart.
","When I finished reading Markus Zusak's novel, The Book Thief, for the first time, I couldn't speak for almost twenty minutes afterwards. I remained stunned, consumed by my thoughts, absorbed in Liesel's world and bereft as both the final chapter and an episode of my life ended.<br/><br/>Departing Brian Percival's film adaptation I just felt hollow.<br/><br/>The Book Thief is a remarkable story of Liesel Meminger (Sophie Nélisse), a young girl in pre-war Germany, whose communist mother sends her and her brother to live with foster parents. When her brother dies on the train and is hastily buried beside the railway track, the illiterate Liesel steals her first book as it falls from the gravedigger's coat. In this small act of deviance, Liesel finds her greatest resource for survival as World War II unfolds around her in a strange town. Pivotal in her life are her new parents, Hans (Geoffrey Rush) and Rosa Hubermann (Emily Watson), her newfound friend, Rudy (Nico Liersch), and Max (Ben Schnetzer), the Jew hiding under the stairs. And overseeing it all is Death.<br/><br/>Let's deal with him first of all. Certainly when one reads a fine novel images of characters are conjured that remain unique to the reader's imagination. However, no matter how fine an actor he may be, Death emphatically does not sound like Roger Allam. His narration is casual, almost suave, smug even, when the character of Death is written as an entity that is surprised and awed by Liesel and her effect on her little world and on himself. It is the first aspect of The Book Thief that jars, but it certainly isn't the last.<br/><br/>When Liesel arrives at the Hubermann's home, almost the first words out of Rosa's mouth are disgust-filled accusations that Liesel stinks and is flea-ridden. What a pity Percival and his costume and makeup departments didn't read the script prior to shooting the scene; Liesel is dressed impeccably, with tidy hair, not a speck of dirt upon her and giving every impression of being positively fragrant. With the exception of a solitary scene in the final act when Liesel and the townsfolk scrabble amongst rubble, every character is dressed in what appears to be new clothing. It is the correct period, certainly, but at a time of depression and austerity not a single threadbare coat, nor a loose string of wool, nor a tear, patch, smudge or stain is visible. Really? <br/><br/>As for Max, when he stumbles through the Hubermann's door, we are supposed to believe he is on his last legs. I don't look that healthy on a regular Monday morning! And when the comment is made that he is developing bedsores (because he is permanently prone), in the very next scene we watch him walk downstairs to the basement unaided! Sometimes the little things mean a lot and there are just too many little things in The Book Thief to overlook.<br/><br/>With the first impressions of a film being negative, it is a long hard trudge uphill to win the viewer over again. Alas, The Book Thief is not up to the task. The language issue is clumsily managed with German accents and periodic words and lines delivered in German instead of perhaps starting the film in German with subtitles to set the scene and the seamlessly segueing into English. It worked for Valkyrie <br/><br/>Mostly the acting is fine. The sets are well constructed, the props and Nazi regalia are accurate, the cinematography is adequate, the script flows reasonably smoothly But something substantial is missing from The Book Thief. It is empty, incomplete, like a wall built without mortar. The Book Thief is a body without a heart.<br/><br/>Occasionally a film gives a fair reflection of the source novel, The Shawshank Redemption perhaps chief amongst them. The Book Thief is not one of those films. Perhaps if I hadn't seen read the novel, this would be a six star film. However, it warrants no more than three stars for all that it could have been and should have been but absolutely isn't.<br/><br/>For lovers of Zusak's novel, only disappointment can follow. Don't do it. Keep your memories in tact.<br/><br/>And if you haven't read The Book Thief? Go. Do it. NOW! <br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."
"Pmjordan","10","23","37","29 November 2013"," Wonderful perspective
","The movie was a fantastic and intriguing tale of a young girl going through the holocaust. I believe it to be in good taste and well written. As someone who learned of WWII first hand there are parts of the movie that ring true yet they seem to be the start of much controversy. For example there is a review saying that ""90% of Germans had a hand in the extermination of 6 million Jews."" (Please excuse the synopsis of the earlier quote) There was an old lady who I talked to quite frequently about her involvement in WWII, in Dachau, Germany (Concentration camp). One of her first comments to me was, ""I bet you all think we are monsters."" Her reference being in regards to the concentration camp. She went on to tell how thousands upon thousands of Germans truly had no idea what was going on during that time and that they were simply blindly following a man who had taken them out of debt and helped to rebuild a civilization after war. I am by no means condoning what happened but saying that they did not know any better, and with the propaganda during that time how were they to know? She lived in Dachau for her whole life. She told me stories of how, much like Liesel and her family, they did not support the Third Rich but their choice was to blindly support or die. The courage and love shown throughout the movie seem to mask the death and destruction of the war but then again if I had wanted to see a movie about war and death I would have went to see a different film. The tactful way the directors of The Book Thief handled the war from a child's perspective makes it the magical performance it was. I highly recommend this film to all interested in seeing WWII from a different perspective other than the American propaganda we have seen all these years."

","I watched this, and I could barely make it through the movie. Which is quite different to when I read the book.<br/><br/>I read the book in one day. When I finished the book, I was utterly speechless. For literally about an hour. And in that hour, in my head I went over every thing again. Every single aspect of the book. The foreshadowing. The characters I loved. The plot. The ending. The tragically beautiful ending.<br/><br/>First off, the movie does not follow the book. It went through nearly half the book in the first thirty minutes. It left out important facts, scenes, and changed so many things.<br/><br/>For example, in the book Rudy met Liesel by playing soccer. And throwing a snowball at her face. In the movie, Rudy met Liesel by lying and saying that his mother asked him to walk her to school. Now, yes, in the book Rudy did walk her to school- but it actually *was* because Barbara Steiner told her kids to walk with her. <br/><br/>They completely left out the fact that Rudy and Liesel joined a gang to steal things. Or how when Liesel found Rudy, he was already dead. He did not die in her arms.<br/><br/>And Death barely speaks in the movie, it is almost pointless to have him included at all. <br/><br/>For how much they changed, how much they left out, and the fact that the Actors and Actresses looked nothing how I personally imagined them, and the fact that I can't see how anyone who hadn't read the book can follow along with this movie at all, I can only rate this a two."

Her mother buries the boy in a cemetery by the tracks and Liesel picks up a book, ""The Gravediggers Handbook"", which was left on the grave of her brother and brings it with her. Liesel is delivered to a foster family in a small town and later she learns that her mother left her because she is a communist. Her stepmother, Rosa Hubermann (Emily Watson), is a rude but caring woman and her stepfather, Hans Hubermann (Geoffrey Rush), is a simple kind-hearted man. Liesel befriends her next door neighbor, the boy Rudy Steiner (Nico Liersch), and they go together to the school. When Hans discovers that Liesel cannot read, he teaches her using her book and Liesel becomes an obsessed reader. During a Nazi speech where the locals are forced to burn books in a bonfire, Liesel recovers one book for her and the Major's wife Ilsa Hermann (Barbara Auer) witnesses her action. Meanwhile Hans hides the Jewish Max Vandenburg (Ben Schnetzer), who is the son of a deceased friend that saved his life in the war, in the basement of his house and Liesel becomes his friend. One day, Rosa asks Liesel to deliver laundry to the Major and Ilsa invites Liesel to go to her library and tells that she can visit her to read whenever she wants. But in times of war there are many threats and the lives of Liesel, her family and friends will never be the same.<br/><br/>""The Book Thief"" is an American-German production with a beautiful, sensitive and heartbreaking story of love, friendship and obsession for reading books in one of the darkest period of mankind history. The screenplay is original, with Death narrating the plot. One important point of this movie is that it is not about the Holocaust like most of the war dramas. Liesel, Hans, Rosa, Rudy, Ilsa are German common people with feelings, fearing and suffering and eventually dying but they do not necessarily agree with what the Nazi do. The performances are top-notch, highlighting Geoffrey Rush, Sophie Nélisse and Emily Watson. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""A Menina que Roubava Livros"" (""The Girl Who Stole Books"")"

","Sorry, but this film was a HUGE disappointment, and no, I've not read the book.There were too many scenes that made absolutely no sense, a serious case of lazy film making. 1) A mother hiding a Jewish family friend in the basement in nazi Germany will NOT run to her foster daughters school, make a scene, pull the girl out of class on a pretext to tell her that their guest recovered from his illness. A family like that in such peril wants to keep a low profile, not create a spectacle that will be talked about for days. Good news like that can wait until the girl gets home. 2) A girl who is repeatedly burglarizing the home of the local nazi bigwig to steal books, will NOT pause for a lengthy chat with her pal outside the house she is regularly breaking into. The conversation can wait until they get away. 3) Intelligent children on the verge of adolescence in nazi Germany do NOT go screaming at the top of their lungs, ""I hate Hitler!"", however good it might feel. I could go on and on, but I won't. Some good cinematography, some decent acting, and that's about it. Way too many scenes where credibility just went out the window, never to return. Shameless Oscar pandering Holocaust kitsch."
"ferdinand1932","2","56","107","14 January 2014"," How would Lubitsch have done it?
","There's a mainstream middle-brow type of writing and film (music too) which was what the Nouvelle Vague in the 50s called the 'Cinema de Papa', that is to say, it is thoroughly conventional. It tends to platitudes, to echo the views and moral perspectives of the very average. Tradition is not a bad thing, not on its own, yet with a film like The Book Thief, it goes over much repeated material in a form which is so well known as to induce narcolepsy.<br/><br/>While the film is comprised of a number of much adored clichés, especially as it deals with this historical period, it assembles them as pure kitsch.<br/><br/>The world is viewed through the eyes of a child, her parents are forbidding, her father kindly, almost like fairy tale father; the historical and social fabric is rendered in simplistic reductive episodes and the script delivers such gems as, ""A human doesn't have a heart like mine. The human heart is a line, whereas my own is a circle, and I have the endless ability to be in the right place at the right time. The consequence of this is that I'm always finding humans at their best and worst. I see their ugly and their beauty, and I wonder how the same thing can be both."" That is not writing – it's Barbara Cartland. It's the sort of drivel book clubs consume, with its hallmark card insight and ladles of sentiment.<br/><br/>The film proceeds at a solemn pace, suggestive of its deeply human feeling, which means we have to endure two non German actors use something like an anemic Germanic accent with added inflections as though they might come from the shtetl. Other characters are similarly afflicted with shifts between some real German and then awkward accented dialog. Why someone says 'Nein' then continues talking in English is like the muddled logic of a 1960s Disney movie.<br/><br/>Billy Wilder was known to have a sign in his office that read, ""How would Lubitsch have done it?"" It was a check for him, a guide, to find that course of action that was right and sharp. It is true to say that both Wilder and Lubtsich would have passed on, or rewritten, The Book Thief. It is a banal piece of work."
"makenzie-kretz","3","17","29","29 March 2014"," Why I couldn't make myself love this movie
","Recently, I just finished reading this book so I was pretty excited to see the movie. However, there are things in the movie that can't be overlooked by anyone who read the book. The acting was pretty good by most characters, the setting was spot on, and most of the costuming was good. However, there are more negatives I found to the movie than positives. <br/><br/>First off, the movie completely ignored the fact that Liesel did find Max in the crowd of Jews that were parading through the town. In the book, their were three parades total and Liesel was able to find Max in the last one. They talked and Liesel was thrown out of the parade. However, she went back and talked to Max but they were caught again and Max and Liesel were both whipped(Max more than Liesel). I don't understand why they would take this out of the movie as it was one of the most important parts in the book. It showed what happened to Max and the idea of the Nazis being bad that took place throughout the whole book. <br/><br/>Secondly, the movie had Rudy still alive at the end of it and die in Liesel's arm while telling her ""I love you"". In the book, Rudy was dead when Liesel finally found him after the bombing. I get that they needed to show that Rudy loved Liesel and had a crush on her but why couldn't they have done it like the book did? The book has Death explain that Rudy knew the moment he saw her he was going to marry her and that he always asked for a kiss. It also had a moment where they broke into his dad's shop and almost kissed. That would have been much better than doing the cliché scene that they choose to do. <br/><br/>The movie also ignored the fact that Rudy and Liesel joined a gang who stole things and that's why Liesel was brave enough to steal from the mayor's wife. I'm not going to explain anymore about this but that's all I have to say about that. <br/><br/>Lastly, which probably upset me the most, was that they had Liesel tell Rudy and have the other kid find out that she was hiding Max. In the book, no one found out about it and certainly not one of the leaders of Hitler youth. Max was kept a complete secret so it doesn't even make sense for them to add this. Especially because they never followed up or had it lead to anything. <br/><br/>Also, when they had the Jews parading through the town, they had the costuming all wrong. The Jews were coming back from work and should have been in a concentration camp uniform. Instead, they had them in jackets and what not. <br/><br/>So, the movie wasn't too terrible for the most part. However, being someone who read the book, I cannot overlook these key things that they missed. It makes the movie much less than it could have been and it should have been done differently."
"mitchlb452","1","27","50","9 April 2014"," Where to begin...
","I know I might catch a bit of flack for criticizing a movie with such an obviously high production value, so I'll just have to be extremely clear why I am giving this film a one. First, the film is completely historically inaccurate. The books that were on the banned list were books that Hitler considered to be either, Marxist, Communist, or overtly sexual - because Hitler was a man who hated the whoredom that was going on after the treaty of Versailles. Second, there are several songs and speeches from average German citizens about how they were going to wipe out the Jews - this is completely historically inaccurate. People were told that the Jews were spys on the German people and that they needed to be segregated, not wiped out. None of the German people knew anything about the Jews who died in camp due to Typhus or anything of the sort. Now, off the historical inaccuracies, and there were many, I'd like to talk about the plot of the story. The plot was absolutely nothing new. (brief summary/mild spoiler section) A family harbors a German, and people die in bombings... (brief summary over/mild spoiler over) The plot was extremely slow, but worst of all the characters were complete archtypes in every way. Can't we have a single nice SS soldier? Do we have to have an angry German boy who has nothing better to do than spy on every single person and threaten to beat up everybody - don't people realize that even the most evil people need friends? I can't believe a character that just goes around being mean ALL the time and just so happens to be lurking at every moment when he shouldn't be. Come on, people! Finally, this film lies to people rather badly. If there was a single thing that stopped me from giving it a 3 instead of a 1 it was the lying. The film implied that a girl wrote a rather historically inaccurate book and she lived to be 95 etc... but actually the book this film was based on was written in 2005 by a person who knew less about history than the average American (which is saying something). Maybe I am the only person left that doesn't watch period-pieces with a mind solely bent on entertainment, but I find it shocking that people can enjoy this film without bothering to even look up the period and fact check this stuff. Hollywood doesn't care, but I STILL do. 1/10"
"preferred-user","2","30","57","27 February 2014"," weak and pointless
","Many things have been said already, but some elements are more annoying than others. First: the story doesn't go anywhere. The characters do not evolve, by the way nor does the scenery. It is always winter, and just the subtitles tell you that, hey, now we are a year or two later. The scenario is full of holes. For example, the village got bombed in the end (or was it a town? From above it was a town, below it was a village...) because some bombers got the place to bomb wrong - as if the schedule were communicated to Germany before the attack. Bomb alarms tracked all possible ways of bombers, and there was no way that there would have been no alarm because the bombers got lost! The there are other errors - the boy swims plunges into the river to find a book deep underwater, that seconds before was happily floating on the water. It is winter - he plunges with all his clothes. The two kids then stroll happily home (no hurry), and the boys clothes are dry when he arrives at home, although his hair is still wet. Ouch... and there is no end to the errors. There are many other scenario errors, just annoying. Worst of all are the language tricks. The film painfully repeats a term that is meant to be insulting, a term sounding a bit German ""Schweinmensch""... that simply did and does not exist. If you know a bit of German, this is like someone slapping you in the face every 5 minutes - you just can't concentrate on the little that is left of the qualities of this mediocre movie. I can't understand where it got its nominations from..."
"neil-476","8","7","10","27 February 2014"," Held together by a 12 year old
","13-year old Liesel, having lost her family, is placed with foster parents (stern, forbidding Rosa (Emily Watson) and kind, sensitive Hans (Geoffrey Rush)) in a small rural German town during World War II. The film tells the story of her learning to read, her friendship with neighbour boy Rudi, the sanctuary Hans and Rosa offer to Jewish fugitive Max, and the consequences of these and other things.<br/><br/>This film is based on a book I have not read, and I should start by saying that in many respects it strikes me as being somewhat derivative - there appear to be elements sourced from The Diary of Anne Frank in particular, The Pianist, Fahrenheit 451, Neil Gaiman's Sandman comics (the use of Death as a major character - here he is the narrator), and more. But Harry Potter had multiple sources, and look how that turned out. The fact that you can see the antecedents of a particular piece does not necessarily mean that the creator of that secondary piece has not fashioned something which stands on its own two feet.<br/><br/>And that is the case here. For over two hours, Liesel's story keeps us enthralled, moving adeptly between the concerns of a 13-year old and the horrific reality of living in wartime Germany. Emily Watson and Geoffrey Rush (and Roger Allam as the voice-over Death) are the only Names in the cast, and they (and everyone else) are all first rate.<br/><br/>But this film hinges on the ability of French-Canadian Sophie Nélisse, aged 12 while this film was being made, to hold things together - a major 2 hour movie with a great deal of thematic depth, emotional nuance, and intense drama. And she is, quite simply, superb. Her omission from this year's Oscar nominations is regrettable, although I am sure her time will come - already, one can see strong indications of the adult actress she will become. I think she will transition from child performer very well indeed.<br/><br/>Having been thoroughly engaged throughout, the two sequences which make up the ending ripped my heart to pieces and put it together again. I recommend this film highly.<br/><br/>Postscript: Repeated watchings do not diminish this film: it remains superb.<br/><br/>I have subsequently read the book which is, quite simply, one of the most dazzling pieces of writing I have ever encountered.

I decided this is going to be the last Nazi Germany film for me, but mainly because it was so conventional.<br/><br/>The German accent by the main characters is awful, they say words that don't exist, the film is slow and full of stereotypes, dialogues are cheesy and have lots of pauses, the girl is oversweet, the mother overgrumpy (up to an incredible point) and the father overgentle, just to mention some of the things I didn't like.<br/><br/>To make a long story short: a feeling that I was not seeing anything new accompanied me throughout this fairytale with this hackneyed subject, which is one of the reasons why I found it so boring."

","The book is lovely, with solid writing, creative narration throughout by Death, strong character development (even for minor characters), and appropriate characterization of the horrors of Nazi Germany.

The screenplay jumps around the plot (I don't see how anyone who hasn't read the book even can follow it), Death's occasional narration seems random, there is zero character development, and the Nazi atrocity is egregiously soft-pedaled. The only reason I gave the movie any stars at all is because Geoffrey Rush's acting is so good, as always. This movie could have had Oscar written all over it. What a waste. Don't watch the movie. Read the book, instead!"
"bob-the-movie-man","5","9","14","6 March 2014"," Some people clearly ""get this""... but not me
","When a film is narrated by Death himself, you know it's not likely to be a laugh-a-minute sort of film. ""The Book Thief"" - a cinema feature debut by Brian Percival - starts impressively. Death stalks the skies muttering truisms about life and mortality. Decending through he clouds we see a steam train chuffing through a snowy European landscape. Decending through the train's smoke trail we enter the carriage and see Death claim his first victim of the film, all to John William's luscious (and Oscar nominated) score. Unfortunately, this memorable opening scene doesn't translate into the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The Book Thief tells the story of Liesel: a young girl in late 30's Nazi Germany, abandoned by her communist mother into the safer hands of an older childless couple - Hans and Rosa - played by Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson. The illiterate Liesel is taught to read by Hans and this fosters a burning love of books - in stark contrast to the love of burning books of the Nazis. The film centres around her relationship not only with her new adoptive parents, but with her best school friend Rudy Steiner (Nico Liersch) and with Max (Ben Schnetzer) - the Jewish friend of the family who brings both a brotherly companionship and great danger into Liesel's world.<br/><br/>The German village life is nicely portrayed and the everyday activity counterpointed against the bizarre and terrifying goings on of historical events around them. But unfortunately, the story seems to be all over the place. I don't know the ""beloved"" and ""critically acclaimed"" novel by Markus Zusak to know whether it is the source material or the adapted screenplay (by Michael Petroni) that is at fault. But in my eyes, the story just doesn't go in any satisfactory or coherent direction. I was expecting it to be more of a harrowing Holocaust style picture, but it really wasn't (this might be attractive to many viewers). Just when you thought the film would go off in an interesting direction it veered off again down a different path. As such, it lacked any real tension or (apart from one scene) sense of danger. To me, it was just... ""Meh"".<br/><br/>The script is not helped by some clunky lines of dialogue of the ""Liesel, Liesel - you are growing so big"" variety, and uttered by Rush and Watson in a manner reminiscent of Olivier's execrable Jewish turn in ""The Jazz Singer"". Add to that a brutal ending (prepare yourself) and you end up with a rather unsatisfactory and disappointing result.<br/><br/>The two junior leads - Sophie Nélisse and Nico Liersch - acquit themselves well, and their touching scenes together are the best parts of the film. Ben Schnetzer's acting role as Max though was less convincing: not a great performance in my eyes.<br/><br/>I also spare a thought for young actor Nozomi Linus Kaisar. He must have been so thrilled to go and see this flick with his parents on the big screen, only to see his character in the end credits as ""Fat Faced Goalie"". It must have done wonders for his self esteem: what was the director thinking? Overall, I would suggest this is not a film to go out of your way to see at the cinema: wait for a rainy Sunday afternoon on the box for this one.<br/><br/>(If you enjoyed this review, please see my archive and ""Follow the Fad"" at http://bobmann447.wordpress.com. Thanks.)"
"shawneofthedead","7","5","7","5 February 2014"," The story loses some of its steam in migrating from page to screen, but it's still a powerful tale, relatively well-told.
","Many books have been deemed 'unfilmable' - but anyone who's read Markus Zusak's heartbreaking, thought-provoking The Book Thief would think it especially so. An often grim, unrelentingly dark and yet sadly uplifting novel about Nazi Germany in the throes of World War II - narrated by Death itself? Reviews for director Brian Percival's lush, snow-swept movie adaptation have not been kind, suggesting that the book would have been better left alone. It's true, of course, that Zusak's story and characters suffer somewhat in leaving the page. But the film and its titular book thief nevertheless possess a bittersweet charm, buoyed by a host of unforgettable supporting characters.<br/><br/>As the clouds of war and death gather over Germany, Liesel Meminger (Sophie Nélisse) meets her new foster parents: kindly Hans (Geoffrey Rush) and the remarkably abrasive Rosa (Emily Watson). She tries to settle into her new home and school life, striking up a spiky friendship with kiss-hungry Rudy (Nico Liersch) and learning how to read by going through a macabre book about grave-digging with Hans. But, just as she's starting to grow accustomed to her surroundings, Liesel's life will soon change all the more, when Max (Ben Schnetzer), a young, hunted Jew, comes to stay.<br/><br/>As a film, The Book Thief works quite well. Liesel's literary thievery is given a nice cinematic touch: when she snatches a forbidden book off a bonfire, the secrecy of it steams hot and red through her coat. The crucial relationships between Liesel and her extended family - including Rudy and Max - are also given plenty of depth and heart. By the time the bombs start raining down on their little town, the emotional stakes are as high as they need to be. Percival handles some crucial scenes with just the right amount of sentiment, particularly the snowball fight that erupts in the basement: a moment of pure, unexpected joy stolen from a world broken by war and genocide.<br/><br/>The Book Thief benefits greatly from its excellent cast. Nélisse - still so young and raw - wanders effectively through war-torn Germany: she is the focal point of both book and film; the child-like eyes through which we witness great love and also enormous hatred. She's ably abetted by Liersch, a cheeky triumph as Rudy, a character so full of life and charm that he'll warm and break your heart many times over. Rush and Watson, of course, are very good indeed - the former embodies Hans' gentle, loving soul; the latter hides a huge heart beneath the prickly armour in which she cloaks herself all day.<br/><br/>To be perfectly fair, the film occasionally falters beneath the weight of one too many wartime clichés. Without the benefit of a stronger narrative voice (Roger Allam's Death pops in only once in a while to propel the tale forward), The Book Thief feels safe and conventional when some of its ideas are anything but. It's a story, really, of institutionalised death-mongering and the most dangerous and quiet of rebellions, but that doesn't always come through as strongly as it should. The decision to sprinkle some German dialogue into the film feels jarring as well, although that's how Zusak's novel (originally written in English) unfolds.<br/><br/>As for its merits as an adaptation - by necessity, The Book Thief leaves out details galore and metes out tiny injustices to several supporting characters, many of whom arguably represent some of Zusak's greatest insights and ideas. Tucked away in the background is the sad, bitter backstory of Ilsa Hermann (Barbara Auer), the mayor's wife from whom Liesel also filches a few books. Stripped from the film, too, are those characters who have completely bought into the Führer's worst philosophies - including Hans and Rosa's biological son. That removes much of the brooding complexity of the novel, which takes time to consider the collective and individual burdens of guilt borne by Germany and its citizens in relation to the Holocaust. Worst of all is the loss of Death's unique narrative cadences, his grasp of the English language both weird and wonderful.<br/><br/>But, on the whole, The Book Thief is incredibly faithful to the spirit - if not the letter - of Zusak's book. With a few stumbles and omissions, Liesel's heartbreaking journey towards finding - and, inevitably, losing - a family of her own is preserved, and quite affectingly translated on screen. In that sense, while the film may have lost quite a bit of the novel's darker bite and punch, it remains a powerful tale of human connections: the ones we make out of love and fear, and the ones that sustain us in the darkest of times."
"craig_palmer","3","20","40","15 December 2013"," Are you kidding me?
","This is a very beautiful film, with excellent acting and a typically lush score by John Williams. But it has all the depth and complexity of a Hallmark Hall of Fame special. This is war and death as we would like it to be, sentimentalized as a distant memory though the eyes of a child.<br/><br/>There is, for example, a wonderful children's choral rendition of ""Deutschlandlied"" that I suppose was to have the same effect as ""Tomorrow Belongs To Me"" in ""Cabaret"". Except there is no context provided for it. Naziism has become a kind of movie shorthand for evil that requires no explanation or elaboration. The audience will have to be responsible for bringing what it knows of Nazi atrocities to the theater because, aside from breaking a few windows, burning books and roughing a few people up, what was so terrible that people should be afraid of them?<br/><br/>A few key scenes I loved and will always remember but I have to admit I found myself reaching for the remote more than once to speed things up, getting the point of a scene long before the characters did. I could hear sniffles throughout the theater and thought, really? You're buying this? <br/><br/>All-in-all, a well-meaning but misguided attempt in the vein of ""Life Is Beautiful"" and ""The Boy In The Striped Pajamas""."

Why Max leaves home hale and hearty (the first time we see him in the film) then arrives at Lisl's house a wreck (the next time we see him) is entirely up to the viewer to imagine. Many incidents are unrealistic: people secretly sheltering a jew during World War II just would not behave in many of the ways we're shown in the movie: they'd keep the lowest conceivable profile. When people are killed by bombs landing on houses they don't emerge nicely dressed but dusty and without a mark on them. The way the cast speak, in English with pseudo-German accents, might be acceptable, but throwing in occasional German words (""ja"", ""nein"", ""und"") is just plain dumb. With its score that turns on swelling strings every time something heart rending happens and an unnecessary voice-over that inanely purports to come from some supernatural death or god figure, this film is clearly aimed at those with high appreciation of all things saccharine. The film is not moving, just tedious. The plot is neither convincing nor uplifting, just trite and often unrealistic."
"JohnLeeT","10","32","72","6 October 2013"," Another Stunning Performance by Emily Watson
","A very moving interpretation of the famed novel is anchored solidly by a mesmerizing, dynamically stunning performance by Emily Watson. While she is aided by a wonderful turn by Mr. Rush, it is Watson who is the pillar of acting power that supports the entire film and is the center of suppressed emotion that bubbles beneath a seemingly self-protective surface. She is stellar in this role and as usual her artistic gifts give the film gravitas and direction. There are scenes between she and the child and with her husband that will sear your soul and touch your heart more deeply than anything ever put on screen. This is a performance that deserves an outrageously delayed Academy Award for Ms. Watson, even if it is a misplaced supporting actress one. It would be ironic if she receives her first Oscar for supporting because she is actually the unforgettable centerpiece of every piece she appears in and defines the word ""star."" This film is worth seeing if only to witness another incredibly beautiful performance by Emily Watson and to watch the most truly gifted actor of our time add another triumph to her majestic career.<br/><br/>5/24/14: Having just watched this wonderful film with family at home, I am driven to return again to my keyboard and restate my initial reaction to the absolutely wondrous performance of Emily Watson as Rosa. On second viewing, I found myself even more profoundly touched by the humanity in her portrayal of Rosa and the subtlety that Watson uses so skillfully to bring her character to life. Rush is superb as well and their relationship is beautifully realized on film. It is Emily Watson, however, who reaches so deeply into the life of Rosa and makes her character's heart beat while at the same time touching our own. This is another star in the crown of unforgettable performances by a uniquely gifted and magnificent actress."
"doug_park2001","9","9","16","28 February 2014"," ""Words are life, Liesel""
","THE BOOK THIEF is the most poignant and haunting film that I have seen in some time, one that will stay with me for years. Sophie Nélisse gives an outstanding performance as Liesel Meminger, an initially illiterate but incredibly imaginative and independent girl who's full of unique metaphors and similes --e.g., ""The sun looks like a silver oyster""--and, with the help of various diverse people, discovers the power of books and the written word while living with foster parents in Hitler's Germany. Virtually every other player in this film gives a fine performance, and the very special narrator, Roger Allam as the somber yet strangely unforbidding voice of Death, adds a distinct touch, coming in at just the right crucial moments.<br/><br/>I have never seen anything remotely like THE BOOK THIEF and can only say that I wish there were more like it. The best way I can describe it is like a dark yet ultimately heartwarming Disney film for adults. It is, of course, a Fox 2000 production expertly directed by Englishman Brian Percival, spoken mostly in English--albeit, with some speeches in German w/English subtitles--with a cast of various nationalities. Still, the characters are all most convincingly German. It captures the lives of ordinary German citizens during WWII in a way I've never seen done in any non-German film. The accents and various mannerism are very, very real and immediate. The cinematography is also excellent, with stunning views of the town and countryside and, even when viewed from approaching Allied bombers, the sky above them. THE BOOK THIEF is driven mostly by its characters, themes, and atmosphere. Nevertheless, even if it takes a while to find itself, the plot also makes perfect sense (allowing for the various elements of magical realism), moves at a natural pace, and is ultimately quite gripping.<br/><br/>Though I loved every second of this film, a common criticism seems to be that it simply does not do justice to Markus Zusak's original novel. Film adaptations, of course, often make serious departures from the books that spawned them, and it's fairly impossible to completely capture a really great novel on screen. Though I have not yet read the novel, I could tell that the directors and writers had a lot to pick and choose regarding what/whatnot to show. There are a few patchy spots: In particular, I wanted a little better sense of Liesel's origins. In this respect, I can only say that this film should prove an excellent illuminator for the book, which I am now eager to read."

Strong performances from Geoffrey Rush, Emily Watson, and newcomer Sophie Nélisse who plays the little girl Liesel with a stunning performance who has a bright future ahead in the film industry.The film clothing & speaking were all perfect for the era of the film its set in, as was the perfect scenery that was breathtaking and captivating, and I felt transported back to 1941 German.<br/><br/>The emotional impact & Captivating and extremely powerful scene make this one of the best film your see in a long time, i know i normal say this about some action film but this is just an outstanding journey in the heart of human life seeing through death eye's as the literary vehicle of death as the narrator really is a masterstroke and works perfectly giving a sense that death is always with us you cant live forever. I know from the trailer your thinking this is going to be a slow boring film but if you think that you seriously are missing out on one of the most emotional, powerful, beautifully written film's of 2014 that i recommend seeing at the cinema or owning on DVD.<br/><br/>The ending of this film really blow me away with just how beautiful & emotionally fitting it was as you hear death narrating Liesel life to the very end in present day such a perfect way to end a film on a sad happy note really brings you to tears."
"rightwingisevil","Null","17","36","13 January 2014"," Boring and predictable with hollow storyline
","borrowed its ideas heavily from 'Diary of Anne Frank', the differences only put an orphan girl into the hands of another poor family for welfare purpose just like American foster care system, making money from the social welfare system. the girl was not hiding in the attic, on the contrary, could attend school regularly. the role of anne frank was cunningly adapted to become a Jewish young man, hiding in the attic first then later staying in the basement for couple of years. the whole movie was just barely watchable with good acting from some of the best old actors. there was nothing great enough to move you or deep enough to touch your soul. the whole storyline was just in the boring rigid predictable straight-lined, and also absurdly with a stupid narrative voice of the 'death'. funny thing was the writings on the walls in the basement and the books in the private library, all in English instead of German language. the whole movie only gave you a going-nowhere hollow story, a plain and numb narration of a story told in the form of a film not far away from a printed book. nothing bad but nothing great either. have expected too much but unfortunately turned out to be just a lukewarm, quite forgettable, pointless film. there's nothing to be praised about like most of the viewers' comments. if you guys were so easily to be satisfied, it would only give those mediocre novelists, screenplay writers, directors not to try harder and do better.<br/><br/>final verdict: a very boring film from a very boring novel, then adapted into a boring screenplay, then directed by a not-quite-talented director. a quite forgettable lukewarm film."

","I finished the audio-book and was blown away by the creativity and impact of the narration of such a beautiful and powerful story. Literally, goose-bumps, tears, the whole package. Then, as I often do, I wanted to see the movie adaptation to see how my visualization of the characters and locations differed. Big mistake! <br/><br/>To do the book justice, the movie needed to be 4 or 5 hours long so I was expecting a lot of abridgment - that's par for the course when making the leap from a long novel into a short(ish) film. Even so, I found that badly done. Whole chapters which defined relationships between characters were compacted into 3 or 4 seconds of screenplay. Worse still, what I was not expecting was the flagrant way in which some of the remaining key elements were rewritten unnecessarily into cliché movie scenes which were both less plausible and less entertaining. This is not book-snobbery. I have found many screenplays of great books to have been done perfectly and result in truly great films. This was just not one of them.

","I've watched many holocaust movies however this one was one of the worst ones i've seen. There were way too many ""BS"" scenes and half-way through the movie I actually started to get quite bored.<br/><br/>Firstly the ""attempted German"" by Geoffrey Rush is horrible beyond repair. All due respects to him being a great actor, but casting him in this one was a fail. You sometimes catch him attempting German with a subtle American accent which mixed like oil and water. Apart from the frequent ""Ja!"" (Yes) at the suffix of each sentence, His attempt was nothing short of terrible.<br/><br/>The last 35mins of the film felt like the Producer and Director both nodded at each other in reference to sealing off this movie before it drags on like a game of boring tennis.<br/><br/>What also annoyed me was the scene where Max (the Jew) walks out in the night during heavy bombings smiling to the Sky, while the locals all camped in basements. I'm yet to see any person actually perform this action in the act of warfare.<br/><br/>Eitherway this film was flawed with bad (attempted) accent which rivaled John Travolta's Serbian accent attempted in Killing Season coupled with BS scenes and attempts while portraying a True Story.

","If you have read the novel as I have, you will be incredibly disappointed watching this dreadful movie. Firstly, the child acting was horrific. I feel a little harsh bashing young actors but come on! Sophie Nélisse was emotionless and just god awful. Both her and Nico Liersch sounded as if they were reading straight from the script. (SPOILER) When Liesel's family and friends die, the girl barley cried. I didn't feel her agony, her pain, her fear.. but when reading the novel I couldn't stop crying. Also, the voice of death sounded like this should have been a Disney movie. In the novel, death is telling the story with such magnificent and touching words. You only heard death speak in the movie just a few times which was quite annoying and interruptive. Lastly, at the end when everyone dies, no one is bleeding, no one has injuries, they died without so much as dirt on their faces which was incredibly unrealistic. If you enjoyed the novel as much as I did, save yourself the disappointment. Throughout the whole movie I kept checking my clock to see how much longer I would have to sit through this misery. This movie barley describes WWII let alone the Holocaust .Terrible directing, terrible acting, terrible movie."

","While I agree with most of the positive reviews, there are some weird aspects about this movie:<br/><br/><ul><li>It starts in 1938, when Liesel is brought to her new foster parents by her real mother; she herself isn't able to take care of her anymore, because she is a communist. Obviously everybody knows about that, and yet she is moving freely across the country, 5 years after Hitler's ""Machtergreifung""? Is she on KZ leave? Or taking a holiday from the underground?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There is a book burning in the little town, where Liesel is living now, at the end of 1938. But the book burnings in Germany were 1933! Did they store the unwanted books for nearly 6 years, just to have a nice warm fire in the winter?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>At the beginning, Liesel can't read or write, though she is about 12 years old! Why? She is able to do it, as we see later on. There was compulsory education in Germany, even for kids of communists!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why is the Jew Max sleeping with a copy of Hitler's infamous ""Mein Kampf"" in his hands?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>From where gets a poor family as the Hubermanns real coffee in 1941? This was pure luxury at that time!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>And why are most people speaking English with a German accent, interspersed with German words like ""Saukerl"", while other people speak German?</li></ul><br/><br/>The last question has his answer probably in the fact that many of the actors are German and the (english-speaking) stars more or less adapted their style. I suppose that the other points have their cause in the fact that director and author had some problems with the conversion of a book of 500-something pages into a movie of 2 hours. Perhaps I have to read the book ..."

","The creators of The Book Thief have somehow managed to make a movie about World War II in which many people are killed but no one ever seems to be hurt or to suffer pain. The two leads do not age convincingly from 12 in 1938 to almost 17 in early 1943. The device of having Death do the voice-over narration trivializes what the characters are supposed to be going through; Death's slightly bored perspective is that everybody dies sooner or later, so that 15 or 85 doesn't matter in the long run. The most that can be said is that the production design is attractive and all the kids look adorable in their HJ and BDM uniforms."

","Worst war film I have ever seen. You felt no real compassion for any of the characters or the Jewish people. The main part of the film ended in 1942 and then it jumped forward 3 years to the end of the war. At this point you were left wondering what had happened to the characters in the mean time as it gave no explanation to where Liesel or Max had been in those three years or how if there had been contact between them in those three years. The film also went at an incredibly slow pace which made me feel like I could have read the book quicker. It felt more like an episode of Downton Abbey than Schindler's List, which I'm sure the director hadn't intended. The only good part of the film was Geoffrey Rush but even he was not at his best. Overall, I believe the film does not do the book any favours at all and you should avoid at all costs."

"dave-mcclain","3","3","4","10 December 2015"," ""The Book Thief"" stole over two hours of my time and gave me precious little in return.
","""The Book Thief"" (PG-13, 2:11) is one of those movies whose title tells you very little about the film, so allow me to fill you in. It's the story of life in Hitler's Germany, as seen through the eyes of a pretty and self-assured blonde tween named Liesel (Sophie Nelisse). She is ""The Book Thief"". Even though she doesn't know how to read, she takes a book that she sees someone drop on the ground. When she finally learns to read, the book thievery increases. She takes a book from a houseguest and later breaks into the local mayor's home (repeatedly) to avail herself of his large personal library. Of course, she refers to her activities as ""borrowing"".<br/><br/>After Liesel is, for her protection, given up by her communist mother, she is raised by a childless middle-aged couple (played by Oscar-nominee Emily Watson and Oscar-winner Geoffrey Rush) in a small German town. Liesel's new mother is harsh but is hiding a big heart under her gruff exterior, while Liesel's new father is kind and nurturing. He teaches her to read, and a young man who comes to hide in their home (for reasons you can probably guess) teaches her to express herself. Meanwhile, Liesel forms a close friendship with a cocky, but sweet neighbor boy. Even as the world around her seems to become more dangerous and make less sense by the day, Liesel's love of learning , her growing creativity and the support of those around her carry her through.<br/><br/>After so many movies about Nazi Germany, I give this film credit for its realism and unusual focus. The restrictions, bigotry, fear and paranoia bred by the Nazis is treated as a simple matter-of-fact, giving us insight into what life was like for average Germans during World War II, and why they tolerated it. The film features a girl who really wants to read (good), but shows her stealing without consequences (not so good) and it's inexplicably narrated by Death (as in the Grim Reaper). The story is fairly interesting and the set decoration is great, but if you're interested in how the Nazi regime affected the lives of its people, I'd recommend 1993's ""Swing Kids"" (with a young Christian Bale) or 2008's heartbreaking ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"". ""The Book Thief"" is too long as it tells a story that is only barely worthy of telling. ""C"""

","Not only is this film bad, it is also insulting, fake, banal, and kitsch and an insult not only to the history of cinema but also to humanity and to everyone who suffered during the holocaust. <br/><br/>It is in effect a Nazi film.<br/><br/>For these reasons, it at first seems strange that so many people have eulogised this film, giving it four and five stars. <br/><br/>First off, it's directed by a non-entity, not a real film director. What is the explanation for this? Maybe that a real filmmaker would smell a rat a mile off.<br/><br/>It's an American AND a German funded film, which unsurprisingly portrays the Germans in a good light i.e the REAL Germans are nice and kind people in the film and the horrible Nazis are in the background. So, it in effect is a form of contemporary German propaganda,(by the way most films are propaganda), that seeks to imply that the Germans were as much victims of the war as the Jews themselves. <br/><br/>Hmmm!<br/><br/>I don't actually remember reading in the history books that the Germans were the ones that forced themselves into the gas chambers. Yes, I suppose the Germans were victims for being forced against their will to line up naked male and female civilians, whole families, next to ditches across Europe and to machine gun them into them. Yes, the poor Germans who pushed whole villages into barns and then set them alight.<br/><br/>In the book thief we have two aryan children who look like they are right out of a Nazi film of the 1930's. The Disney-esque, banal mood of the film, contributes to this at every turn. <br/><br/>The film is another one of those fake art house films. i.e. an art house film that is not an art house film. To that effect, we see Germans speaking English the whole time (?) but every so often they say a couple of words in German, (?) This is about as nauseating as it gets. <br/><br/>They clearly did not use the German language throughout with subtitles, because this would have led the target audience of compliant and brainwashed drones to avoid watching it, and the one thing about propaganda is that it only works wholesale.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this film is so bad it is actually brilliant. Art is prophetic. If this film is the post- modern equivalent of a Nazi film we are all in trouble. Economic depression, films that are just escapist lies, fake emotions,...maybe another Hitler is around the corner.<br/><br/>What is most frightening is that no professional film reviewers seem to have either seen any of this, nor put it in these terms. Maybe they don't want to bite the hand that feeds them."

","Acting was amazing but the script was horrible. When my wife and I saw the movie, within the first five minutes I said to her, ""This isn't at all what I thought it would be."" This was due, mainly, to a voice-over of death (which continued throughout the movie) and could not have been more cheesy. It took a dramatic time in history and made it seem like a filler. The movie would have been much more powerful if the death scenes were acted out rather than death saying ""it was just so easy. Everyone thought she was snoring."" That said, there were some extremely powerful relationship moments. If it weren't for the cheesiness--if they could have really grasped the WWII concept--this movie would have been a 10.

Good Nazi propaganda movie about hard but tolerable life of a small Nazi district in Stuttgart during the war. Bad British Avros who bombed the city and killed very peaceful civilians. I felt even sorrow when the truck full of Nazi soldiers including the character of Geoffrey Rush was exploded. What is that? Another Hollywood vision of the life of Germans during the war? Why is it so glamour? Why is it so untrue and unfair to Jewish people? Honestly, I didn't feel much about the girl robbing the house of the burgmeister and her insinuations on the theme of the Nazism. It was not convincible. I didn't understand what was the sense of inclusion of the Death narrations either. It's trivial for everyone that war is bad and people die. It gave me strong impression like of watching a movie for kids, and not for adults. Those narrations and the final image of Death walking along the streets completely disconnect from the content and from the whole movie.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is a classical example of a glamour and banal Hollywood production; the example of how the movies should not be made.<br/><br/>I'd recommend watching Life is Beautiful and Pianist instead, and of course Schindler's List.

Anything in this book that had to do with the power of words and books has been erased and sent into oblivion. This takes away the entire purpose and the meaning of the book and the story. I was expecting so much and they could have done so much with it, but instead they chose to do what every movie based on a book does - erase, delete, add and change, until the work is no longer recognizable. I cannot even evaluate the movie on its own, because it is NOT a stand alone movie. It IS based on a book, and if you read the book, you will see that the power it was supposed to have is nowhere to be seen. As for the story, it is a good one and I would recommend it.

","I can't quite recall how this film found its way into my queue, but what a shame it did. From the opening line of the narrator's--and the narrator is Death--we knew it was a stinker. I understand it's based on a novel, and I hear the novel is good. Given the nature of the film I have a hard time believing that; but if that is the case, this may well be the mostly poorly adapted screenplay ever. But speaking from the strictly filmic vantage point it's bloody awful too; the story is set in Holocaust Germany (as if that hasn't been overdone) but none of the characters speak German; they all speak English, affecting German accents, while throwing in the occasional German word (e.g., nein) for effect. It's embarrassing; you're embarrassed for the actors. But the story is terribly contrived, the acting melodramatic, and the lines are horrific, the stuff of high school drama, obvious & patronizing. But above all those things, the story's just plain lame, for too many reasons to count. For starters, the narrator (Death) turns out also to be the main character. Aside from the fact that he's given the worst lines in the film, what's more offensive to the viewer's sensibilities is that Death upstages the Holocaust & WWII; it reduces them to supporting cast. A literary faux pas to say the least. Nevertheless, we sat through this stinker of a film and were rewarded appropriately: the closing lines of the film belong to the narrator's and they're equally if not more embarrassing than the opening ones. We were laughing out loud precisely where we weren't supposed to. Seriously, do yourself a favor; skip this movie. It's 2+ hrs of your life you'll never recover."
"sashabunakova","9","4","7","28 February 2014"," Fantastic film, but greatly misunderstood
","From what I've gathered, many of my fellow reviewers have not read the book, and therefore misinterpreted the meaning behind this extremely well put together film. I would like to stress that although it is set during WWII, the war is NOT the central idea of the plot. I have seen complaints that it is not an accurate representation of the Holocaust, that it does not take into account the true horrors of WWII, that it is too sentimental and unrealistic, etc etc. While I completely agree that it was a horrific event resulting in millions of futile deaths, THE HOLOCAUST IS NOT THE MAIN FOCUS HERE. I believe that the whole purpose of the novel (and consequently the film) was to portray the war in a different light, from the perspective of someone who is supposedly the 'enemy'. What the film shows is that ultimately, everyone is a victim in one way or another. Another major theme in the story is childhood. Although narrated by Death, Liesel is the main character and the film is centered around her life. I'm sure you can all agree that children very often only have a vague idea of the world around them, as they live in the moment and don't focus on the bigger picture. As a result, life seems to pass them by, and for this reason, I don't see how you could expect the film to focus exclusively on the Holocaust as it was not something children would have been aware of anyway at the time. Instead, the film focuses on how WWII affected people indirectly, whatever side they were on. Other themes in the film include sacrifice, courage, and, as the blurb of the book says, 'the power of books to feed the soul'. Books are a refuge for Liesel as she is seeking comfort in words in the midst of the very bleak and uncertain world around her. Many reviews have compared this film to Anne Frank's story, which again is invalid because although the film focuses on the struggles that Jews faced, it is not the main message that it tried to get across. I am in no way disregarding Anne Frank, but she is only one example and we use her diary as the universal example simply because it is one of the very few surviving documents which provide a realistic observation on the experiences of Jews during WWII. The film is largely about the impact on Liesel's family of hiding Max, which people disregard because 'they don't take the Jews themselves into account', yet where is the widespread recognition of Miep Gies, Johannes Kleiman and Victor Kugler, the people who helped Anne Frank's family go into hiding? The whole point is that the film focuses on everyone, not just the Jews, which I feel is just as important to take into account because they sacrifice themselves and their safety for others. While I do think that the film could have adopted a slightly more morose atmosphere in order to achieve the intended effect, I understand how this may have been difficult to capture on the big screen. This more 'realistic' mood is much more prominent in the book as it has an omniscient, objective narrator. People have also bashed the film for being 'too sentimental'. I do agree that the movie industry likes to romanticise every little thing, but on the other hand, I think we are forgetting the effect that the deaths of many people had on their families and their friends still left alive. If you think back to the scenes with Max and his illness, it was not romanticised at all. Neither was the extensive patriotic scene at the book-burning. In short, although set in Nazi Germany, this film is not, and was never intended to be, ABOUT Nazi Germany. It is about the indirect impact of the war on individuals and how they choose to cope with it, and we learn that different characters deal with it in different ways. Although historical context is provided, the film is centered around the overall impact, rather than the technicalities, of the Second World War. I admire Zusak's alternative perspective of the war, and I admire the producer's attempts at reconstructing these ideas so that they are accessible to a wider audience. I think that in order to fully understand it, you would have to read the book and let the words sink in. Overall, a fantastic movie, but be careful not to judge it based on appearances."
"3xHCCH","8","4","7","18 February 2014"," Practically Perfect Book Adaptation
","I read the novel ""The Book Thief"" by Markus Zusak because this was required reading for one of my kids in her English class, and I would like to be able to help in case she needed it. For very young readers, it may not be the easiest book to start reading as the beginning chapters were rather mysteriously written, and the experience of any war may not be familiar. Despite a difficult beginning, the book eventually absorbed me in its tale of life in Germany during World War II. <br/><br/>The story was innovatively narrated by Death himself. The language used by the author was poetic, rather than straightforward. The author's use of descriptive metaphors was very original and evocative. This made the book an exercise in imagination as you picture the movie in your mind as the less than pleasant story unfolded with the beautiful prose. When the movie came out, we went to watch it to see if our movie in our heads matched the one envisioned by the filmmakers.<br/><br/>It is 1939 in Nazi Germany. Liesel Meminger loses her mother and brother, and was brought to foster parents Hans and Rosa Hubermann on Himmel Street. From her beloved foster father Hans, Liesel develops a life-long love affair with the written word. This beautiful obsession happened as she struggled through the difficulties of war, the air raids, and the deaths; even if she had to steal the books she reads. <br/><br/>For me, the actors cast did not really exactly match with the way I imagined Liesel, the Hubermanns and the other characters in my head, but they did very well in their assigned roles. <br/><br/>Sophie Nelisse, the pretty child actress who played Liesel, did creditably well in her difficult role. She had won an acting award already in her native Canada with her very first film role at age 10. Now 12 years old, with her riveting lead performance here, it looks like she has a promising international career ahead of her as well.<br/><br/>Award-winning actors like Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson definitely brought on the acting gravitas required for a serious piece like this. Both of them were so effective in being able to convey their emotions with only their facial expressions, even without a word being said.<br/><br/>Special mention has to be given to young Nico Liersch who played Liesel's best friend, Rudy Steiner. He plays his rascal role so naturally and charismatically. Fortunately, Liersch also had excellent chemistry with Nelisse, so we will also cherish the relationship between Rudy and Liesel.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Ben Schnetzer, the actor who played Max Vandenburg, I felt was a bit lacking in his performance. Max is a heavier and more dramatically-loaded role than Rudy, yet he failed to connect with me the way Schnetzer portrayed him.<br/><br/>The script is actually almost a perfect adaptation of the book by Michael Petroni, which is a good thing for the book's fans. The script shares the same love for words as the book does. The film touches on all the important parts of the book. <br/><br/>As directed by Brian Percival, the film unfolds more literally than the book. However, we will care about what happens to Liesel's foster parents, her best friend Rudy, her secret Jew friend in the basement Max, her book benefactress Ilsa Herrmann, and of course, Liesel herself. The horrors of war were still there, but these were shown very sensitively in full consideration of the young audience it targets. <br/><br/>Although as in most adaptations, due to the constraints of a reasonable running time, the film skips through many details. In particular, the ending felt rushed as it was shown as a montage of only wordless scenes and dramatic music (by John Williams), with the story told via a voice- over narration. The words used were very eloquent, and can still evoke deep emotion. But those who read the book know that the missing details could have made a more dramatic impact that what was shown."

","There are movies that can be put in a category appropriately labelled 'Oscar bait'; and if there is one film that exemplifies that best this year, it is The Book Thief. Just like any cold or flu, 'Oscar bait' films have very clear symptoms. For starters, setting the film during The Academy Awards' favourite time in history, World War II is a must; having a young lead performance is another; previous academy award winners and nominees within the cast (in this case the illustrious Geoffrey Rush and the always impressive Emily Watson) always helps; and finally, the icing on the cake is the heavy-handed and manipulating (to the point of distracting) forced drama (in this case, a completely unnecessary voice-over). Put all those factors together and you have one of the most formulaic and familiar films during Oscar season this year. Read more!<br/><br/>I have not had the pleasure to read Markus Zusak's supposed enthralling source material in which the film is based off of. The novel has received an overwhelming amount of accolades for presenting a story through the perspective of an unlikely narrator, but within Brian Percival's cinematic adaptation, unfortunately, this narration is far from effective.<br/><br/>The Book Thief is by no means a terrible film. Mediocre at best, the film is a slow, long-winded feature that check-marks most of the essential plot-points of its far superior World War II predecessors. With just over a two hour run time, The Book Thief uses morbid images of death, sometimes involving children, to get its dramatized point across and elicit notions of pure sentiment.<br/><br/>The film follows Liesel Meminger (French-Canadian Sophie Nélisse from Monsieur Lazhar), a newly orphaned child who is in the midst of pre-war Germany in 1938. Liesel is sent to live with a new family, Mr. & Mrs. Hans Hubermann (Rush & Watson) and like any child her age, she is very much reserved towards the strangers she must now call her parents. Hans does everything in his power to comfort his new daughter, finding a common passion in literature. Liesel, who is unable to read before she arrives to her new home on Heaven St., seeks the guidance of her new father, and together they find a small solace amongst the raging political ideology and war propaganda within Germany at the time. As you would expect, Liesel befriends a young, lemon- haired boy Rudy (Nico Liesch), and together the film recounts the innocent relationship these two share during one of the most atrocious times in our world's history.<br/><br/>The scenes between Rudy and Liesel are some of the best within the film, surely capturing the simplicity of children trying to make sense of a very complex time. The very fabric of the relationships and loyalties between the people she holds dear to her are tested with the sudden arrival of Max (Ben Schnetzer), the son of an old friend of Hans. With cultural tension and war on the rise, Liesel and her family must turn a blind eye to patriotism in favour of humanity, finding a new way to survive without ever compromising their own integrity.<br/><br/>Some of the finer points of The Book Thief comes from its impeccable acting talent. Nélisse embodies the young heart of Liesel and makes the character her own. While Rush and Watson make the best of the material they are given, Rush is always shining, capturing our hearts and the heart of Liesel any which way he can. His affections are as sweet as the lumps of sugar he magically surprises her with.<br/><br/>Light on any real emotional responses, The Book Thief will less than likely make a dent during the award season. It'll probably be left mostly forgotten by the time nominations come early next year.<br/><br/>Rush is a fine actor joined by an equally talented cast. Despite the great acting unfortunately, The Book Thief will surely be crippled for its clichéd war narrative that we have seen time and time again. Applause is surely warranted for choosing to focus on elaborate set pieces, excellent production design, authentic filming locations in Berlin and talented actors, however the film neglects its chance to actually drop any emotional bombs on its audience."

","Greetings again from the darkness. You may be familiar with the source material - the huge best selling novel from Markus Zusak. If not, you may be surprised at the ""through the eyes"" of an illiterate, orphaned child's perspective of the German home front during WWII. You may be more surprised to learn that it's narrated by The Grim Reaper (British actor Roger Allam), and includes a Nazi rally, book-burning, bomb shelters, a look at the anti-Jew and anti-Communist movements, the German conscription/military draft and the dangers associated with hiding a Jew in one's basement.<br/><br/>There is no denying the melodramatic nature of the story, but this one avoids schmaltz thanks to the remarkable performances of the great Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson, and especially Sophie Nelisse as the incredibly perceptive Liesel who provides the innocence and powers of observation that prove to us (and Death) that good people will do extraordinary things no matter the atrocious conditions.<br/><br/>As Liesel's foster parents, Rush plays a warm-hearted WWI veteran and Watson plays a cantankerous, grounded woman hiding the emotion she carries for her husband and new daughter. The biggest piece of hiding involves Max, a young Jewish man who is the son of a soldier who once saved the life of Rush's character. Max and Liesel have a wonderful bond as he teaches her to speak through her eyes and she nurses him back to health by sharing her new found joy of reading.<br/><br/>The ghost of the boy who lived in the shadows ... from H.G. Wells ""The Invisible Man"" plays a key role as Liesel tries to make sense of a world that delivers a daily dose of relentless danger. As she develops her love and dependence on the written word, it's clear that to survive in these times, one must have something that provides hope. The unusual story structure with the odd narrator, and a mix of wry humor, keep us connected with the characters and allow the humanity to shine through. Still, I challenge you to watch this without a lump in your throat. www.MovieReviewsFromTheDark.wordpress.com"
"therunner42","9","5","10","16 January 2014"," We've very talented down here.
","The Book Thief tells the story of a young girl called Liesel (played by the beautiful and very talented Sophie Nellisse) who is abandoned by her mother in Germany just a couple of years before World War II. She is taken into care by the lovely Hans (Geoffrey Rush ) and the equally non-lovely Rosa (Emily Watson ) as the three of them try to survive and stay moral in the perils of Germany under the Hitler rule. Based on the book By Australian author Marcus Zussak, this film will bring out one of two reactions in you. If you haven't read the book you will love it. It is an extraordinary tale and highly compelling. However if you've read the book (and by all reports most people who read the book become obsessed with it) you will find it slow and be disappointed. Try to keep in mind that while reading a book everybody directs their own film in their head but with an unlimited budget and dream cast. I thought this was a beautiful film and loved every second. It is a real tribute to the talent off Zussak who coined the tale in his debut novel. Geoffrey Rush is also amazing and I just want to mention (okay brag) they are both Australians. We've very talented down here."

","There is a waterfall of fantastic reviews for this flick. Of course, it is perfectly fine. We all have different tastes. One's treasure could be someone else's junk.

All those ridiculous German accents ( with an occasional German word snuck in), all these million times chewed upon saccharine sweet messages, that everybody enjoys, but nobody takes seriously. And, above all not a single one original idea, even a sentence. So, if you like a bit of kitsch, nicely colored, wrapped in shiny paper, knock yourself out. You could do worse.

","Adapting Markus Zusak's seriously popular book that has a ripe awards and box office subject matter – one would suspect that The Book Thief would have been a resounding success both commercially and critically but instead what occurred was a muted release with an equally low key response from fans and in the aftermath of its cinematic run The Book Thief will be lucky to live on in people's minds thanks to a film treatment that inspires nothing within thanks to a pedestrian effort from almost all involved.<br/><br/>There is no question about The Book Thief being a very pretty motion picture with a nice visual design but the films lovely and well-designed settings only but harbor a story that sadly fails to translate the emotional investment to many readers had obviously found within the book, what is left is a cold and distant film that only ever shows brief glimpses of characters becoming something more for the viewers to invest in.

"l_rawjalaurence","5","3","5","15 April 2014"," Disappointingly Executed Version of an Intriguing Text
","Brian Percival's film of the Markus Zuzak novel contains two stand-out performances from Sophie Nelisse and Nico Liersch as the two children Liesel and Rudi. Caught in a complex world they understand little about, they try to pursue their day-to-day lives under the most trying circumstances. Liesel, transplanted to a German town and billeted with a new family, has to cope with a domineering foster-mother (Emily Watson) while trying to manage at a new school where she is taunted for her inability to read. Rudi, the perfect example of a blond-haired Aryan, ends up rebelling against his prescribed destiny, which is to be sent away for ""special training"" in the Nazi army. Apart from these performances, however, the film is a disappointment. The narrative unfolds at a sluggish pace, with treacly music by John Williams lending a sentimental edge to a profoundly unsentimental story. There is also the question of accents: one wonders why the main characters have to speak in the faux-German English accents punctuated with occasional German words ""Ja"" or ""Nein"" or ""und,"" reminiscent of the British sitcom 'ALLO 'ALLO. This seems all the more incongruous when the script is peppered with American English neologisms. Why the characters couldn't have spoken in their normal voices seems a mystery to me. Thematically speaking, the film has a lot to say about the power of writing - even in a repressive regime such as Nazı Germany, Liesel and her Jewish friend Max Vandenburg (Ben Schnezter) understand how important it is to read and write. Liesel's adoptive father Hans Huberman (Geoffrey Rush) thinks much the same way - despite limited reading skills, he encourages Liesel to write all her new words on a board to compile her own dictionary. At the end of the film Liesel emerges as a powerful figure, one who can even cheat Death (Roger Allam) in the sense that her words - and her thoughts - live on through her books. THE BOOK THIEF has a promising idea, to be sure; it's just a pity it could not have been better executed."

","This movie definitely was not what I expected. It was better. I had seen the previews a while back and knew this was one I had to see.<br/><br/>The story takes place in Germany at the threshold of World War II. It is narrated by Death, whose commentary on events gives one a new perspective. And, unlike other movies set during WWII, this gives a more one-sided view. It shows the impact on one young girl as she goes from a timid child being sent to live with foster parents to enduring the worst part of the war. And yet, through it all, she maintains an innocence despite the things she lives through. She gives feeling to the events as they unfold, which helps the viewer to better understand what it is that she is going through. <br/><br/>The story also is a wonderful illustration of the love of family and friends, how those relationships sustain people in the worst of times. It gives you an understanding of what it was like to be a child in Germany growing up amidst the chaos and poverty of Nazi rule. These people have next to nothing, yet they seem to have all they need in each other.<br/><br/>This is truly a moving story. It will make you laugh and it will make you cry AND it will make you think. I hope you will experience the same range of emotions that I did as I watched this amazing movie! As you get to the end of the movie you will be left with new thoughts and insights, as well as a sense of a sadness for what these families went through."

","It is rare in this day and age that films like these are produced. I am so glad that I had an opportunity to witness such an achievement.<br/><br/>Acting is outstanding. What do you say about these actors, especially the young girl. Unbelievable, how do they do it with such a young kids. All together acting is outstanding, I hate to single someone out but girl is something special.<br/><br/>Plot is very unusual for a WWII film. Usually it is either fighting or life in the USA or UK while men are at the front. We rarely take a human-civilian look at the events taking inside Germany during the war. I do not say that films have not been made before about the subject, but it has not been done in a while. I was especially impressed by the recreation of a small town inside Germany during those times, Kristalnacht and book burning ritual. Everything was done by precision and it looks outstanding on the screen. Job well done! We saw so many films on the subject in the past, but we should never stop reminding young generations about horrors of the war. While I was watching this inside my local movie theater, there were many young teenagers watching this, they probably saw film about Nazi era for the first time.<br/><br/>All in all it is a must see, please make an effort to see this film!"
"CMTiago","8","4","8","26 January 2014"," Powerful yet simple story that shows us innocence
","Having not read the book, I wasn't going in to this movie knowing fully what I was expecting, but had a certain amount of reasonable expectation: I was either going to be bored or I would sort of like it. The end result was something quite different. Everything in this movie just connected perfectly and once I got attached to this world I couldn't let go. Starting with the characters, every single one of them did what they were supposed to do. Liesel was a beautiful and curious girl, Hans was a caring and loving father, Rosa while also caring, was a bit more strict, as to create a balance within the family. All other characters were just as important as they had connections with the girl and eventually had a mutual effect on each others lives. Then there were two characters that were mostly linked to Liesel than any other character besides her father. Rudy and Max were two friends that while with different backgrounds, provided Liesel with some much needed life lessons. While Rudy was a simple incarnation of her childhood and her best friend outside of her home. Max helped her understand the world and its injustices.<br/><br/>Set in World War II Germany, the mood manages to be quite cheerful at times, but as reality kicks in, we are reminded that the situation is much more serious and the danger is always present. The direction of the movie allows us to know this and fear for the characters safety. One of the better elements, and the reason John Williams scores his 49th nomination for an Oscar, is the beautiful and light soundtrack that accompanies this young child's journey and ultimately falls into the collection of great scores by Williams. In conclusion, this is a smaller and more calm movie when compared to the big budget blockbuster being churned out today (nothing against it), yet it captures the imagination of being young and innocent through some brilliant performances and an enjoyable story.<br/><br/>Rating 8/10"
"face-819-933726","9","4","8","21 January 2014"," Well she stole my heart, and the story just swept me away.
","Touching, and so very sweet. We first are handed this little innocent who has no idea beyond the journey that she has just been forced to take to get to the street called Heaven. Watching her grow, and seeing the people around her become better people just because she is in their lives is a real thrill. Words can save lives, and they should never be censored just in blind righteousness, a voice must be heard it is a human need. Little Liesel played by Sophie Nélisse is going to melt your heart, and be on your radar for some time to come. There was one striking thought that kept hitting me though throughout this whole movie, and that was that had Liesei not been so perfectly ideal in her little Heidi look there is no way that she could have gotten away with even getting a good family in the first place. Looks saved this girl, and her willingness to grow, and learn, and fight back made her. I really Enjoyed this movie, there are great laughs, and heart felt joy from the least likely of places. I recommend this one with no hesitation, this is a great look at what things were like for the people in the middle of the other side. The people no different than the allied home front, just trying to survive, and give what they have to. A brilliant and highly emphatic kudos to the the way this movie plays with language as though you are really understanding German, and other languages with a slight transitioning in, and out of English, but always in a way that the youngest viewer will pick up on what it is that people are saying, and they transition so well. Good work on the set design as well. You really never leave this little street, but there is never a doubt as to the time of year, or the atmosphere of the citizens. The narration I do not want to spoil, just enjoy it all."

","THE BOOK THIEF is a movie full of great incidents and characters, top production values and fine acting -- Geoffrey Rush is one of those actors I believe cannot give a less than brilliant performance and Emma Watson creeps into your heart slowly and steadily throughout. The story is telling and surprisingly hopeful in the end.<br/><br/>Unhappily, this is not a great movie and the problem can be laid squarely at the feet of the scriptwriter. Based, as it is, on a book, the first problem lies in how to translate ideas into images and what to cut without losing the movie's heart. Michael Petroni has succeeded admirably in the former endeavor, but has not been entirely successful in the latter. Roger Allam's narration of the story as Death is well performed, but ultimately pompous and a cheat.<br/><br/>I have not read the book this movie is based on, but it seems likely to me that the narration attempts to replicate the third person omniscient narrator of the book. Sometimes it is the details like this that endear a book to us, but the translation from one medium to another requires great care and narration is rarely a good idea in a movie. The attempt by narration to make the conditions of the movie simultaneously universal and of great individual importance is miscalculated. It may work in the book. It does not work on the screen.<br/><br/>This is a movie I took great pleasure in while in the theater. As I said, the acting and attention to detail are compelling. However, the scriptwriter was apparently too fond of the least cinematic parts of the book and the entire movies suffers thereby. It's still compelling, but far less than it might have been."

","""The Book Thief"" is a novel-based film from between 1 and 2 years ago and it's another pretty good German-American co-production about world War II. It was directed by Brian Percival, an Emmy Award winner for ""Downton Abbey"", and written by Michael Petroni, whose most famous work is a ""Chronicles of Narnia"" film. The soundtrack comes from the legendary John Williams and was the film's only Academy Award nomination and Williams' most recent. The story is about a young girl who has to leave her mother, but soon gets very close to their new parents. It takes a while longer with her new mother and initially it is not clear if she will possibly be an antagonist. But the girl as well as her new parents are saddened by the loss of Liesel's brother, who did not survive the trip.<br/><br/>I have to say that, with this movie, young Canadian actress Sophie Nélisse elevates herself into the finest actresses of her age group and it seems she has all the talent (and looks) for a long career in the industry if she decides to pursue that dream. She played her part well and did not stand out negatively next to really experienced actors such as Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson. Geoffrey Rush is a personal favorite of mine and I enjoyed watching him as I always do. I would probably not list this among my very favorite performances by him, but he is a welcome presence as always and he made his character just so incredibly likable. The epitome of a good father performance. Because of the German production background, you will also find some German actors in here. Rainer Bock, Barbara Auer and Heike Makatsch (who only has one scene at the beginning) may be known to German audiences. All in all I enjoyed watching these 125 minutes (without credits). Nélisse carried this competently and even if there were no real outstanding scenes in my opinion, this was a film that never dragged in my opinion and also had a nice, almost poetic ending to it. Thumbs up. I recommend this film and it's nice to see that there are still new films about World War II that actually move you and have a good story to tell, despite the existence of uncountable movies already about that topic. Thumbs up."

Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson are doing their best to save this, and the two main kids are doing a great job. But this film fails on almost all other levels.<br/><br/>It's all ruined by badly written dialog., with awful German-English accent, awful over-play, horrible direction, pretentious narrative voice, convoluted classic music score and plain silly ideas.

","I recognize the criticism of this film in that it is a bit too contrived to pull at our heartstrings. First we have the poor girl in a kind of ""Secret Garden"" milieu. She is taken in by a woman who appears to be a virago, whose motives seem to be to get an allowance from the government (we know this because she is furious that the little brother has died on the way) and he husband, an easy going handyman played by Geoffrey Rush. Throw in her interactions with the evils outside (she is immediately pegged a communist because of her mother's lineage) and that she is bullied because she is illiterate. There is also her connection to a young Jewish man, Hans, who is being kept in the basement. These things are integrated, along with a little blonde kid who lives next door, Rudy, who takes a shine to her. So we have some real plot weaving. That aside, the characters are nicely developed, the situation outside is one we all know, the world is collapsing and good is going out the window, there are threats everywhere. Death is an everyday occurrence as are the purges that take place. Sophie Nelisse is the wide-eyed eleven year old who seems older than her stated age. She has her guard up at first but it slowly drawn into the family, mainly from Rush's immediate affection toward her. He recognizes the pain in her, knowing that those around, including his wife, have enough pain of their own. Like all films set in Holocaust Germany, there is a visible tension that settles over the populace. News of an actual war is exciting to everyone, most of whom are so taken with the cause, they fail to realize what they are saying. I was somewhat mesmerized, even though I knew I was being manipulated. The book was breathtaking; the movie a worthwhile use of time."

Whilst there is some truth in that statement, one should not rush to dismiss ""The book thief"" because in the midst of the horror of the war, it puts children at the forefront. Children who are forced to grow up quickly although they cannot totally abandon their nature.<br/><br/>This 1940's German family has no interest in the Nazi propaganda but like the people in the countries attacked they are in a struggle for survival and despite the hardship they will not risk everything to help those in need.<br/><br/>Moving and emotional it does a good job in putting humanity at the core of the story despite the surrounding overall lack of it."

","'THE BOOK THIEF': Four Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>World War II drama film about a young girl living with foster parents (during the war in Germany) who also develops relationships with a Jewish refugee (hiding in their home) and a boy (her age) from the neighborhood. It was directed by Brian Percival and written by Michael Petroni. It's based on the 2005 novel of the same name by Markus Zusak. The film stars Sophie Nélisse, Geoffrey Rush, Emily Watson, Ben Schnetzer, Nico Liersch and Roger Allam (voicing the narrator of the film, Death). I think the movie looks great (and is well made) but it's not quite involving enough to be really interesting or entertaining.<br/><br/>Nélisse plays Liesel Meminger, a young girl who is 12 when the movie starts (in 1938 Germany) and 14 by the time it's over. Death (Allam) narrates Liesel's story and tells how her mother (Heike Makatsch) is forced to leave her with foster parents (because her mom is a communist and a target of the Nazis) shortly after her brother (Julian Lehmann) dies. Her foster parents are Hans (Rush) and Rosa Hubermann (Watson). Liesel takes a liking to Hans much more than her new mother because he's a lot kinder. She also takes a liking to a young neighborhood boy, Rudy (Liersch), who thinks he's in love with her (and is constantly asking her for a kiss). When Hans learns that Liesel can't read (after she's picked on for it at school) he begins to teach her. Liesel becomes obsessed with books and later develops a relationship with a Jewish refugee, Max Vandenburg (Schnetzer), who comes to hide in the Hubermann's home.<br/><br/>Brian Percival has directed multiple episodes (6) of the popular TV show 'DOWNTOWN ABBEY', which is a historical drama series set right before World War I. That's what this movie feels like to me (a TV show). It's not epic enough to be a great dramatic war film and probably would be much better as a longer developed TV show. The acting is all good (the young actress in the lead is especially impressive) but the characters' drama isn't overly interesting or that memorable. One thing about the film that is truly cinematic is the score by John Williams (one of the greatest music composers of all time) and this is the first movie he's done in 8 years that's not directed by Steven Spielberg. It is a World War II film though, which a lot of Spielberg movies are, so it feels like a John Williams type movie. The film is probably more interesting if you're really fascinated by World War II but most others will be likely be bored.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UY2UtXfI_w"
"paolamarquez-05712","10","1","1","1 December 2019"," Book Thief Review 11/30/19
","""THE BOOK THIEF""
Dear, Brian Percival
my name is Paola Marquez and I am 16 years old as of right now. Also I am in the 11th grade attending J.P Taravella Highschool. I am taking the Holocaust elective which is why I am writing this letter about your amazing movie ""The Book Thief"". Due to this, I was assigned to pick one out of three movies about the resistance during the Holocaust, to which leaded me into choosing your movie in the end. To start off, I think your movie is by far outstanding and I am fairly impressed of how well you interpreted the story from the original book. What I have interpreted after watching your film which was basically about a german girl who starts a new chapter of her life with her foster parents, who end up hiding a Jew trying to escape their tragic fate while Hitler is taking over Europe during the 1930s-1940s, is the emotional pain one has to deal with when leaving someone dear to them. For example when Liesel (main character) and her brother had to leave their mother who was a communist (which at that time was taboo during nazi persecution), in order to escape from nazi power. Liesel's mom decided to do this after witnessing her father being taken away by the Nazis because he was also a communist.
Even if the pain of being separated by her mom was not bad enough, along their way to their new foster parents home, Liesel's brother dies halfway due to sickness and she had to see him be buried. The way I interpreted this scene, is how a girl from that young of an age, accepts death so calmly. And to be fair, I do not blame her for not seeing her cry her eyes out in this scene because she obviously has been going through alot. Her father was taken away from the nazis, she has been sent to live with a new stranger family because she is not safe with her mom, and then her brother dies, what else is worse than this. She understands that some things are not meant to last forever and she just needs to move on and start a mew life with her new family. The scene that impacted me the most throughout this film was the part that interpreted Kristallnact, November 9, 1938. Because this scene instantly affected my emotions and I honestly felt sad, the scene was by far unforgettable to me and I could only imagine how the people who were there and experienced that event would feel. Shattering jewish shops in the middle of the night only because they were jewish, and beating them up ontop of shattered class, was and is still inhuman. The main thing that stood out for me through this whole movie, is how it was narrated by Death. Death is telling a story about a little girl who is living with her new family who ends up saving and hiding a Jew who left his family in order to escape nazi persecution. Liesel's foster father knows and understands the consequences that could his families life if he were to be caught hiding a Jew, it is very much risky. But i do not think Hans (Liesel's foster father) saved Max (jew who was being hid) out of sympathy, he did it because he knew what was right and what was wrong, and being persecuted by Nazis just because they are Jews did not sit well for Hans, he couldn't accept that, so because of this he resisted against the nazi way. He knew he had to save this man, and that he did. Finally I would like to say to you that the scene in which made me cherish human significance, was the scene in which the bombing happened in their town to which Liesel's foster father and mother and close friend die and she was grieving their death upon seeing their lifeless bodies, something she did not do when her brother died, that really did struck my emotions because things started to go well for her and she knew that, and to see everything crashing down in front of her (losing her love ones) at the end of the film, was truly heartbreaking."
"Tornado_Sam","5","1","1","24 November 2019"," Incomprehensible if one hasn't read the novel
","Marcus Zusak's novel ""The Book Thief"" is one of those books that just doesn't work well as a movie adaptation. There is so much to be considered in the novel, so many themes, ideas, and concepts, that the average filmmaker couldn't do it justice. The medium of filmmaking isn't involved enough to fully capture everything like writing can, and this 2013 adaptation perfectly shows how a visualization just doesn't cut the entire story.<br/><br/>Going right in, so much is cut out of the book so that the movie could only run two hours that the story just isn't there anymore. The whole concept of Death being the narrator of the story is barely there; they shouldn't have even bothered including him since he only speaks four times throughout the movie. On top of that, the narrative just happens: Liesel's on the train, her brother coughs a couple times, then they're standing around a grave, which is supposed to be his (those who haven't read the story would be like ""What the heck is going on here?"") then she's in a car, she goes to her new foster parents...on and on. There is no explanation for anything at all, the dialogue carries no light to anything that is happening and confuses the viewer even further, and very little of the action is brought to life. When the film got to the scene where Liesel, Max, Rosa, and Hans are having a snowball fight in the cellar, it actually got funny and entertaining for a moment - it was then I realized that all the action preceding it just sat there, this was the first time I had gotten engaged in what was happening.<br/><br/>As a result of this, the film is really just a bunch of scenes chained together that do a clumsy job at telling a story. Right there is the issue - the movie is about telling the story that the book told, but the book was not just about narrative. Zusak's novel was more than that. It was a wonderfully interwoven piece of literature showing the power of words, the corruption of society, the strength of love, and so many more important messages. The adaptation takes the basic plot, confuses it, jumbles it around, takes out various things, and leaves behind the messages in the dust. This book just wasn't meant to be a film - only a piece of literature that should not have been tinkered with.<br/><br/>That's not to say everything was done wrong. On the plus side, the director did some things right: great actors for Liesel, Rudy, Hans, and Rosa; good settings; a few decent scenes; and a good ending. Visually, these all make it alright to watch, but it is really not that good mostly because the writing fails to bring any of it to life in a strong way. If anyone wanted to see this, they should read the novel first, because this movie is rather a incomprehensible adaptation otherwise."

","Based on the novel by Markus Zusak, the story centres around a twelve-year-old German girl (Sophie Nélisse) who is taken in by middle-aged foster parents just before World War II.

They also go along with Nazi antics out of survival even though their hearts and actions go in the other direction despite the danger this could cause them.<br/><br/>""The Book Thief"" is a German/American collaboration. It is mostly in English (substituting for German) with German spoken during Nazi anthems and speeches.<br/><br/>For the most part, this is a fine drama. It has a good heart; it is certainly well acted; and the production sets and music do a fine job in recreating another time and place - one that is very familiar to avid moviegoers.<br/><br/>There are weakness that lessen the film's overall effect, however. The part of the story that is referenced via the title seems a bit off and out of place at times. There is also a really absurd scene of a mother barging into a school classroom that seems to make no sense at all. While the musical score by John Williams is good, it tends to be used to lighten the otherwise difficult subject matter. Similarly, the film is narrated by a character known as Death. This might have worked well in the book; but in the film version, there are mixed results.<br/><br/>In being placed in the movie genre known as ""Holocaust/World War II Drama"", 'The Book Thief"" is inevitably compared to some of the best films in history. It doesn't fully meet the difficult challenge though it does have its merits."

For one thing, most of the people in this movie have very stale acting. I think the only 2 that were very good was Max and Death, as they actually came off very well. However, while the book uses Death as the narrator to give a feeling of sadness and burden to the plot, here he's probably here for like, a minute. This really should have been two movies, simply to be able to flesh out the plot of the story enough. Just do yourself a favor and read the book. It may be long, but it's a lot better than this."
"bryank-04844","5","1","1","22 August 2015"," While I've seen better WWII films and better Holocaust films, 'The Book Thief' does a good job when it isn't trying to suck us into an emotional black hole.
","20th Century Fox would like you to compare 'The Book Thief' to the Oscar-winning 'Life of Pi'. The trailers even say, ""From the studio that brought you Life of Pi."" Not the director or the writer just the same corporation that financed both movies. The comparisons get even thinner from there.<br/><br/>Sure, you can argue that both films come from novels, deal with survival of the most dire circumstances, and have lots of symbolism about life, death, love and God, but that's pretty much it. Any other comparisons are just an attempt to drive audiences to see 'The Book Thief' in the hopes that it will garner some of the same awards and giant pile of cash that 'Life of Pi' did. Unfortunately, I don't think 'The Book Thief' will accomplish these goals. Although the acting and story are pretty good, the poor pacing and too many cheesily sentimental moments ultimately undo the movie. That, and the lack of expensive CG effects, a beautiful world, or a big tiger.<br/><br/>Working from Markus Zusak's novel of the same name, director Brian Percival (whose main claim to fame is a couple episodes of 'Downton Abbey') relies mostly on his cast to keep the movie trucking along. This is not a happy story by any means. It starts out with young Liesel (Sophie Nelisse) and her younger brother boarding a train, unaware that their mother is giving them up for adoption. On the way to their new family, the brother dies, as the narrator informs us over the grim images. In fact, the narrator is death himself.<br/><br/>Liesel is not a happy child at first. She's forced to stay with a family with no other kids. Hans Hubermann (Geoffrey Rush) and his wife Rosa (Emily Watson) live in a small German village at the start of World War II. This village mostly consists of Germans who are not happy with Hitler and don't want to be associated with the Nazi party. Hans is the father every child wants. He's a kid at heart himself, who plays tunes on the organ, laughs at inappropriate times, and can talk to anybody of any age. His wife Rosa, however, has a thick outer shell, and seems to have a dark cloud over her at all times. Deep down, she's a lovely woman, but she rarely shows it.<br/><br/>Soon enough, Liesel makes some friends at her new school, as well as an enemy or two. One of the friends is a boy named Rudy (Nico Liersch), an aspiring runner whose hero is Jesse Owens. Things get a bit more dangerous when someone from Hans' past shows up at his door. Max (Ben Schnetzer) is a Jewish refugee who wants to hide out in the Hubermann's basement. With Max's encouragement, Liesel learns to write. When she isn't writing her own stories, Liesel enjoys ""borrowing"" great works of fiction from a Nazi officer's wife, which helps her escape her sad life.<br/><br/>There isn't a whole lot pretty to see here. Our backdrop is a cold and frigid Germany, without too many green pastures or blue waters to take in. Fortunately, the actors hold our attention. Watson gives a great performance as a frumpy crank who hides her soft side without getting too silly about it. In recent years, Rush has been known for playing over-the-top zany characters, and we've come to love him for that, but here, he plays a sincere, kind-hearted and simple man. The true star is Nelisse. Her portrayal of Liesel is full of sadness and loneliness, yet conveys the character's strength in overcoming this horrible time in history. Her eyes sell every emotion flawlessly.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the execution of the rest of the film is less than thrilling. At no point in time did I feel suspense for any character – which, for a WWII movie focused on the rise of the Nazi party, means that the film is simply not doing its job. Particularly in a scene where the Nazis search basements to capture hidden Jews, it would have done Percival some good to watch Tarantino's 'Inglourious Basterds', but I guess he missed that. A lot of the dialogue is cheesy and too on-the-nose"" for my liking, and it seemed like the movie has four separate endings that don't flow well at all.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the cinematography by Florian Ballhaus is beautiful and majestic, and the music by John Williams (yes, that John Williams) is one of the better scores I've heard a long time. While I've seen better WWII films and better Holocaust films, 'The Book Thief' does a good job when it isn't trying to suck us into an emotional black hole."

I was deeply touched by the book, whereas that wasn't the case here. It seemed as though everything had been great until the bombs fell, no poverty and death everywhere. The horrors of war, in my opinion, were given a facelift. I hated the beginning. While reading about the death of Liesel's brother, it felt like I got slapped in the face. In the movie it was like poof, he's gone now. I suppose they didn't want to depress the audience from the very start.

He crosses a line, the line in that time he wasn't supposed to cross. Reading was like a forbidden fruit at that time and place. Liesel escaped the daily grind in the world that her books give her.<br/><br/>I cannot pass on the character of Max. A Jew running, hiding from the Nazis's in the basement. He's one of Liesels friends and she is his only one. Every day she uses the new words she learned from her books to describe the outside world to him. After all these conversations Max sees something beautiful in her, in her words.<br/><br/>He gives her a new path – the blank page. Where she can write her own story, however she wants it to be.

"Ed-from-HI","10","4","9","28 December 2013"," UNIQUE STORY = Incredibly 'Moving' Film!
","Some critics have expressed the view, that this film should have maintained a 'darker' atmosphere, fully reflecting the bleak WWII backdrop (and overlapping Holocaust period, circa 1938-1945). But I feel the director, and producer of this movie made best efforts to be faithful to the tone of Markus Zusak's original and highly acclaimed novel, and to also remain true to the youthful (and by definition, more optimistic) view of its main protagonist, Liesel Meminger. With that in mind, the 'Book Thief' film should be looked at, as a worthy companion piece (and not directly compared) to the other immensely important Holocaust period films, like 'Schindler's List' the 'Pianist' and even the 'Reader.' However, while decidedly 'lighter' in tone, this film does contain a critically important (and serious) central theme = the very difficult (and sometimes even life endangering) moral 'choices' that ordinary people, during WWII, were forced to make in order to survive, while still protecting their full 'humanity' (made much more hazardous during the epoch of calculated cruelty perpetrated by the Third Reich). There are many stories still to be told (and lessons to be learned), from this exceedingly bleak period, and Markus Zusak's novel, and this outstanding film, happen to tell an exceptionally engaging and heartfelt tale. Now, the film review: the direction by Brian Percival is inspired, extracting the perfect balance of both 'authentic' and 'spontaneous' performances from each member of the amazingly talented cast. Sophie Nelisse is truly extraordinary, her portrayal of Liesel Meminger being incredibly real, and always totally 'in the moment' (with no hint of actions being rehearsed/ or pre-planned), she is also more than able to convey the complete 'transformation' of Liesel, from initial bewilderment, to growing 'awareness' (largely due to book thievery), and the resolute drive to understand and share the contents of these stolen outlawed books, culminating in her full capacity to transmit large doses of compassion, much beyond her years. This last dimension especially true, in her ability to restore the 'hidden Jew' Max Vandenburg (brilliantly played by Ben Schnetzer) back into our world of the Living (thru the sheer power of many stolen book readings)! Geoffrey Rush (certainly one of the most gifted actors of our time) brings the requisite abundance of 'humanity' to Hans Hubermann, and Emily Watson is more than adept at interpreting the complex characterization of Rosa (her seemingly stone faced facade,used to conceal a very large heart of Gold). The actor playing Rudy is a perfect match to the spontaneous playfulness, and empathy of Liesel's portrayal. And the interactions between Max and Liesel are full of genuinely 'magic' and truly inspiring moments. John William's score is also exceptionally heartfelt, and a good companion piece to his incredible ""Schindler's List"" Score. All in all, a very worthy and important film = that should promote much discussion regarding the timeless question of what it really means to retain our humanity during exceedingly 'inhuman' (and inhumane) times (WWII and the Third Reich, certainly reflecting the darkest of these periods). 'The Book Thief' really deserves to be seen by a much wider audience - and also hopefully, win a few Oscars along the way! I also highly recommend Markus Zusak's original source book - to discover many more hidden 'gems' and also hear much more from its narrator 'death' (a narrator/character providing a number of surprising insights, perhaps even bordering on the humane? A most intriguing aspect of the original source novel)!"

","The overall concept for the story is magnificent, allowing readers and viewers alike the opportunity to see WWII Nazi Germany from an angle not usually approached. The characters are lovable and the story is engaging. I loved the film overall, however I would say that if you read the book you will be a little disappointed by the film. I still loved it but it was as if they took the first quarter of the novel, started making the movie, and then realized when they were three fourths of the way in they did't have enough time to cram the rest of the book in to the amount of film time they had left. They spend way too much time covering the very beginning of the story and not enough on the end. <br/><br/>Like I said though, still a great film with so many good points and parts that were true to the book. Great movie for families to see together. I would just say as a word of advice try not to have any preconceived ideas about how it should be based off the novel, if you go in with an open mind you will enjoy it much more. One thing I thought was done perfectly was the narrator's (Death) voice, it was almost exactly as I pictured it."

","The movie is a well made but constrained story that downplays the Nazi excesses, which is the movie's problem. It does depict these excesses, but fails to convey the sense of terror associated with the Nazi regime. Then again, the story is not about the Nazis but about characters set in that time. This is not to suggest that the subject of the Nazis is whitewashed, because it is not, but rather that the style of the movie, that focuses on the characters, pushes the Nazi actions more into the background, lessening its emotional impact, which, given the history of the Nazi regime, is a hard sell. The girl who plays the title role is excellent. Her performance is warm, engaging and credible. Also, Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson give strong performances. Some of the elements of story are stagy and contrived, but so what? It's literary license. It's a movie about a young girl who witnesses all kinds of awful things and is exposed to Nazi ideology, yet, because of a loving family, maintains her goodness. That alone makes this movie worth watching."
"RTTerry","9","4","9","12 December 2013"," Wonderful!
","Wonderful! I never read the book, therefore I had no expectations which needed to be satisfied from this movie, so whether or not it lives up to the printed version doesn't matter to me – from that perspective this is a WONDERFUL movie! I wish they made more movies like this, where the violence doesn't have to be graphic and realistic, or the language becomes embarrassing, even though dealing with such a humanistic and horrific situation as WWII. It seems you can no longer take your kids or grandkids to movies that simply tell historic stories, without the screen flashing nudity, violence and rough language to give it 'real' feel.<br/><br/>It was absolutely refreshing to experience this story from the child's point of view, and to have the narration done by DEATH - that added to the flavor of the movie and made it easy to follow. It also takes adults back to our youth, when we can remember going along or doing things simply because the adults were doing it. The acting is wonderful and the story is priceless.<br/><br/>On a side note, I read a review by a critic that gave The Book Thief a poor rating, indicating that if you want to see a war movie done like Disney would do it, this one would be perfect for you. I think that was the critic's problem, this isn't a war movie; it's a story of coming of age and dealing with challenging issues when you are growing up, which happened to occur around Stuttgart, Germany during WWII. There are plenty of war movies you can't take younger audiences to that are already out there, this was a welcome relief.<br/><br/>Do not miss this movie!"

","An amazing performance by 13-year-old Canadian Sophie Nelisse in the movie version of Australian Markus Zusak's best selling young adult novel (2005). It's a fine way to introduce the era and what happened in it to children, as director Brian Percival gets a lot out of Nelisse and co- star Nico Liersch, letting these two kids play people their own age (and a bit younger) accurately and believably.<br/><br/>The tension that runs throughout the film is like watching children play with loaded guns for 131 minutes, truly and fairly representing what these people must have lived for six years. I disagree with other reviewers who found that it didn't dwell on things long enough...it's shot from a young person's point of view, with that kind of simplistic acceptance of things that happen outside one's field of view. <br/><br/>This is the kind of film that provides much to chew on afterward, if taken seriously. We saw it with members of our synagogue so that wasn't an issue. The tension for us began with simply seeing that this was set in Germany during WW II."

","I saw someone else say, ""Beautifully made."" No, it wasn't!<br/><br/>I liked the authentic sets, and the casting was appealing. Brian Percival's directing is abominable. The accents are OK, but now and then comes a distracting ja or nein. Are they speaking English as a second language? Percival makes every knock on the door, no matter how innocent or routine, sound like the Gestapo, so he can gin up the tension. He completely mushes up the title character Liesel's love interest. The boy next door has a crush on her, and (maybe) she has a crush on her Jewish cellar-dweller, but nothing much happens. We never know what either are to her. Sophie Néllisse has a big, expressive mouth. She'd make a good Disney character. <br/><br/>The ""book thief"" part of the movie seems incidental, more like a prop than the title. The beautiful blond Rudy is the most interesting character, whose story could have been made into its own movie. But he remains, like the title, just a prop.<br/><br/>The voice of Death, the narrator, is almost identical to Goeffrey Rush's voice, which helps muddle the story line. So, Death is Leisel's foster dad? The ending was an unnecessary downer -- on a cheap, melodramatic note. It's as if the director had run out of things to say or do and just killed everybody off. Here sentimentality trumps substance. Maybe the book ends this way, too, but it could have ended with everybody surviving -- quite possible -- with the message intact. But it would have required more work by the author...and the director. As it is, the message seems to be, ""Books are good, Nazis are bad"". OK."

Typically you would see in a movie set in this era a lot of horrid situations and Nazi criminal actions. But the story is told from the perspective of the everyday German citizens living in a small towntheir struggles at the time and this young girl and how she dealt with her situation. But don't think it is a downer of a movie because it is not. You see the determination this girl has to learn to read and what she does to accomplish this goal. Add to it colorful characters that you like and that you learn to like and the side stories that go along with all that. It actually has some humor throughout the movie. This movie keeps your attention throughout and gives you a glimpse of a culture that most know little about during the time it is portrayed. Entertaining? Yes. Interesting? Definitely. I give it a ""B""."
"howard.schumann","8","3","7","22 December 2013"," A story told with power and conviction
","Like René Clement's Forbidden Games, British director Brian Percival's The Book Thief focuses on the effect of war on children who are forced by circumstances into coping with events beyond their capacity to understand. Written by Michael Petroni and based on the novel by Australian author Markus Zusak, it is a story told with power and conviction about the Nazi's systematic attempts to destroy learning and culture in Germany during World War II. It is not a film about the Holocaust per se but about how the war impacted ordinary citizens in a small working class German town where people were compelled to support the Nazi cause most likely without knowing about the concentration camps and the Nazi genocide.<br/><br/>Like the book, the film is narrated by ""Death"" (voice of Roger Allam), though he is never identified as such. It is a risky device that could have been mawkish but, in the context of the film which is mainly geared to young adults, provides some humor and softens the disturbing events seen on the screen. Liesel Meminger, in a superb performance by French-Canadian actress Sophie Nélisse (Monsieur Lazhar), is a young girl of eleven who is adopted by surrogate parents after her mother, ostensibly a Communist, abandons her for unstated reasons, though they can be easily guessed. The family was also expecting Liesel's younger brother but, sadly, he died of an unexplained cause during their long train ride.<br/><br/>Liesel's new foster parents, the Hubermanns, are very different from each other. Hans (Geoffrey Rush), a housepainter who has refused to join the Nazi Party and has suffered economically for it, is warmer and more immediately accepting than his wife Rosa (Emily Watson), who appears cold and brusque. As the political climate worsens, the family observes the Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass), a state-approved violent outburst in November, 1938 against Jewish businesses and synagogues in both Germany and Austria, an event that resulted in the murder of hundreds and the forced deportation of 300,000 German Jews to concentration camps.<br/><br/>Upset at the taunting she has to endure at school because of her illiteracy, Hans, who plays the accordion to stay calm, begins to teach Liesel to read, using the basement walls as a blackboard. Studying the only book she has, The Grave Digger's Handbook which she stole at her brother's funeral, stimulates in her a passion for reading. After seeing Liesel save a book from the fire after a Nazi book-burning ceremony, the burgomaster's wife, Ilsa Hermann (Barbara Auer) who Liesel works for as a laundress, invites her into her home to see the vast library put together by her now deceased son. Her visits become an important part of her life until she is thrown out by Ilsa's fanatical husband, losing an important source of income in the process.<br/><br/>A new avenue is opened for learning, however, when Hans allows Max (Ben Schnetzer) to hide out in their basement, repaying a debt owed to the boy's father for saving his life during World War I. As Max lies ill, recuperating from his injuries, Liesel reads to him from books that she takes from Ilsa's library. In reciprocation, Max shows Liesel the path to becoming a writer by stimulating the use of her imagination. In addition to her relationship with Max, Liesel has also become friends with Rudy Steiner (Nico Liersch) a fair haired German classmate who is ridiculed at school because of his admiration for the black track star, Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics.<br/><br/>Though they both have to wear hated Nazi youth uniforms, they are aligned on their hatred of the Fuhrer. Though John Williams score adds to the film's appeal, Percival avoids the temptation of heart-tugging sentimentality, allowing whatever tears are evoked by the film's emotional climax to be fully earned. Contrary to the specious arguments of some critics that The Book Thief is ""Disneyfied"" and makes light of the Nazi crimes, it is a perfect film for young people to learn about the dangers of an authoritarian government and to appreciate the value of the written word and the importance of culture and knowledge in a civilized society."
"kellydcarter","9","3","7","15 December 2013"," Does the book justice
","No spoilers ahead. If you love movies with beautiful human stories, you MUST see this. You won't see better acting from an actor of ANY age than what you will see in 13 year-old Sophie Nélisse. The cast surrounding her was simply perfect. The filming was beautiful. Having said all that, the book is even better. But I'm so thankful it was turned into a movie of this incredibly high quality. Read the book! See the movie!<br/><br/>IMDb requires that I say more to submit my review. OK, all of my relatives that I convinced to go see the movie this weekend thanked my profusely for recommending this movie. Ages ranged from 18 to 90, both males and females."
"merlinvicki","8","2","4","1 April 2014"," Hauntingly beautiful movie
","I have seen many World War II movies. This would be one of the touching ones. It shows the difficult times during Hitler's reign from the eyes of young Liesel, living in Germany with her foster parents. I loved the title which is what attracted me in the first place to watch the movie. The direction is really good and the story tries to stay positive throughout, even though everything around is shrouded in fear. <br/><br/>While a lot of movies try to portray the suffering among Jews, this one also tries to depict the anger among the ordinary German people. All the characters are very strong, I specifically loved Emily's, the way she tries to appear tough but is so loving in her heart. Sophie Nelisse is perfect in the role of Liesel. I loved the way she brings out the German accent. The voice of ""Death"" was a bit distracting. This movie although a bit on the same lines as ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" has quite a different perspective. Absolutely loved it."
"bm2759","7","2","4","9 March 2014"," Refreshing choice of narration and authentic replication
","To my surprise this was a nice film which covered a lot of emotional content and giving us a fictional yet believable story of ordinary people in Germany during WW2.<br/><br/>Credit goes to the use of death as the narrator of Liesel's story which was refreshingly different. It enabled the story to be presented in a more pleasant and child-like manner than a typical tragedy of suffering.<br/><br/>One further positive is the effort taken to replicate a believable Stuttgart. Characters spoke realistic sounding German, English with a German accent or a mixture of both. Very few films enable the audience to understand another language whilst also telling a story in their own language. Also the use of real propaganda like posters, school choir songs, outfits, living conditions and public atmosphere all benefit the film and allow us to appreciate it better.<br/><br/>Each of the 5 main characters are all very well acted. Geoffrey Rush nails a caring yet slightly silly father beautifully as does Emma Watson as the tough mother with a big, yet hidden, heart. The standout is Sophie Nélisse as Liesle portraying wonder, innocence, joy, sadness, or empathy with us ease; they definitely chose the correct actress. Nico Liersch as Rudy was solid as light-hearted, joyful best friend of Liesel. Ben Schnetzer as Max portrayed a Jew in hiding we've not seen before, i.e. confident, understanding and caring towards those who are keeping him alive, without being frightened , tormented or helpless.<br/><br/>My main criticisms are:<br/><br/>* Mama coming to school to give Liesel good news - why do that and risk being exposed when such news can be delivered at home? * Bodies of those who died from their homes being bombed looking like people asleep. Surely if the filmmakers go to the effort of having vocal coaches for realistic German accents, then why not also give us authentic looking corpses. * Max appearing at the end. Where did he go and how did we survive? Not even some dialogue to explain how or why? His appearance lacks any impact upon the audience and lines up too nicely to be believable, i.e. cheap. * The film skips from sometime in 1943 to 1945 when Americans arrive in Stuttgart. What happened to Liesel in that time? The most interesting part of her story is what happened to her after the town was severely bombed. * The last 5 minutes of the film was quite rushed where it seemed to hurry up and finish the story without giving many details. I wanted to see a little more of what happens to the characters. * The ending is beautiful and a positive. However why can't we see how she ended up in Manhattan, New York. And why New York? Of all the places she would have emigrated to surely choosing New York was too clichéd. I suspect it was chosen because many Europeans emigrated to the USA and New York is likely where they arrive. Despite being an open-minded and multicultural city it is unrealistic she'd remain there her whole life.<br/><br/>A few small grievances aside this is a film I'd recommend to anyone wanting to see a story of how regular Germans experienced life under Nazi Germany."

","Led by a (hopefully) rising star in newcomer Sophie Nelisse, and carried by veterans Emily Watson and Geoffrey Rush, 'The Book Thief' is a solid adaptation of a book that is hardly conventional on paper or on screen. <br/><br/>While the responsibility for the narrative lies with the author, 'The Book Thief' is refreshing in the course of the events it depicts; many movies on the subject of World War Two and Nazi Germany are all too keen to explore beyond the gates of the death camps, but director Brian Percival's film honours the source material by celebrating its story about the importance of the written word with a proud approach, allowing it to sit at the film's core despite every possible distraction. It's a sometimes bleak, often fulfilling tale of the best and worst aspects of the human condition, and at its heart is the concept of sharing comfort in words and stories. Narrated by 'Death', the unique selling point of Marcus Zusak's novel might work consistently throughout an entire book, but seems like a very weak afterthought during 'his' sporadic 'appearances' in the film. It's the one example of Percival allowing anything to come close to detracting from the film's mission statement, and with its jarring, intermittent monologues, almost does.<br/><br/>Joining 'War Horse' and more so 'The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas' as recent war dramas to be lauded and then treasured for years to come, 'The Book Thief' should steal your heart completely. Or, as Liesel would say, merely borrow it."
"cgbarr-73033","7","0","0","3 July 2020"," It's good, but not the book
","It's a great quality movie, but it lacked some of the context that gave a lot of the scenes significance. In fact, some of the most powerful moments in the plot were missing entirely. In terms of quality, it's a fine movie. It simply lacked the emotional intensity that made The Book Thief one of the best stories I've ever read. And however much I love Geoffrey Rush, his version of Hans was not a very accurate or worthy one- that could have easily been the director's fault though. If you haven't read the book, not everything will make sense, but you might enjoy the movie nonetheless."

","From the studio that brought ""The Life Of Pi"" this is the tale of ""The Books Thief"" as narrated by Death : Roger Allan . As when Death tells a story, you really have to listen. It is just a small story really about, amongst other things, concerning a teen : Sophie Nelisse, an accordionist : Geoffrey Rush, some fanatic Germans, a Jewish fist fighter and quite a lot of thievery . It begins February 1938 when Liesel : Sophie Nelisse, is traveling by train along with her mother and brother, but an unfortunate incident takes place. Firstly, she takes a book from a graveyard titled ""The Grave diggers Handbook"", and subsequently, finding solace by books reading. Along the way a voice representating Death tells the happenings. Then, the adolescent named Liesel is adopted by a foster family, formed by stepfather called Hans Hubermann : Geoffrey Rush and stepmother named Rosa Hubermann : Emily Watson, both of whom have a Jewish refugee called Max Vandervurg : Ben Schnetzer, hidden at their basement. She undercoverly meets the Jewish and quickly become good and close friends. The more time she spends with the Jew, the more she learns about the value of friendship and reading. It will be the attractive start of an extreme romance with books. She also befriends his next door neighbor and schoolmate, too. At the beginning she is unable to read but thanks to his friends she rapidly learns and becomes really captivated with reading anything she can, even stealing books and sharing them, too.<br/><br/>Exciting and enjoyable coming-of-age story set in Nazi time with interesting themes, family relation, and full of courage beyond words , being based on historical facts. As at the film happens some historical events , such as : books burning similar to the famous Berlin books bonfire , 1938 Night of Shattered Crystals , bombing over German towns by Allied aviation, Jewish pursuits, among others . Stars a little girl marvelously performed by Sophie Nelisse, playing a peculiar teenager subjected to war horror while learning about the value of life and words thanks to her insatiable books reading . Geoffrey Rush plays perfectly a kind-hearted and friendly person. And Emily Watson plays pretty well as the good and understanding adoptive stepmother.<br/><br/>It contains a sensitive and rousing musical score by the veteran and prolific master John Williams. As well as a colorful and evocative cinematography by Florian Balhaus. The motion picture was compellingly directed by Brian Percival. He is a good craftsman who has usually directed episodes and TV series, such as : Downtown Abbey, Clocking off, Shakespeare told, Dark Angel and a movie titled A boy called Dad. Rating 7/10. Above average. Well worth watching . Essential and indispensable seeing."

The Book Thief easily pulls your heartstrings and has some very sad scenes. I think what gives this movie its ""one of a kind"" touch is unlike most holocaust films, The Book Thief takes place from a child's view in Nazi Germany.
All in all I personally enjoy the book more, it is more in depth and time accurate. But for a movie made after a book this is a great watch, and I recommend this to everybody wanting to see a look in on their past."
"Red-125","9","0","0","24 December 2019"," An amazing film, narrated by Death
","The Book Thief (2013) was directed by Brian Percival. It's an unusual movie in which Death is the narrator. In Death Takes a Holiday (1934) The Seventh Seal (1957), and Black Orpheus (1959) death is an on-screen character. However, in this case, we see the film from Death's point of view.<br/><br/>Sophie Nélisse portrays Liesel Meminger, whose mother is taken by the Nazis because she's a Communist. Liesel isn't Jewish, so she's not sent to a concentration camp. Instead, she is placed in the home of Hans and Rosa Hubermann. (Portrayed by Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson.) They aren't the happiest of couples, but they protect and care for Liesel.<br/><br/>Telling much more about the plot wouldn't be right for this movie. Needless to say, the world turns upside down for all of the lead characters. It's hard to act in a way that even resembles normal in this horrible, abnormal period.<br/><br/>The direction is excellent, and Sophie Nélisse was already a superb actor at the age of 13, when the movie was produced. (She has gone on to star in many movies since 2013.)<br/><br/>We watched this film on the small screen, where it worked well. The Book Thief has an excellent 7.6 rating. I think it's even better than that."
"andrewjasonmorris","7","0","0","1 December 2019"," ""Heaven"" isn't all its cracked up to be.
","I just saw the movie ""The Book Thief"" and I would like to give my opinion on it. This movie is based off of the book by Markus Zusak. A girl named, Liesel, who is welcomed with open arms to a man and his wife. The wife is a very mean women and the man acts very sweet when Liesel first arrives. This movie sets places during World War II. This movie shows what a family did to hide a Jewish person at this time.<br/><br/>In this movie, I liked the presentation of the bombs falling from the sky and hitting the town. I found it ironic that the street name was heaven and it got bombed. I liked that the movie showed Liesel and her love for books. The movie also had some cliffhangers in their that made you gasp and I thought they did a terrific job to pull the watcher in. I didn't like that there were some things in the movie that were very unclear. For example, they didn't mention who the narrator was at all during the movie. Another example would be at the start of the movie when Liesel enters the house the mom gives her a white ball and they don't mention what t is throughout the movie either. I didn't like how long it took for the movie to start becoming interesting but after about the 1 hour mark it gets a lot better. I believe the moral lesson of this movie was to show the power of literacy because Liesel begins to read better everyday and she quietly rebels against the Nazi party. Even the Jewish man, Max, who the family is hiding and he writes his story of Hitlers ""Mein Kampf"". All in all I would give this movie a 7/10 mainly because it was slow and some parts were very confusing to understand but it was a good storyline."
"gokselcin","6","0","0","10 July 2019"," Unfortunately, not good as expected
","2nd wold war is sill a charming subject for all art works. But, existing productions which have become touchstones determine some adequacy boundaries for the new ones. The masterpiece works like Pianist, Schindler's list, Life is Beatiful or the recent examles; Dunkirk, Son of Saul have created an overall degree of II. World War films. Thus, every new production should pay attention to previous works to catch an original point of view on a subject which is treated many many times.
The Book Thief, unfortunately, can't avoid falling traps and presents lots of cliche during the whole movie.
Exaggerated dialogues, idealised characters and impresice settings...
So, what a pity, this movie is not more than a titbits."

They captured the period really well, not only showing the horrors but also adding the closeness and charm and good nature of the community, well some of them anyway. Great acting from all the cast, moments of sadness, humour and love. Although fictional, It demonstrated that not everyone was bad during they awful period, done were decent human beings with compassion who simply could not fight back or stop what what was happening.

It didn't even mention half of the book stolen/received by Liesel Meminger. As far as I remembered, the second book mentioned was ""The Invisible Man'' instead of ""Shoulder Shrug"".

I suppose, my rate and opinion would be probably different and I would like the movie more if I hadn't read the book already. But as I know the strong connection between the characters, the love, the sadness, the misery of some of them and as I know how I got attached to them, I can't say that the movie accomplished that completely.

","I recently finished ""The Book Thief"" in my Holocaust Literature class, it is this awe-inspiring story of this little Jewish girl named Liesel, who moves in with a German family in Molching, Germany; during the early years of World War II (1939-42). The movie follows Liesel as she struggles to learn to read, although manages to sneak several books even when not knowing what they are. Her new ""family"", Hans and Rosa, aren't Jewish but do not support the Nazi party and make several efforts to help other Jewish people, including a sharp young Jewish man named Max. Sophie Nelisse plays Liesel perfectly, and so does Ben Schnetzer who plays Max.<br/><br/>I loved the writer's use of Death as the narrator, as he introduces Liesel and his thoughts on her life, and his descriptions of everyone as the story goes along. Throughout the movie, there is also a juxtaposition of kindness and cruelty; acts of kindness in the face of cruel behavior. This theme in the movie perfectly highlights Liesel's struggle along with her character. I believe the movie could have illustrated the true horrors of the Holocaust better, including during the Jewish death walk scene. Overall, I learned much from the movie. That doing what is right should take precedence over everything else and never to let anyone stop you from achieving. I believe others will also get a better understanding of the silent resistance during the Holocaust, those who didn't fight outright but instead silently harbored Jewish people and resisted against the Nazi party.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 9/10 stars, all the actors portrayed their characters with such emotion and depth, and the whole plot was beautifully executed."
"myacummings-17924","9","0","0","15 November 2018"," The Book Thief - A Burning Passion
","Recently, I watched the film ""The Book Thief"", directed by Brian Percival. The film begins with a young Liesel and her brother on a train ride to meet their new parents in the fictional town of Molching, Germany (1939-42), as their real mother can no longer take care of them. Unfortunately, Liesel's brother is claimed by death, who is also the narrator. From that point on, Liesel is taken in by a family who helps her learn to read and operate in a Nazi propaganda infused world. Along the way, she develops a curious and risky passion for reading and meets a new friend named Rudy.
What I enjoyed about ""The Book Thief"" was its tale of a young girl who went from not being able to read, to instantly falling in love with books. While developing her love for books, she also dealt with the many troubles of adolescence and growing up; which helped normalize her in a world that was changing for the worst.
Overall, the moral I saw constantly throughout the film, was to help and protect those who can't do so themselves. Another moral I noticed was to stand up for what is right and resist what is wrong rather than merely follow it, as many did back in the 1930s-40s, for the fear of being different."

It really was that strong of a performance Emily Watson and Geoffrey Rush are great as usual. <br/><br/>It's at times maybe a bit too dramatic and trying too hard to make everything a spectacle.

Liesel is illiterate but takes a shine to reading.

","The movie has good scenery and seem to be historically correct, but it fails in the acting. The main character seems plain and doesn't evolve at all during the movie (I know to cast a child is hard, but they failed hard on that). 
The characters doesn't get the proper deepness they need to the public to feel closer to them (except maybe Rosa and perhaps Rudy), they doesn't walk comfortably in their world, their actions doesn't seem natural and justificated. 
Maybe it was just me, but the accent and the mix of languages doesn't quite fit in, especially considering that they were on Germany and they were on war against English people!, they should just make everyone speak english as if it were a translation (though this is my personal preference)"
"ishan-pec","6","0","0","12 April 2018"," Decent but could have been a lot better
","Firstly, let me state at the onset that I have read the book and loved it. Movies based on books often start with an inherent handicap with viewers like me and movies which have done a better job than the source material can be counted on a single hand with fingers to spare. So my observations are definitely coloured from that perspective. <br/><br/>Well, the movie is overall good and largely stays very close to the source material. It has high production value, the cast look their part and acting is largely good. However, the movie seems to lack a soul, and therein lies my problem.<br/><br/>Firstly, I believe the source material is a warm story in a dark setting. With its brightly lit sets, immaculate and dare I say fashionable dresses, and generally well-off surroundings, the characters never come off as indigent or suffering. It was difficult to understand why Leisel's mom was calling her dirty when she first meets her. The coat she was wearing could have easily come from a Ralph Lauren store. Overall, the movie could have done better with a cheaper wardrobe and set design.<br/><br/>Next, Rudy and Leisel in the book are extremely energetic and passionate. Rudy, especially, came across as someone destined to conquer the world by his sheer confidence and charm. In the movie, they are both much more reserved and the movie is lesser for it. It is the juxtaposition of the spirit of the kids with their extremely harsh surroundings that lent the book its gravity. And both are toned down to a large extent in the movie. For example, in the book, Rudy is constantly hungry which makes Liesel and Rudy steal food alongwith a bunch of other kids. A single apple makes for a good day! The gravity of their situation is never felt in the movie.<br/><br/>Similarly, the character development while decent could have been much better and that is the most apparent in the case of Rosa Hubermann, Liesel's adopted mom. Also, the commentary by death which was brilliant in the book just came across as tacky in the movie without lending any value. Lastly, the editing at a few places was shoddy, especially in the last scene which was devastating in the book but was fairly average in the movie. <br/><br/>I would recommend watching the movie and people who have not read the book would definitely enjoy it more."

","I went into this film having not read the book it was based upon, so I'm not sure exactly how faithful it was to the source material, but overall it seemed quite intriguing. The story being set in a small German village was an interesting vehicle for how major events in history are interpreted.<br/><br/>The main strengths of this film stem from the excellent performances of its main cast, with the formidable Geoffrey Rush as the kind-hearted Hans, Emily Watson as the secretly loving but strict Rosa and Sophie Nélisse as the determined and fiesty Liesel. The score from John Williams is also beautiful, which is what you would expect from a man of his talents.<br/><br/>The theme of using literature as an escape from life in Nazi Germany was well well explored, whilst the film being narrated by the embodiment of Death allowed for some intriguing philosophical ideas to be introduced.<br/><br/>However, I felt the film was not as emotionally impactful as it could have been and there was a lack of tension in moments where there should have been, so that detached me from the narrative somewhat. Also I felt aspects of life in Nazi Germany were skimmed over with not enough focus in some areas."

"elizajstocks","9","0","0","15 May 2017"," A really well done adaptation of an amazing story.
","Quite obviously, this was a movie adaptation of The Book Thief by Marus Zusak. I read the book for the first time a few years ago, and it quickly became one of my top favorites, however I'd never seen the movie until recently. I thought that Brian Percival did an excellent job of bringing Zusak's world to life.<br/><br/>The artistic value of the film cannot be ignored. The production team did a great job on keeping the set and costume designs true to the time period, down to the tiniest of details. The simple piano theme during the intro not only fits beautifully with the time period, but it also portrays the simpleness of childhood while adding a darker element in minor. The cinematography was also impressive, which just adds to the overall artistry of the movie.<br/><br/>As far as entertainment value goes, many people know and love the book (which is amazing!) but I feel like the film isn't getting the attention that it deserves. This was easily one of the best film adaptations of a book that I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The Book Thief is definitely thought-provoking. Of course, there's the unique narration by Death himself. Then there's the fact that the story of WWII is told through the eyes of a young German girl who is hiding a Jew in her basement. It delves into the struggles with racism, especially in the Jesse Owens scene. It really shows the effects that war has on people, especially children. Then there's also the fact that books saved her life. One of the scenes that really illustrates this is when Liesel is reading to everyone in the bomb shelter. Earlier in the story, they had attended a book burning, but at this point, books are the only thing providing Liesel and everyone around her with hope and comfort. <br/><br/>The plot line is so rich and juicy and yet so simple at the same time. The characters are all so three-dimensional and developed so well that it's like they're real people, which is part of what makes the final scene so heartbreaking---and I don't mean ""Aww,"" single tear, and move on with your life type of 'heartbreaking'. No, I mean blotchy-faced, puffy-eyed, heart-wrenching sobs that leave you out of commission for hours afterward type of 'heartbreaking'. Seriously, buckle up.<br/><br/>The only reason I omitted a star from my rating was because I didn't like how they portrayed Death in the movie. What he is lacking in personality, he makes up for in creepiness, which, believe it or not, is not in the nature of Death in the book at all. His character in the book seems much more genuine, and he looks at gathering the souls of the dead as a boring, dead end job that he desperately needs a vacation from, whereas Death in the movies is more stereotypical of the grim reaper. That's my only real complaint. Sorry for the long post!"

","It's heart may be in the right place but ""The Book Thief"" suffers mightily from the almost impossible task of translating a book which was basically about the power of words into a medium that is often at its best when it uses as few words as possible. When an illiterate young girl is adopted by a poor but worthy German family prior to the outbreak of the second world war her desire to better herself is aided and abetted by her adoptive father. As the influence of The Party grows the family give shelter to a Jew thus endangering all of them. That's about it,really in basic terms,but the girl and the fugitive from Nazism develop a friendship and he eventually leaves the house in order to protect them all. The village is destroyed in a bombing raid and only the girl survives. In the end,a bit like in ""Titanic"",we see the mementoes of her long life and history. It's all very standard stuff but somehow unaffecting when we should be in floods of tears. What happened to ""Death""?Here he is an almost peripheral figure whereas in the novel he binds it together and adds to our understanding of the actions of the characters. And the German accents ?They were very much of the ""Ve have vays of making you talk""variety and merely distracted the viewer.We know they're supposed to be Germans,for heaven's sake,this isn't ""Hallo,Hallo!"" where Herr Flick of the Gestapo is going to limp in slapping his leg with his baton. Mr Rush and Miss Watson were particularly guilty of giving us 1950s British War film Germans,but then they say there's nothing like a foreign accent as a prop an actor. I did want to like ""The Book Thief"" and I did want to be moved by it.Unfortunately I didn't and I wasn't."

","A friend told me ""The Book Thief"" was her favorite book. So naturally, respecting her opinion (she is a college English professor, after all) I had to find out what makes this so wonderful.<br/><br/>First of all, the film is a beautiful experience. You may find it difficult to imagine that you could relate to, and sympathize with, a group of average patriotic German citizens during the Nazi years. The events in Germany between 1938 and 1945 as seen through the eyes of a young girl (the book thief of the title) remind the reader/viewer, however, that these are just ordinary people going about their ordinary lives with the horror of the Holocaust and the other excesses of Nazi Germany as a background. The people seem to be too busy surviving, for the most part, to object to the political and social evils surrounding them. They were also terrified that drawing attention to themselves - any attention - would result in their ""disappearing"" as a number of the characters in the story ""disappear."" A young girl learns to read with the inspiration and help of her adoptive father, her best friend, the Burgomeister's wife, and a Jewish fugitive hiding in the basement.<br/><br/>The acting is superb! Sophie Nelisse is breathtaking as the central character, Liesl. Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson are wonderful as Liesl's adoptive parents.

","""The Book Thief"" has good intentions but over-all I found it muddled. There were too many things going on – Liesel's relationship with her surrogate parents and with Rudy. Then there was hiding a Jewish person in the family household – and then Liesel's relationship with him. One could add other themes like the growing Nazism of the towns-folk, the Allied bombings, Liesel stealing books...<br/><br/>The film just tries too hard when making any emotional statement. Aside from our central character I never felt any emotional connection to the others. Liesel's surrogate mother was a caricature.<br/><br/>Although well-filmed and colourful cinematically it was bothersome to hear German accents and words popping up constantly (Ja, Nien...). The bodies of Liesel's surrogate parents and Rudy after the bombing raid look so pristine beside the ruined homes – giving additional phoniness to this film.<br/><br/>Also that over-narration of Dr. Death added to the cloyingness.<br/><br/>Overall the story held some interest, but I never felt much of a main focal point."

Whereas she is mentioned mostly especially late in the book. In the book it is mentioned some tragic incidents about her and her sons. Also Liesel goes to her and reads book to Miss Holtzapfel. Likewise not mentioned about Ilsa Hermann in detail. However she is a very important character in the book. Many times Liesel goes her house for stealing books and Ilsa Hermann noticed that. She leaves a letter to Liesel and say that she does not has to come in by stealth, she can come anytime that she wants. These details are not part of the movie. Except for these there are also some details that not mentioned or different according the book in the movie.<br/><br/>Although some criticism above, generally I like the movie.

","All too often one ends up on IMDb writing negative reviews for the plethora of trash film making that seems so common these days, combined with terrible reality television shows (cough cough Kardashians cough cough rubbish)...<br/><br/>Anyways, for a change I found this film, and having recalled reading the book I thought i'd check it out.<br/><br/>Really it is just one of those stories quietly told, the inner sadness of a girl given up, who along the way grows her inner strength, her joy at life and her compassion for others at the same time that she grows to love her new 'parents' and her friend Rudy.<br/><br/>To be honest, I recall little of the book, I know I enjoyed it because I know I have a hard copy in a storage box somewhere, but because my memory is not what it once was I can't entirely compare the film to the book.... sorry.<br/><br/>But I digress, the relationship with her new parents grows, Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson are up to their usual standard of amazing, Emily has always had the ability (to me) to play these quiet characters, understated, and yet you learn through her quietness the strength of self and the huge well of love she has, Geoffrey does something similar, through his quiet resolve, his determination to keep his family safe it is obvious that his character to is a well of love, compassion and warmth.<br/><br/>Sophie Nélisse is a delight, a gorgeous girl who portrays a character of warmth, humour, fun, and that typical youthful wish to rebel. She is a delight to watch as she inhabits the character so well, and tells the story of her life so beautifully. Her evolution in life and her learning to love reading are to me so typical of many of us, it tells a truthful story in this sense.<br/><br/>Nico Liersch is Rudy is also a joy, his not so secret love shows itself in unexpected places and lifts what could be a sad moment into one of happiness. He plays his character with a sense of wonder and curiosity about him, he appears to live life to the full and seems strangely apart from all the Nazi activity about him, no doubt this is more the script than the acting, but its a part I thought interesting.<br/><br/>These two fine actors will I hope grow and become better known, if these is a early career highlight for them, then both seem to full of potential.<br/><br/>Lastly, the narration, it is beautifully done, sometimes you don't really notice it but you absorb the words. The last narration is full of heart, of love and sadness and it makes you wonder if indeed some aspect of this narrators existence does exist - wouldn't we all love to know the answer to that?<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is a gorgeous film, it tells stories of friendship and trust, of love and of loss, of humanity lost and found, to see it will remain with you, and to not spend the time seeing it is a pity for you will be the poorer for that choice."

As Liesel maintains, she does not steal books; rather, she borrows them. But, it is out of this habit of reading that she changes so many lives. And eventually, her own as well. <br/><br/>There is death, but death with dignity. There is courage, but courage with passion. Above all, there is understated love that binds all the actors, young and old, in this period drama so well adapted from a book by Marcus Zukas, and so well enacted by the main role players. Liesel, played by Sophie Nelisse, is the most beautiful young adult I have had the pleasure of watching on the screen. The actors who play the roles of Max, Rudy, and her Papa and Mama have all played extraordinary roles in the movie. <br/><br/>This movie is a must-see for everyone who loves to see balanced, tempered drama and thinks, like me, that it is not how long one lives but how well they do that is important."

","The book thief, Geoffrey Rush, Emily Watson! 2 actors I admire much... So I got rid of the TV commercial and prepared myself for a great viewing. I did get it; I have seen quite a few movies from this era and this topic. The first one would have been the one with its haunting music and a favourite introduction to classical guitar debut ""Jeux Interdits"" (forbidden games) TBT is set 4 years before I was born therefore depicts a lot of things that are buried somewhere in my aging mind but, yes, ring a bell and wake up some emotions. As much as I enjoyed the film I was uncomfortable with some aspects of it. I did read a few comments before I wrote mine, knowing that each of us is entitled to his/hers opinion, and found some that like me beg questions. I don't read much so at least was not worried about how the film was loyal to the book yet wonder why in certain cases filmmakers seem to corrupt a well known book with changes that really don't do anything for the film... Some did comment about the accent, and the use of German words thrown about English spoken sentences. I too agree it was disturbing, especially when I could not understand the meaning of some of these words. I guess that in a book (read these were also used in the book) it's quite different, you can pause and, today via internet search, get the answer in seconds. This is not so at a theatre, even in my case watching the recording, you seldom read a book in one go, but a movie should not be interrupted. As for the accent I was not too demanding I took it as a little 'salt and pepper' in the mix to get a German flavour. I do prefer a foreign film with subtitle but here this is not the case, and I'm not sure if plain English accent (and which one!) would have had the same impact.

","Well all I can really say i s the director and screenplay writer have done an extremely hard job in order to ruin a magnificent script and turn it into a drab, boring and below average movie. The movie started off with death as a narrator as it is in the novel, things didn't last that way. As we went ahead with the movie the massacre started. I have seen each and every important detail in the book being reedited and changed into something that is not even half as good. The choice of the actors to represent the characters was acceptable in the cases of Hans Hubermann depicted by Geoffrey Rush and Rudy Steiner by Nico Liersch. The other picks were a failure in my perspective. Rosa Hubermann for example was way too nicer than its original character by Mark Zusak and showed more affection than what was expected. Moving on we see the scenes of Max Vandenburg and here would be my least favorite part. The scenes were meant to contain his illness and suffering , and Leisel's compassion through out his tiresome illness. It simply wasn't depicted in the right way and was dragged allover as if the director was seeing the events as a rather superficial stray of events. The tendency of the director to avoid portraying any scenes of violence that were written in the novel was quite shocking. Whipping, spanking , slapping , kicking , wrestling , boxing to mention a few were edited out of the script marring an already quite drab scenario. To sum up the performances of Geoffrey Rush and Nico Liersch were the only dim-lights in a rather dark room. Honestly I won't recommend the movie for anybody who have loved the novel which is considered one of the best of all time."

","From the very beginning I was intrigued by this movie. They set the scene so eloquently by addressing the world's mortality which only made me more invested in little Liesel Meminger's journey. Her thirst for new literature is not surprising as it would provide a much needed escape from a dismal reality.<br/><br/>The whole thing really gives you a clear understanding of how terrible it really must have been to live in such a fascist time. I felt their fear around an uncertain future and respect their need to conform. The thing that really disgusted me though was the ignorance and naivety of some who truly believed in Hitlers regime. They relished in the prospect of war and treated human life like it was worthless.<br/><br/>Although this movie was heartbreaking it was told beautifully with an air of sophistication."

","Well worthy of being watched in a pair with ""The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas"" (which is perhaps even a greater and deeper, if more harrowing film), ""The Book Thief"" tells us more about that hitherto rather rare being, the on-screen ""good German"". Here several appear, only to be dispatched into the embrace of Death (in fact a key character in the film, played by Roger Allam, who also narrates) - most likely by a British bomb. Like ""The Boy..."", this film also reminds us that, while kids did indeed have to grow up fast in Hitler's Germany, that did not mean that there was no such thing as a childhood at all. The heroine in the film - an extremely sweet and persuasive Sophie Nelisse as Liesel - would like finally to have a childhood, having seen her brother die at the time when she was being given away - for her own safety - by her communist mother. And coming to a smallish Bavaria-like town, she now has the chance to do this, in the care of doting foster father Hans and ostensibly-severe foster mother Rosa, conveyed splendidly as characters (almost by underacting) by Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson. As is noted in the film itself, these main three characters are at the outset of their time together ordinary in the extreme, itself an extraordinary thing in Nazi Germany! Later the tension goes up a notch or two as they devote many months to the concealment of a young Jewish man (a fine role for Ben Schnetzer), as ""Papa"" makes good his promise to help out the family of the fellow soldier who saved his life during World War I (shades here of yet another fine film, by the way, this time one originating as a play, rather than a book, i.e. ""Good"" of 2008, starring Viggo Mortensen). In ""The Book Thief"", a number of profound and often moving insights are to be gained through a repeated focus on the relevance and importance of words and books, hence the title. This is all the more relevant given that a key way in which Liesel's young life is (sort of) put back on track is through her painstaking learning to read in the company of stepfather Hans. Like several successful films, this one has a story set slightly on the margins of huge events, being in this way left free to make its points without too much of the clutter that inevitably impacts upon more ""epic"" productions. Doubtless the book on which the film was based was good too, but that is not for me to say, given that I have not read it. The film tells a super story, is well-acted, full of truth and enlightenment, and is extremely nicely made. If one really wanted to say something about English with strong German accents interspersed with an occasional ""ja"", ""nein"" or ""und"" one could do so, but for me that would be pointless pedantry. To not get at least some worthwhile and enlightening experience out of this touching and meaningful film is tantamount to having a heart of stone..."

","I have recently watched the Book Thief, it was AMAZING. The plot summary was great, it is set in the midst of the second world war. The plot follows Lisel Meminger, a German girl, as she is taken away from her activist mother and left with two new parents to live a new life. As Lisel begins to settle in a strange man comes to the house in the middle of the night. He is a Jew and they need to protect him. <br/><br/>This is a tale of love, family, war and loss as we watch Lisel and her new family struggle through the war.<br/><br/>So what did I like about this film? Well where do I start? The story was realistic and was executed by brilliant acting. Even though the plot was simple it had a captivating story, and what I love about it, is that it shows the complication of Nazi Germany, that many German citizens didn't have a choice about fighting in the war. It was very effective because of the way it shows the relationships between the characters. <br/><br/>The ending was not Hollywood style, because it shows the harsh realities of the war, unlike many other Hollywood war films. This is good in someways because it highlights how bad the war really was, however the ending is a little too depressing, shocking and tear jerking. <br/><br/>Overall, I would definitely recommend this film. Also I would feel that there is a large age range of people who would enjoy it."

","I admired the novel by Markus Zusak which describes the experience of a young girl in wartime Germany but the story works better on the page than on the screen. Many of the ingredients - effective sets and locations, good photography and strong acting - are creditable, but the script is not strong enough and there is insufficient narrative dynamic to make this worthy film the success that British director Brian Perceval and his German crew clearly sought. <br/><br/>Young Canadian Sophie Nélisse does well as the central character Liesel Melinger and Australian Geoffrey Rush and Briton Emily Watson are excellent as her adoptive parents, while Roger Allam provides the gentle yet chilling voice of Death.

","I found this movie on DVD at my public library. I purposely went into it not knowing much about it, I normally just like to see what unfolds. It is set mainly in 1938 to 1945 Nazi Germany as war breaks out and Nazis are looking to purge out the Communists and the Jews.<br/><br/>The movie is narrated by Roger Allam as ""death"", the Grim Reaper, and the movie starts with his voice-over. There is a family on a train, a mother and her two children, a daughter and a younger son. The son gets sick, bleeds from his nose, and dies. They are forced to bury him near the train line during their journey.<br/><br/>We find out where they are going, to Stuttgart, a childless family are set to adopt the children, because the mother is unable to keep them, presumably because she is considered a communist and must flee. But the new parents get only one, the girl, and thus only half of the ""allowance"" the government would give them. Times were tough, they needed the resources.<br/><br/>The title reference belongs to the little girl, wonderful young (about 11) Canadian actress Sophie Nélisse as Liesel Meminger. It is her story, she yearns for knowledge and is particularly attracted to books. She is in virtually (maybe actually) in every scene, the success of this movie depends on her and she carries it well. She is not so much a ""thief"" as she is a ""borrower"". However right after a large book-burning in the street she picks up an unburned book and takes it home. When asked if it was hers she says ""It wasn't always mine."" <br/><br/>The movie probably also would have fallen flat if her adopted parents had not been great, and they are, played by Geoffrey Rush as the happy and generous Hans Hubermann, and Emily Watson as the gruff and frowning Rosa Hubermann. Also good was the blonde kid she became friends with, Nico Liersch as Rudy Steiner.<br/><br/>Very nice cinematography and sound engineering. In the approximate 1:45 into the movie, the bombing scenes were filled with explosions that rattled the pictures on the wall of my home theater room.<br/><br/>I have seen a number of movies set during Nazi Germany during that era and this is one of the best. It is the little girl's story and how she survived the war and prospered."

","Australian author Markus Zusak's novel, ""The Book Thief,"" was an international best-seller, but its film adaptation inexplicably soared (there's no other word) under the radar during its release in 2013 (one Oscar nomination _ for John Williams' score). It deserves better.<br/><br/>The two-hour-eleven-minute PG drama flies by, which is unusual for a story of this intensity.<br/><br/>With elements of ""The Diary of Anne Frank,"" ""Life Is Beautiful"" and ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,"" as well as of ""Au Revoir, les Enfants"" and ""The Pianist,"" it would be easy and convenient to write off ""The Book Thief"" as derivative, been-there-done-that twaddle designed to tug at the heartstrings and maybe pick up some awards along the way. The Nazis, after all, make easy targets (as well they should).<br/><br/>But thanks to director Brian Percival and smooth, underplayed narration by ""Death"" (Roger Allam, who plays the droll DI Fred Thursday on the ""Inspector Morse"" prequel ""Endeavour""), you're pulled into the story from the git-go, and before you know it, you've more or less standing in the well-worn shoes of the story's protagonist, young Liesel Meminger (Sophie Nelisse), an adopted girl on the verge of adolescence who is fostered by the Hubermann family after her father ""abandons"" her own brood and her mother is forced to give her up.<br/><br/>The Hubermanns _ and Sophie _ live on Himmel Street (Heaven Street) in Germany as the country is swallowed whole by Nazism. At one point the Hubermanns take in and hide in the basement Max Vandenburg, a young Jew, the son of a man who saved the life of the Hubermann patriarch, Hans (Geoffrey Rush), in World War I.<br/><br/>The linchpin of the story is Sophie's inability to read upon her arrival into the family. Hans begins to teach her, and then her ""education"" is aided and abetted by a most unlikely source. The opening of her eyes, and mind, in a culture now dedicated to the closure of both is an apt metaphor that works surprisingly and remarkably well.<br/><br/>The devil is in the details in any historical drama, especially one whose subject matter, Nazism, has been plowed so often, but director Percival and this sterling, deep cast are more than up to the task.<br/><br/>While Rush and Emily Watson (as Hans Hubermann's wife, Rosa) are unquestionably the strong underpinnings of the story, the film rises or falls on the narrow, schoolgirl shoulders of Nelisse's Liesel. The young Ontario-born actress is, simply put, wondrous in the role. One can't imagine the film existing at all, much less succeeding, without her.<br/><br/>This is a good one. Just be prepared to haul out the hanky, no matter what you tell yourself otherwise at the outset. It's more than worth it."
"pixrox1","8","6","20","25 November 2013"," What if they had a Holocaust, and only Disney reported it?
","THE BOOK THIEF is from Fox 2000 Pictures, part of a conglomerate that is not known for its sensitivity to Jewish Issues. If the Disney people actually HAD adapted THE BOOK THIEF to the film medium, it could not have looked more ""sanitized"" than director Brian Percival's vision here. The main characters in THE BOOK THIEF are mostly blonds, under the gun because they have Communist parents (an even bigger anathema to Fox than the Chosen People), they don't want to pay dues to the Nazi Party, or merely because they can run faster than the school bully. Unlike THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK, wherein the hidden Jews must be quiet as church mice and they're not even in Germany, those in THE BOOK THIEF somehow evade the Gestapo's notoriously meticulous record keeping in a major German city for YEARS, having snowball fights, writing novels, playing Jewish musical instruments, and building snowmen in their basements. The fact that post-war surveys indicated upwards of 90% of ordinary German civilian men and women actively collaborated in, knew of, and supported the extermination of six million Jews, apparently ALL the ""good"" Germans were concentrated into the one street where most of THE BOOK THIEF takes place. As the uniformed Nazi soldier tenderly carries the wounded main character to safety toward the end of the 131-minute film (only the last 10 minutes of which resembles a war movie at all, in which MILLIONS of so-called Christian German civilians ALSO died), one wonders which movie has the most pristine German Nazi Swastica flags--THE BOOK THIEF or Hitler's old favorite, TRIUMPH OF THE WILL? Unlike the recent Kate Winslet WWII flick, THE READER (another literary-focused look at the Holocaust, like DIARY and THIEF), this movie is more suitable for kids 10 and under. While it may not teach them to appreciate the hardships and horror of War, it could instill more respect for the joys of reading."

","For the Germans of course propaganda as a weapon was almost as effective as the V2 in the second world war so we can savour the irony of a film set against the background of WWII and portraying the conflict exclusively from the perspective of German civilians, serving as propaganda for the printed word in an era when Kindle and other 'tablets' are sweeping all before them and doing to the printed word what Henry Ford did to the horse and buggy. In a simplistic sense this is the other side of the coin to The Sound of Music; both share an approximate time scale (1938-1943) and locale (Germany-Austria) but whereas The Sound of Music falls into the Trapp of utilising primary colour that emphasises the picture-postcard 'gingerbread' houses, The Book Thief mutes its colour so that the overall feeling is documentary rather than chocolate box. By portraying the German civilians who populate the film as ordinary, humane, people, much the same as their counterparts in Allied countries the film runs the risk of being castigated as pro-German propaganda but realistically it is probably an accurate depiction of life at the time. The emphasis throughout is on humanity and rubbing along in the face of adversity which makes the ending - which states unequivocally that humanity is meaningless in the long run - more powerful. Overall a fine film and highly recommended."

","Reading reviews before, and watching this movie, I've decided to read the novel and forget about the movie. For me, it was just a pile of scraps from some lives put together in desperate search of a meaning. So, until I read the novel, I'll stick to the movie as it is. It is certainly not Schindler's list or La vita e bella. It does try to provoke some emotional response but fails. It's either too short or badly written and directed or both. It ends abruptly just when it becomes interesting. It deals with characters and their destinies superficially, with no explanation what, who, why, when or how. And leaves so many questions afterward. However, the cast is pretty good and Mr. Rush brilliant. But that's it. I'm especially mad at people who mix English (sometimes with an accent, sometimes plain) with German. Jesus, guys, do not take your viewers as fools. Make a movie placed in Germany either in English or German. This mixture is ridiculous. Nobady zer shpoke Inglish zet wel und srtnly not wiz Deutsches akzent. This film is not supposed to be a comedy (although the narrator, Death, tries to say: My job is dirty, but someone has to do it). And, as a matter of fact, the girl stole only one (1) book (probably that's why this is not called The Books Thief) and with no significance to the story. Final question: what did the makers of this movie try to say and to whom?"

","If you ever wanted to explain to a child what went on in Germany prior to and during World War 2 then The Book Thief is ideal.<br/><br/>Shown from the perspective of young Liesel after she is placed in a foster home we see a German people steadily influenced then overcome by the Nazi party. Children wearing the infamous brown shirts, singing nationalist anthems and attending book burnings remind us how that society was controlled by their political leaders. We all know what happened to communists and Jews during this period without the ""Schindlers List"" graphic detail yet the tension for those working against the barbarity and bigotry remains palpable.<br/><br/>The main story is simple and drawn around somewhat stereotypical characters but thanks to the talents of the brilliant Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson playing her step-parents they are more than one dimensional. Young Liesel and her friend Rudi carry the film on their young shoulders with the wide-eyed optimism you would expect of their age and pre-1940's era. The only serious criticism I could offer is of the narration which seemed totally unnecessary as the film told the story perfectly. I still remain baffled as to why the film-makers needed a voice-over to occasionally point out the bleeding obvious? Call it artistic license I suppose? <br/><br/>In 2014 as our media and political parties infect us with the belief that refugees or worshipers of different religions are our enemies I found The Book Thief to be a great antidote. Yearning for knowledge by not burning books and doing something when innocents are victimised is the cure to hatred, ignorance and intolerance.<br/><br/>If you can stand up for what's right in Nazi Germany you can do it today. This is the lesson of The Book Thief and I encourage you to share it."

The harsh realities of war from the perspective of normal citizens trying to live day by day in extremely stressful circumstances is portrayed with such heart-felt emotions of distress and anger combined with laughter and joy in very tough times. This is an unpredictable film and viewers should be prepared for the unexpected, for positive and negative outcomes. The book thief is a simple tale of extraordinary people brought together under exceptional conditions, experiencing the atrocities of civilian life during World War 2 in Germany. After seeing this film, it is difficult not to be affected by the lives enacted in this story, from the innocent young trying to understand it all; to the elderly that have the same issues in trying to comprehend what is happening to their lives.

She is stellar in this role and as usual her artistic gifts, give the film gravitas and direction. There are scenes between she and, the child and with her husband that will sear your soul and touch your, heart more deeply than anything ever put on screen. This is a, performance that deserves an outrageously delayed Academy Award for Ms., Watson, even if it is a mislaid supporting actress one. It would be, ironic if she receives her first Oscar for supporting because she is, actually the unforgettable centerpiece of every piece she appears in, and defines the word ""star.""

","After seeing three films featuring the horrors of slavery, it is only right to throw a holocaust film in there. However, it should be noted that The Book Thief isn't a rated R picture, so it may give you an idea of what is going on, but never gets so gritty you feel that a young person couldn't go see for it would leave them with nightmares. With that said though, don't think this film doesn't have the potential to bring tears to your eyes.<br/><br/>Characters & Story<br/><br/>The lead of this film is a young girl named Liesel (played by Sophie Nelisse) who, seemingly, was abandoned by her mother and now is under the care of an old couple. Said couple, Hans (played by Geoffrey Rush) and Rosa (played by Emily Watson) are complete opposites. Hans is the usual silly dad you would find in a sitcom, though not on the level of Phil on Modern Family, and Rosa is the more serious of the two. Maybe even so serious she could fit a possible stereotype of eastern European people. Outside of Liesel's new family is the boy who has a crush on her Rudy (played by Nico Liersch), and he seemingly has the type of love for her which could be a movie on its own, maybe a 1940s German version of Bridge to Terabithia. Then there is Max (played by Ben Schentzer) who is a Jew Liesel bonds with as he hides in their home, and lastly there is death (voiced by Roger Allam) who is, naturally, an ominous figure.<br/><br/>Together, they make a film in which we watch Liesel become familiar with a street where all these characters meet, and the street is named Heaven, or Heavenly. Liesel starts off aloof, but Rudy breaks down those walls, and Hans is the first one to help her truly blossom. Then comes Max who inspires Liesel to write, and amongst this all is a woman named Ilsa Hermann (played by Barbara Auer) who provides the resources for Liesel's vocabulary to grow. But, as Liesel's mind advances, so does Germany's war and with Death being a character in the movie, you are always on pins and needles.<br/><br/>Praise<br/><br/>First and foremost, perhaps there hasn't been as interesting of a young female lead in a movie since Ivana Baquero in Pan's Labyrinth or Lina Leandersson in the original Let The Right One In. But, considering Nelisse speaks English, likely she maybe able to follow after Saoirse Ronan, Jennifer Lawrence or even Chloe Moretz and find herself a nice career. It must be noted though, part of the beauty of her performance comes from playing off her wonderful supporting cast. Rush's character, and Watson's too to a point, make wonderful parents who present both the fun loving side of humanity, and the side of humanity which worries about everything and because of that, they become critical of those who find freedom in just living.<br/><br/>Also, a part of me liked how, despite the holocaust background, the focus wasn't strongly on Max. If anything, him coming in and the beginning of the holocaust showed that, even as allegiances had to be made, not everyone was in support of the regime, at least in private. Perhaps though, most of all, it was just nice to watch Nelisse get comfortable in the role. She started off aloof, as said, and awkward to the point where you want to question her talent, but as he character becomes familiar with her surroundings, we see her abilities shine and that is why I think she could have a great career with this being her western world launch pad.<br/><br/>Criticism<br/><br/>Of course though, as with any movie, there are issues. For one, though I love Rudy's character, sometimes Liersch had that same awkwardness Nelisse had, but for him it never ended. Even in the middle, to end, of the movie, he still seemed like he wasn't comfortable yet and while it didn't badly hamper things, he did stick out. Other than that, the only other issue was the ending. The ending leaves you with some unanswered questions and a lack of clarity. Not in such a major way where it ruins the movie, but it will likely lead to you asking someone, like I will on IMDb, what their take was.<br/><br/>Overall: Worth Seeing<br/><br/>I'll admit, I didn't get as emotional as I thought I would/ should during many scenes, but after Scandal, Monogatari and The Best Man Holiday, maybe I'm just all cried out this weekend. Still, the performances are largely brilliant, the story is compelling and there are moments which bring tears and laughter. Not to forget, this could possibly be the movie which may lead to Ms. Nelisse's career taking off, and who doesn't want to say they remember seeing a quality actress when they first started (she has other work, but this seems to be her first western-world role)."

","The Book Thief is a movie told through the eyes of the citizens of Germany during World War II. Due to events leading up to the war, a mother is forced to give up her child for adoption to seek refuge for herself. The girl, Leisel (Sophie Nélisse), is adopted by a poor family of two, an older couple, who live in the heart of Germany. The father, Hans (Geoffrey Rush), is kind, friendly, and quickly forms a bond with Leisel. The mother, however, is much more strict and uptight. Being the new girl, Leisel only made one friend, a young boy named Rudy (Nico Liersch) who one day dreams of going to the Olympics.<br/><br/>Coming from a poor family, Leisel is illiterate and wishes to learn how to read. Throughout the movie, Hans and Leisel read books that Leisel ""borrows"" from a rich family who hired the mother to do their laundry. Around the halfway point in the movie, the family is faced with a new challenge when a Jewish man seeks refuge in Leisel's home from the Nazis.<br/><br/>The events of the movie are suspenseful and tug at the heart strings. However, The Book Thief tends to drag on from time to time. With most of the movie about reading books and hiding from the Nazis, some of the scenes are longer than needed. This does not take away from the fact that the movie does an excellent job of portraying how evil the Nazis really are.<br/><br/>Overall, The Book Thief is a mediocre movie. With one big name actor, Geoffrey Rush, the other actors in the movie simply blend together.

The questions these children are confronted with in the film are done with eye opening scenes. The historical events are accurate but toned down somewhat which is in good taste with a younger viewer. The mix of German and English puts you in the scene trying to understand the meaning of some lines. The film moves along at a good pace with a great soundtrack. Enjoy!!!"

","That a film that is so meticulously made and directed by Brian Percival with a cast of brilliant actors in excellent performances and concentrating on a different view of WW II Germany should have attracted well in the box office. It failed. But here it is now in DVD format and in many ways this may be the best way to absorb this compelling story.<br/><br/>THE BOOK THIEF, based on the beloved bestselling World War II-era novel by Markus Zusak and adapted for the screen by Michael Petroni, tells the story of Liesel Meminger (Sophie Nélisse),a spirited and courageous young girl who transforms the lives of everyone around her when she is sent to live with a foster family, Hans Hubermann (Geoffrey Rush) and his caustic wife Rosa (Emily Watson) in World War II Germany. Her brother has died and her mother is selling Liesel for cash. She arrives having just stolen her first book, ""The Gravediggers Handbook"" - it will be the beginning of a love affair with books. Her new Papa teaches her to read and bestows love and affection while Mama remains businesslike and cold. Liesel's only friend is Rudy (Nico Liersch), a spicy little neighbor boy with whom she becomes close. The Hubermann's agree to hide a young Jewish lad Max Vandenburg (Ben Schnetzer), the son of a close family friend, who is ill. The Hubermanns and Liesel nurse him back to health but as the war progresses Max must leave to prevent the Hubermanns from being discovered as harboring a Jew. Papa is conscripted but returns and eventually the village is bombed at the peak of the war. How Liesel deals with all of these changes makes for a fascinating, emotionally gripping story.<br/><br/>The aspects of the film are so beautifully wrought – acting, cinematography (Florian Ballhaus), musical score (John Williams), screenplay, story – that this is a film that likely will become part of movie lovers' libraries. The fact that it is narrated by Death (Roger Allam) may have put off many people in the theater. At home, it is simply another haunting element Highly Recommended."

","First things first: I haven't read the book. This despite the fact that, I've worked in a bookstore for nearly eight years. I've always meant to, read it, but when I won tickets to the Mill Valley Film Festival, premiere, I had less than 24 hours until the screening. The Book Thief is a grand film, nuanced and thoughtful, and buoyed, by strong performances from Geoffrey Rush, Emily Watson, and newcomer, Sophie NÃ©lisse. We watch as Germany falls under the storm of war, the, country slowly descending into madness as we follow one girl who finds, a home in the care of a couple at odds with the Fascist ideologies, sweeping the nation. Soon Liesel (NÃ©lisse) meets Rudy, a neighborhood, boy, and Max, a young Jewish man her new parents must hide in their, basement. Built around the external drama of the war and its consequences is, Lisel's discovery of reading and books. Words are a worthful commodity, in her ravaged society, and the care paid by the filmmakers and actors, to accentuate the importance of stories to Lisel's survival makes this, movie all the more compelling. The cinematography, editing, and script, are all excellent as well. In short, The Book Thief is the kind of film you could show your, children as a way to first begin a discussion of World War II and the, Holocaust, but it never takes shortcuts from darker subject matter to, reach this role. An excellent movie.,"
"kluseba","7","3","11","6 December 2013"," Another sophisticated and lengthy drama about Germany's most evil twelve years in history
","Here comes another Nazi drama set in Germany under Adolf Hitler's dictatorship. It's so sad that a country with such a rich history is often reduced to only twelve years of its past. Where are moving dramas about the fight for German independence in 1848? Where are war movies about the Franco-Prussian war in 1870 that changed an entire continent? Where are conspiracy thriller related to the dramatic Spartacist uprising in 1919? Where are tragicomedies about the sad period of the Weimar Republic? What about a valuable movie about the creation or the fall of the Berlin Wall? All people get to see in relation to Germany are movies about evil Nazis. It's getting really redundant and closed- minded by now.<br/><br/>Despite its content, I decided to watch the movie because it had received excellent critics and because the events are shown through the eyes of a young girl whose mother was a Communist, whose young brother died and who must integrate into a small town where she lives with her new parents and meets a lot of interesting people from an imaginative but sick Jew hiding in her host parents' basement over the literate and melancholic major's wife to her new best friend and neighbour Rudi who is in love with her and some Nazi bullies and her rude children. The concept is interesting enough and ultimately works thanks to a convincing acting by the empathic and wise host father played by Geoffry Rush, his emotional and severe wife portrayed by Emily Watson and some convincing youth actors such as Nico Liersch. I'm still asking myself why the Germans weren't portrayed by German actors in here which would have been even more credible, especially concerning the main character, but this is only a slightly irritating detail.<br/><br/>Apart of the acting, the movie convinces with greatly detailed settings and appropriate moods that really put you right inside a small German town during wartime. The movie is atmospheric and feels authentic and realistic as well. The camera and light work as well as the choices for images and words are very well done. The use of a few German words here and there works well but would have needed a few subtitles for those who don't speak that language.<br/><br/>The problem is that it takes quite a while to get into the mood of this film and until significant events happen like the host father's departure for war or the dramatic bombings of the small town. It's a good idea to show the everyday life of those villagers but this movie definitely has its lengths and lacks a coherent story line. Some people might leave the movie alone after thirty or even forty minutes because of its slow pace. You definitely need to bring some attention, patience and some historical knowledge to fully appreciate this film. I didn't have any personal problem with that but it might definitely be considered as a weakness by many.<br/><br/>What I found even worse is the idea that the story is told by a voice that introduces himself as the Death. I think this adds nothing to the story and it feels like a pseudo-intellectual touch close to arrogance. I also had my problems with the abrupt ending and the movie's epilogue. Where the almost sarcastically incidental but grisly expectable ending of ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" worked very well, the similar idea used for ""The Book Thief"" isn't what you have been prepared for since the beginning of the movie and feels rather random.<br/><br/>Fans of sophisticated movies set in Nazi time and slow paced dramas with a lot of details will appreciate this movie which might even get some Academy Awards nominations because this kind of challenging movie is what older critics like. Anyone else should be sure to bring some background knowledge and patience to enjoy this film. It's a quite solid book adaption but definitely not a classic or the biggest highlight of the year."
"anishwicks","9","2","6","1 March 2014"," Very watchable
","From the badly done trailer this may seem to be a boring movie but once you watch it you might wonder why it wasn't nominated for best picture. From the perfectly picked music to the flawless acting the book thief is nothing but perfection. In some cases I personally thought it was more entertaining than Schindlers list. It wasn't the normal World War Two movie. It had various side stories which in some ways all connected to make this incredibly powerful movie. The setting and filming has been done so greatly that it is so realistic and so intense but at the same time so very watchable. I was put off by the rating on some sites so I refused to watch it but then one day I found it in the DVD player so I watched it for the sake of it and by the end of it my heart was beating so fast from all that adrenaline and there were butterflies in my stomach from that great and very inspiring story. If I had nothing else to watch I wouldn't mind watching this again cause I know it wouldn't bore me to watch it for the second or even third time."

","I usually don't prefer to watch movies based on world war, 'cause most of them always bring out the suffering, the hardship, deaths.

And I definitely know that it was because of the character of Liesel. Bringing in the emotions playing in the minds of children during the world war has given a whole new perspective. <br/><br/>Each and every characters is brilliant. Everyone has done an excellent job. <br/><br/>The narration(by Death), oh boy its like the voice wont stop until you drop a few tears at the end.<br/><br/>I wish this movie receives an Oscar !!"

","Having Death as the narrator kept me focused from the beginning until the end of the movie. Being transported back in time to Nazi Germany felt quite real. For two hours my heart experienced sadness, joy, love and in the end there were tears in my eyes. Sophie Nelisse gives an incredible performance and we see things through the innocence of her eyes. She mocks Hitler with Max her Jewish friend and Rudy the boy next door. The bravery she shows looking for Max as the Nazi's match the Jews off shines through. Superb acting by the whole cast makes this a must see movie with or without teenagers in tow! Perhaps is was slightly too long and it ended to abruptly. Would of liked to have seen a bit more of the what happened after the war ended if they could have trimmed the movie down a bit. But maybe that's how the book ended."

","It's 1938 Germany. Liesel Meminger (Sophie Nélisse)'s little brother dies. She is left to foster parents Hans (Geoffrey Rush) and Rosa Hubermann (Emily Watson). Rosa is not happy because she was promised two kids with the expected allowance. Rosa is not nice especially about Liesel's communist mother. Hans is much nicer calling Liesel ""Her Majesty"". Liesel befriends neighbor boy Rudy Steiner. She is bullied for being illiterate but she knows how to fight. Hans teaches her to read. After a Nazi book burning rally, Liesel saves one of the books. Max Vandenburg (Ben Schnetzer) is a Jew and on the run. His father gave up his life in the Great War to save Hans, and Hans returns the favor by hiding him in the basement.<br/><br/>The intention is good. The movie is professionally made with some great actors. The girl Sophie Nélisse is a good little actress. However there is a lack of tension for the first half of the movie. The narration by Death gives a surreal literary feel to the movie. Director Brian Percival needs to find ways to inject danger into the movie as much as possible. I'm not suggesting that Nazi jack boots should be stomping around all the time or bombs should be falling day and night. Rudy could sneak in and run around. Or the bully kid could be stalking little Liesel. The movie needs danger to raise the tension and do it much earlier."
"JohnWelles","6","1","2","28 October 2014"," Amiable but Tame
","""The Book Thief"" (2013), the début film of Brian Percival, who previously directed episodes of TV shows like ""Downton Abbey"" and ""North & South"", is adapted from the 2005 novel by Markus Zusak. In its telling of a coming-of-age story of a young girl, growing up in Hitler's Germany during World War Two, the film works amiably enough. Certainly, Percival elicits fine performances from his cast, particularly Nélisse as the precocious heroine, Rush as the kindly surrogate father and Watson playing the frosty mother. They provide an emotional centre that's crucial to the picture's success and while their characters are never as sketched-in as one would hope, the capable actors allow the audience to identify and empathise with them as they undergo wartime trials and tribulations.<br/><br/>For a first feature film, Percival brings an eye for the small-scale from television; despite taking place in a limited location (mainly the Heaven Street where Liesel lives), he avoids any feeling of constraint. He crafts a slow rhythm to the life of Liesel that's appropriate for the small town it's set-in, a commendable illusion of verisimilitude immeasurably aided by Florian Ballhaus' cinematography. The wide-angle shots of snowy landscapes and dramatic red-and-white swastika flags all contribute to grounding the movie in the atmosphere of its specific epoch.<br/><br/>However, the film suffers from a number of different elements. The rather arch conceit of having Death narrate the movie (voiced by Roger Allam), while it might work on the printed-page, seems out of place and ultimately places a comfortable distance between us and the tragedies on screen. In particular, the sugar-coating of its downbeat ending removes any real pain, leaving only a vague pathos. This is compounded by John William's Oscar-nominated score, redolent of his soundtrack for ""Schindler's List"" (1993), and in its heavy emphasis on string instruments, blatantly attempts to emotionally manipulate the viewer and push the sentimentality to the extent that it feels forced and un-earned.<br/><br/>So many clichés, from stiff Nazi villains to the triumphant message of the power of reading, are presented unquestioningly, as po-faced as possible and without the saving grace of irony. This is fundamentally a gentle film; the horrors of war are delicately kept out of the way and even when the family is apparently starving, Liesel looks the epitome of a healthy young child. If taken on its own terms and in a receptive mood, ""The Book Thief"" plays well enough, but its lack of any bite means that it will likely grow hazy in memory."
"valadas","6","1","2","15 June 2014"," It could be better
","We have here a movie that portrays with enough realism the atmosphere of Nazi Germany in the years that preceded World War II and during it. A tyrannic atmosphere where human beings lived oppressed by inhuman values no matter they were supported by a lot a fanatics. It's the story of a girl whose mother was a communist and as such she had been probably sent to a concentration camp, a detail we never are exactly aware of. The girl is withdrawn from her mother and comes to live with a couple who has adopted her and of whom the husband is a tender hearted man but the wife is rude although not wicked. They shelter a young Jewish man who is trying to escape arrest and deportation to a death camp like it's happening to all Jews in Germany then. The girl steals books of a Nazi authority's library and bring them home to read and lends them to the Jewish young man with whom she at once establishes a very deep friendly relationship. The story is moving though not particularly deep. But it could be much better if it didn't erect Death -- let's say -- as the main character whose voice off as narrator is heard now and then as if he was master of the world and mankind which in my opinion introduces a negative value in the movie."
"aahs1024","Null","1","2","24 January 2014"," Ehhh
","I refuse to rate this movie, as I have so many mixed emotions regarding it. First of, I loved Rudy (Hoody, as pronounced by Liesel). I felt it he provided an immeasurable amount of support to her a newcomer, and it was just nice to see their friendship unravel. I felt like all his emotions were genuine and it didn't feel scripted. I've got to say Nelisse killed it in this film. Every person she interacted with there was just a sense of reality. Bush is AMAZING, and probably the most likable character in this. He plays the accordion while the town goes to hiding during the bombings. He's just this cool mellow guy you'd like to be around all the time. He has this sort of wisdom and patience to him that just makes you love him probably as much as Liesel and Rosa did. Max's appearance in the movie is just a blur to me. Doesn't mean he wasn't a significant character, because he IS, but I was just more enthused with Rudy and Hanz. <br/><br/>NOW, the narrator blew my mind. It was amazing, not only seeing WWII being reenacted via a teen/pre-teen's POV, but also I guess DEATH'S point of view. It pretty much lets you know, ""spoiler alert- EVERYONE dies"". At least everyone Liesel cares about. The night that the sirens didn't go off, and how it knocked on everyone's door.. Wow, we really never think about ""it"" this way. It was Death's lines throughout the film that really stuck with. <br/><br/>The ending came too quickly, and can be summarized in one sentence. Your left making assumptions on you own. I guess I could say I enjoyed the film overall, as it was left to our imagination and for us to reach our own conclusions. <br/><br/>I should read the book now that I think about it. Enjoyable movie, but can't say I'd watch it more than once."

So much is invested in his survival but he walks into the night until the death update in the tacked on ending.<br/><br/>The movie has a dramatic John Williams score, far from his best work. Perhaps it is the fault of the theater but much of the movie was noticeable very dark.<br/><br/>Outstanding performances make this movie a bit more then sugar coated Nazis.

I really enjoyed the movie and I really want to read the book also. It is a story about normal people who are brave and helpful. It makes you laugh, and cry at the same time. It talks about how small things could change people mind and effect their emotions. Also, it could help save someone life with only hope."
"Robert_duder","8","2","7","15 December 2013"," A war film with a different sort of spin. A beautiful story with a horrifying backdrop
","The trailers for the film intrigued me. I didn't really know entirely what it was about but it looked interesting and it looked moving and powerful. I honestly didn't find the film ""powerful"" per se. But moving...absolutely. It was just a sweet story with some terrifying twists and turns, some heart wrenching moments and it does transport you to a very different time. One thing I really loved about this film is that it isn't American or Canadian or any other allied country but rather set in the heart of Germany. These are German people and families in this small village and throughout the film some of them even head off to war and they are fight for Hitler but we still see how that affects them and their families. The performances are terrific and draw you into these people's lives. The pacing of the film is near perfect and the musical score is lovely. Everything about this movie works. At the same time there was something about it that didn't exactly blow me away like other war films like Warhorse or Schindler's List but this film is just a little less gritty and a little more on the heart of the film rather than the war itself that plays on emotions. The film is all about survival and its absolutely a must see.<br/><br/>How amazing is Sophie Nelisse? She is a relative newcomer and this is the first film I have seen her in but she is simply captivating. She draws you into her character and her sad story and you rejoice with her in her triumphs. She is just perfect for this part and really does shine. Geoffrey Rush...this guy is always phenomenal. He is so good in this and you just will absolutely love Hans. I mean, the character is written for you to fall in love with his sweet nature but Rush embodies the character and is so great. Its a subtle performance and much like the film, it won't blow you away and yet its a great character and performance. Emily Watson is equally as terrific as the hard nosed house wife who begins to fall in love with her new daughter. She's tough as nails and when she softens it will pull on your heart strings. Rush and Watson are so terrific together and the three of them are the heart and soul of this movie. Nico Liersch is also excellent as Nelisse's best friend Rudy. Their friendship is beautiful and they have such great chemistry and just make you ache for them in their tragedies and the world they are growing up in. Their final scenes together are heart wrenching. Ben Schnetzer is a great addition as Max, the stowed away Jewish boy in their basement. His blossoming friendship with Nelisse is also wonderful to watch.<br/><br/>I have nothing truly bad to say about this film and yet I can't score it more than I am. I don't know what it is but there wasn't anything truly mind blowing about this movie. I keep using the same positive words to describe it and I mean all of them but it is what it is. I can't help but wonder if the feeling of something missing in the movie comes from director Brian Percival who doesn't have a ton of experience and most of it is in TV. There isn't anything wrong with his direction I just wonder if maybe he doesn't quite have the experience to make this Spielberg Warhorse quality. The setting of the film is lovely and haunting, the architecture and the small village they live in. The story was eerily reminiscent of Canada's Anne of Green Gables with a world war 2 spin. Its a very different coming of age story to say the least. I also don't understand nor think it was necessary for the narration performed by Roger Allam. I sort of get what they were trying to do (and perhaps the book it is based on does the same) but Death narrating the story at awkward random moments seemed out of place and took you out of the story. Its still a must see film and won't take any awards this season but certainly one to watch for. 8.5/10"
"billsoccer","10","2","8","12 January 2014"," WWII German youth with heart - best story of year?
","A much better film than I expected (which was a too-obvious tear jerker ripping off Anne Frank), this. The previews feature a girl stealing a book from the infamous Nazi book-burnings. The actual story involved so much more - German youth rejecting Hitler (there had to be some and there's a paucity of examples in our literature and movies). Decent Germans hiding a Jew out of debt to his father; A young refugee adopted by them, the girl being taught to read and coming of age. Geoffrey Rush will get an Oscar nomination for his performance, for sure, though he faces stiff competition this year. A surer bet for the Oscar win is Heike Makatsch, who plays the - at first - shrewish mother. Unless I'm too unsentimental, I'd favor this as best story/screen play of the year also (12 years a Slave and Saving Mr Banks notwithstanding)."
"bbewnylorac","6","2","9","11 January 2014"," Not bad
","This film was ultimately unsatisfying, although it did have a few things going for it. Despite the strange, fake German accents, Emily Watson, Geoffrey Rush and the other actors played their roles with conviction. The cinematography was good, and it was an interesting and unusual perspective for a Hollywood film to focus on a small German village during World War II being bombed by the Allies -- with characters who are mostly ordinary Germans and not evil Nazis. My main criticism is that not much happens in the movie. There isn't much plot. A girl comes to the village to stay with foster parents. And stays there. Not very exciting. The child actor playing the boy she befriends, Rudy, is outstanding in every scene he's in. One puzzle is: towards the end he's drafted in some way (into the Army?) and he almost runs away, but nothing becomes of his supposed drafting. He just sticks around. I thought the girl playing Liesl was miscast. To me, she wasn't animated enough. It was a part that demanded a lot of emotion, but she mainly looked bewildered, and focused on saying her lines. It may have been how the lines were written. I didn't like the narration by the character of Death. I thought it was too twee, and didn't add anything to the the film. I thought the ending was moving, and, of course, horrific."

","Review: I quite enjoyed this deep drama about a young girl living with her foster parents during World War II in Germany. The storyline was very well put together and the mixture of wit and seriousness really worked well at such a terrible time. Nowadays, people use the internet on there phones and there tablets, but back then there wasn't many ways of getting the news or getting access to books, which was the only way to escape reality. The relationship between the girl and her best friend made me laugh and the parents were played extremely well by Watson & Rush. I was also impressed with the attention to detail which captured the period well. Following the little girl in her journeys were a joy to watch, especially as she used emotion more than words to communicate throughout her life. Enjoyable! <br/><br/>Round-Up: Emily Watson's German accent was impressive and it was good to see her play a stern woman for a change. The chemistry between Watson and Rush was brilliant and the little girl was a great addition to the tight unit. Geoffrey Rush was a great choice for his role because he was able to see the light in every difficult situation. Although this movie doesn't have massive explosions or loads of action, the great script is what keeps this movie interesting. I'm glad that the movie did make a profit because it was well deserved.<br/><br/>Budget: $19million Worldwide Gross: $77million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there period dramas, set in Germany around the World War 2 era, about an adopted girl adapting to difficult times. 6/10"
"VenomousVermin","5","1","3","5 June 2014"," A Great Book, A Good Movie
","I am, honestly, disappointed in the movie. As someone who has, both, read the book and watched the movie, I would beg to differ from the views of the majority. The movie was good, for most of the part, but it had its ups and downs. The book, on the other hand, was a work of genius by Markus Zusak. When I heard the movie was based on a book, I instantly, as habit, read the book first. After reading the book, I was really excited about the movie, which, compared to the book, went so wrong. Most of the details of the book that helped understand a lot about the characters was skipped out and the poor character development were probably the biggest cons of the movie. <br/><br/>That being said, the movie did grasp a very emotional concept with riveting set of an accurate Nazi Germany which was really well executed. The set perfectly pictured the life of an average person under the era of Hitler. The fact that the whole movie, despite being based in the whole era of war and bombing, showed more about the life of the average people instead of fighting and war. I believe that was probably the best thing about the book and the movie. The fact that it was based in an era of war, without war being the subject itself. The idea of feelings like love, and happiness could spread in times of utter fear was well executed.<br/><br/>All told, without giving any spoilers, this is a good movie to watch. But in comparison, I would still urge to those who read this, to at least read the book. You'll understand a lot about the movie by reading the book."
"chelseawns","6","1","3","2 June 2014"," Beautiful, but nothing will ever compare to the novel
","This film was beautiful in every sense of the word. The cinematography, the soundtrack, the cast, the script...I was astonished at how quickly I grew attached to the actors portraying the characters. As the novel is one of my favourites, I was worried that the casting would disappoint me, but I was so wrong. Max, Liesel, Hans...everyone was perfect. I fell in love.<br/><br/>I had a few tears (nothing compared to when I finished the novel), but I found the ending very disappointing. My standards were already impossibly high, so maybe I'm just biased, but I found it didn't have much impact on me. I liked the way the pace was slow, and that the emotion was quietly-spoken, but Rudy's death didn't work for me. I didn't like him almost saying he loved her - we didn't even need him to say it; he portrayed his emotions so well throughout the film that we could clearly see it on his face. It was a matter of show, not tell.<br/><br/>Another thing was Death's voice. I found the voice was too much like a fairytale voice-over. You didn't need the dainty inflections in his voice. But, no matter.<br/><br/>Beautiful film. I really did enjoy it."

One of the things that the viewer notices is that the mayor denounces books but has an entire library in his house.<br/><br/>Death narrates the book and movie. Part of the point of this is that Death was very busy during the Third Reich, but he also reminds us that he will one day meet each of us. And amid all the evil of Nazism, there were still people who did what they could to stand up to the regime, even if they did so surreptitiously. The point is that we will all eventually die, and then it will come time to think seriously about what we did during our lives. Good movie."

"bkoganbing","9","1","3","26 April 2014"," A little knowledge
","For those of us who remember the classic cinema MGM did a great anti- Nazi film in 1940, The Mortal Storm. One of the memorable scenes from the film was the book burning scene with young Dan Dailey intoning all the names of the authors the Third Reich was now banning. Nazi book burning is the theme for The Book Thief, that and one young girl's thirst for all this knowledge that the state says she must not have.<br/><br/>Young Sophie Nelisse goes to live with foster parents Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson after her birth mother gives her away. It is mentioned that the birth parents were Communists and that their fate was not good once the Third Reich got established. <br/><br/>At the book burning scene here which seems to have been modeled on the one from The Mortal Storm attendance in the town was required for the ceremony and as is true in every culture with the young, you say something is forbidden you know kids will want to try it. So Sophie's parents feel the same way and in the basement they have an illegal stash of forbidden authors. The one she first zeroes in on is H.G. Wells's The Invisible Man. No doubt why he's forbidden, Wells being the British Fabian Socialist he was.<br/><br/>Sophie's parents also take in a young Jewish man who lives in their basement among the books. He's played by Ben Schnetzer and he and Nelisse form a bond with their thirst for knowledge, especially that which the state says they must not have.<br/><br/>Binding this film is Roger Allam's narration as the character of Death whom he says all will eventually meet up with him. As you can gather several people do have an encounter.<br/><br/>There are a couple of juvenile performances that are worthy of note. Nico Liersch is a kid next door who befriends Sophie and he's not quite buying into all the propaganda he's being fed. After seeing newsreels of the 1936 Olympics and seeing Jesse Owens, Liersch paints himself black and pretends to be the fastest man on earth.<br/><br/>That brings him to the attention of Levin Liam who is the prototype of the Hitler Youth. It's funny how bullies seem to have a natural affinity for certain groups. Nazis certainly had their share of them, people whose need to bully others is now given an ideological base. I wish we'd have explored his character a bit more.<br/><br/>The Book Thief is about ordinary people trying to live as best they can under adverse conditions, a state that stifles knowledge and the deprivations of war. The Book Thief shows as few other films I've seen that the thirst for a little knowledge will never be quenched."

"davidgee","8","1","3","18 March 2014"," A few good Germans
","The trailer for THE BOOK THIEF made it look like a new take on the Anne Frank story, but it's both more and less than that. The movie, like the novel on which it's based, targets Young Adults, so there's an element of Holocaust 'Lite' about it (as in last month's THE MONUMENTS MEN): the cinematography adds a glossy sheen to the horrors of World War Two. Nevertheless, we are shown Jews being beaten up in the street and marched off to the camps, so young viewers are not spared the ugly face of history. Having the story narrated by the Grim Reaper is an interesting device.<br/><br/>If Liesel, our heroine (Sophie Nelisse), is perhaps a little too cutesy, her adoptive parents (Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson) are almost pantomine characters: the loving father and the flinty mother with a soft centre. All three actors were coached to do German accents of the ""Ve have vays of makink you talk"" variety, which is seriously overdone and comes close to undermining the seriousness of the theme. But the central message of the story - not all Germans at that time were Jew- hating Nazi thugs - is delivered touchingly, if sentimentally. War brings out the best - as well as the worst - in people."
"Jerghal","8","1","3","17 March 2014"," Honest film with great performances
","In this German/US co-production we get to see the German civilian side of the WWII conflict. There is a mix of real German and English with a German accent in the movie because English actors can't speak German and the German actors can't speak English without the accent. So they all sound a bit like when someone imitates a funny jew/rabbi accent (yes really) but you get used to it pretty quickly. It's always a bit ironic when a film pimps the virtues of the written word. Certainly when it relies so heavily on the visual presentation and acting performances (which are all excellent) as this one does. I liked the film a lot but as a lot of films these days it's quite long but it's also told at a slower relaxed pace. I would certainly recommend it as it is a very honest film: it doesn't try to tear-jerk or manipulate the audience and it's a good entertaining production."
"emilyelizabeth1283","8","1","3","16 March 2014"," The Book Thief
","The Book Thief is a beautifully poignant film that honestly caught me off guard. I'd seen the preview and the poster for the film for weeks and my initial reaction was that this is kind of a light-hearted (to the extent that this is possible in a movie about World War II) story from the point of view of a little girl with whom both children and adults could identify and who would unsurprisingly triumph in the end of whatever struggles she may face. Then I began watching it, and within the first few moments I realized you can't judge a book by its cover, and I'm glad I decided to watch this movie. What I didn't know until reading a bit about the film was that it is based on a book by Markus Zusack (and adapted for the screen by Michael Petroni.) I did not expect to become as emotionally connected with the character Liesel (played by Sophie Nelisse) as I did, and I think a lot of that had to do with the unbelievably endearing performance of Geoffrey Rush as Liesel's ""Papa."" There is a narrator, he is death. The film instantly became something much bigger than what I'd anticipated, and I no longer had the feeling that a happy ending was guaranteed. What struck me throughout was the fact that although the brilliance of the film direction by Brian Percival and beauty of the film score by John Williams could quickly manifest itself if you focus on it, for the majority of the film these aspects were nearly invisible, creating for the characters a foundation from which they become very strong and enthralling as the story progresses. The incredibly mature and effective acting of Nelisse and Nico Liersch (Rudy) make them as interesting to follow as any pair of star-crossed lovers in a romantic drama. The setting itself, the narrow roads of the village and Heaven Street, bring the viewer to feel very much on the ""inside."" The camera view rarely peaks above the height of the houses sitting so closely together, creating the feeling that we are unable to escape, just like Liesel, but more than that, we can feel the pressures of being watched constantly inside of a cage. On the flip side of this, I also felt like I was embodying the narrator, death, watching the story unfold and feeling that at any moment all death had to do was reach out and touch someone at any time, completing their part in this story.<br/><br/>In the end, after Liesel has experienced more than her share of both joy and tragedy, the final words from the narrator lead us to a clearing where there is no greater answer than what was stated in the beginning. No matter how strong our character is or the height of spirit we achieve, death eventually comes to us, and many times before a person is ready. The positive twist offered to us in this story is that those achievements can indeed affect even a force as cold and foreboding as death itself, giving him pause, before continuing with his duties, as he must do. http://funkyforestfirstcontact.wordpress.com/"
"Kicino","8","1","3","9 March 2014"," A moving odyssey for book-lovers
","I have not read the book but will do so after watching this movie. It is beautifully written, narrated and depicts brilliantly some strong values and noble human qualities by means of film language, which can be enjoyed differently from reading a book.<br/><br/>The Book Thief is a story set in Germany during WWII where an adopted daughter, Liesel Meminger (Sophie Nélisse) of a modest Germany family learnt to read with her adopted father Hans Hubermann (Geoffrey Rush). Hans hid a Jewish refugee Max Vandenburg (Ben Schnetzer) in their basement. To entertain Max, Liesel began stealing books from the Mayor's library to keep her new friend entertained. While she was doing that, she learnt to read more and had a better mastery of the language which helped her and her community stick through the war. <br/><br/>What strikes me of this film in the first place is how human beings help each other regardless of their race and background and these karma goes on. Hans' life was saved by a Jew in the war so Hans repaid this favor by taking in his son Max while risking his own. Liesel befriended Max and took the risk of stealing books to read to him. Rosa Hubermann (Emily Watson), Liesel's mom seemed to be mean and cold in the beginning but was actually as kind-hearted as Hans. Even the wife of the Mayor turned a blind eye to Liesel's stealing books if it was for a good cause. Most characters are likable and it is encouraging and enjoyable to see them struggling to live a respectable life despite the war and poverty.<br/><br/>It is also because there are something more important in life than mere survival – eg parental love, friendship, music, books, and imagination. Liesel evolved from being illiterate to being able to use language to describe her surroundings in poetic terms was a big triumph. She also put these skills in positive use when they were trapped in the shelter for the air raid. <br/><br/>Language is important in expressing our feelings, opinion and narrating our environment, thus helping us to connect with one another. In Max's case, it was reading that kept him alive! Human may die but our opinions, values and insight will stay on, by means of language. In that way, we can be immortal in a way.<br/><br/>Yet no one is as immortal as Death. It is interesting to have Death as the narrator in the beginning, at some important moments and at the end. It frames the whole story and put everything in perspective: fairness to all. It also gives a sense of detachment and objectivity. Since we are all going to die, what should we do to make our lives more worthwhile? <br/><br/>As Death said, Liesel has shown us what it was to live. The characters and plot development is engaging. Sophie Nélisse is so cute, pure and so good with her eyes. I have seen her in Monsieur Lazhar, a story with an illegal immigrant turned teacher, and was already impressed by her acting. All the other supporting cast are good too. <br/><br/>There are some very moving scenes and I cried. You will cry too when you empathize with the characters in the movie. I am sure I will probably cry more when I read the book. But it is OK if it gives me more hope on life and humanity.<br/><br/>The Book Thief is such a good movie with positive messages that I wish more people could see it. But its publicity is very minimal and I almost missed it. Definitely recommended."

The Book Thief is a tale of one such family and how the arrival of a young girl called Liesel changed their lives. Based on the best selling book of the same name, this film charts the day to day task of living and the hard job or surviving. Unable to read when she arrives with her foster family, Liesel soon discovers the magic of books and when Max, a Jewish refugee, arrives on their doorstep she puts all her efforts into bringing the outside world into his dark hiding place in the cellar.

","For most of its runtime, my general feeling was that The Book Thief was a good movie - a definitely interesting movie that looked at World War II and Nazi Germany from a different perspective. In this case, we see everything that happens mostly through the eyes and experiences of Liesl. As the movie opens, Liesl is on her way to live with adoptive parents. Her mother has been taken away as a communist, and her brother dies along the way, leaving Liesl to face an uncertain future on her own. As she cautiously bonds with her new parents (played by Emily Watson and Geoffrey Rush) we see first the outbreak of anti-semitism with a brief look at the events of Krystallnacht, and then the outbreak of the war. Interspersed are some looks at everyday life in the Third Reich, including the decision of Liesl's parents to offer shelter to a Jew, and you get some idea of how the children especially were brainwashed by Nazi propaganda. Mind you, aside from a lot of looks at swastika flags, I thought Nazism was surprisingly underplayed in this; the Nazis and the state apparatus being present but generally more in the background than front and centre. All very interesting, and certainly worth watching, but no more than that. And then came ... the ending.<br/><br/>Well, the last few scenes really. It began with the bombing of the street Liesl lived on. Everyone she cared about, and everyone who cared for her was killed. She survived only because she had fallen asleep in her basement. It was literally heartwrenching. Then an equally heartwrenching reunion, as Max - the Jew her adoptive parents had sheltered - returns to her after the war. And then, the story of Liesl's long and finally happy life - all narrated by death itself. To that point, I wasn't taken with the decision to use death as the narrator (in keeping with the novel on which this is based.) But death is actually a very effective narrator at the end, making a lot of wise and philosophical observations about the human condition. The ending of this movie is truly superb.<br/><br/>Also superb was Sophie Nelisse, who played Liesl. She did a magnificent job of portraying Liesl gradually growing up and maturing. Those who did her makeup and costumes were equally superb. The changes in her appearance as the years went by were noticeable but subtle. Very realistic, in other words.<br/><br/>I give this an 8/10. The last 15 minutes or so is a perfect 10, though."

But death takes her brother sooner then they thought because of poverty. Liesel's family could not afford it anymore since her father was taken away and their communist mother could not provide for them no longer. The theme of Liesel's struggle was with words and to keep up in school. The students from her school would tease her because she couldn't read or write. Liesel Meminger one of the main characters of the novel when she was about fifteen years old a bomb destroyed her home and family in Germany. Liesel in the start of the story can't read or write books. But her passion for books is so strong, she is so hunger over books that begins to read with her papa Hans everyday to learn more and more about books. Liesel started to read down the basement every time there was a air raid. Reading books seem to be a comfort for liesal. Also learning new words would fill her up. But she didn't realize that Adolf Hitler words were ugly. The way Hitler use the words to manipulate the Germans to cause violence. The Nazis hated books, they heap in the town square. Instances of book burning in Nazi Germany are historic facts. Nazis hated all books that were non-German and burn it, they felt that anything that was not German was not accepted and destroyed. <br/><br/>Han's who was not really part of the Nazis party takes Max in and hides him in basement. He once was saved by the father of Max, which had done a promise that if his family ever needed anything he would help. ""Hans' life is miraculously saved by a Jew in World War I, and for the rest of his life Hans is gracious to Jews despite the threat of imprisonment in a concentration camp for helping them in the wake of Kristallnacht -- indeed, Hans is lucky that he is not taken away for vandalizing a Nazi Party office. Risking his life to hide Max is Hans' courageous payback for Max's father Erik's good deed. Hans feels guilty over the fact that Erik, who had a son, died while childless Hans survived.

Zusak).""<br/><br/>Soon then within time Max and Liesel began a close friendship since both had something in common their mothers were communist and Jewish. They both were displaced people foreigners in their country. According to Bilge Ebiri a journalist from the article, Ebiri on The Book Thief: Nazis, Stories, and a Chatty Grim Reaper ""Diesel becomes fascinated by, and somewhat enamored of, a young Jew, Max (Ben Schnetzer), whom the Hubermanns hide in their basement; the relationship never really comes alive for us."" This article reminds me of Titanic's film when the two youngsters fall in love but can't be together because of many reasons like political circumstances . <br/><br/>The voices in the film are in a cod German accent. The author Han's as voiced by Roger Allam is the only English accent we hear. He teaches Liesel how to read although he was not much of a good reader. Han's was a housepainter who like to play the accordion a lot. There's lots of emotion like anger, Liesel is upset when the Nazis are burning books. Through out the film most of the characters would talk with a German accent. In the film The Book Thief there's Love, Death, Anger, and Hate many different emotions towards each other. I have to say to the film The Book Thief by Marcus Zusak is very interesting how it goes over a very important historic story. It is very excellent film with a beautiful story. It takes us back to World War II time and it reminds how education is also important in our lives today. As a great example of Liesel's story it reminds us how learning to read or write is very useful so we can connect with the real life. She overcame those fears and continue with school and learn new powerful words even the ugly ones of Adolf Hitler. Liesel was a brave young girl and who faces all the ugly words from Adolf Hitler when he would encourage the people to cause harm to the others just because they were not Germans. This film is very inspiring to me it makes us realize we can follow our dreams no matter how far it seems to get to them. As longest we feel hunger and ambitious over our dreams it can be reached."

","It's 1938, Nazi Germany. Liesel's (Sophie Nelisse) mother sends her to live with a foster couple as she can no longer care for her. Liesel steals her first book at the grave site when her brother dies on the trip. The book: The Gravedigger's Handbook. (Does something like that actually exist?) Liesel likes Hans (Geoffrey Rush) who she calls Pappa. She is wary of Rosa (Emily Watson) who she calls Mamma, but considers her like a thunderstorm as she is always rumbling. In time this new family takes in Max, a Jew who is in hiding from the Germans, and they know the consequences if they get caught hiding him. <br/><br/>This is quite a history lesson especially for the youth of today as they have no clue about WWII and the German attempts at world domination. We see the family living in fear all the time. We can conclude that most families during this time had no real love for the German government, but they complied as the government expected them to. They all lived in fear. <br/><br/>The story is compelling as we follow Liesel and her need for reading. When she brings the laundry to the Bergermeisters's house, she is shown the huge library and the Bergermeister's wife lets her select books to read. I bet you are thinking how Liesel can figure out how to steal all these books when she is overcome with the quantity there. Just a thought as it ran across my mind. Later, when the Burgermeister himself catches Liesel in the library with his wife, he forbids Liesel to come again with the laundry and he's not too happy with his wife. Later, Liesel sneaks into the Burgermeister's library and steals (she claims she is only borrowing) various books and reads them to Max. Her school-friend, Rudy, calls her the Book Thief. <br/><br/>Sophie Nelisse was the perfect choice to play Liesel. She has that ability that shows constant wariness, alertness and the necessary fear of something bad about to happen. You can see all this in her eyes. She gave quite a performance. Kudos. <br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush should have received a nomination for his role as Hans, a house painter, who refused to join the Nazi Party. The chemistry with Liesel was pure gold. <br/><br/>The story is narrated, in parts, by DEATH (Roger Allam) and he says everyone will die and there is no use fighting it. His comments at the end of the movie fill in many gaps.<br/><br/>English is spoken with German accents. Sub-titles are shown when German songs are sung by the Hitler Youth. <br/><br/>This was not a true story but the impact of the war on German families and their children is quite dramatic and probably worse then what we see in this movie. Yes, this is a movie the youth should watch and it should be mandatory in schools. (9/10)<br/><br/>Violence; Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."

Narrative from the point of view of Death is sheer genius as it threads to ever escalating scenes.<br/><br/>Why this movie was not nominated for an Oscar as best screenplay, movie, or other of the more prominent awards in the wake of the filth, repugnance and ""yuck"" of American Hustle, Dallas Buyers Club, or that horrid ""Wolf of Wall Street"" -- spins a sad commentary on the Academy's taste and negligence for quality stories, movies, and creativity thankfully still shown in pictures such as this.<br/><br/>I watched this film twice in one day -- whereas the others I had to slog through over weeks because in minutes I'd feel so disgustingly pooed on with excessive profanity, nudity, and other ilk rampant in Hollywood film today.<br/><br/>This one tells a heartfelt, simple tale of decency, survival, and resilience in the face of unspeakable odds during one of our world's most damning eras.

Refreshingly poignant and compelling."

Sophie Nelisse is the star in the movie playing the part of Liesel - ""The Book Thief."" Her relationship with Geoffrey Rush - her Father, Rudy - her boy friend; and Max the Jew her family was hiding - are all very captivating. She is one of the more appealing characters I have seen in a long time.

"vistheindian","8","1","4","3 April 2014"," Feel like stealing and reading the book it's based on
","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>Set in the period of WWII, The Book Thief tells the story of a young girl seeking comfort in the books she learns to read. The setting is merely a backdrop to show how relationships can enrich one's life while knowing full well that death is inevitable. The highpoint was the acting by the veterans Emily Watson and Geoffrey Rush that brought the story to life. Even the child actors Sophie Nélisse and Nico Liersch hold their own against such great talents. It is not a movie without fault however, as the final act felt rushed and anticlimactic. Yet this is truly an incredible film that is not to be missed.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>The Book Thief, is about a young girl called Liesel (Sophie Nélisse) who is taken into foster care by the Hubermanns (Georffrey Rush and Emily Watson) during the escalating events of WWII. The Hubermanns also find themselves having to hide a young Jewish man named Max (Ben Schnetzer), from being taken away to the concentration camps. Amidst the chaos and horrors of the war, Liesel finds refuge in the written words and shares the stories she learns with the people she comes to love.<br/><br/>The highlight of this film is the chemistry between the characters. This can only be achieved through sheer acting talent, and there is plenty of that to be seen. The child actors Sophie Nélisse and Nico Liersch, playing Liesel's neighbor Rudy, are no acting thespians. Still they both play their parts well and the friendship between them is believable. Nélisse especially brings some genuine innocence and wonderment in her scenes, which contrasts well with the dreariness of the setting. Academy nominated actress Emily Watson plays the role of the foster mother and to no surprise is wonderful in her role. She is supposed to be a cold and strict mother, but when she shows her caring side, Watson makes that transition seem very natural. However, the man that steals all the scenes that he is in, is none other than Geoffrey Rush playing the foster father. This man can do no wrong. He is the polar opposite of Watson's character, being a more nurturing and understanding father to Liesel. He is so charismatic that even in the most distressing moments he livens up the scene. Most of all the relationship between his character and Liesel is sweet and heart- warming.<br/><br/>The few flaws that are there has mostly to do with the third act. I felt that the ending was a bit rushed. Much of the movie spends time on developing the relationships of the characters. While that's perfectly fine because it is done beautifully, it left little time to progress to the final climax. So instead it felt anticlimactic, and there was no satisfactory closure.<br/><br/>I actually never read the book this movie is based on. The only exposure I had was the one trailer in the cinemas and one of my friends telling me how great the book is. So I went in with mediocre expectations and I ended up loving it. There are some flaws, but as a whole I had a great experience. I'd highly recommend giving it a watch if you can. Geoffrey Rush's charm alone is reason enough to watch this movie. The Book Thief will definitely pull at your heart strings."
"waynerad","10","1","4","26 March 2014"," Extremely touching
","The Book Thief is an extremely touching movie. It is sweet and will make you smile but it is also tragic and will make you cry. The movie asks you to contemplate questions about the ultimate meaning of the actions we take in life. If you make a mistake in a situation of extraordinary danger, that puts your life or the lives of others at risk, but it was not really a mistake because your conscience, your humanity, demanded that you do it, and you or others ultimately end up dying as a result of that, what is the meaning of that, in light of the fact that, ultimately everybody dies? The fact that everyone ultimately dies is central to the story, and you know it, because the movie starts with Death as the narrator, talking about how, eventually, everybody dies. The movie does not give you a handy answer to this question. You have to answer it for yourself.<br/><br/>Since this is too short, I have been looking at what everyone else has been saying, so I will comment a bit on that. A lot of the criticisms seem to me like unimportant nitpicks -- the historical inaccuracies, the accents, and so on. Sure, it is true that the way certain characters die is not realistic or historically accurate, probably, but in war who lives and dies is very random and the movie wants you to think about that. I am completely happy with all the performances of all the actors and actresses, and don't mind that the accents or the odd German word are not perfect, or that not everything is historically accurate. The visual style of the film is very beautiful. No film is perfect but I have no qualms whatsoever about giving this film 10 out of 10 stars -- for me it is perfect enough. Never mind the imperfections and think about the deep questions of life's meaning that the film is asking you to think about.<br/><br/>I will always love this movie."

","It's true that I read the book 3-4 months ago, so I probably forgot some details, but that's been the case before and yet I've never found an adaptation to be faultless. Until today, when I saw The Book Thief. I found it transmitted the same thoughts and emotions as the book, without one false note. Read the book or watch the movie... it's the same in this case, in my opinion, at least. When I see an interesting trailer of a movie based on a book, I do my best to read the book before watching the movie, so I almost always measure the movie against the book and I very seldom find the movie to be better. And in those very rare cases I do, it's a so-so book turned into a good movie or a good book turned into a very good movie. This is the only combination, in my experience, of a very good/perfect book with a perfect movie."
"ririgoei","10","1","4","24 March 2014"," The Book Thief
","When my English teacher lent me a copy of The Book Thief by Markus Zusak four years ago, I never realized how much of an impact that one particular story would make in my life. Truth be told, The Book Thief is the sole book that successfully reduced me to tears for twenty whole minutes. The story itself is nothing but beautiful, a true piece of art.<br/><br/>So when I found out that the movie adaptation was made, I made it one of my top must-see movies. I didn't expect the movie to do the book much justice, to be honest. No movie adaptation could ever reach the level of brilliance the book possesses. But I didn't expect it to be this good either.<br/><br/>Right from the start, I knew that this would be a great movie adaptation of the book. The train scene, the funeral, Liesel's arrival at Himmel Street... they're all depicted almost as realistically as I had imagined them while reading the book. All throughout the movie, it never fails to amaze me how much alike the book it truly is. As expected, it also reduced me to tears for a good solid THIRTY minutes. I'm still sniffing as I write this review.<br/><br/>If you want a movie along the line of historical fiction that can also touch your heart, restore your faith in humanity, and feel tremendously warm and heartbroken at the same time, go watch this movie. I recommend you read the book first before watching it, for it would give you more background information on all the things that are going on in the movie. But either way, it is nothing short of a beautiful masterpiece. A true, delicate work of art, so finely shaped that you can't help but adore its beauty. It will touch your heart; it will be one of those movies you can't help but think about for a long time after you see it.<br/><br/>Recommended. This story has been such a big part of my life for a long time that no matter what happens I'd always have nothing but praises for it."

It is a lyrical presentation of a time at war from a girl's view who does not understand everything but simply lives the life she is given. While the book is somewhat darker, it is presented in almost fantasy form from the inside of German - not from the outside with all of history to help shape your view.<br/><br/>This move is beautifully done, faithful to the book (while there are differences) and contains the passion and care that so many reviewers find missing. Honestly, it is movement like these when I wonder if I am an alien or simply cannot see what they see.

","I have never seen a film which is introduced by Death in quite this way, but that spectre speaks at the beginning of this film. It is set during the hey-day of the savage Nazi era. How very appropriate!<br/><br/>The film is about an illiterate child who is given to strangers who are paid to look after her.<br/><br/>The woman abuses and humiliates her husband publicly and openly. Somehow, he maintains his equanimity despite the relentless provocation and stress to which he is subjected.<br/><br/>Into this cauldron comes a vulnerable young girl who quickly becomes attached to the surrogate father. She is pretty and is befriended by Rudi, a pleasant little blonde boy who escorts her to the new school.<br/><br/>Nazi 'ethnic cleansing' is at its height. The little, uniformed children sing 'Deutschland uber alles' and racist songs at school. The young ones parade in smart, brown uniforms boasting Nazi symbols. Huge Swastikas in red and black festoon the town of 10 000 or so inhabitants. <br/><br/>Jews are driven out of the town. Everybody has to espouse racist values otherwise they would get into trouble. A man who is discovered to be a Jew (whose son is at the front) is hauled out of his shop, beaten up and taken away. Old Pappa is conscripted into the local German army as punishment. The scenes are surreal.<br/><br/>Rudi's father, is conscripted. The scene depicting the uniformed soldier's departure as he says goodbye to his wife and children outside his home is heart-wrenching. This is how it has been for millennia.<br/><br/>Was it like this when US soldiers left to invade Vietnam,Iraq, Grenada and Afghanistan? The Germans come across as very human – they're afraid, they're trying to conform, they're vulnerable, they're even delicate. They are a far cry from the Teutonic caricatures on which I was force-fed as a child.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush as the adopted father (Pappa) plays his role with insight and warmth and wins everybody over. Gradually, young Liesl learns to read – helped along by Pappa. And she tries to find books. <br/><br/>The Burgomeister's home has a huge library. Liesl wants to read all the time. The mistress of the house allows Liesl to read the books but they cannot be borrowed. <br/><br/>In Stanger, the non white library had a tiny book-stock which was stashed in a cellar-like structure located at the side of a steep hill. The pristine white library was part of the municipal complex of buildings. <br/><br/>I had not realised that many of the books which I was able to access espoused Neo Nazi perspectives and values and I was being indoctrinated. <br/><br/>Pappa plays an accordion which belongs to a soldier who saved his life in World War I. A Jew. When that Jew's family has to flee a son ends up being hidden in Pappa's home. The Jew's mother does not have papers so she cannot escape.<br/><br/>The essence of this movie is in the sibling relationship which develops between the older Jewish refugee (who appears to be in his twenties), so wise, educated and mature and the young Teutonic teenager. The Jew talks about how Aristotle said that 'the memory is the scribe of the mind'. Finally, when he has to leave, he consoles her by saying, <br/><br/>'Write. You will always find me in your words.'<br/><br/>Most people are aware that Vietnamese, Iraqi, Korean, Afghan, Balkan and many African homes have been bombed within our living memory. We have been helpless as innocent families and their homes and amenities from hospitals to schools to police stations have been reduced to rubble. We have seen Vietnamese children maimed by napalm, we have seen families dismembered. And we have been helpless.<br/><br/>The people have to hide from death in cellars. Sometimes, there is no warning. We see the every day life in the village and we see all the love that keeps the village surviving. <br/><br/>The love that the teacher has for the children whom she teaches, the love between parents and children, the love that service providers have for the people whom they serve... the enormous love which enables a village of some 10 000 souls to survive. But they have been 'anointed' with the shroud of Nazism and they have been forced to imbibe Nazi values. And so Death has more recruits here... As the Germans were being bombed in the film I thought of Warsaw, Moscow,Amsterdam and London that they had bombed. I thought of Delhi, Peking, Shanghai and Rangoon that the free West has bombed. And I thought of the diminutive, poor Vietnamese children and women that some Americans were happy to bomb and dismember.<br/><br/>Rudi is infatuated with Liesl and at times he wants to kiss her. Every lad (and most girls) knows about the effect that these lovely young girls have on us. Many young boys have surreptitiously kissed giggling school girls through out eternity. Liesl is not so enamoured and tries to push him away at times. Then, in the end, she kissed him when he was unable to kiss her back.<br/><br/>This is a moving and beautiful film which will stay with me for a long time. The theme music by John Williams is apt and the cinematography and the attention to detail makes it so authentic. I loved it.<br/><br/>I thought that it was well worth watching as a piece of history, as a document about the effects of racism, as a guide on how not to behave, as a depiction of how people grow and survive despite the savage policies of a government gone mad. I am so grateful that I was able to see this film."

In fact, one of the Geoffrey Rush's best movies I have seen, I went speechless for his acting in the movie. The girl was also so good in fact she was the backbone of the movie. Except those two, few other characters were shown in brilliant shades such as Max, Rosa and Rudy.<br/><br/>I don't know why this movie did not qualify in many categories for the 2014 Oscar.

","""The Book Thief"",I have witnessed the most confusing and well written movie, in a while now. This girl is to play Liesel and does so very well, being that she can't read or write as she is welcomed to a new home,into a new school. This movie shows how Germans(citizens) went through with their lives whilst WW2 was rising and Hitler came into power. Showing how the Allied bombed Germany, especially near where Liesel lived. Very good editing on their part over viewing the bombs when leaving the plane.
I liked that when Liesel came into her new home she met a best friend named Rudy. The narrator really gave a lot of feeling to the theme and how the movie would come to an end, especially liked the way it came in the beginning. The lesson I think I learned throughout the movie would have to be, love and death is all around us and there is no way of not coming in contact with it. Even after I have watched this well written/acted movie I would give it a 7/10. Mostly because it isn't my style of movie. Yes, it was interesting to view but I did get bored after some scenes. Even with this I would probably watch it again to see if I view things differently."

And it is really touching to imagine war and how life was under Hitler's regime from a child's perspective and how she handled keeping a Jew in their basement at a time when Jews were displaced and killed.
However when I watched the movie itself, it lacked the same emotions that I imagined that the characters were going through. Generally speaking the actors themselves were suitable for the roles. Moreover, like any other book-based movie, there were so many deleted moments and critical events that explained why some things happened the way they happened."

","The Book Thief (2013): Dir: Brian Percival / Cast: Sophie Nelisse, Geoffrey Rush, Emily Watson, Nico Liersch, Ben Schnetzer: Extraordinary film set during the holocaust and seen from the point of view of the young girl. Her name is Liesel and the title regards the initial book she picks up at her brother's grave site. What the title really represents is freedom since books are burned at the command of the Nazi party. Liesel is sent to live with foster parents Hans and Rosa. He is a skilled accordion player while she does laundry for cash. Eventually they end up sheltering a Jewish refugee whose family Hans owes a debt to from years back. Sophie Nelisse provides the curiosity of young Liesel who resents the Nazi and yearns to find her mother. She has a strong desire to learn to read to which she uses to bond with the refugee. Nico Liersch plays Rudy, a boy who befriends her. His father is sent off to war but he desires to be a runner and often stands up for Liesel in the face of bullies. Geoffrey Rush provides a warmth and humour as Hans, while Emily Watson plays off the strict nature of Rosa whose guard melts during a humorous scenes regarding a snowball fight in the basement. Ben Schnetzer plays the refugee taking shelter in the basement of their home. Director Brian Percival does a great job at capturing the period and is backed with the paranoia rumbling sounds of war rendering every thought towards one's own fate. That is, until Liesel interrupts the tragedy with story, views and imagination that temporarily captive the thoughts of everyone within listening distance. Score: 10 / 10"
"anda-alexandra-86","10","0","1","10 November 2015"," The Book VS. The Movie > I liked them both!
","I was very disturbed over how Rosa was portrayed in the movie. In her first scene she is calling Liesel's mother (and Liesel) a ""filthy communist"" that drags children half way through the country, unwashed and unfed, only to kill one of them. ""I was promised two children, two allowances""! Where did all this came from? Rosa would never say such a thing, as brutal and verbally tough as she was in the book. And where is the washing scene? Where is the bonding that grows since the very first moment between Hans and Liesel? Where is Hans showing Liesel how to roll up cigarettes instead of taking a bath as she was dirty from the train/trip? I really missed that in the movie... And why is Liesel singing herself to sleep? And how come Hans plays the accordion with the same tune? Where are Liesel's nightmares about her brother and mother? Where is Hans comforting and soothing her each night by playing the accordion? That was all the point of the relationship and showing them growing their love for each other! And from where does Rosa's line come from?! ""What makes you think you are good enough for my daughter?"" - that was said to Rudy, Liesel's new friend/boyfriend/companion. And why does Rudy even come to pick her for school the first day she is there? This was not in the book and makes me weird to think Rosa immediately calls Liesel daughter and takes ownership over her and her potential love-life. Not to mention the next scene from school where Liesel is just instructed ""Chalk. Board. Name. Write it!"" by her teacher. We find here that Liesel does not even know how to write. As far as I remember the book, she was very much able to do that and recognize certain words. *** Now I really must admit I quite love the actors chosen for the parts in the movie. Even the German accent is adorable! But one of the very things I have noticed about Rudy was that his love shown in the movie was extremely pushy and to a certain point very irritating. Thank God Max has its entrance and starts to balance things up! Though it is a bit abrupt - his friend just givens him the train tickets in a Mein Kampf book and send him on his way while he leaves his mother to be killed/taken to Auschwitz. Well where is Max's isolation? Struggle with himself and leaving the ones he loved? Where is it?! In the book we read of his solitude and of his fright of moving too fast so people would hear him. We hear of him staying in the darkness of the room and shaving for his trip with the train, being afraid of the outside after staying so long without any human contact... He is brought up to the bed in Liesel's room, which should have been her brothers. Which brings me to the question: where is the basement?! He should have been taken directly there! That is how the book had it! And where are the writings on the wall in the basement? (well... still... do not worry about that, we see them later on, totally way later than the book told us about it!) We see Hans bringing Liesel down in the basement (and BTW this is one of my fav scenes in the movie!) and saying ""Come, I have a surprise for you!"" and shows her the walls filled with letters: ""It's a dictionary. Some of the words we have learned. Add as many as you like!"" :) Another thing I liked in the books, but it came in also as a lovely surprise in the movie, was the scene where Rudy runs all painted in black as his hero: Jesse Owens. But one huge minus! Where is the public? In the book we know all the town knew about it and that many people saw him run all smeared in black saying he is Jesse! Here only one old man who ends up pulling his ear and dragging him to his dad appears... *** The burning books scene is also heartbreaking and brilliant. The whole speech held by the mayor/party leader is very exhilarating and as it is done in German so much the better! I love how the producers actually used as much as they could the German language + German accent. Even if one does not know the language one can realize all the hatred and conviction with which people followed the lead of the ones that wanted the ""end of communists and jews"" alike! Though I did not like one part that is not in the book. A boy from the Young Hitler Group gives them forbidden books to burn in the huge mound of forbidden items and watches them as they do so... I think Liesel would not be able to burn a book as she loved words and stories so much..."
"dariosmagata","5","0","1","7 June 2015"," Far from the brilliance of the novel...
","Marcus Zusak's novel 'The Book Thief' is a masterpiece that will truly make you feel what the characters are going through. It's unfortunate that the movie couldn't seem to match this feeling, at least for me. Simply put, it felt like the filmmakers had based their screenplay on the Sparknotes version on the novel. So many key plot points are missing that the storyline is a mess - you need to have read the book in order to understand why anything in this movie happens. Events from the book occur out of order in the movie, lessening their impact, and many touching scenes are cut completely. <br/><br/>Of course, there is some good in the film. I have to praise the writers for not adding a single thing to the story, meaning that the overall tone is retained. Also, the cinematography is simply excellent, appropriately lending a dark and dreary tone to the entire picture. But for me, the films' shortcomings far overpowered these triumphs, thus the middle-of-the-road rating. As a movie, it's quite well done, but as an adaptation, it fails."

","This lovely and haunting film really touched my heart and my daughter's who watched with me. The Book Thief is based on a novel and after seeing the film I had to get the book too and now both my daughter and I are sharing reading it. It is not as violent as some films on the Holocaust, and it's very humane: war seen through the eyes of two children, Liesl and Rudy, both played by outstanding child actors. Loved the score by John Williams too; he should have won the Oscar for it, though he did win a Grammy. I loved the cinematography too. The film is not too long so it would be a great intro to WW2 history for children today, many who have short attention spans. This is a film that will stay with you. I loved it."

","A young girl named Liesel, Sophie Nélisse, grows up in Hitler's Germany and loses almost everything she cares about, yet she endures.<br/><br/>The movie is narrated by Death. You have to handle Death carefully otherwise it turns into a cliché. Ingmar Bergman barely got away with it. Here, we don't actually SEE that narrator but his soothing voice is nice to listen to. He has a touch of humanity and a wry wit. On Liesl's childhood friend, Nico Liersch, ""His soul rolled into my arms very lightly."" On Liesel's frowning mother, ""I caught her in mid-snore."" Next time, try making Death a woman, preferably one resembling my high school girl friend, Agnes De Groot.<br/><br/>You have to be careful about Nazi Germany and the Jews too, or it turns into something much worse than a cliché. It becomes a cheap shot at breaking hearts.<br/><br/>""The Book Thief"" has a young Jew in it, who shelters for a time in the basement of Liesel's father (Geoffrey Rush) and plump mother (Emily Watson). Liesel and Max become friends and Max teaches her to read.<br/><br/>The movie, despite its over-used theme, is made for perceptive adults who don't need a kick in the pants to feel empathy for the suffering of the characters. The Nazis aren't all snarling beasts but at their best they're no more than men doing routine jobs. Nobody turns from a nice guy into a rabid Gestapo officer. Max doesn't get caught and crucified, which spares us another tour of the unspeakable camps. In fact, he walks off into the night and survives the war.<br/><br/>Liesl's family, on the other hand, dies in a night-time bombing raid, along with Liesl's boy friend, Nico Liersch. Yet, though we see a row of houses disappear silently into a garden of flames, when the bodies are dug out they are already dead and gray. Only Liersch has time to gasp out an attempt at a declaration of love while lying in Liesel's arms but he (or the director) gives up and he rolls his head to the side and dies a Hollywood death.<br/><br/>It's a sensitive movie. It's not challenging like ""The Tin Drum."" It's easily grasped because it's sentimental. But it is not insulting. Given the subject, for that reason alone it deserves a prize. It's a movie about people, not about cardboard cut outs."

","I cannot even begin to explain all the emotions I felt while watching this delightful movie. First and foremost, the cast is phenomenal. The casing director should win an award for the amazing casting of this movie....every role was cast with perfection.<br/><br/>Movies like this such as The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, The Pianist, Angela's Ashes, etc. always fascinate me, but this movie stood out from them all, as far as I am concerned. Lets start with the cast. Geoffrey Rush will always be one of the best actors that ever lived (in my book), and I have never had the privilege of watching a movie he was in that I did not love. Sophie Nélisse who plays Liesel (the lead character) was a breath of fresh air, and should definitely be nominated for her role in this film. Emily Watson, who plays Liesel's adopted mother, plays her role to perfection. Even Nico Liersch, who plays Rudy (Liesel's best friend) is one of the most amazing child actors I have ever seen.<br/><br/>This film is a roller coaster ride of emotions from the beginning to the end. It has the ability to pull you in every direction then jerk you back to reality. Happiness, sadness, hope, fear, love, sorrow, sympathy, and hate are merely a few of the emotions you will have during this two hour extravaganza.<br/><br/>I have to say the ending really caught me off guard, and I love the way they had ""Death"" narrate it from his perspective. This is one of those movies that you watch, and it makes you want to be a better person. It is a wonderful movie for families to watch together, and should be mandatory material for all middle school students.<br/><br/>On a scale of 1 - 10, I would give this movie 11 stars if I could!"

","***SPOILERS*** Based on Markus Zusak's best seller-230 weeks on the NY Times Best Seller list- by the same name ""The Book Thief"" starts out with little Liesel Meminger, Sophie Nelisse, on her way to see her new adopted parents Hans & Rosa Hubermann, Geoffrey Rush & Emily Waston, in the little Southern German town of Mulching. That's after Liesel's sickly kid brother died on his way there from pneumonia. Liesel's birth parents were arrested and sent to a concentration camp for being members of the communist party a crime in Nazi Germany. It takes a while for Liesel to adopt to her new surroundings and her life in school is a total disaster in her being illiterate. It's by learning to read and reading books that she gains confidence in herself as well as having her classmate the very Aryan-blond hair and blue eyed-looking Rudy Steiner played by Nico Liersch, who idealizes the great 1930's African/American track and field Olympic champion Jesse Owens, having the hots for her.<br/><br/>It's when Liesel brought the town's Burgermeister's very well read wife Ilsa, Barbara Auer, her laundry that she hit pay-dirt in her giving her access to her library and allowing her to take out her books and read then, without a return or due date, as long as she wanted to. This had Liesel educate herself and becomes an honor student in no time at all. But with a war, WWII, going on at full blast things soon get a bit out of hand for Liesel and her parents to deal with. It turned out that the son of the man-Jewish Sgt.Erik Vandenburg- who saved Hanss life in WWI in the Battle of Flanders Fields the sick and sniffling Max Vandenburg, Ben Schnetzer, showed up unexpectedly one night begging Hans & Rosa to hide him from the Nazis who are out to arrest and very possibly, at the local concentration camp, do him in! This can put the Hubermann's if it's found out that they took Max in to be put on the notorious Nazi sh*t list that's like a death sentence. That if they ever discover that they were hiding a Jew and thus end up being sent to a concentration camp along with him.<br/><br/>With the Nazis in danger of finding him Max, who's suffering from malnutrition and sleep deprivation, now on the verge of death anyway decides to leave the safety of the Hubermann's home and go out on his own, in Nazi Germany, to spare them any more, in looking after him, suffering. By now both Liesel and Rudy had developed a puppy love relationship and the war was the farthest thing on their minds. That's until the little town Mulching was hit by a devastating 1,000 plane allied bombing raid and wiped out Liesel's entire adopted family as well as her now full-time boyfriend Rudy Steiner. The film moves two years into the future-1945-where we see Mulching liberated by units of the US 3Rd Army with Liesel alive and well there to greet and cheer them on. We later see that in the future, sometime in the late 1990's with her owning an Apple Computer, Liesel grew up and became a big success in the art antique and collectible world and it was her love of books that made that all possible. Were told all this by non other then Mister Death, Roger Allam, himself who on and off, with an occasional coffee break, narrated to movie.<br/><br/>P.S What struck me is the running for his life from the Nazis Max Vanderburg appearance at the very end of the film! He in fact looked fit as a fiddle as a lot better and far more healthier, with roses in his cheeks, after spending some two or three years in a Nazi concentration or death camp! Then when he was, on the point of death, while free and taken care of by the kind and loving Hubermann's! In fact it had me wonder that if the Nazis did find out that the Hubermann's were harboring a Jew or fugitive in their house they may well have survived the war with Max if they ended up in a concentration camp along with him!"

Sure, there are elements of verisimilitude that might have been toned down a notch—shifting German accents here and there being the most glaring to me —but overall, this film is charming, poignant and gripping.

","The Book Thief, based off the award-winning 2005 novel, is such a powerful, heart-warming film about how a young German girl views World War Two from her very own eyes and how she take solace amongst written words, forbidden or not. This film runs parallel with 2008's The Boy in Striped Pajamas as both feature children in dangerous spots within the war. This movie speaks volume and is powerful beyond words. I even liked the fable element of the story, where we had Death himself narrating the story. I cannot believe how critics were harsh with the film, because this is one of the best films of 2013, if not the very best.<br/><br/>Brian Percival's film is about a young German girl named Liesel Meminger who is adopted by foster parents named Hans and Rosa after Liesel's mother is unable to care for her anymore. Hans persuades her to read and later she steals books just so she can spread the power of words amongst her suffering neighbors. Meanwhile, Hans and Rosa decide to harbor a Jewish refugee named Max, despite the risk of being taken away if they were caught.<br/><br/>The acting is just excellent, very excellent. I can see that Sophie Nelisse may have a long career ahead of her, especially with her moving portrayal as Liesel. We also get excellent performances by Geoffrey Rush as the kind-hearted Hans and Emily Watson as the stern, but caring Rosa. Finally, we get a strong performance by Ben Schnetzer as the Jewish refugee, Max.<br/><br/>Overall, the Book Thief is a movie that moved me beyond words and tears. It is a movie that will stay with me until the day I die. The movie depicts the grim reality of war, but through the eyes of an innocent girl. She sees the fateful horrors the Jews suffered and the film offers up a moving portrait of Kristallnacht. John Williams provides an excellent score, which serves for more tear bait. The production design is beautiful and for a film that only has a nineteen million dollar budget, the film soars as if it's a blockbuster. In the end, this is one emotionally-wrenching film, but one of the best films of 2013. I rate this film 10/10."

He gives a terrific subdued performance as the adoptive father and Emily Watson, as his wife, shines as the strict adoptive mother who is yet caring and loving.<br/><br/>While the history in a bit rushed- book burnings, we're at war with England, Hitler is about to enter Moscow by Nazi newspaper accounts and the ultimate bombing of German cities, this helps the story along, which attempts to show that compassion did exist during such a ruthless time in our history."

It's drama and it has a lot of things in it that are a thorn in a lot of peoples minds. The ""old"" German hymn for example. A friend of mine walked in as that played and told me to shut it. The sensibility is still there, even though this is just a movie and is needed to understand what it was like back then.<br/><br/>The actors are phenomenal and the ""story"" is really gripping. Anything that defied the odds or went against this order is always and should be considered a heroic act. Of course we know that it's easy to go downhill if you do the right thing, in a time when you are supposed to do the wrong thing.

","An emotional journey.<br/><br/>Set in Germany shortly before and during World War 2, the movie examines the extremes of human nature - intolerance and kindness - as seen through a child's eyes. Very moving at times.<br/><br/>Good performances all round. Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson provide the star power and are solid in their performances. However it is 12/13-year old Sophie Nelisse, in the lead role, who steals the show. Great performance, especially for someone so young.<br/><br/>Not a perfect movie, however. The plot seemed quite trite at times. The holocaust / Nazi persecution of Jews theme, which seemed to be the main focus of the movie, gets watered down and does not feature in the conclusion. In fact, the conclusion just seemed tacked on and unrelated to the movie.<br/><br/>In addition, the narration by Death seemed unnecessary and quite lame. Really didn't see the point of it, especially as narration is supposed to give a movie direction and add useful information. This did none of that.<br/><br/>One of the problems could be that the movie was made so that children could see it (it has only a PG age restriction in Australia). This prevented the director from making a movie that was too gritty, realistic or confrontational in its themes."

Quite a dramatically compelling fictional tale concerning real-life happenings during the timeline of the narrative depicted here.

","The Book Thief is a 20th Century Fox film by Director Brian Percival and is based on the novel by Michael Petroni. The film is set in the years leading up to World War II Germany, the casting is very well representative of the era and the region, the locations filmed were so well chosen and prepared that the viewer would be hard pressed to not feel as though the film was actually shot in the time and place of the story. The film portraits a different side to most World War II films in that it has little to do with the Holocaust and more with the daily life and struggles of the common Germany citizen in that same time. The Book Thief definitely deserves the attention of anyone who appreciates a great drama.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of the life of Liesel Meminger, a young girl who looses everything yet learns the meaning of Life. The narrator is none other then Death himself. The story starts with her mother giving her up for adoption to a German couple, while on the train to her new home her younger brother dies. Her new adopted parents will eventually be taken from her by the tragedy of war, but not before she meets a young man who inspires her to live. By all accounts she did just that, she lived a full life of 90 years and when Death came to collect her he wanted to tell her that she made him wonder what it was to live.<br/><br/>The Locations filmed in the movie were very well chosen and the attention to details were greatly considered. The buildings, the streets, the school house, all were as if the viewer warped back in time. The house which a great deal of the film was shot was painstakingly set in the greatest detail, the viewer feels as if they are in the room cramped as it may be. There were several outdoor scenes which transitioned seamlessly. <br/><br/>The cast of the movie were wonderful, Hans Hubermann, Liesel's adopted father, is warm and funny. Rosa Hubermann, Hans's wife is an outwardly ornery wife who at one point in the movie refers to herself as a witch, but in her heart is actually very caring and kind. The boy next store, Rudy, becomes Liesel's best friend. The Burgermister's wife, who herself knows the loss of her son, embraces Liesel and encourages her to read from her private library. Every character has a depth and a presence that is felt on screen.<br/><br/>The Book Thief may not be on the top 10 list, however neither was Albert Enstein, at least not initially. The Book Thief would make a great addition to any collector's library."

","Oh my word, I LOVED this film. There's nothing better than a story that wraps you up, transports you into the era it's set in and disarms you with the strength of the emotional depth in both the characters and the events that transpire. Set in World War II in Germany just before and during the peak of the conflict, this movie reminds us that not all Germans followed the homicidal Adolf Hitler on his mad conquest through Europe. Others wanted to just live their lives, refusing to believe the web of lies that were told about Jews and other countries... But most had no choice but to obey the dictatorial regime, in fear for themselves and their families...<br/><br/>I have rarely seen a child performance as good as Sophie Neilisse's. She takes this wonderful role, and gives us a heroine who transfixes us with every line of dialogue and subtle little reaction shot. She's so multi-layered and enthralling in every single way, it's easy to forget the rest of the cast. But, thanks to Emily Watson's brilliantly played stoic stepmother (with a dead-on German accent, and a heart of gold) and Geoffrey Rush's bumbling yet charming stepdad, this never happens. Plaudits go to Ben Schnetzer, too as the illegal immigrant this family takes in... He functions as a kind of surrogate big brother to Neilisee and shares many heart-rending scenes with her.<br/><br/>The final portion of the film is so emotionally devastating, and comes as such a shock, that those of a certain disposition will work their way through a pack of Kleenex at least. I've seen plenty of movies with unnecessary narration... The Book Thief has the best use of the medium I've witnessed for eons. It becomes especially poignant when you realise just WHO is delivering it. Based on a best selling book (I now wish I'd read before coming in) it joins The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas as a superb example of a horrible period of history... told from a child's point of view. Let us hope they grow up and not repeat our mistakes from the past... For all our sakes. 8/10"

","Liesel Meminger (Sophie Nelisse) is a German girl who has been given up for adoption by her mother (Heike Makatsch) who can no longer afford to take care of her. Her adoptive father, Hans (Geoffrey Rush) is a kindly old accordion player, who loves Liesel at first sight. Her adoptive mother. Rosa (Emily Watson) is a strict taskmaster, who demands obedience and not love. Liesel develops a friendship with the boy next door, named Rudy (Nico Liersch) but is bullied by the rest of the kids in school, especially Franz (Levin Liam) an ardent member of the Nazi youth . Liesel learns to read with the help of Hans, who starts a dictionary for Liesel on the walls of his basement. Liesel attends a book burning, but she would much rather read books than burn the, also there are hints that her mother is a Communist, so she is already feeling like an outsider to the Nazi regime.<br/><br/>After Kristallnacht, a young Jewish man named Max (Ben Schnetzer) runs away from his mother's house fearing for his life. He asks for refuge at Hans' house. Hans feels obligated to Max's father, because Max's father saved Hans' life during WWI and gave him his accordion for safe keeping. Hans takes Max in and hides him in the basement, where he and Liesel strike up a friendship based on their mutual disdain for Hitler. Max also teaches Liesel to read and write in descriptive language. Max gives her a book as a present. Rudy throws the book into the river during a fight with Franz rather than hand the book to Franz. Franz informs the Nazis about the book and they are soon at Hans' door to search his basement. Do the Nazis find Max or do Hans, Rosa and Liesel continue to hide him?<br/><br/>This is a great movie, because it not only shows the Nazi atrocities, book burning, Kristallnacht and the segregation of Jews by forcing them to wear what is called the Jewish badge, it shows the absolute change in German attitudes towards the war as the war dragged on. At first, the German kids are running through the streets excited to fight, as the fighting continues, there is a palpable sense of war weariness, and futility about the war. Of course the filmmakers take the anti-Nazi sentiment too far, It's doubtful that there were kids yelling ""I hate Hitler!"" as the film portrays, but the underlying anti-war theme is a powerful one, underscored by the voice of death narrating the film. Liesel learning to read is a metaphor for her learning about the ugliness of life in the Nazi regime, but there's also a sense that learning is the only way that people can bring down oppressive regimes, that is a very subtle point made by the movie. The ending is emotional, with a mix of emotions, nothing more needs to be said.<br/><br/>The acting is superb. Geoffrey Rush is lyrical almost poetic as Hans, he wants to be an oasis of sanity for Liesel n the insane world around him. Emily Watson is excellent, as the stern matriarch, who has layers of depth beneath that stern exterior. Sophie Nelisse s exceptional in an intricate role that demands her to play the role with the simplicity of a child but the emotional complexity of an adult. There are many great supporting performances to go along with the strong lead performances, just an outstanding ensemble cast.<br/><br/>The direction is great, the cinematography is clear and picturesque the viewer really does feel like he is spending a winter in Germany. The scenes of Nazi atrocities come in short, sharp bursts, as if to increase the shock value of Kristallnacht or wearing the Jewish badge. These scenes are a sudden jolt to remind viewers, that yes this is Nazi Germany and yes people are being killed for their religious beliefs.<br/><br/>Movies like The Book Thief need to continue to be made, we must never forget the horror that is the Holocaust.<br/><br/>Fro more riveting reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com"

A story in the backdrop of world war focuses on the lives of people living in a small German town and a girl who is fascinated by books. Though we see people so evil and merciless, blinded by false notions and propaganda but on the other hand we see people capable of exhibiting kindness to a great extent.<br/><br/>Also, I would like to believe that the way certain parts of the film have been crafted, it was an attempt to pay homage to the German film 'Wings of Desire'.<br/><br/>Lovable characters, great performances, scenes with high emotional quotient and a slow paced yet engaging narrative.

","Brian Percival's The Book Thief is truly one of the best movies from last year about a girl named Liesel (played by Sophie Nelisse) who is on her way along with her brother to see her new parents but however while on their way to the car that takes them to their new home tragedy strikes Liesel's brother id dead and they had to bury him near the tracks. Then when Liesel gets to see her new parents (played by Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson). One thing that I forgot to mention is that this movie is based on a best-selling novel by Markus Zusak, Percival directs this movie version of the book with masterful brilliance. This movie has one thing in common besides Spielberg's Schindler's List (1993), it is also kind of similar to Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds (2009) in which they all have one thing in common they are all set during the Holocaust. John Williams also gives one of the best music scores that he has ever written in a long time, but in the end the movies message is that how idiotic the Germans were at the time when it came to supporting Adolf Hitler and his idea in extinguishing the Jewish race once and for all and thank god that never happened during that time period."

","Like Life is Beautiful, this is a movie that succeeds mostly on charm. And despite my bone-deep cynicism about almost everything, The Book Thief crept under my guard. True: it's a story-book vision of a fairy-tale Germany, complete with WWII movie conventions from a different age - hidden Jew, book-burning, over-the-top score, stodgy, sanitized settings - but it turns these things to its advantage, creating not a children-in- wartime film, but a children's film. While the setting is somewhat idealized, I found it beautiful enough to sweep away concerns about realism. <br/><br/>Liesel Meminger is a young girl in World War II Germany, who steals her first book from the frozen graveside of her brother. Abandoned, she is taken in by a pair of quirky but affectionate foster parents, with whom she is to endure the war. Her love of words and stories gives her hope in a world where childhood is quickly unraveling.<br/><br/>Sound familiar? Of course it does. The story is given another twist, however, by the fantastical, mythical background, which lends a sweeping, universal feel to the narrative. I've read (and reviewed) the book - and this is not a very good adaptation, at least when it comes to that element. It's lighter, cleaner, and has a completely different tone. Given his iconic status, Death is still the narrator, but this doesn't work on-screen, feeling instead intrusive and arbitrary, if not silly.<br/><br/>But though it's not a good adaptation, it's not a bad film. Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson are casting genius (seriously - see the movie for them if nothing else); they're perfect as Liesel's foster parents: warm-hearted Hans Hubermann, and his fierce wife Rosa. Even Ben Schnetzer as Max eventually won me over. I suspect the two child actors will split opinions - they're both too young and angelic for the roles (though Liesel ages quite well), but I only rarely found them too saccharine. Confession here: I sometimes think children with foreign accents can get away with a lot more kitschiness than Americans can.<br/><br/>Looking back over my review of the book, I see that the film solves some problems while perpetuating others. On the one hand - it provides a little more basis for the characters' benevolence, while on the other, the ending, which I didn't like in the book as it lacked closure, works even less here. <br/><br/>Overall, it was a refreshingly optimistic look at humanity - and unlike Life is Beautiful, it gives us pictures of hope, but not hope sprung of ignorance, an illusion only - but something more tangible and everlasting. Haunting, even."

","When I read commentary from (movie) critics on the failure to include more about the Holocaust, war and other events, I was quite surprised. This movie, in my opinion, is primarily about the human character and emotions, especially the character. It is surprising what one's character/soul can hide and how it can be maneuvered by someone else to change it. The movie is not primarily about the war. Describing the points of view on the war effort(s) and pointing out that the German civilians also faced millions of casualties of the innocent were important, but not the film's theme(s), so commentary on how the plot and events were inaccurate and childish are quite wrong. The movie is not a documentary. Overall, I really liked it, and I believe that the simplicity of the story plot makes the film beautiful and touching. Hope you all enjoy it!"

It is difficult to watch and has no shortage of abuse and neglect. There are slow spots, but to me the movie is too good to dismiss based on them.

","After reading The Book Thief, I found this telling of the story to be quite accurate and seamless. Although it's categorized as ""young adult,"" the story transcends the ages and is made for all viewers. I found the cast to be perfect; young Liesel and Rudy were wonderful to watch together on screen as their friendship only became closer with every scene, but not in a way that would make moms-of-daughters cringe. The German accents in an English language movie were very realistic to the point I had to look and see if the actress playing Liesel was German! <br/><br/>Clearly, a film about Hitler's Germany, it is sad and dark. This isn't a deep thinking, philosophical, difficult-to-perceive film. It is an accurate telling of several years in the life of young Liesel, her foster family, and her Molching community during the rise of Hitler (food rations, air raid shelters, fear, starvation, Jewish parades, book burning, etc). It's an excellent film for both educational and leisure purposes, but I find it quite appropriate for the young viewer. To understand history through a different, more relatable perspective."

","I love this movie. I read this book a few years ago and I cant believe how it somehow changed me. It was nothing like what I usually read, but it was amazing. So perfectly written, with such an amazing story. It is something you can call Literature, which you cannot really say for most of the things being published today. No matter what age you are- READ it. Watching a movie is great, but not necessarily enough in order to understand the whole story. I hate people that only watch movies, but don't read the books. For me a movie is only a picture. So that I can imagine the people more clearly in my head, but sometimes I just hate the movies while I was amazed by the book the movie was based on. In this case I cant say that. While of course the book was better than the movie, the movie was surprisingly great. Great actors, great screenplay . . . great everything. It gives you a look in to the past. Things like that were really happening. I was slightly annoyed in the book and in the movie, by the fact that of course in real life everything was happening in Germany so they were talking German, while the book is written in English, with some German words used and the movie is filmed with German ACCENT English, which probably is the worst combination they could find. So in conclusion. Irritating language but everything else is P E R F E C T. Watch the movie and read the book. Its a classic. And a great way to improve your writing abilities, as well as a guide on how to change the way you look at the world,"

","I went into this film with very low expectations, having read the book and totally adoring it I was afraid, afraid that it would get mangled and the essence of what made the book great would get lost in translation to film and get distorted or diluted. I was more than pleasantly surprised by it. From the opening lines I knew it was going to be faithful to the book and the essence of what the book wanted to portray and the message it conveyed would be preserved.<br/><br/>It is intensely moving, and forces a reaction from the viewer. It shows how humans can be so cruel, narrow minded and vindictive, and how the sometimes unpalatable repercussions from these acts manifest themselves, it shows how the desire the human race has to annihilate itself and yet on the other side of the coin how individuals who refuse to conform to the expectations of the time go to lengths which put themselves in danger to do the right thing by showing compassion to fellow human beings.<br/><br/>The fact this story is narrated by death drives the point home even more, and is the reason I loved the book so much as it was a highly original idea, and the fact it wasn't entirely lost in the film was very gratifying to see.<br/><br/>I would unhesitatingly recommend this film as it is so much more than a period piece Second World War film, or a story about the appreciation of literature, whatever message and reaction you get from this film is entirely individual as there are so many layers and so much depth to it, and it is subjective as to what the viewer picks up on. You are not spoon fed a beginning, middle and end or given any answers, you are left to ponder and discover for yourself what you want to take from it, and that is what in my opinion makes it magnificent."

","As I watch the early part of the film, I was a bit skeptical since I knew that this was another World War II -related film.<br/><br/>Yet It is surely different in many ways. Firstly, we will not see much brutality just like it is showed in most war-related films. Instead, I think it's beautifully crafted with some romantic dialogues. Secondly, it is a little bit centered to tell about writing and stories. Writers or all who are aspired to be one must be motivated by the scenes how a little girl who firstly didn't know how to read and write, eventually became a successful writer.

","For me, the best historical context for screenplays, fictional or not, is the Second World War. It need not have much burst rifle or bomb exploding in the snow, just to portray the suffering of Jewish and German families during the ethnic cleansing led by Nazism, surely the saddest fact of all the great war. <br/><br/>I quoted German families in this film because the living environment is German, so you can see how much the German low-income families also suffered from any war, either because the men of the house have to fight on the front and also see their Jewish friends being recruited to genocide. <br/><br/>I'm not counting the ends of movies that speak nor important plot details, but in this case I need to talk about an important feature of this work. The film is directed by Brian Percival and was adapted from the eponymous book by Australian writer, Marcus Zusak, and the interesting detail is that the narrator is a character somewhat deprecated in any story, death. <br/><br/>Death opens the film as telling collects the souls that need to be taken, until she meets the main character of the story, the orphan girl, Liesel Meminger (Sophie Nelisse). So who knows, death starts to follow her life and so begins the story of ""the book thief to read with a Jewish refugee in basement of the adoptive parents."" <br/><br/>Anyway, here is my tip for who's to an historic well made movie with good actors, moreover, Sophie Nelisse, write down the name."

It shows us heavy demonstration of the culture that The third Reich tried to implant into the lives of Germans by portraying the children choir, the book burning, and the heavy display of Nazi party flag. Yet it lacks the gruesome violence that is typical of World War II movies.<br/><br/>The narration was the monologue of the character of death, which personifies death well, wondering of what will the humans do and be ""haunted"" by humans.<br/><br/>A sidelined idea that was underdeveloped was the ""Jesse Owen wannabe"" Rudy, that at one time scraped mud and dirt all over his body to be black just so he can be more like Jesse Owen, an African-American sprinter who was at that time the fastest man on earth.<br/><br/>The ending parts of the movie is just an anti-climax.

","Now... i was a bit nervous watching this film as i was like ""No film about the war is gonna be good and is just going to be sad!"" Boy was i wrong! This film isn't like other films i have seen about the war. It was pretty special. <br/><br/>I'll be completely honest and say that at first i thought it was taking a little bit too long to get into the story. Then i realized they was actually just building up the characters so we would be more emotionally attached to them! At the beginning it's pretty different. She can't read or write. Then she learns to read and write and that's how the story builds up. <br/><br/>It's pretty sad all round. Some bits make you smile like when Max comes in and they become good friends. Then she helps him through the time and you can see he feels some gratitude to her for what she has done. It's pretty sweet to see the characters build up like that. You rarely get good acting these days which you can see the connection! When max gets ill it's pretty sad as at this point you've got pretty attached to the characters. This film is only filled with a few plot twists but it's still a really really really good film<br/><br/>I must admit that some points in it made not only me but my mum cry. It's quite a sad film but what did you expect with a war film? It's long but it isn't dull at all. The only thing was i did not expect that ending... i'll be honest *IF YOU DON'T LIKE SPOILERS THEN SKIP TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH* and say i really did expect Max and the girl (i can't remember her name but she's the main character) to get married at the end as she would be old enough and she waited for him for so long! when that didn't happen i was pretty sad *END OF SPOILERS... IF YOU READ IT AND DIDN'T WANT THE SPOILERS I AM SORRY BUT I DID WARN YOU ._.*<br/><br/>Overall it's a good film which will make the hardest of people cry. It's got a good storyline, good acting and is def worth watching even though it's long. It's OK if you want to watch it as a family film. Though you should bare in mind there is a tiny bit of violence in this and also a tiny bit of death which may be scary to young children. But i would personally say this is suitable for many ages from around 7+... Maybe even younger if you watch it with them :) I recommend to everyone and give it a 10/10 as i enjoyed it very much and watched it again :D"

","Liesel is a girl with a great love for books, encourages by her foster father, Hans. During the war, Liesel finds a way to find and read books, while her whole world changes around her. From the start, the movie gives you the impression of negativity- the narrator, the death of Liesel's brother, the foster home. However, as the story develops it gets better. And fortunately it is not only about the books, but also about the war and how the Germans show it, their day to day lives, the streanght of the girl, the people who marked her life. The story line is fine, with a few ""year skipping"" but not confusing. The performances are great, considering many of the main characters are children. The scenery and the costumes as well as the settings are very original and atmospheric. However the ending kind of destroys the whole movie. It's not the unhappy ending. It's more the repeated ending. The narrator talks about the ending, then there is a scene, then the narrator, then a scene, then the narrator again. The whole thing doesn't give you a close to the story and leave you with many questions. So 6 out of 10 because of the ending."

The actors did a marvelous job. From the more experienced actors like Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson to the younger ones like Nico Liersch and Sophie Nélisse they where simply amazing. The story it self was good but a bit too sugar coated for me and the CGI was a let down at times, but the actors shined through and helped to sell the story beautifully."

","The Book Thief isn't a typical World War II movie (at least not that I have seen). It centers on the everyday life of ordinary people struggling to survive under the Nationalistic rule of Hitler and Nazi Germany. The movie evokes a great range of emotions including sadness, joy, despair, and delight. In this way it is a very realistic type of film with a very real connection to life and people. The young girl in the story, Liesel, who is the main character, ""borrows"" books to read to a Jewish young man who they are hiding in their basement. This young man often asks Liesel questions that not only makes her character think and grow, but it causes the audience to feel compelled to grow as well. For example. In one part of the movie where Max asks her for the weather report he says; ""If your eyes could speak, what would they say?"" In another part he presents her with a blank journal and says; ""Write. In my religion we're taught that every living thing, every leaf, every bird, is only alive because it contains the secret word for life. That's the only difference between us and a lump of clay. A word. Words are life, Liesel."" This movie makes you think and it creates sympathy for the German people who are often lumped in with Hitler's crimes against humanity.Hitler's beliefs were projected onto the German people and society. Not all were under the same belief system as he was. The movie shows the evil humanity can show others and it shows the beauty as well. The narrator is ""death"" although the movie never comes out and says it. One of the beginning quotes of the narrator is; ""One small fact: you are going to die. Despite every effort, no one lives forever. Sorry to be such a spoiler. My advice is when the time comes, don't panic. It doesn't seem to help."" At first I thought it was God speaking about bringing souls to heaven,but I quickly came to realize that is not the case. There was an eeriness and coldness when the narrator speaks. A feeling of dread seems to come over you. When I came to this conclusion, it left me with a feeling of incompleteness to the film. There is such depth in the characters and ideas, that it stops short in this respect. This movie is an excellent film and depiction of the times and the belief systems that influenced the period. The characters of this movie will inspire you and the words will stay with you. Once such quote is when Liesel and her mother are in a bomb shelter with their neighbors and Liesel begins to tell a story (which is actually about herself). She begins the story like this; ""There once was a girl, who had a friend that lived in the shadows. She would remind him how the sun felt on his skin and the air felt like to breathe, and that reminded her that she was still alive."""

","I have to say this is one of the best movies I've seen this year. The movie was so well done, both in terms of the acting skills and the directing. When I finished watching it, I went back to look at the credits and was surprised to see once again that it was done by Brian Percival. What an amazing director. I love the way he directs. I remember him from his direction of ""North and South"" and here he was again capturing my heart with this wonderful story. <br/><br/>Two relatively new 14 year old actors, Sophie Neliesse who played the title role of Liesel and Nico Liersch who played her friend Rudy were both magnificent. Their performances stole the show. I foresee that they will both be stars to reckon with in the future. Ben Schnetzer as Max was also captivating. His presence in the life of Liesel is what made her grow into the woman she became despite all the horrors of war she lived through. Geoffrey Rush as the adoptive father and Emily Watson as the adoptive mother (both German) hiding Max (a Jew) from the increasing Nazi fervor deserve note as well for their fabulous performances. <br/><br/>This story is not your average war story, but rather it looks at the hearts and minds of the average German citizen who were caught up in the madness of Hitler's Germany. This is the side of war we so often forget. How so many people get caught up in something they do not approve of, but to save their families wind going along with the powers to be, or standing silently by for fear of reprisals. Yet through their small efforts of humanity, they make extraordinary differences in the lives of others; Like taking in Liesel, and hiding Max, saving their lives through their bravery, kindness and generosity. <br/><br/>The movie takes an interesting approach, narrating the story through the eyes of the Angel of Death. The book by Markus Zusak and the screenplay adapted by Michael Petroni was excellent. I loved the story-line seeing WWII through the eyes of a child, through the eyes of death, very creatively written. There should be more films of this quality being made. In my opinion you should skip ""12 Years a Slave"" and go see/rent ""The Book Thief"", it's a much better movie both in terms of the acting, directing and the story-line."

If my memory of the book serves me correctly then it was a fairly faithful translation to the screen. The cast were really good and the sets were excellent. I guess that the little village was a set and not real but it looked wonderful. The cast was fabulous. Who wouldn't want Geoffrey Rush putting reading them a book at bedtime? The younger players were great too. It did sag a little in the middle and could have been trimmed a touch but overall I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>I have one odd niggle with the film - It is set in Germany and all the characters are German so why did they need to speak English with German accents? It wasn't a problem but it just strikes me as odd. Also, they would occasionally use common German references like ""Dummkopf"" but this wasn't consistent as Geoffrey Rush uses the phrase ""God in Heaven"" at one point and not ""Gott in Himmel"". There is a lot of writing in the film, on advertisements, books and newspapers and it's all in German, all apart from the girl's dictionary on the cellar walls which she writes in English. This inconsistency with the language does not spoil the film for me but I do find it puzzling.<br/><br/>Overall - good movie"

This I found to be very interesting, The problem is that Death speaks so few times that he becomes unnecessary. I would have either given Death more times to speak or not have him in the film at all. He ends up not bringing anything to the story.<br/><br/>I also don't really understand why it's called ""The book thief"". Sure she does steal books, for a small part of the movie and it is (sort of) the catalyst for her starting to write and become an author in the end. But it could just as well be called ""The father"" seeing how he is the most important character in the movie and HE is the real reason she starts her creativity and HE is the reason she starts being interested in books and story's in the first place.<br/><br/>Then the movie kind of trip's itself in the third act. So many bad things start to happen that in the end you kind of stop caring just in time for the final scenes.<br/><br/>And then there's the ""Return of the king"" dilemma. The movie acts as though it's over 3 times before the it finally ends. First everything explodes and there's a fade giving the impression that it's over. Then we fade up and we see that Liesel is alive. She then collapses and another fade. Then we fade up again and we see that Rudy is alive...then he dies and we fade out again. Then we see the text ""2 years later"" and Liesel is working in Rudy's fathers shop, and Max comes in. Another fade. We fade up again and we get to hear Death talk about how inspiering Liesel was as a person.<br/><br/>And now that I'm writing this I see how it may read as I hate the film, but I don't' I like it, it just has a lot of unnecessary parts."

","""When life robs you, sometimes you have to rob it back.""<br/><br/>Directed by Brian Percival (who is better known for his work in the TV series, Downtown Abbey), The Book Thief, is a film that has divided audiences. Many people seemed to have hated it for being yet another sentimental and tacky melodrama about Nazi Germany, while others found it sweet, inspiring, and touching. I'm not on either side of the spectrum since I didn't hate it, but I didn't think there was anything remarkable about it either. Based on Markus Zusak's novel of the same name and adapted by Michael Petroni there was some strong material to work with but I found the filmmaking lazy at times. First of all I thought we could've done without that terrible narration from Death; every time he spoke it just completely took me out of the film. The other main issue I had with this film is that while everyone is speaking English in Germany, you have the Nazi's speaking in German which made absolutely no sense. Does speaking German make you a Nazi? I thought it just tried to demonize the language. They should have just stuck with one language. Despite these issues I had with the film, I still found it engaging and moving at times. I found it impossible to resist Sophie Nelisse's charm in this film. She is just so sweet and adorable, I enjoyed her performance. Geoffrey Rush gives yet another masterful performance and I'd recommend this movie based on these two performances alone. Rush's character here is very sweet and human, opposed to some of the other roles we've seen him in. Overall I thought this was an enjoyable film despite all the schmaltz and lazy filmmaking moments. <br/><br/>The film opens with a narration from Death (voiced by Roger Allam) telling us all how we can't escape from meeting him and how wars seem to accelerate this process. He then introduces us to Liesel (Sophie Nelisse), a sweet 9 year old girl who is sent to live with a foster family in a German working class neighborhood. She arrives during the Second World War experiencing many horrors first hand. She's introduced to her foster parents: Hans (Geoffrey Rush), a sweet and loving man, and Rosa (Emily Watson) a stern and hard working lady. A friendly boy named Rudy (Nico Liersch) welcomes Liesel to the neighborhood and plays a key role in her adaptation. Despite missing her mother she bonds with Hans who teaches her how to read and write. Liesel quickly falls in love with books and she begins collecting some when she has a chance. When Hans and Rosa bring in a Jewish refugee to hide out in their home, Liesel bonds with him and spends even more time reading stories to him, but as the war continues the risks involved for hiding refugees grows, and Death is lurking around the corner collecting its victims.<br/><br/>The Book Thief is a film that seems to be aimed towards a young target audience since it portrays the war from the perspective of a young girl. It has its interesting moments, but it also is very melodramatic and manipulative at times while clearly aiming for the heart. The message is pretty much straightforward and simplistic; books are good, wars are bad. Despite hitting those wrong notes at times, I still enjoyed this film and found Rush and Nelisse's performance extremely charming. This film could have been made much better because it's based on strong material, but I was disappointed with the end result."

","Those who have read the book, a YA novel (some even consider it more targeted towards children), would well remember how it is proliferated with hand-drawn, simple illustrations which I, for one, consider an annoying nuisance that has only one (albeit perhaps unintentional) effect – distracting from the well written prose. The movie, at least, does not suffer from that, although some critics do comment unfavorably on its lacking in depth. These critics may have forgotten that the movie has been adopted from a book not targeting an adult audience.<br/><br/>The movie follows the book closely, using the VO of Death (supplied by veteran actor Roger Allam) as sporadic background narration. You can call this a Holocaust story although for reasons mentioned, you will not see realistic depiction of Holocaust horror as in movies such as ""The pianist"" and many others. It happens essentially within a few years commencing with our protagonist, a young girl names Liesel (Sophie Nelisse) being sent to a desolate small German town, after witnessing the demise (from illness) and burial of her younger brother, as her mother cannot afford to keep and feed her. Four key characters gravitate around Liesel: working class foster parents Hans (Geoffrey Rush) and Rosa (Emily Watson), classmate Rudy (Nico Liersch) who rapidly becomes soul mate and Max (Ben Schnetzer), a fugitive Jew whose father saved Hans's life during WWI. In addition to the Holocaust and coming-of-age aspects, there is the titular theme of Liesel's metamorphosis from an illiterate (when asked to write her name on the blackboard on her first day to school in this new life, she scratches out 3 ""X""s) to an avid reader under the patient help of Hans (who has not had that much education himself).<br/><br/>Casting boasts of two of the best veterans in the supporting role. Rush wins immediate affection playing a simple, kind man that is the embodiment of goodness. Watson, one of the most sought after English actresses (and not to be confused with lovely Emma who is obviously much too young for the role) is even more endearing when the tough, grouchy surface finally peel off, revealing a heart of gold. The two other supports, while unknown, deliver equally strong performances – Rudy as the jubilant and at times cheeky Rudy and Schnetzer as the artistic, melancholy Max. At the heart of the movie, Nelisse brings to life the deprived but resilient girl, bright, defiant, and all at once innocent and mature.<br/><br/>Strong production design, captivating cinematography and superb score (John Williams's Oscar nominated work) all contribute to the high quality of this movie. One thing I can never understand, however, pertains not only to this movie but to many other movies in a similar ""foreign"" context. If it is in a foreign language, that is fine with subtitles. If it has a cast of foreign actors who speak English with a foreign accent (e.g. ""Gigi""), that is also not a problem. But to use an English speaking cast and have them speak in a faked, contrived foreign accent makes absolutely no sense. Is that to remind the audience ""Hey, remember, this happens in German and these are Germans""? Gimmi a break!"
"raulfaust","6","0","4","5 February 2014"," A pain in the neck or something like that
","I went to catch this movie on screen without knowing any aspect of its main plot, so everything felt brand new to me. It's important to mention that I'm not familiarized with the book either, I only knew its title because I live on Earth and everyone has already heard about it somehow. ""The Book Thief"" tells a story about a girl that is ""adopted"" by a German family during the World War II, so you can imagine how difficult they life may be. Not only that, but they have to hide a wanted Jewish in their basement, which deliver some tense moments. After around 30 minutes of running I discovered why the story is called ""The Book Thief"", in the burnt scene, and I confess I didn't see that coming. All the characters involved in the plot are well developed and charismatic, each one in its own way, and the promising cast really helps it to flow. The photography direction is beautiful to see, delivering some bucolic scenes, usually helped by a careful overall directing. What bothered me the most was the slow-placed plot that took too long to deliver interesting moments; I mean, the film spent almost two hours to make us believe something powerful would happen, but almost all the promising scenes end up too simply-- despite the deaths scene, which was well made. For a dramatic story like this, I believe filmmakers could have given us a stronger final scene, no matter what was the conclusion in the book-- we are in the cinema anyways, aren't we? For a film to me remarkable, spectator needs more than just a regular story that happened to many people. That's maybe the reason why this movie didn't impress me that much, making me feel like there are better stories out there. In the end, some people found it extremely touching, but I didn't, even if recognizing its production values."
"cultfilmfreaksdotcom","6","0","6","8 December 2013"," Liesle's life is Beautiful
","There have been films narrated by the deceased. American BEAUTY first comes to mind, and some others – but to mention these by name would be a spoiler And a few (including an obscure Western titled FIVE BLOODY GRAVES) are narrated by Death himself. And yet, in this particular case, he doesn't sound formidable, sinister or cold. In fact, a very gentle-voiced Grim Reaper's quite taken and moved by the main character<br/><br/>Well he's onto something because Liesel, played by Sophie Nélisse, is the best thing about THE BOOK THIEF, centering on a young girl who, adopted by a common family living in a German ghetto during the throes of Nazi rule and then the beginning stages of World War II steals books that aren't allowed by Hitler... Basically, anything the Furor didn't write.<br/><br/>Some of the more heartfelt scenes involve Liesel with her adaptive father, Hans. Geoffrey Rush is good as always, his kindhearted character liken to the LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL dad, wielding a creative method to alter the harsh reality of Hitler's takeover, making his child feel comfortable, if oblivious, to the approaching storm. In this case, allowing Liesel to read voraciously and then to, after memorizing important words, write on the basement wall where the family's hiding a young Jewish man named Max.<br/><br/>Liesel and Max bond together through literature – mostly stuff remembered of what she's allowed to read at a society woman's home. More lighthearted scenes, where the friends poke fun at Hitler, seem more catered to the audience than a genuine, personal connection Their best moments are through the stories. And the only worthy suspense relies on if and when Max will be caught by authorities, which would put the entire family in jeopardy.<br/><br/>On the peripheral, and taking us into the daylight, is Liesel's friendship with a young boy her age, blond and blue-eyed, typical of the German youth of that era. With a Fascist-loving bully dogging their heals, much of the scenes play off like an AFTERSCHOOL SPECIAL or perhaps a wartime version of MY GIRL.<br/><br/>The more interesting parts occur indoors, relating to her parents, Hans and Rosa. As the wife, Emily Watson has the most noticeable character arc, going from a henpecking, irritated wife to a woman with passion and strength. The couple are polar opposites yet seem like they've been together, forever, through thick and thin. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film never centers long enough of each of Liesel's eclectic friendships to make them matter as a whole. It's almost like watching a collection of vignettes as opposed to a thoroughly structured story. But the emotional range of the lovely and talented Sophie Nélisse is what really matters. Like Death himself, you'll be very impressed."
