","I would consider myself to be a movie buff and I live and grew up in Massachusetts. I must tell you that Ben Affleck has done an outstanding job in his directorial debut. In casting his brother Casey you may think that it's just nepotism or giving his brother a break. No. He is the absolute perfect person to play this role. Because they know the area they have made one of the most authentic movies I've ever seen. And it's not just some Boston movie either. I heard a woman as I was leaving saying it's just like The Departed. No it's not, it's much better and the fact is, I loved The Departed. But that was flashier. As great as it was you could tell people were acting. Not here. They seemed exactly like the degenerates and handful of decent folk I see every day of my life. The woman who plays the girl's mother, I don't know who see is, but I've met her about 1000 times.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes I'd never spoil it for you but it's complex, not confusing. There is a lot going on and it's so real. I don't know what's happened in this area but people have become so lousy. So lousy that if you're a good person you just don't know what can be done anymore. There seems to be no answer sometimes and this film is set in that world. If you have the brains and heart to try you don't even know what will come of it.<br/><br/>Who should see this? Intelligent people. People who want to come out of a movie thinking about what they just saw. People who want to see an incredibly well made film. And anyone who ever liked Ben Affleck even for half a second. He should be very proud of this movie. As far as content there are loads of curse words, some drug use, but no nudity that I can remember, and there is some gun violence, but nothing too bad. Put it high on your movie going list."

","I had wanted to see this movie for sometime now. I have finally gotten to see it and can tell you it is no disappointment. This movie had a particular touch that gave a genuine and authentic feeling to it. Ben Affleck has a way of writing about life on the streets in Boston that just grabs you. Good Will Hunting was a fine example of that but Gone Baby Gone displayed his directing abilities as well. This movie appeared that it could fall apart any second but yet the story held up and managed to get its message out. Ben Affleck seems to be very creative and knows how to get your attention right when he want you to.<br/><br/>I had not expected Casey Affleck to play as well either because there were so many compliments made toward his performance I expected something totally different. Yet he also brought this authenticity in his acting like Ben did in his directing. Youn could just see the look in his eyes that he was totally into it, he was it. He gave a great portrayal of a detective that should have earned him an Oscar nomination. Also a great supporting cast was put in place with Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris and Amy Ryan. All of them gave engaging performances as well. Amy Ryan especially with her performance as the mother of her girl who is the centerpiece of this story. I believe if it was not for her this movie could have very easily fallen into an ordinary movie. <br/><br/>What really made up the movie was the message. After all what is a movie without a message. This movie did not try to pretend to be deep or try to impress. It did what it had to do, asking the a very tough question. Is the right thing to do always the right decision to make and do the ends justify the means? I advise you not to miss this movie and definitely watch this with a friend or family member."
"dead47548","10","244","308","22 October 2007"," Ben Affleck crafts a disturbing emotional adaptation.
","After a decade of critically disgraced performances and brutal public humiliation year after year, Ben Affleck took a well deserved break from the Hollywood scene. This year he came back, but instead of taking the spotlight by starring in a film, he went behind the scenes and opted to direct his first feature film. Taking an example from another actor turned director, a little independent man named Clint Eastwood, he decided to adapt a novel written by Mystic River author Dennis Lehane. On the surface, Gone Baby Gone tells the story of a missing child and the two private investigators who are hired to find her. The story transforms into a highly disturbing tale of selfish, terrifying characters and the fact that no matter what people never change.<br/><br/>In deciding who to play the leading role of the intelligent, reserved, moral and slightly naive Patrick Kenzie, Ben looked no further than his brother Casey. Initially this may seem like a bad idea with lots of sibling tension on the set, but the decision couldn't have been a better one. After years of under-the-radar brilliance, Casey gets to show his acting genius in the leading role of a powerful, emotionally drenching work. I love the fact that everyone is finally getting to see what a true wonder this young actor is, with talent greater than the majority of actors I've ever seen no matter what their age. He's getting a large amount of critical recognition for his flawless turn in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, but he is almost as exceptional in this one. Counterbalancing Kenzie is his mature and equally intelligent partner and lover, Angie Gennaro played by the beautiful Michelle Monaghan. The two of them grew up on the streets of Boston and therefore are pursued to use their relationships with the criminals involved to help find the men who kidnapped this little girl. This leads the audience on a highly engaging and very disturbing journey through the lowest forms of scum in the Boston population and a climax that is just as surprising as it is haunting.<br/><br/>The second half starts with another missing person's case and Kenzie discovers something that forces him to bring back Detective Remy Bressant (Ed Harris), a character who he didn't end on the best of terms with in the first act. In an act of high tension and in the face of an ultimate evil, Kenzie makes a decision that he immediately regrets and is the first time he really matures in the film and falls into a moral crisis as he witnesses the true personalities of those around him and re-evaluates everything in his life. A conversation with Bressant soon after this act provides a stage for Ed Harris' remarkable display of talent in one of his career best performances. However a revelation Kenzie makes during this conversation leads us into an even darker world of corruption within the police, back to the victims of the original crime and a lesson that sometimes the most morally righteous can people can do terrifying things if they believe it is for the greater good.<br/><br/>Another stirring revelation leads Affleck to the film's second big twist that I didn't see coming from a mile away. He finds moral corruption, again 'for the greater good', in the most unexpected place and is led to one of the most arduous and unimaginable decisions I've ever seen put on film. I won't spoil anything, but it's safe to say that this was the first and only time I've ever put myself in the shoes of a character on screen and wondered what I would do in his situation. It's a decision I don't think I could ever make, and one of the most painful scenes of the year. Watching Affleck's expression and the pain in his eyes is truly gutwrenching. In his decision we eventually see that even in the most emotionally straining situations and no matter how much they say they will, people never change. I found that to be the final moral of the film, and the ending was haunting, cathartic and emotionally painful as we see Kenzie living with the fact that maybe his decision was the wrong one but he still tries to do the morally just thing in the end.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck has come back strong to the Hollywood scene by avoiding public humiliation and realizing that the film would be miles superior if he directed instead of starred in it. There is one minor flaw in this feature, and that is that it felt to me like three different films. There are two clear cut endings, but the film picks back up afterwards on the road to the final conclusion. With each new story comes depth and disturbance from the characters and overall plot, so one can easily ignore this very minuscule flaw. His casting was flawless from the stunning magnificence of Casey Affleck to the Oscar-worthy Ed Harris to the critically praised grieving mother Amy Ryan. Gone Baby Gone is certainly one of the best films this year, and I hope it's not forgotten come awards season, particularly in the form of it's reborn director and flawless leading man (as well as the rest of this multi-talented cast). A deeply disturbing and thoroughly engaging picture that is sure to stay on my mind for days."
"RussyPelican","9","225","284","24 October 2007"," Great Baby Great
","When I went into the theater to see Gone Baby Gone, Casey Affleck was not what I pictured when I read Dennis Lehane's Patrick Kenzie novels. But he won me over and will now forever be Kenzie as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>Gone Baby Gone is a tough and gritty movie about a child abduction and the lives it destroys. You can see the end coming a little too early in the movie, but it's still fascinating watching Kenzie slog through a lot of awful stuff before you get there. Ben Affleck has proved that he can direct a movie with the best of them. There was nothing slack or boring for the entire running time, and the ending will give you something to argue about over dinner after watching the movie.<br/><br/>The best detective movie I've seen in a while."
"Craig_McPherson","10","325","425","21 October 2007"," A masterpiece
","Every once in a while, amid the dross that reviewers have to sit through, comes a movie that hits like a sucker punch to the gut and haunts you long after you've left the theater. Such is the case with Gone Baby Gone.<br/><br/>Based on the book by Dennis Lehane (Mystic River), Gone Baby Gone marks the directorial debut of Ben Affleck, who also penned the screenplay in tandem with Aaron Stockard, and easily puts him at the front of the line for Oscar contention.<br/><br/>Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan star as a pair of private investigators based in the rough working class Dorchester district of Boston. The two are hired by the family of a missing four-year-old girl to assist the police investigation because of their street connections and ability to get people to talk who otherwise would never open up to a cop. As they navigate through the neighborhood's seamy underbelly of pimps, drug dealers and crack whores they uncover an ever-expanding mystery that takes on the added dimension of provoking the question of just what is right and what is wrong, firmly pitting both story and viewer in a struggle between situational ethics and moral absolutes.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris round out an impressive cast, but it's the younger Affleck who takes this movie on his back and runs with it, easily surpassing his director brother in terms of acting breadth and range. This is no slight to Ben, however. It's been a long time since I was this impressed with a directorial debut, and even longer since I was given cause to reflect upon the values that we hold dear as individuals and a society, and the moral foundations upon which they are based. Gone Baby Gone manages both, and wraps it up in a hard-hitting detective story that serves as much to satisfy the baser urges of bar fights and gun play, as it does tackling bigger issues.<br/><br/>It's also one of those rare movies in which it can easily be said that the less you know about the story going in, the richer the experience. There's no clear twist ending to give away, but rather a layered story that unfolds like a Russian stacking doll with a moral dilemma at its core.<br/><br/>One thing I do feel comfortable revealing, however, is that this movie comes about as close as any can to being a bonafide lock come Academy Award time. Congrats Ben, you may well have redeemed yourself from your J-Lo/Gigli reputation at last."
"loquegustas","10","400","530","20 October 2007"," I was surprised at this movie being so good
","Being retired I have all the time in the world to do what pleases me. And seeing movies pleases me a lot, so much that I see almost everything, good, regular, bad and really baaaad. Seeing a movie for me is being at the cinema showing it, paying for my ticket, and I hardly ever watch a movie in TV, direct or recorded. This means that in order to keep up with my statement of seeing almost everything I go to see movies a minimum of five and a maximum of seven days per week, and some days I attend several movies (this is not an exaggeration), meaning that I do get to see 250 to 300+ movies every year.<br/><br/>Today, 10/20/07 I was trying to decide what to see and Gone Baby Gone was not in my menu, as even though I go so often to the movies I had not seen any trailer for this movie nor heard anything about it. Perusing the newspaper the synopsis attracted me and I decided to see it. As Gone Baby Gone progressed I found myself being really pull into the story, living it together with the characters, through the splendid direction, editing and camera work. As the movie ended I thought to myself: ""This is why you go see so many bad and regular movies, so you will not miss the occasional good one and the rare excellent movie"".<br/><br/>""Gone Baby Gone"" is easily the best movie I have seen this year. And that includes most of the art, foreign or indie movies that I also attend religiously. Unless something out of this world comes out in the next six weeks, this is my candidate for the Oscar to the best picture and Ben Affleck should also be nominated for best Director."
"ssflady1963","9","157","205","20 October 2007"," WOW, Better than I expected
","Anytime a movie can get you to pause and consider a moral dilemma (what would I have done?) while watching it definitely deserves a high mark in my book!! This movie showed the very raw, mean streets of Boston's underbelly and didn't sugar-coat anything. I liked that it was real and not made all pretty for film as in so many other films of late. I have/will recommend this movie to all my friends. Kudos to Casey Affleck, Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris. This was, so far, the best movie I've seen in 2007. I haven't been impressed with Ben Affleck in front of the camera, but maybe he's found his niche - behind the camera? Just go see it."
"mikekuch","9","186","252","20 October 2007"," Into the depths
","It's become a hobby of mine this past year to watch IMDb's top 250, AFI's top 100 and all Oscar winning (and most nominated) films. I've seen over 100 films in just the past year alone, but I am struggling to think of a film that I enjoyed more.<br/><br/>The performances are outstanding. All of the characters- including the city itself - are filled with depth and ambiguity. Like a previous post mentioned, Amy Ryan did a phenomenal job as Helene, not only do I know many people like her, I'm related to some. I didn't even recognize her from her wonderful performance in the Wire.<br/><br/>The questions that this movie asks as it unfolds do not get answered in by the closing credits, and they still aren't answered as I type. Who was right? Is there a right answer? Morgan Freeman- the greatest actor alive- and Ed Harris give standard upper echelon performances. But I was surprised by Michelle Monaghan and especially Casey Affleck. He didn't flinch, and he didn't compromise his ideals, but in the end compromised nonetheless. I hope he gets a nomination.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck lost my favor somewhere around the time he began to cry in Armageddon, and I haven't taken him seriously since. But his achievement here, the pace, the mood, the spot on capturing of the desolate neighborhood, and the overall story leads me to anxiously await his next directorial effort.<br/><br/>The best film I've seen in years."
"brefane","7","105","143","12 November 2007"," See it before it's gone, baby, gone!
","Ben Affleck's impressive directorial debut features some remarkably naturalistic performances, a genuine sense of locale, and an atmosphere of despair and hopelessness that becomes a major antagonist. An honestly downbeat film, it portrays a mode of existence where nothing is black or white, and it is that gray area that the film explores so effectively even if I find the story from Dennis Leheane's novel to be a bit far-fetched and convoluted. More than The Departed, Mystic River, and Peter Yates' The Friends of Eddie Coyle, Gone, Baby, Gone understands the inter-relationship among cops, criminals, and a neighborhood as they search for a missing child. Though the boyish Casey Affleck is arguably miscast as Patrick, a character who was more mature in the novel, his performance cannot be faulted and by the end he has won us over. The last scene is particularly resonant. Though well-known actors such as Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman are expectedly good, it is the performances of an unknown supporting cast that gives the film a disturbing authenticity. And Amy Ryan as the child's mother gives a trenchant performance. Director Affleck maintains an admirable tone of objectivity and compassion throughout, and he has made a film that is worthy of your time. Go!Baby!Go!"
"ClaytonDavis","10","163","227","20 October 2007"," Gone but Never Forgotten
","In his directorial debut, Ben Affleck has completely morphed himself into an emerging artist and even more challenging director. Gone Baby Gone might be the most innovative and moral challenging film of recent years. This is the story of young Amanda, a little girl who mysteriously disappears from her home and the activity and dangers that befall upon the people involved in her finding.<br/><br/>The film stars Affleck's brother Casey as Patrick, in his most challenging and engrossing performance to date. Not since Sean Penn in Mystic River has a role been so subdued yet immensely victorious and depth defying in choice of delivery and spot on emotions. Casey Affleck has paved the way for himself in roles that demonstrate the actor's showcase and give the performer range. It's a bit odd what to make of the younger Affleck in the upcoming awards season. He fairs a better shot for his earlier raved performance in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford for a nomination, but his performance in Gone Baby Gone is far more superior. Especially with upcoming prospects such as Daniel Day-Lewis, Johnny Depp and other big name talents, it'll be a tough road ahead for him.<br/><br/>Ed Harris, who's been long ""overdue"" for Oscar recognition is purely haunting in his role as Remy, a hard-nosed cop looking for young Amanda. In one scene in particular, Harris shines and gives his best portrayal since The Hours. Although his character is a bit one-dimensional, Harris elevates the material and turns it into his show and steals frame after frame in a role easily lost in a picture like this.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman, in a role we have not seen him in before, plays Captain Jack Doyle, the head of the missing persons unit with personal experience in the loss of a child. Freeman, although absent for most of the narrative, sugar coats the top acting talent in the picture. Freeman's agenda into more range projects in his older career is reaffirming his Oscar win in 2003 for Million Dollar Baby, but now with the more rewarding films worthy of consideration.<br/><br/>Michelle Monaghan who's a bit of an unknown face, plays Angie, Patrick's significant other who's personal fears interfere with her involvement in the case. To be honest, Monaghan gets lost in the shuffle and while the audience empathizes with her throughout the latter of the film, she's placed into a role easily overshadowed by stronger characters. Perhaps being the only strong woman role would have gave us something to awe at, but not with the guns at full blaze at the hands of Amy Ryan.<br/><br/>Ryan plays Amanda's mother Helene, definitely not the most likable of characters but tragic in character arc. It's like a full on tennis match going back and forth with Ryan and audience; the viewer is hating her one moment and then needing to hold her the next. Helene is multi-layered and grasps her own importance of parenting and the whole film it becomes a fallen angel lost in the fire. That is the tragedy of the film, a film not only about the loss of a little girl, but the loss of innocence and the torment that betrayal, guilt and corruption can weigh on our souls.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck is completely in control of this film, which he has lacked in his performances often. He knows what the mission is of this picture and would gladly take a spot amongst some bigger, older talents among Oscar prospects this year. Along with Co-adapting the film with Aaron Stockard, if Oscar is feeling like inviting Affleck to the Kodak, the screenplay category seems like a better fit, especially with an already win for Good Will Hunting. Other possibilities for consideration is wonderful cinematography by John Toll and a great musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams.<br/><br/>Comparisons to Mystic River are all about, being done by the same author how could we expect no less. Mystic River had more of the message of the domino effect of one's actions on others, Gone Baby Gone brings it to a new level. This film is about a society, a society who has lost the importance of innocence and the beauty of life. It focuses on the beauty of children and rest assure, when the film is over, if you're not yearning to be a better parent of embrace a child as a blessing, there is probably emptiness in your chest. This film is marvelous, beautiful and spectacular. A must-see film of the year and a pleasant surprise coming from Ben Affleck.<br/><br/>Grade: ****/****"
"blackburnj-1","7","21","25","9 December 2008"," Flawed film with a great deal of promise
","It is now largely forgotten that Ben Affleck's big break was not as an actor in but as a writer of ""Good Will Hunting"". His career has never lived up to the promise of his performance in that film (a quiet and subtle display) and has been overshadowed by the success of his friend and co-Oscar-winner, Matt Damon. With ""Gone Baby Gone"", Affleck moves back behind the camera, directing and writing, whilst his brother Casey, who really impressed in ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"", takes the lead.<br/><br/>The film is a gritty thriller at first, with a quite masterful opening which is engrossing and effective. The sense of location is evident from the start and both Afflecks demonstrate their talents. Casey is an interesting screen presence, and Ben is an unfussy director with an eye for location and images.<br/><br/>The film is served well be the stellar cast. Ed Harris is very good, as is Michelle Monaghan and the Oscar nominated Amy Ryan is fantastic, whilst Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman, which is nice. They do make the film easy to watch, even though the subject matter, focussing on child abduction, is difficult to deal with.<br/><br/>However, although the subject matter is treated well throughout most of the film, its fatal flaw is that it lets itself go in the third act. The plot twists and turns three times toward the end to lose nearly all credibility and then loses any that it had left by landing on a truly unbelievable conclusion. Its focus on character is not lost, but it is still a disappointment to see such a tightly played drama unwind at the end.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this film has much promise. Its subject matter should be a consideration for anyone who is thinking of seeing this, but it is an intelligent and interesting film which is worth watching, mainly because of what it might be the precursor of."

","""Gone Baby, Gone"" is one of the best films of the year. It is being compared to ""Mystic River"" and ""The Departed"" because it takes place in Boston, but I actually liked it better than either of those films.<br/><br/>The opening credits start with the camera showing close ups of people's faces. The close ups are a recurring theme throughout the movie. It's because this is not just a film about a child kidnapping. It is a film about people and that is what lifts this film above so many others.<br/><br/>Director Ben Affleck shows confidence and style in his first film. After this, he does not need to perform in any more films. He is a much better writer and director than he is an actor.<br/><br/>All the performances in the film are superb. Casey Affleck has to carry the film and he does a great job. He is a stoic, deadpan, detective. But unlike the Noir detectives of the past, he is not a loner. He has a lot of friends and he has his girlfriend played by Michelle Monaghan help with the investigation. He uses his connections to find out things the police cannot.<br/><br/>Beyond that, the less you know the better.<br/><br/>If you like crime dramas that also work as character studies, you should run out and see ""Gone Baby, Gone."""
"a-d-resource","9","85","123","3 October 2007"," Ben hit a commercial and social home run !
","People everywhere cringe at the thought of their child being abducted. Anyone who has watched any of the prime-time news channels in the last several years can see that every major news network devotes huge amounts of time to abduction and kidnapping stories. This is a clear reflection of the heart and conscience of a global society today. Every single human has a family, and knows from a primal understanding that all children are innocent, and are dependent on 2 parents and their extended families to protect them, teach them, and guide them down a path toward independence in the world.<br/><br/>This movie raises one of many important questions in a long overlooked subject .children's rights.<br/><br/>I was happy to see that when facing a tough decision of how to end the movie, Ben Affleck decided to choose for the rights of the child. In a discussion after the directors screening I attended, Ben said ""in real life, you never know if it's right or wrong, but you have to take a side, and live with the consequences"". Casey Affleck said ""any other choice would be crazy and irresponsibleyou can't take kids"". Amy Ryan said ""lets help the parents ""(who need help), ""its about breaking the cycle"". Clearly working on this film has raised these actors / director personal awareness on the issue of child abduction. As I am sure this movie will for all who see it.<br/><br/>As the father of an abducted child, and a person who has devoted most of my life to this work since my daughter was abducted, I have to say that this film .from beginning to end, handled such a challenging subject with a sensitivity and completeness. I am very impressed and Ben has made me a believer in his work. Ben Affleck and Aaron Stockard definitely did their due diligence in real research. There are many important aspects of real world abductions handled well here.and it is all in a Hollywood movie that contains the kind of action and drama and intrigue, that filmmakers seem to have to use to get the tickets sold.<br/><br/>I was especially impressed with the coming of age of the character Casey played, Patrick a guy who didn't exactly know where he fit in his community, until he decided ""I'm gonna bring her home"". With a certain naivete' in the world , he is driven to stand by his principles. The line ""I believe the government when they tell me something"" explains him well. But eventually he has a moment of clarity and growth and says ""I must have remembered it wrong"". This is the moment of his acceptance that the government, corrupt police, and anyone .is fallible and has shortcomings. We all have personal and political agendas that if backed into a corner, will defend, right or wrong, and the rest of the world can't change that. Its a moment that defines the rest of his life.<br/><br/>Amy Ryan does a great job playing her character a bad role-model for a parent. Those stereotypes on Jerry Springer exist in real life, and they have children. Many are not able to put the children first in their lives, for whatever the reason. All of us probably live near one.<br/><br/>My hat is off entirely to Ben Affleck and all. Children seem to be able to survive incredible events and trauma. They seem to rebound against all odds without obvious damage sometimes. In the end, all will be revealed. But for now . We are left to ask ourselves and those around us .When that child grows up, and finds out that he or she was abducted, or when that abducted child says ""they stole me""...... Who will stand up and answer for and apologize to her for not helping to return her to her lawful parents? Definitely go see the movie ,<br/><br/>Patrick Braden October 2 2007"

","The tough private eyes Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) was raised in a poor and dangerous neighborhood of Boston, and works with his partner and girlfriend Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) generally tracking missing losers in debt. When the four year-old Amanda McCready (Madeline O'Brien) is abducted from her apartment, her aunt Beatrice 'Bea' McCready (Amy Madigan) calls the police and the press, and the case is highlighted with the spots by the media. Then Bea hires the reluctant Patrick to work in the case because he is not a cop and based on his great knowledge of their neighborhood. Meanwhile Capt. Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman), who lost his own daughter many years ago and is in charge of the investigation, assigns detectives Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Pole (John Ashton) to give the necessary support to Patrick. After interviewing the addicted low life mother of Amanda, Helene McCready (Amy Ryan), Patrick goes to a bar and discloses that Helene was on the streets with her boyfriend Skinny Ray Likanski (Sean Malone) dealing and using drugs on the day Amanda disappeared. Along his investigation, Patrick faces smalltime criminals, drug dealers, pedophiles and corruption, facing a moral issue to solve the case.<br/><br/>""Gone Baby Gone"" is an impressive debut of Ben Affleck as director of feature. The story is original, supported by an outstanding screenplay with several plot points and a polemic conclusion, and the performances are great. The moral and ethical codes of the lead character Patrick Kenzie seem to follow his thoughts, when he says that people cannot choose, but they are fruit of their town, neighborhood and family. His polemical and controversial decision in the end, right or wrong, selfish or right, is certainly another attraction in this great film. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Medo da Verdade"" (""Afraid of the Truth"")"
"Polaris_DiB","3","25","39","28 February 2008"," It was almost there...
","The first two-thirds of this movie is honestly great. Ben Affleck presents a new level of dark and grit in a story about an abducted child, the private investigators hired to find her, and the local Boston community--a much more ugly background of extras typically used in even the most ""social realist"" of film works, where the grim of the street is more effectively incorporated into the scarred visages of people without make-up effects. It's a compelling and dark look at a reality where children go missing all the time, where the media has a field-day with the attention while real families are brought into conflict and even the emotional demands of cops are not fully brought into closure.<br/><br/>And then Affleck drops the ball, majorly. At somewhere around the 2/3rds point (give or take a percentage of the play time), suddenly the story switches gears with another one of those unnecessary ""twists"" that contemporary movies trying to increase the ante tend to throw into what was previously a well-crafted movie. At the point at which the cops are implemented into corruption and guilt for the crime is when almost all of the characters suddenly start working entirely against their motivations and all logic and realism is frankly tossed out the window. This wouldn't be such a problem if it wasn't for the fact that realism was part of the point. But mostly, we as audience are supposed to accept that the following conversation took place:<br/><br/>Titus Welliver: ""Listen, I have this niece who I love but who unfortunately is being neglected and abused by her coke-addict mother. I would like some help in getting her away from this damaging environment."" Ed Harris: ""Okay, I know the captain of the child-abduction section of the police force is dealing with extreme issues of loss from his own child's death, so let's kidnap the girl and place the blame on the coke-dealers while he'll adopt her.""<br/><br/>when in the really real world, where even corrupt cops like Ed Harris' character have their credibility to protect and cops like Morgan Freeman's captain would never actually agree to that crap, the conversation would have gone like this:<br/><br/>Titus: ""Listen, I have this niece who I love but who is being neglected by her coke-addict mother, I would like to help her."" Ed Harris: ""Okay, here's the number and the names of some contacts I know in social services, while in the meantime I'll follow up on this whole coke-addiction lead and maybe get me some dealers and users in jail for some good Boston P.D. PR!""<br/><br/>Yep. Nonsense. The point of the movie, of course, is that these decisions create a real moral issue in the main character, played by Casey Affleck, who has to decide where the ethical ground lays and whether it may not be perversely better to allow Morgan Freeman to adopt the girl, albeit highly illegally and sinisterly. Except that crisis of morality makes no real sense and has no real importance in a situation in which none of the characters actually have a logical motivation for the crime. Instead, the movie is filled with truisms, pedophilia substories, and Catholic symbolism to show just how degraded our society can come to be in a way that basically makes this movie just a really intricate and fleshed-out episode of CSI: visceral and sensationally disturbing, but utterly absurd at heart. Too bad, because it was aiming more like ""Chinatown"" for a new generation.<br/><br/>There are other more minor problems with the movie, such as the fact that Casey's character's girlfriend pretty much doesn't need to be included: at first she plays the sensible foil and emotional weight of the two-character team, but that conflict could have easily been encased in Casey's role alone, especially as that very thing happens as the character gets more and more involved and the girlfriend, similarly, starts slowly phasing out of the plot... Secondly, whereas people can be violent, there seems to a strong inflection on the fact that these characters pretty much resort to violence before most other solutions. Add a scene which pretty much stands in for an unquestioned argument for capital punishment and vigilantism, and some of the less-fleshed out consequences of the narrative become disturbingly clear.<br/><br/>It was a good job on everyone's part, but MAN did it need a massive re-write and re-thinking, especially since it tries to sell itself as the type of movie people are supposed to mull over for weeks.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","The book is always better than the movie. (Except when someone takes a half-baked book-idea and turns it into a great film. This has also often happened.) In this case, Dennis Lehane's book was better, just as his ""Mystic River"" book was better, even though they were both good films.<br/><br/>I thought Ed Harris was excellent, as was Morgan Freeman; but they are seasoned veterans and of course would be good in such a production. The two lead characters, both relative unknowns (relative in the Affleck brother's case being a pun unintended)were okay, nothing special; they had a good script which made them credible, but there was no big acting going on here.<br/><br/>Sometimes it's just...not a good idea to make a film from a complex, complicated story. There are so many characters and so many unexplained threads, and although the film tried hard to cover gaps in the storyline, it was still too diffused.

","I was giving Ben Affleck a chance showing better competence as director than he was showing as actor - and I regret it. I was thinking that 8 out of 10 points on the rank was indicating a great movie. The Boston area where the story is set and its inhabitant is staged like a Freak Show for people living in better areas to shudder and be happy to not live there - a tad too much paint I would say. The movie seems to convey several doubtful messages: that child molesters are never stopping their doings anyway - teaming up even, that self-justice is excusable and what is worst - that stealing kids from bad mothers is justified. I haven't read the book, but the movie doesn't seem to want to motivate the private detective's (Michelle Monaghan) feeling concerning stealing the child. The usual corrupt cops topic doesn't require any additional comment really. As a last comment: I wouldn't have been surprised if Jennifer Lopez had taken a role in this movie to make it a truly Bennifer experience of a movie."
"stowbury","4","21","34","6 July 2008"," Reprehensible Drivel
","*** SPOILER WARNING *** <br/><br/>So in Boston it's apparently legal to commit murder as long as the guy on the receiving end is a piece of low-life scum. A short way into the investigation into a child abduction the police and private investigator track down a double-crossing drug-runner who's been strapped to a chair and beaten to a bloody pulp before being killed. They have a very strong suspicion as to who did it. They know where he is, the detective even meets him face to face to discuss the more important issue of the kidnap, with the police waiting outside. They don't bother to question him about the murder, let alone make an arrest or apparently even open a case of homicide. Later the detective himself shoots in the back of the head an unarmed man posing no current threat. The recipient of the bullet is a known paedophile however and it seems that he has been abusing and recently killed a kidnapped seven year old boy. The detective openly admits to committing murder in conversation with a senior police officer. Everyone knows about it, his girlfriend says she's proud of him for it. Again there is no questioning, no arrest, no mention of any charges being brought as even a possibility. I can only conclude that in Boston it is legal to murder someone as long as they are well known to be a piece of low-life scum.<br/><br/>Ah, but these police had reason not to do the things by the book as they are up to no good themselves. That misses the point. The detective believes them to be on-side and yet doesn't raise an eyebrow, nor does anyone else at the fact that a murder in some cases seems to be less of a crime than jaywalking.<br/><br/>The story is the most ludicrous that I have ever come across in a supposedly serious film. In an amazing twist the kidnapping turns out to have been an extra-curricular operation by the Boston police themselves conducted at the very highest level - the uncle of the girl, the senior cop, his sidekick and the chief commissioner of police were all in it together and have been leading the private dick up the garden the path from the very beginning. Scriptwriters take note - you can turn any story on its head by this simple device  just have a lot of the supposedly trusted people that the main character was relying on for most of his information turn out to have been telling lies. And why did they do it? To give a better life to the young girl than the one that her biological but wayward, neglectful and impecunious mother was providing. The now retired chief commissioner and his wife, who lost their own daughter to a killing, have become her parents. One slight problem here I feel  how were they to explain the sudden appearance of their lovely new blonde daughter (who would be presumably be highly coveted by thousands of the eager adoptive couples of a more likely age?) and one who looks so uncannily like the very girl whose face has been plastered on posters and broadcast to the nation, whose disappearance the commissioner led the investigation into? Or are they to retire from society completely, keep her away from school, friends, all social intercourse in case she mentions a previous mother she can perfectly well remember? Perhaps one crazy individual or couple could overlook such niceties, but three senior long-serving police officers with presumably massive pensions at risk to go along with an escapade that is so fraught and liable to discovery? Yet this is not even the final absurdity. We are asked to believe not just that this could happen but that when the detective finally confronts the kidnapping top cop they have a moral debate about who's right and who's wrong, making elegant speeches to each other about what's best for the girl now and in the future, and not only this but the detective's girlfriend takes the kidnapper's side, and so strongly that she walks out on him and ends their relationship when he insists on turning the ex-commissioner over to the law and returning the girl to her mother.<br/><br/>Praise for the actors in coping valiantly with this drivel and turning in good performances cannot be too high. The first half hour or so is quite gripping, before the first faintly ludicrous interview with the framed gangster suspect. After this it is all downhill  moving ever further from any possible reality and with ever longer tedious speeches between characters supposedly grappling with the moral dilemmas that the contrived storyline has thrown up. Rarely in the history of cinema has such silly and faintly repellent rubbish been taken so seriously and been so highly praised. In choosing the theme of the ultimate crime  the abduction and possible abuse and murder of an innocent defenceless young child  the film-makers perhaps thought that they themselves could get away with murder or at least daylight robbery  the audience so cowed by the enormity of the topic that they take collective leave of their critical faculties and accept any old nonsense at face value. It seems they were right."

","My admiration for Ben Affleck has gone way up after realizing this film is his directorial debut. Depressing in that it shows the seedy underbelly of life and the truly horrible flaws of human beings, it sucks you in with the excellent acting of the principle characters. When I first saw his brother Casey on the screen my reaction was probably the same as most viewers - this guy is way too young to play the character written for him and he's out of his depth. I was so wrong on both points. Casey Affleck is great in a very understated way as a man haunted by his morality in what is right and wrong and you see the struggle he goes through as the film develops towards its heartbreaking conclusion. Everyone played their parts well and any film with Morgan Freeman in it is worth a look as he is a fine actor. The only criticism I have about the film is the use of the 'f' word in almost every sentence. I guess a film about the underbelly of life in Boston would not be realistic without the 'f' word but it was 'overkill' to me and shows a lack of originality. However, the script is amazing and the story is well told as it unfolds to its conclusion. I found the ending scene so profound and powerful in its predictability and ordinariness that it's impact was like a punch to the gut. Without giving anything away, the ending scene shows that life goes on, one way or another!"

","This is an extremely well made movie. It is an extremely well acted movie. Despite being well done and telling a captivating story, it just isn't what I want from a story or a movie in general. Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) are called in as private detectives by a family to investigate a missing child report. Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman)and Detective Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) represent the reluctant, yet cooperative police department that works hand in hand with the private detectives. The story evolves as a mystery leading the viewer along as everyone sifts through the lies and cover-ups. While this story is quite emotional and disturbing at times, the final message is a bit anti-climactic. It comes across more as a social statement directed towards an American subculture than it does being a plausible series of events. In the end, it just all seems pointless. It isn't a bad movie, it just isn't how I'd want to spend 2 hours of leisure time. Casey Affleck does a great job at keeping the story on track. Michelle Monaghan plays a convincing girlfriend/assistant. Ed Harris & Morgan Freeman never skip a beat on making you feel distressed about the little girl being lost.

If you really do want to see this movie (trust me you don't), then read this after you've seen it.. <br/><br/>This movie started out pretty raw and it does tug at your heart strings since it has issues with kids in it. At first I thought it was some sort of shock movie. One of those for lack of a better story, pushing the sock value (you've seen them before).<br/><br/>I got to hand one thing to Ben.

It got worse and worse about 3/4 into the movie.<br/><br/>#1 He just shot the pedophile killer in the head and killed him. I didn't shed any tears for the guy, okay the guy deserved it. But then it doesn't explain how he got away with this murder. It left me thinking that ""okay, they must have made up a story with Remy to make it all self defense.."".<br/><br/>Then the movie reaches it denouement, thinking there was some terrible conspiracy for money, only to find that the bad guys were not so bad after all. <br/><br/>Then the detective does what does not make any sense at all, and gives up the child back to the drug addict mother. Just after the three cops basically gave up their careers, two of them their lives (one directly), not to mention several other people that either lied or gave up $130k in interest of the child. Makes even less sense, when he commits murder in a previous scene and gets away with it, but then he's morally inclined to take the child way from new loving adoptive (albeit illegal) parents. Not to mention sending the good retired Chief and wife to prison.. And then a few more final scenes that points out that he was even more of an idiot, and that what other people were telling him.<br/><br/>Now all of this nonsensical line would have made sense (every movie need not have a ""happy ending"" after all), but Casey Affleck just didn't bring it. Just maybe, it would have made some sort of melodramatic sense if he could have pulled it off right.<br/><br/>No offense to the other reviewers, but Ben must have paid them well.<br/><br/>I'm off to watch ""The Maltese Falcon"" to wash the bad taste out of my mouth before I pluck my eyes out after watching this movie.."

","Where do I begin? I read several positive reviews about this film that made it sound interesting and poignant. It was apparently meant to be a film about dilemma that was primarily designed to make the viewer reflex on its message and think about their' own moral decision making. What would you do, type of thing. By the time the moral of the story came – I no longer cared. The film was a huge disappointment. First of all, the story is confusing and disjointed. Ben Affleck directs like he acts – like a teenager with A.D.D. The characters were uninteresting, unmotivated and miscast. Casey Affleck (Patrick Kenzie) as a private eye looks more like Dookie Howser than Mike Hammer. He tries so hard to master the Boston accent that he is difficult to understand - not that he has anything interesting to say. So little time is spent on character development that the viewer doesn't really care about who any of these people are or what happens to them. Michelle Monaghan literally sleep walks through her role as Affleck's girlfriend and partner, muttering a few phrases occasionally so you won't mistake her for a mannequin, but so uninspired that one wonders who she was cozy with to get the role. (I think you can all figure out how Casey Affleck got the lead role). Ed Harris, who is a good actor, does his best with the uninspired dialogue but his efforts are wasted on a part that no one could have saved. Most disappointing of all is Morgan Freemen's role as Jack Doyle. Morgan appears as an aging police official – who looks to be about 80 – who for some reason ""lost"" a 12 year old daughter. OK, that's possible, but improbable. While his name appears prominently in the advertisements for this debacle, Freeman's character shows up in about 5 minutes of the actual film. In conclusion, the acting is second rate, the characters inadequately developed and the story poorly told. Gone Baby Gone should have been titled Bad Baby Bad –it stunk."

","The tag-line for this movie should have been, ""Dare to imagine a world where no one has an I.Q. above 80"". The opening narration was fairly poetic and thought provoking. It raised my expectations for what was to follow and made the ensuing mess far more disappointing. A parade of mean and stupid characters competed mightily to mitigate any empathy that the situation might have engendered. Ten minutes into the film, I was fervently wishing that the missing girl might stay missing. It was bad enough to watch these characters moving through what they call a life. The thought of having to actually live amongst them makes my skin crawl.<br/><br/>The biggest failure of the film was the mumbled dialogue. Much of it was incomprehensible. It did not seem that it was by oversight so much as a celebration of the street scenes that the Aflecks remember from their childhood. You got out of it guys...Let it go...Nobody wants to wax nostalgic about the underbelly of Boston."

","I watched this film a couple of days ago and I thought it was dreadful. It's release in the UK was delayed so it's taken me a while to watch it. It's had many great reviews but I didn't enjoy it at all. As a few other reviewers have said, the dialogue is difficult to follow and the acting is awful. This film didn't live up to my expectations in any way.<br/><br/>Without wishing to reveal too much about the plot, I also thought it was pretty unrealistic in terms of the attempted 'moral complexity' of Casey Affleck's character. His female companion also has some pretty dumb expressions on her face during the movie which I think would have been commented on in 'real life'.<br/><br/>It's a pity really because I think the idea was a good one but it was just put together in such an awful way."

","I was really made restless by this movie because of the overwhelming reviews it got from ""trusted"" reviewers here. I searched through highs and lows just to get hold of a copy of this film, and when i finally had it, i didn't find it coming that i will be haunted again by restless nights why i paid so much for such a lousy film.<br/><br/>I am not trying to disparage the novel or whatever. No, it is not the story, it is everything about the film that sucks (pardon me for my use of such word but it is the only one that I can think of right now to describe how the film felt for me).<br/><br/>I am really quite disappointed and appalled by the ratings this movie got from the reviewers. Let me explain on the following points one by one.<br/><br/>First, they said Casey Affleck's acting in this movie has far surpassed his feat in Jesse James. this is absolutely not true. Jesse James (as Robert ford) is still Casey's best and unforgettable performance. other jurors must have agreed with me that was why they chose him as the best supporting actor. there is still no film where he acted better. Casey's performance in gone baby gone is not in any way in the league of great actings; his brother Ben just couldn't bring out the best from him. he just can't.<br/><br/>Second, from the reviews, it said that Ben Affleck did an amazing job in his directorial debut. I hope Ben does not read the reviews here because they might get into his head and make him believe he really did a great job. For Christ's sake, I thought i was watching 24 or CSI or Prison Break. Yes, Ben affleck was copying the styles of the TV series, only that his film turned out to be a cheap copycat. If Ben affleck could not afford to go to school to get some directing lessons, or at least the how-to-point-your-camera 101 basics for complete dummies, he should watch great movies to learn how they are made.<br/><br/>what was really annoying was that Ben affleck does not know how to use camera perspectives. he was always so focused on the faces of the characters that it seemed they were always shooting in a cramped, tight, tiny rooms where there are no spaces to move about, even a step. there were very few scenes where the camera captured a panorama, most of them ugly ones. 90% of the time you could see Casey's, or other character's faces, or should i say, noses.<br/><br/>acting was really bad. Ben affleck made their actings strangely stressed or tensed. not only that, the dialogs were so clichéd and predictable and what they did to make up for such lousy dialogs was to pepper, no, drench them with expletives. i might have a slight idea that Ben wanted this film to make it to the Guinness book of world records as the film with the most number of ""f.u.c.k"" having spoken.<br/><br/>this movie is not worth buying the DVD. it surely is a waste just like what Ben affleck made out of the great actors he cast. i just couldn't calculate how agonizing it was to finish the movie because i wanted to get something worth out of the not-so-affordable price of this lousy title."

","Don't waste a precious minute of your life on this movie. It lacks a main ingredient that is essential to any worthwhile movie: a good story, or plot.<br/><br/>Because of this shortcoming, the movie falls short on suspense, and we don't really care very much about what happens to the characters . They come across as flat and superficial. The movie quickly slides into a rut, and the director tries heroically to rescue it with bursts of colorful language and by tugging at our heartstrings. But, as always, these gimmicks fail, as they can never paste over the movie's lack of a good story."

Can you guess? <br/><br/>Ever notice that movies that have Boston as a setting have the characters use the really deep Boston accent in the beginning and then later on everyone forgetsaboutit? Huh?<br/><br/>Also, ever notice that in his early movie days Marlon Brando took on roles whereby it took some getting used to his speech patterns? Well, I don't know if Casey Affleck will attain Brando status, but something needs to be addressed as his words slide unintelligibly sideways out of his mouth. Yes, I had to use the Rewind on the DVD to get what he said. Then I got tired of that and said the heck with it and I just put my ears into SLURRY mode and made out so-so. Not good. At this point Mr. Affleck is not a Marlon Brando or even a James Dean if anyone remembers him.<br/><br/>The production was okay, but the dark night scenes were really too dark to a point I would rather have the camera focus on someone we can see sitting somewhere listening to all the commotion and reacting to those sounds than to try to figure out who is on the screen and what is he doing etc.well you get the idea. That would help eliminate eye-strain.<br/><br/>Amy Ryan was up for Best Supporting actress and did not get it. Why was she nominated in the first place? Her performance was okay but we see this character all the time on cop shows on TV. Nothing new or exciting here. The performances of the rest of the cast were good, but when Titus Welliver (Lionel McCready) was on screen I kept getting distracted by his overly bushy mustache. I wanted to pull it off, brush crumbs off it, put a match to it. It was that bushy.<br/><br/>I think the only time we will see more of Morgan Freeman is when someone does a documentary about him. His screen appearances are nothing but GOLD but we always only see bits of him in movies. Why?<br/><br/>The story was good, lost some continuity in places and had two anti-climatic scenes (when I thought it was over, it was not). However, the movie had one big flaw in it: Casey Affleck is not a Leading Man and that is the reason this is a forgettable movie. Sad to say but he had no chemistry with anyone he was in any scene with. Enough said. But, to be fair he was better in the Assassination of Jesse James film.<br/><br/>Almost forgot. The title could have been better.<br/><br/>Violence:Yes; Sex:No; Nudity:No; Language: Yes, and the movie seems to bring in some really nasty terms too."

","I find it amazing that viewers seem to like this film. The plot is transparently obvious, so most of the time I found myself just waiting to see what sort of complications would be thrown at us in what seemed a half-hearted attempt to create suspense. There were so many red herrings and so many holes in the plot that the whole thing smelled fishy before it was halfway through, while the second half smelled cheesy. I couldn't decide which was worse--the acting (except for Amy Ryan), the completely unbelievable story, or the even more unbelievable casting. Casey Affleck as a private detective who tracks missing persons? Give me a break! First of all, as his film wife says, he certainly does look too young for the part: but worse, his wiseguy/homeboy character could never get away with the things he's made to say. And sorry, the guy simply cannot act: as the saying goes, he couldn't act his way out of a paper bag, which is exactly what this film was. Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman at times looked like they were embarrassed to be in this thing, but everybody should have been. Reviewers make much of the fact that this is Ben Affleck's ""directorial debut."" Well, he has a long way to go yet. Back to school, Afflecks: Ben to director's class, Casey to acting."
"Red-125","6","2","2","18 July 2017"," The mean streets of Dorchester
","Gone Baby Gone (2007) is a crime drama co-written and directed by Ben Affleck. It stars Casey Affleck as Patrick Kenzie, a private detective who works in Dorchester. Dorchester is a huge neighborhood in Boston. It contains upscale areas but also some really rough spots. The overall crime rate in Dorchester is 30% higher than the national average, so it's not a very peaceful place.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie is that Kenzie grew up in Dorchester and knows everyone in his neighborhood. He's hired to find a kidnapped girl by the girl's aunt. The thought is that he can talk to people who wouldn't talk to the police. As it turns out, the aunt is right and Kenzie learns things by talking to people who will talk to him.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is very strong. Michelle Monaghan portrays Angie Gennaro, Kenzie's lover and his detective partner. Morgan Freeman portrays Jack Doyle, the head of the kidnapping squad, and Ed Harris portrays Remy Bressant, one of the detectives assigned to the case. They all do well in their supporting roles.<br/><br/>The problem for me is that I think Casey Affleck was the wrong actor for this role. Director Affleck knew that. There's a line where Kenzie tells the police something like, ""I may look young, but I'm 31."" In fact, Affleck really was 31 when the movie was produced. However, he looks more like an Explorer Scout working on his Law and Justice merit badge than he looks like a street-hardened private detective.<br/><br/>Truth in reviewing--there were so many very bad guys, pretty bad guys, and somewhat bad guys in the movie that I lost track of which bad guy was on the screen at any given moment. Win some, lose some. <br/><br/>However, I have to admit that the basic question raised by the film was interesting and not easy to answer. The question is whether the end justifies the means. Do you do what the law says is right, or do you do what may well be wrong, but could have a better outcome? <br/><br/>Although I believe Affleck was the wrong actor for this role at that time, he portrays his doubts about the case very well. (I should say that I thought Affleck was superb in Manchester by the Sea. In 2016 he was the right actor in the right role.)<br/><br/>This movie worked well enough on DVD. It has an excellent 7.7 IMDb rating. I may be overly critical, but it just didn't work for me."

From a novel by Dennis Lehane, Ben Affleck makes gravy in his directorial debut, about a redneck daughter's kidnapping on the mean streets of Boston. And how his sleepwalking brother saves the day.<br/><br/>Surrounded by intrigue and Ed Harris as a detective and Morgan Freeman as the head cop (all doing that ker-ray-zee Boston accent), Casey slouches his way through the role of Patrick Kenzie, a small-time private dick, called in by the aunt of the kidnapped girl, who believes that neophytes Patrick, and his private dick-lover, Angie (Michelle Monaghan) would bring a more personalized approach to the investigation than the callous police.<br/><br/>They do - and get in way over their heads, their own personal life impacted by the moral decisions they must make.<br/><br/>Genetics is amazing: we can really see Ben in Casey; his career was kickstarted by the OCEAN'S ELEVEN franchise, where we were introduced to his Hammock-on-a-Sunday-afternoon style. As soon as he shouts, we're listening to Ben... He is his own man when in that hammock. Not to say he can't pull out a deft Action passage, as when he is surrounded by rednecks in a bar and mans up in front of his woman to get them out of there with all limbs intact.<br/><br/>After a gruesome scene involving another kidnapped child, the discovery of the redneck daughter is anti-climactic, for the kidnappers were not placing her in danger, but rather trying to save her from a life of trailer-trashiness, as exhibited by her mother (played with lowlife brio by Amy Madigan), her every move screaming Easy-After-Two-Vodkas.<br/><br/>When moral ambiguity comes, pray it doesn't come as Morgan Freeman.

None of the confrontations which exist in the book and keep your pulse pounding is portrayed with as much of an iota of realism in the movie. 1.The Filmore Tap episode. 2.The Quarry episode 3.Leon Trett,Roberta Trett,Corwin Earle chilling and horrifying episode. Where is the blood curdling menace, the horror, the claustrophobia? The book has it all, the movie has zilch. And Ed Harris as 'Remy Bressant' and not 'Remy Broussard'.!! Such an ill fitting role for a great actor. Remy is supposed to be a younger man who works out 4 times a week. Not who's born in 1950 and is 58!!! Edi Gathegi ( Cheese Olamon ) and Slaine (Ruprecht 'Bubba' Rogowski )look like they are in for comic capers.They are real violent stuff actually, in the book. Did Ben Affleck for once, read the book!!!! Michelle Monaghan and Amy Ryan look and fit their parts.<br/><br/>How much liberties can a Director actually take when putting an extremely compelling work of fiction into a movie?

The truth is that Ben Affleck brings the same lackluster feel to his directing as he does to most of the films he chooses to star in. Sure, the script is snappy, with dialogue that hits the viewer like a slap to the face, but the plot is overly contrived and the twists are elementary at best.<br/><br/>While Casey reinforces the fact that he is a fine actor destined for great things, he is terribly miscast (probably, let's see, because he's the director's brother). Maybe its his slight frame or boyish looks, but Casey plays a tough guy about as well as a high-school cheerleader. Even Morgan Freeman seems out of place as a Georgian uprooted and serving in the Boston PD. As portrayed in the film, he doesn't seem to fit in either world.<br/><br/>The direction from Ben Affleck, too, seemed very amateur. Ben fancies himself an auteur, but the film instead comes off as amateurish. The quick cuts and blackout voiceovers only reinforce this point. Let's face it Ben: you're not Paul Greengrass.<br/><br/>""Gone Baby Gone"" carries a certain amount of emotional gravitas, which is why parents probably relate to and enjoy the film.

","After a long wait for and hyped reviews of the delayed directing debut from Ben Affleck Gone Baby Gone was simply an anticlimax. The movie drips with moral high ground and wooden speeches of main characters, some of whom although cast from the top layer of Hollywood, still do not manage to make us believe the candy sweet, naïve dialogues. <br/><br/>Casey Affleck playing the main lead is cast well if not through his family connections. He plays the young and street-wise detective on a search for a little missing girl. We are supposed to believe (unsuccessfully) that the case is solved in the middle of the movie, just to see it unravel in the next hour. A poor attempt at bad guy-good guy dilemma, Ben Affleck's movie stinks of American mass-denominator, though-shall-not-sin preaching.<br/><br/>The motive of child welfare seems to time well with Ben's own new baby theme, perhaps this was the reason why the story was so black and white. Great potential of this movie could have been exploited so much better in the hands of say, Clint Eastwood, but Affleck, like his protagonist, still has a lot to learn. <br/><br/>Visually the film is nothing special either. Sweeping shots of horizons, close-up speeches to lame music, sit more comfortably in 1998 than 2008. In some shots, the actors actually move away from the group as the camera moves onto their face and the music swells, and they proceed to give the God-bless-America-ish speech. <br/><br/>I do believe Affleck, the actor and director, rubbed enough shoulders in Hollywood to know better. Lets hope his next movie will prove that."

","Contains few spoilers: I rarely take the time to write a movie review, but after seeing this movie, I felt obligated to warn others. At this point I am convinced Ben Affleck took the time himself to write many of the reviews I am seeing on this message board. I rented this looking forward to see 2 very talented actors/actresses from my favorite show The Wire. Unfortunately their respective agents decided to phone it in after landing them their successful television roles. I will not waste much time leaving my remarks. All you need to know is that the plot is entirely contrived, and that it uses a poor attempt at shock value by having too many characters involved in an overly elaborate plan to kidnap a child and steal $130K.

OK, the principal character is supposed to be a young looking 31 but for x's sake he's incredibly dim for someone that age. Unfortunately, the story is revealed from his point of view so the viewer is left in the dark and can only pick holes in the story as told until it is eventually revealed that, no, they are not mistaken, the story teller is the dim one. This makes for very unsatisfactory viewing. The dialogue is often incoherent. Affleck's inability to move his lips when speaking doesn't exactly help. Freeman does the best with the material he is given but the film is already a dummy. He can't save it (or the baby). A shame really as potentially there is a lot to work with.

I thought he did a good job and is as the book described him.<br/><br/>Bressant (actually Broussard in the book) - Harris did a good job of portraying this character. However, he was limited in being allowed to develop the character. Never felt that he was likable in the movie where in the book he was a complex person.<br/><br/>Bubba - sorry, this character never came across as the psychopath he really is.<br/><br/>Cheese - waaaaay different than the book character.<br/><br/>Bea and Lionel - liked the job they did.<br/><br/>As you can see, my problems were around the characters and character development.

","Ben Affleck must be kicking himself. I'm sure it passed through his mind when he was making particularly empty vehicles as an actor and turning in self-conscious performances as Daredevils and Dick heroes that he wasn't enriching the history of cinema and had somehow joined the Forces of Evil, conspiring against the wellbeing of humanity by cashing in on a watery culture of cinematic mediocrity. He knows that film at its best can make the world a better place – somehow. It is implicit in the script of Good Will Hunting. Then Hollywood came along and tried to tell him otherwise and he forgot, like those flawed heroes who become mired in just getting by everyday after their fall from grace. Well, consider Gone Baby Gone his vengeance. It is superb. Immensely detailed, textured and nuanced he uses his own brother Casey as his alter ego to confront a world mired in selfishness and deception. The Afflecks will attempt to do what is right, what is good, and yet! It is the ""and yet..!"" that makes this film so special even beyond the great performances of pretty much every actor in the show. Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan play Patrick and Angie, life partners as well as professional partners in their business of private detectives. They are hired by the relatives of a child who has been kidnapped from her drug-using irresponsible mother (Amy Ryan playing Helene McCready in one of those turns that is unfortunately so richly convincing you don't actually think she is acting). Patrick may be street wise but there is a youth and innocence to him that makes the viewer feel protective. Those hand-picked masters of gravitas, Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris play 'the grown ups' as it were. Freeman is the police chief who has suffered a young daughter being murdered in the past and at first appears as a minor character in it all. Harris plays Remy Bressant, the seasoned cop working with colleague Nic Poole (John Ashton) obliged to share their findings with the young pair. The relationship proves to be mutually beneficial as they delve inside the shabby crime kingdom of Boston with its drug lynch pins, hustlers, thugs and users. From a Dennis Lehane novel the script by Affleck (Ben) and Aaron Stockard handsomely builds up the detail and complexity of the story. Affleck knows how to make a scene count and there are stings and zingers throughout this two hour movie that make each word and image essential and watchable. The writers also take a big chance with structure, chucking the (recently) time-honored three act system out the window, as the film is divided into two halves. It is a risk to take nowadays as audiences are so used to the set up, but it pays off because of the density of events and - that rare thing nowadays – real character development. At the heart is Casey Affleck's prickly boyish persona, both strong and brittle, a resolute and doubting crusader, vulnerable and untouchable, a sinner or a saint in the making.<br/><br/>While I'm reminded of those early Scorcese films that weave Catholic hope and guilt between urban conflict, Gone Baby Gone manages to produce a new level of sophistication. Scorcese heroes are iconic and distant. Affleck is within arms reach. This is a crime genre film that is reflective without forgetting the viewer, dealing with the lives of ordinary Americans as if they mattered, brimming with compassion, while still managing to be a cinematic ride of craft, invention and mature intelligence. <br/><br/>Yep, Affleck must be kicking himself for wasting so much time letting less capable people shape his offerings to film when all the while he should have been at the helm himself. I hope he has learned his lesson. Loved it."

However, yet again a modern American film - unlike the giants of the 1940s - falls down because the actors constantly fail to articulate their words clearly, and in this film it is Casey Affleck, with his somewhat ""affected"" style of speaking, who is the worst offender. It has now got the point at home that very often we have to press the subtitle switch on 'the box' in order to make heads or tails of the plots of American films, so bad and awful is the diction. And in this present film, total clarity of hearing was an absolute must in order to keep up with the eventual convoluted plot. Maybe the problem also lies with modern recording equipment in America.

Morgan Freeman has chosen such better roles that he must have had negative signs in his bank account and really need the money.

","There are two aspects to this movie... the posing of a serious moral dilemma with a complicated, seriously flawed plot. The goal, to propose the dilemma could have been presented without the flaws, which would have made a much better movie, but not one where everyone left saying, ""Gee, I never had it figured out."" Of course you didn't. We all work within the basis of our human experience. And when people do things in movies which are against self interest but advance a plot to confuse us, I call that mere trickery.<br/><br/>First, the plot errors. The reason no one could logically figure out ""who done it"" is that so many people do things which people just don't do. The first was the brother in law... the one who helped set up the whole scheme in the first place. He overheard the conversation which set up the heist of the money from the robbers of the drug dealer. OK, that's fine, except why in the world would he go with his wife to our intrepid detectives to hire them to discover what he had done. Or if that seems believable do you think anyone would volunteer his pension to be discovered? He could have just gone as a bump on the log. But no, he wants to get caught? Then when the Deadly Duo go to the cops with what they've found out about the druggie mom, the cops act surprised... fine they should be. But when they go to question her, they really grill her until she snaps. They could have asked a few polite questions (or without such vigor) and left. But no, they yell and scream at her until they get the truth. Did they forget they don't want the truth? And then the whole charade with Morgan Freeman and the recorded phone call. Sure they want the suckers (the detectives) to be witnesses to their Comedy Francaise, but all they would have to have done would present a phony note, or just say there was a conversation which got back to the top cop and they were meeting the coco loco drug dealer to get the girl back. No! Top cop wants to get caught too. And is. Plots like this are merely designed to fool us, the watcher. No thanks. The writers felt this is necessary in order to set up the moral dilemma... is it best to return the poor little girl to her addicted mom and a life of poverty and abuse or leave her with Morgan Freeman, to be reared ""happily"" away from her neglecting mother. Affleck's character decides, correctly, that she must be returned and the perpetrators of all these crimes, if not already dead, imprisoned. This is not decision for the benefit of the little girl. It is a decision for the benefit of society. If everyone just went around deciding whom to kill, whom to rob, whose children to take away, we would live in a world of more chaos than we already do. So we can thank the writers for at least posing a serious question of morality. But they could have done it ever so much more honestly."

BUT it looked like it was made for TV! The acting was not great, and i think this was in some part due to the script. The worst was Mr Affleck. Sorry but this boy just can't act! Every time he spoke he seemed to wear one expression!! Even when he was trying to be menacing or angry it didn't feel genuine. I always read the reviews on here before i watch any movie, (none that contain spoilers!)and i have never wrote a review before myself, but i felt compelled to to comment on this film after so many people talked it up!! For me both Freeman and Harris were good but seemed restricted. Harris more so. Trust me, there will be no awards for this film, which is a shame because there is some bravery in the ending of the film, which shows us all something that we really know anyhow, but is rarely shown in this type of film............and that is that ultimately, people don't change!"

","I like everyone involved with this film, but it just doesn't work.<br/><br/>Casey Affleck is an excellent actor, but too young and too white to portray his character believably. He looked like a tenth grader hanging around with tough cops, dealers and coke heads. He didn't sell it, he couldn't sell it.<br/><br/>Michelle Monaghan's character lacked any depth. She is one cute chick and I think she is a great actor, but I found myself feeling sorry for her as she was forced to recite such uninspired lines.<br/><br/>Ed Harris overacted. I love Ed Harris, but in this case, it is almost as if he approached the role as film noir. He looked more like a dying AIDS patient than a cop. There was not a drop Cajun in his characterization.<br/><br/>Amy Ryan turned in a superb individual acting performance as the coke whore mother. If any one actor deserves nomination for award, she does.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman just uttered his lines in his Morgan Freeman voice without any great effort or emotion.

"Robert_duder","8","8","15","15 November 2007"," Perhaps not life changing but still a really well made and interesting film
","If the summer of 2007 of was the summer of action than the Fall of 2007 is the fall to stop and think. I have seen a host of really great films this fall and a lot of them give you a lot to think about and I don't think anything is wrong with that at all. Gone Baby Gone presents itself like a mystery kidnapping film but that's not what is at the heart of this film. This film is far more about a decision made to protect an innocent person and whether that decision is justifiable. On top of that it's also really a look into a Boston neighborhood and I was really impressed with director and co-writer Ben Affleck's capture of this neighborhood (his own of course before moving to Hollywood) and how real everything seemed. It was dark and gritty and just had this feeling of emotions and real life tied up in it and I think that's pretty impressive for Affleck. The story unfolds like a typical kidnapping story but ends up turning into something completely different than you would have ever expected. It's also a very real look into the life of the rough Boston neighborhood which I didn't really think looked on it in all that great of light but perhaps in just a form of reality.<br/><br/>Casey Affleck plays the lead role, fortunate to have his older brother directing. Casey Affleck has had some decent roles over the years but nothing really stellar and this performance as young but street smart PI Patrick Kenzie is pretty good. Oscar worthy? Mmmm I don't really think so but it's a good role. I mean how far of a stretch is it for him to play the street smart, tough talking Bostonian because isn't that what he is? Still he commands the screen and does a good job in the lead. Michelle Monaghan was really good in Mission Impossible III with a small role and yet in a critically acclaimed film such as this she's just kind of there. I mean her role is kind of subtle and she has an important purpose as the balance to Casey Affleck's character but she just doesn't make herself stand out in the role. I hesitate to say this but her role is almost dull compared to some of the others. Enter the amazing Ed Harris who IS hands down deserving of a best Supporting Actor nod in this amazing role as the tough as nails Boston Cop. His speeches and emotions and just his entire performance is gut wrenching and he is amazing in this part. He steals the show quite simply!! Equally amazing Hollywood elite actor Morgan Freeman plays a small but very important role as the chief of police. He doesn't get a whole lot of dialog or a whole lot to play with in the role but seeing him on screen is always great. John Ashton is also really great as Harris' partner who often has to step aside to Harris' performance but still does great playing off of that. Amy Ryan, Amy Madigan and Titus Welliver also turn in decent performances as the family of the missing girl.<br/><br/>Gone Baby Gone is a bit of a roller coaster mystery because certainly it's left for the viewer to uncover as Casey Affleck's character does. And in the end you won't be anywhere near where you started and every twist and turn takes you further into the mystery but for the most part everything matches up and is brought together without plot holes or question marks. Finally in the end the mystery is not who took the girl as much as why they took her and is what they did morally right and it leaves a really thought provoking question in your mind or maybe not...maybe you will just outright side with one side or the other. Either way the film is a real treat to watch filmed with real expertise but as I said I don't know if I'd label it one of the best of the year by any means and I'm not sure that Academy Award status is to be given for anyone other than Ed Harris' powerful supporting performance and MAYBE Casey Affleck in the off chance. The film is full of gratuitous bad language and a cold hard look at working class Boston. Still it's worth checking out hands down!! Destined to be a new career turn for Mr. Ben Affleck. 8/10"
"secondtake","7","3","4","17 July 2009"," Nasty Realism in a Vivid Offputting Roar of Moral Dilemmas
","Gone Baby Gone (2007)<br/><br/>Nasty Realism in a Vivid Offputting Roar of Moral Dilemmas<br/><br/>This is a penetrating experience if not a transcendent one. This cinema-verite dive into rough Boston trashy life, with only limited filmic gloss, as if a kind of documentary, is still clearly fictional and intentional in its scope. These are mostly horrid seeming people on the screen, yet we know them in real life, more or less, and we know they are not so horrid most of the time, that people have their troubles and their strengths. The problem, and the value, of Gone Baby Gone is that we are made to live with them for the entire movie. Even the good guy, the moral light (more correct than his girlfriend) played by Casey Affleck, is rough by necessity. The violence of language, of attitude, and with real bullets, never stops.<br/><br/>Or when it does stop, we are left with abusive parents, neglectful parents, child molesters, kidnappers, corrupt cops, drug kingpins, drug dealers, torturers, mindless murderers, and mindful murderers. I'm sure I've only touched on half of it, and yet we believe this kind of world is out there, and are thankful it's got limits, or at least that it doesn't brush against ours. Usually.<br/><br/>Affleck's character is a contemporary and very young private detective, Patrick Kenzie, and he sort of proves that the cool, hard talking, slow-paced film noir detective is no longer a reality (if it ever was, even potentially). Our new world reacts with too much immediacy, and murder is impulsive. People are so strung out, or so far into criminalilty, reactions are fast and violent. Kenzie's unflagging, show-no-fear approach, and his kindly but somewhat dull girlfriend sidekick, Angie, are the closest thing we have to decency, and we naturally relate to them. But what proves successful is not wits, not CSI cleverness and science, but personal connections and tough conversations, threats and pressure of one friend (so-called) against another, one cop against another.<br/><br/>The plot might at time seem to teeter, but hang in there, because it makes sense, even as it drops over the edge of probability. The twists keep you curious, but mostly it's the determination of Kenzie, driven by some need to succeed, to do the right thing rather than money, that makes you care. Oddly, I did care where he went with it, and worried for him. Affleck is the younger brother of the director, Ben Affleck, and the two of them seemingly have a rapport that centers the film. Morgan Freeman shows, by his sheer presence, what great acting is, and though his role is a cliché as a veteran cop, he pulls it off perfectly. Ed Harris, playing a more war-weary cop, is more complicated cliché, but with enough odd corners to his career, and enough intensity to his acting, we go with him the whole nine yards. <br/><br/>One unsavory character, the young druggie mother played by Helen McCready, is at times so perfectly played it's part of the success of the movie. At first I thought she was playing too stupid, and too callous (being the one we are meant to sympathize with) but gradually I see the depth of exactly that kind of person, and by the last scene I'm convinced completely, and all her earlier crying and not-crying makes her the half faux-victim, half selfish addict she really portrays.<br/><br/>What finally splits the movie is a moral choice that the viewers might make differently, and so ultimately the film goes somewhere beyond its own seedy example. And the ride there is really interesting and worth watching."

","Reading Ben Affleck's name should have been enough to convince me to put this movie back on the shelf, however, Morgan Freeman's name convinced me to rent it. The story line of this movie was a great idea, however, horrible writing, shallow characters, third rate acting and cliché/elementary/hokey directing contributed to this being the worst movie I have ever seen. In high school I took and introductory to photography class. I went home and took pictures of lawn ornaments and sunshine through the window. My first efforts at photography in no way constitute art. Likewise, images of religious statues and scenes of sunshine pouring through a car window on 'Helene' fall far short of the artistic merit that a movie bearing Morgan Freeman's name should include. Casey Affleck is better suited for a Disney Movie or an after-school special playing a Hardy Boy. His phony accent and forced tough-guy persona were ridiculous."
"CromeRose","10","12","25","22 October 2007"," Dear Mr. Affleck
","You have finally found your career, my man, run with it. I must confess that I am not a fan of Ben's with regards to his acting, not because I think he is not a good actor, but with the exception of ""SUM OF ALL FEARS"" I just don't like any of the films he has been in, most especially the horribly overrated ""CHASING AMY"" which simply grates on all my nerve endings. But anyway, not a fan of his acting, but after seeing ""GONE BABY GONE"" I freely and shamelessly admit that I fervently hope he becomes a long-standing director, and I cannot wait for whatever he decides to do next. ""GONE BABY GONE"" is quite simply a masterpiece. Ben's directing style is totally old-school and so thankfully has none of that terrible shaking-moving, documentary style ""realism"". Ben is smart enough to co-write a wholly engaging script, and already savvy enough as a new director to focus on story and character over vacuous, empty ""MTV style"" camera work. Kudos Ben!! The wonderful backdrop of beautiful, throbbing, vibrant Boston notwithstanding, the gritty, dark, pretentious-free realism of the acting (including that of younger brother Casey, who is unfairly bashed by too many critics on this board) and the characterizations in this film are nothing short of mesmerizing and terrifying. I say terrifying because the fact that these characters are true depictions of people who really do exist (the dysfunctional, drug-addled women who should never be permitted to bear children and become mothers; the sleazy two-bit drug dealers who have somehow become top dogs in their horrifying world; the desperate good souls who foul up despite their commendable good intentions; the child molesters and rapists who should never be allowed another second's worth of freedom from prison; and the innocent, hapless and helpless children who are the utterly innocent victims of this sadly broken aspect of society) - these characters, by the very fact that they are dead-on-accurate renditions of people who really exist, are way scarier than anything in any horror movie; and Ben and his team of wonderful actors and technicians have breathed frightening real life into them with perfect aplomb (I almost suspect that a couple of the minor character actors were taken straight off the street). The plot, while containing some predictable elements, still manages to put final twists on each of those predictable parts so as to keep one captivated - and the elements that were not predictable just blew me away. The initial recce of the hideout house by Casey Affleck's character (and his drug dealer buddy) was a wonderfully creepy foreshadowing of terrible things to come - and the follow-up raid, in which Nick is shot and wounded, and in which Casey goes in and finds the missing boy, was spine tinglingly horrific - a scene reminiscent of, and at the same level of nail-biting intensity as anything in David Fincher's SEVEN. The moral question at the end of the movie would indeed be a difficult thing for many people to answer. The fact that Ben stuck to his guns and went for the realistic, true-to-life resolution just enhances his solid steel film-maker's balls. Personally I would have left the little girl in the much better life situation, but in reality, Casey Affleck's character made the choice most would make - which does not make it any less heartbreaking and frustrating, especially with the scene towards the end wherein we see little Amanda back in the clutches of her wretched, selfish and worthless mother (a performance by Amy Ryan that was so real and believable that I was shocked and relieved to discover that she's actually an actress and not some real-life bad mom). I couldn't help agreeing with Michelle Monaghan that I hated Casey Affleck's character for calling the state police, and yet I also believe that he was redeemed in the final scene by its suggestion that he has decided to make it his life's mission to watch over the child forevermore. A wonderful, moving, gut-wrenching film, Ben, and a fine feature directorial debut. Encore!"
"lois-lane33","5","4","6","6 October 2014"," More Hollywood Effluvium.
","This film is actually interesting. In a convoluted sort of way. There is good solid ensemble acting by all involved and a notable performance given by Casey Affleck who plays a youngish private detective trying to break a missing child case that is mired a mile deep in local effluvium. Another younger guy who deals cocaine is depicted in the picture at one point as being some kind of a noble person who 'fights the good fight' which I think is pretty damned unlikely. The depiction of unreal rotten morally empty people as representational of the people that inhabit the poorer areas of the good city of Boston-is tedious. One thing that I have never seen in 500 Hollywood movies is a depiction of anyone who grew up in North America after moving from England as a kid causing them to lose their British accent growing up in a place not England. Accepting that even exists in todays world is considered by many to be on a par with accepting Satan into their lives-when denying such things exist is basically what it is to be Satan. Given that thorny general state of affairs I would't call this movie ground breaking or noteworthy. Policeman takes kid who has doper mother-detective steals kid back and returns to doper mother which will ruin kids life-end of story-nobody wins. The movie doesn't enlighten. Things stink generally at the start of the film and they stink generally at the end of it also. Frustrating movie. So frustrating it is interesting.In a convoluted sort of way."
"bob the moo","Null","4","6","2 July 2008"," Complex, engaging thriller with strong delivery from cast and crew
","When a young girl goes missing from a rough Boston neighbourhood, the relatives of the less-than-sympathetic mother turn to private detective Patrick Kenzie who they hope can help with his local knowledge. Kenzie instantly does two things  one being rubbing the police the wrong way with his involvement, the other being proving his worth by exposing lies the police have been told by key people. However, with the clock ticking, time is running out and the odds dwindling for finding the child alive.<br/><br/>As many others have said, Gone Baby Gone understandably took its time to get to the UK given the thematic connection with the real life child disappearance that dominated the headlines for many months, not to mention the likeness that the two white, blonde girls share. Going into it I thought that it would be a very bleak look at child abduction or child abuse and it was quite pleasing to find myself in the middle of a thriller plot  albeit very much about the aforementioned subjects. I'm not sure if this has been marketed at all in the UK (not seen a single poster for it whereas Hulk is everywhere) but if it has I'm not sure how they would have done it because while it is engaging, it is certainly not a cheerful or lovable film. However this is a problem for the marketing people  not the viewer.<br/><br/>For the viewer what the very dark tone also produces is a complex and engaging thriller that not only manages to hold the attention with a series of solid and unexpected twists but also forces moral questions onto you that have no easy answers (although do have ""right"" answers). The two aspects of the film complement one another really well, with the thriller moving at a pace that does not detract from how grim it is. It is not perfect of course and some of the plot turns do take the odd jump and for the overall scenario as you understand it at the end, asking too many ""yeah but"" questions will take it to pieces with relative ease. Fortunately though, when it does tend to be weak in these regards, it is delivering questions to the viewer (the ending being a perfect example) and these rather serve to prevent one from picking at the internal logic but rather focusing on the question instead. Working this way makes it engaging and interesting to watch and it was a lot better than I expected.<br/><br/>Being"" better than expected"" is also a statement that be applied across the cast and in particular to the director. Affleck does really good work here with his cinematographer to gets loads of well-framed shots along with the realistic ones but he also does very well in regards tone and style of delivery. It may be a ""thriller"" but the development is slow and, when violence comes, the gun fire has an abrasive crack rather than the satisfying thuds more favoured in action films. He draws mostly good performances from his cast as well. Casey Affleck turns in yet another strong performance; some have said he is rather flat but to me his restraint and internal conflict worked best for the film. Freeman has a small role and is essentially the sturdy pair of hands he is now known as. Harris is as good as you expect and it is nice to see Ashton in something again. Oscar nominated Ryan really should have won for a really convincing turn as the mother of the missing child but Monaghan is sadly not as good as she could have been and didn't work for me at key parts. Ironically the main cast member that stood out for me was one that did so in a jarring way, and that was Williams. We are treated to several lingering shots of his character before his name is even known (far less his minor part in the narrative) and I wondered why he was focused on like that. I imagine most people will not notice but it is hard enough to forget he is Omar from The Wire without having unnecessary shots of him.<br/><br/>Anyway, before I start going on about The Wire again (watch it folks) I should note that Gone Baby Gone was not only better than I expected but also very good on its own terms. The narrative has weaknesses but these are helped over by the thread of moral questioning and how engaged I was in the overall film. The delivery is surprisingly good from Affleck as director and the cast is good with only a very few exceptions. Hard to market and not the most fun film you'll see but worth seeing regardless."

And the good things they did get undone, for the right reasons, but they are reasons of the mind. The detective work is excellent, those things that puzzle the audience (gee, how come they are not grilling the mother at least a little bit more) all come out. And the sad sad love story. I kept hoping the maybe, maybe something good might come of doing the right thing, the right thing of the mind. But I don't think so. The lines are right, the script is tight, the logic and flow is excellent. The review in the NY Times noted that Morgan Freeman has done better. That's really hard not to notice, especially in such a fine film. I wouldn't think that Morgan would let that happen, but maybe the director is that important, even for Freeman. I think this is one of the most thoughtful films I've seen in years."
"jaredmobarak","10","9","18","20 October 2007"," Be wise as a serpent and innocent as a doveGone Baby Gone
","Real life is not known for its happy endings. Author Dennis Lehane seems to understand this fact and is not afraid to tell his stories with that mentality. The last novel of his to be given the film treatment was Mystic River. A great movie from Clint Eastwood was the result, showing the deep bonds between family and friends in Boston amidst horrifying tragedy. While the story and acting were top-notch there, something about the recent adaptation of Gone Baby Gone takes it a step further. It is my guess that the impetus for this is adapter/director Ben Affleck. While I'm sure Lehane keeps his stories seeped in Boston lifeblood, the transition to screen can't always be exact, it takes a filmmaker from there to get it correct. As a directorial debut, you can't ask for more from Affleck. No matter what your feelings are about his acting skills (I'm a fan, mainly due to his comedic work) you cannot deny the talent behind the camera. He brings authenticity to the relationships on screen as well as being unafraid to show Boston as it is. The film is as much about the search for a missing girl as it is a lesson on what family means to those living in the city.<br/><br/>For being a character-based tale, Affleck has allowed the story to hold itself up as the enthralling thriller it is. While there is a more action-oriented scene in the middle, it is the suspense of the unknowing that keeps us enraptured in the proceedings. Casey Affleck is a courageous take-no-crap from anyone hero inside a somewhat diminutive frame as compared to some of the heavies he comes across. He is a man who shows what he is made of on many occasions, including at a bar early on questioning witnesses, talking to the drug lord Cheese, and springing to action when his friends attempt a siege alone on a house later in the film. He's the Catholic Boston boy, raised on the streets along with those who took the other road to violence and crime. With a strict moral code, established in large part by his priest growing up, he is unable to accept the skewed mentality of those around him who allow themselves to do wrong as long as it gets a wrongdoer off the streets.<br/><br/>Ben's use of the camera is great. He portrays Boston by the people that inhabit it. The little touches of montages showing real citizens on their bar stools and street corners help put everything in context. Then you have the grass roots word of mouth crusades going on to express how no matter what part of society you belong to, the community takes care of its own. From the bar regular that spills what he knows about the missing girl, (putting up flyers about her as she was their unofficial mascot being that the mother frequently brought her inside), to the other that yells at him to keep his mouth shut, (its one thing to lie to the cops, but another to tell the truth to someone you knowa reason Casey's character is enlisted to help gather intelligence), to the police officer at a funeral for a fallen cop walking up and congratulating Casey for a job well done killing a known pedophile, these people respect the protection of their own no matter what ugliness was used to get it. This is an underlying theme in Mystic River too, but something about this cast and the lead and director being from the city itself that rings so much more true. Besides that authenticity, Affleck does a nice job at adding his own flair to the proceedings and a superb eye for composition of frame and use of close-ups during character interaction. I can't wait to see what he does next.<br/><br/>One must commend him also for his ability to get phenomenal performances from his cast. Many actors say that actors turned director get the most from them, and it shows here. Between this and Jesse James, it will be a crime if Casey Affleck is not recognized for his superior work this year. I can't think of anyone who has done a better job than him. The latent bad boy hiding behind his good exterior and moral disposition comes out to great effect, helping to show the interior conflict he battles through the story. Everyone else is fantastic too, but special mention needs to be made for some. Titus Welliver, (wonderful in Deadwood, it's good to see him doing films), stands out as the uncle of the missing girl hiding a few secrets himself, and the consummate professional Ed Harris bringing his A-game. Harris is a complicated man here with many hidden motivations. His role is very integral to the film and the way he can turn on the tough guy persona when necessary and the compassionate friend doing what he can to help another assuage his guilt is unmatched. The girl's mother, played by Amy Ryan, also sticks out for her genuine performance. You'd be hard-pressed to believe that she isn't a drug addicted drunk in real life, turning on the tears when appropriate, only to shut the faucet when life goes back to normal.<br/><br/>While the journey is amazing, it is the ending that brings everything together. Our lead faces a dilemma that can cost him everything he holds dear. Does he make the right decision? That's for you as the viewer to decide. The final frame is lingered on to allow us time to wonder what would have happened if he chose the other option, but one can't live with regret, they must do what they must do. All those involved saw something in this story and they all honored it with their best, making this my new favorite of the year, by a long shot."

Now having seen the delicacy with which he handles this film, I have to say that he has a pair of highly capable directing hands.<br/><br/>""Gone Baby Gone"" is a top notch under-the-radar thriller and another successful film adaptation of a Dennis Lehane (Mystic River) novel. Affleck has essentially helped plant Lehane's solid seed and done nearly all the work required to let it blossom. This is not one of those arrogant, chin-in-the-air missing child investigative mysteries--it is genuine and honest nearly the entire time. Affleck really keeps his impressive cast of characters on the ground and they are all played by talented actors capable of doing just that.<br/><br/>The story follows independent detective Patrick Kenzie, played by Affleck's younger brother Casey, who easily surpasses his brother's depth and range of acting talent. Basically, Kenzie and his girlfriend (Monaghan) are brought on to help investigate the case of a missing four- year-old girl and what Patrick finds along the way begins to test his character. Kenzie is a thick-accented hard-nosed Bostonian who gets a lot of flack for looking younger than his age but keeps his worth based on who he knows in Boston. Ironically, the role is true to life for the younger Affleck, whose success has been impeded by his youthful appearance. It's a shame, too. Casey keeps the serious, introspective tone of the film alive and prevents it from getting too ridiculous at the end when the film takes some overused twists and turns as the mystery is revealed.<br/><br/>The supporting cast, particularly the always-talented Ed Harris and the missing girl's mother played by Amy Ryan (who we will surely be seeing more of), was also outstanding and helped push across the very human feel of the film, truly its greatest strength. It stays very theme- focused and some excellent dialogue keeps the intensity up. There is some high quality trash talking in the film (thanks to Ben, probably) and that plus some of the scenes in the beginning portray Kenzie in a way that does not make him seem any more powerful because he's the investigator--a trait not common of thrillers.<br/><br/>The film really stays close to its themes and makes it very clear, but not in an overstated or cheesy way. That is avoided because Affleck the humanity and realism are established so early in the film. Just looking at the actors gives off a working-class vibe. The small role actors and extras were not chosen because they were easy on the eyes and that's commendable and integral to the vibe of the film. From a technical perspective, Ben focuses the camera on people and the Boston backdrop a bit too and people and places is what real life is at its most essential. He picks the right moments to show characters and grasp their emotions and what they're likely thinking.<br/><br/>""Gone"" will likely exceed your expectations, especially for Ben Affleck, but it won't go above and beyond anything you've seen before--it's not one of those genre-transforming films. Affleck just takes the story and brings it to its full potential in a way that is thoughtful and entertaining and that's all we can ask for from a director."
"dwilcox9","4","5","9","13 April 2008"," Writer/director Ben Affleck misfires in debut, as screen adaptation of GONE BABY GONE lacks depth and impact.
","Lehane is a terrific writer and there was much to like about the book, including his wry humor, the nuances of the characters and the many twists and turns of plot. I was surprised at the casting choices, including Casey Affleck (who looked too young), the child's mother (who looked too old), the police captain (who changed races), the detective ""Bressant"" (far too hard-bitten and one dimensional a character) and Cheese (how did he get to be a Haitian street lord, and why wasn't he in prison?). The character depiction of the detective (Broussard, inexplicably changed to Bressant) that made his compliance with the conspiracy believable in the book was also unfortunately missing in the film, and it came off as just another predictable, die-cut Ed Harris performance. I confess that Casey Affleck's performance grew on me a bit through the course of the film, but the casting was still wrong, and undercut his believability as regards the supposed maturity and experience of the character. (Hmmm, I wonder if being the brother of the director had anything to do with the choice?) His raspy, mumbling Boston accent was often difficult to follow, right from the opening narration (which I found unconvincing when I could understand it). Both of the cops were badly cast, IMO, as the partner who ultimately died is a warmed-over character actor who always, always plays a cop. I found myself trying to remember what other films I'd seen him play cops in. The events at the quarry, which were so central to the book, were glossed over and greatly diminished in the film. I forgot to mention that Freeman's performance seemed tired and uninspired, even in the final scenes. Just another payday for him. Perhaps it's unfair to compare the book and the film, but as a faithful adaptation of the book (why do I keep expecting this??) it pretty much sucked. I would have to conclude that the ""screenwriters"" either speed-read the book and missed most of what made it special, or saw it but didn't know how to make it work on screen. Big brother Affleck gets a C- for his directorial debut, as (in my opinion) he failed to wrest anything golden from his players, and a D- as a screenwriter, for missing the best parts of the book. This seemed to me more like a movie-of-the-week with a couple of high-priced actors thrown in to get people to watch. Music score was okay but forgettable. Two bones."
"dneunabe","1","13","31","7 November 2007"," Very disappointing. Should Ben Affleck hang it up?
","I can't recall a worse movie. You have great individual performances by Casey Affleck and Ed Harris, and a passable performance by Morgan Freeman. Ben Affleck does a good job of portraying the plight of the poor and drug addicted. But this movie was poorly made. The plot made so many twists and turns at the end, that I wondered when, exactly, it would end. They needed a montage near the end to explain what happened, because otherwise the viewer would have been totally confused. Finally, the ending was completely unbelievable. When Casey Affleck's girlfriend left him, I wanted to leave the theater.<br/><br/>To me, this movie suggests that Ben Affleck should either take directing lessons or hang it up. His wife has a good job, so he doesn't need the money..."
"come2whereimfrom","8","4","7","5 June 2008"," Ben's debut as a director is amazing.
","Ben Affleck gets behind the camera and directs his brother amongst others in this tale of kidnapping, moral decisions and society's deep undercurrents. In a scenario eerily similar to that of the real life disappearance of Madeline McCann (the girl in the film Amanda even looks like her) the story is that of a young girl taken from her bed at night and how the ensuing search affects everyone from the community to the police to Patrick (Casey) and his partner in his private investigator business Angie (Monaghan). Along the way we meet Amanda's mother a character that seems to have no redeeming features, her brother who with his wife are instrumental in the hiring of Patrick and Angie much to the protest of cops Remy (Ed Harris) and Nick (Ashton) under the leadership of Capt. Jack Doyle (Freeman) who we discover lost a child in similar circumstances which lead him to set up a special unit to deal with such happenings. The tone and pace of the film can be compared to 'Mystic River' or 'The Woodsman' with the characters being the driving force of the story which continues to build right up to the end. One of the main things the film does is pose ethical and moral questions and you find yourself at once with the characters that have to make these choices, along with the superb direction and acting it's the main way the film continues to grip you throughout. A haunting score and some impressive cinematography flesh out the movie as do some of the smaller characters that inhabit the neighbourhood, but this film really does belong to the Affleck's Ben proving that with his debut he is now a director to watch out for and Casey who after his part in last years 'The Assassination of Jesse James..' is showing he is an actor of range that is developing with each role. Whether this is a case of art imitating life or vice versa this is a film that will get you thinking long after it's finished."
"screenwriter-14","9","4","7","10 November 2007"," ""For the sake of the Child"" ?
","Ben Affleck has crafted a brilliant, dark and disturbing film in GONE BABY GONE with a sensational cast and such strong acting performances from Amy Ryan and Casey Affleck, as well as from a superb supporting cast. Boston lends itself so well to the story and the characters jump off the screen in a very suspenseful tale of a missing child. Like the film, MYSTIC RIVER, GONE BABY GONE brings your neighbors to the fore front in a manner that is both alluring, and frightening at the same time.<br/><br/>The question of ""what is right for the child?"" is shown on the screen and captured in this film with an ending that will cause an audience to question what is really right, or, what is wrong, in child care rearing and the importance of family. Casey Affleck is magnificent and the lovely Michelle Monaghan as his conscience make a wonderful pair on the screen. Of course, Ed Harris is as always, such a strong supporting actor and his role in the film makes the story flow along with the presence of the fabulous Morgan Freeman. I can hardly wait until Ben Affleck does another film like the one he delivers in GONE BABY GONE. Bravo Ben, ""you done good!""...."
"zetes","8","4","7","22 October 2007"," Has its flaws, and some big ones, too, but still achieves something near greatness
","Ben Affleck's directorial debut, based on a novel by Dennis Lehane, who also wrote Mystic River. Affleck's direction is more than adequate. I'm sure he's aping Clint Eastwood's film version of Mystic River much of the time, and there's one scene that's way too reminiscent of Se7en, but he shows a lot of skill. He's great at capturing his hometown of Boston and the people who live there. The story revolves around the investigation of a missing girl. Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris are two of the major investigators for the police. The aunt of the missing girl hires Casey Affleck and his girlfriend, played by Michelle Monaghan, to do private investigation on the side, because they can maybe find some secrets that the girl's mother (Amy Ryan) might be hiding. It's a gripping mystery story, and it arrives at one quite satisfying twist. But then there's another twist. The second big twist is completely stupid, and then the previously excellent film starts to fall. This isn't unlike Mystic River, where, when we finally found out why Tim Robbins has been acting so strange all the time, I just had to slap my forehead. Gone Baby Gone is able to pull itself up a bit from its head-slapping plot revelation in its final moments, but I was still left feeling cheated. I also have to complain that Monaghan, as cute as she is, adds very little. Would Affleck's character really put his girlfriend in such dangerous situations all the time? I'm sort of glad we're spared the whole cliché schtick where one of the two lovers fears for their significant other's safety, but bringing the hot chick into a powerful drug dealer's den sounds like a hostage situation waiting to happen. Casey Affleck delivers his second fine performance of the year, though it isn't as good as his Robert Ford, which I think might some day be considered iconic. Ed Harris is a sure thing for an Oscar nomination. The guy is such a master at his craft. It's a credit to Affleck's direction that the film can still be considered so good after some should-be fatal flaws."
"pogopuff","8","4","7","19 October 2007"," Hurrah for Ben Affleck, He's got a winner here!
","First of all let me say that I liked some of Ben's movies, unlike most critics, Armageddon was one of his best. But maybe this will be one movie he is remembered for more than others. The story gets you right from the start. No one likes to hear it when a little girl turns up missing. And everyone hopes for a happy ending. There are a few twist that keep you guessing and you will never be bored with this film. Casey Affleck does a fine job. He looks too brittle or too young to be a private investigator, but seems to pull it off. Michelle Monaghan who plays his girlfriend and partner may not be as well known but a lot of you will be saying to yourself, ""I know that girl from somewhere"", She is quite a looker. Lots of recognizable faces appear in the movie. I can't remember their names but they all do great jobs. Morgan Freeman stands out more than the rest, and that man can do any role he wants to. He plays the chief of police (or whatever) and succeeds once again.<br/><br/>You won't be able to figure this one out. And not knowing too much about the film will help you enjoy it more. So don't read the spoilers notes and be careful to whom you ask ""was it any good"", because you and your spouse or friends may leave the theater will different opinions about the ending. And the ending is what makes a movie good or bad. This movie makes you ""think"" at the end about what would I have done if I would have been in their shoes? Hurrah for Ben!!!"

","This crabby pill of a movie takes place in the dreg districts of Boston and stars Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan as a boyfriend/girlfriend detective team who are hired to search for a missing child. What follows is a twisty plot with a stupid and implausible finale. The movie is surly, everyone involved is in a bad mood, and the whole thing left me gloomy and angry.<br/><br/>What am I supposed to take away from a movie like this? The film thinks it's asking weighty moral questions, like what does it mean to do the right thing, what's the difference between what is right and what is legal, etc.? But any point gets lost in the ugly, horrid world the movie lives in. Director Ben Affleck has been getting loads of praise for painting such an accurate portrait of working-class Boston, and maybe he did, but then why in God's name does anyone want to live there? The film makes Boston look like the worst place on Earth, filled with degenerates and thugs. One scene set in a drug house -- by far the most demoralizing scene in the film -- is straight out of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" inbred hillbillies and all. After a while, your only defense in this film is to laugh at the preposterous human ugliness Affleck unrelentingly heaps on you.<br/><br/>Maybe good performances could have saved the movie -- or more accurately, good characters, because the performances are decent. But I don't know what any actors could have done with this material.<br/><br/>I'm sick and tired of Hollywood churning out movie after movie that has no reason for existing other than to make people feel bad. What happened to movies that communicate ideas and engage in dialogue? Now film makers seem to think that what moviegoers want more than anything is to simply wallow in human baseness and meanness. It's movies like ""Gone Baby Gone"" that are responsible for the insidious belief that the world is a much more nasty and violent place to live in than it really is.<br/><br/>I'm glad this one bombed.<br/><br/>Grade: D"

It feels like three of four separate parts clumsily glued together in the editing room. Like a 'best of' of a ten-hour miniseries. - the plot: I'll add a few sentences at the bottom of this text with spoiler warnings.

My advice would be to wait until its released on DVD.<br/><br/>4 out of 10<br/><br/>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD***<br/><br/>As for the plot: seriously, one (1) idea is not enough to keep a two-hour movie afloat.

Drunken Irishmen, rookie detectives, dirty cops, dope-dealers, we've all seen it a hundred times before, done with a lot more style and wit.

"lindhe-1","1","6","13","22 October 2008"," Great novel, horrible adaption for the screen.
","Gone baby gone was probably one of the greatest novels I've ever read and Im a big fan of Dennis Lehane. This however didn't help the movie at all. And it doesn't feel like Dennis has had any say in how the 'feel' of the movie should be.<br/><br/>First of all, the cast: Patrick Kenzie was played by Casey Affleck. A rather young looking mediocre actor. I can imagine him playing in a teen-flick as some pretty boy but a roughneck private detective just doesn't fit. He murmurs when he talks and I had trouble finding his acting/emotions trustworthy. He is also dressed in ridiculously childish clothes throughout the movie. (in the novel he's pretty rough, dressed in shirts/jackets and he also has a beard). I mean seriously, is that too much to ask? Angie Gennaro, played by Michelle Monaghan, was just horrible throughout the whole movie. Although she looks pretty much like Dennis portraits her in the novel, they had stripped her of her cocky attitude and made her seem more like a boring housewife. (The novel displays her as tougher and more aggressive than Kenzie). Michelle's acting was OK I guess, but way too 'weak'.<br/><br/>Cheese 'jean Baptiste' in the book was a huge, fat, redheaded, pale Caucasian who thought and acted as if he was black. In the movie he was replaced by a African-American and to my surprise he acted even worse than Casey. They had also scrambled his role in the novel and it got very confusing.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast they played their roles really nice. Remy Bressant, played by Ed Harris, did a wonderful job and Ed was a good choice for the role.<br/><br/>Second, the script & movie.<br/><br/>While Ben Affleck tried his best to convert a genius novel of roughly 500 pages into a two hour movie he missed a lot of scenes which in the novel are critical. These scenes were also incredibly badly portrayed. The book is scary and very dark most of the time. The movie however, was a complete joke in that aspect. Almost all the scenes were shot in daylight and gave very little to the spooky theme that the novel had.<br/><br/>All in all the movie got confusing and a very emotion novel was turned into a flat emotionless and mediocre drama.<br/><br/>Im writing this since I feel that this was not a fair conversion from novel to movie. so basically: Great novel, horrible movie."
"clotblaster","4","6","13","28 October 2007"," Choppy, clumsy pacing and mediocre acting Doom this movie
","I disagree with almost everyone who has written or rated this movie on IMDb. I thought the movie started very poorly and failed to engage my attention for the first 10 to 15 minutes. In fact I was really trying to get into the film, but the movie repelled my efforts. In fact the entire movie smashes at the audience, both with its acting and action, but also with its unpleasant theme that deserves better movie treatment.<br/><br/>Casey Affleck is a sweet looking guy, but he is totally unbelievable as a detective in hard core Boston. The opening moments that introduce us to him and his female partner are choppy and all over the place. They both come across as flat and one dimensional. They don't talk to each other, but rather by and around each other. The female detective comes across, at best, as a drugged out, vague person. She literally has no personality. This continues the entire film.<br/><br/>The film brings in the reliable Ed Harris to snarl and yell as the macho cop. This is easy as pie for Harris. Morgan Freeman's initial acting in the film is also flat and uninvolving. I also question the credibility of this film in having a black as the highest ranking officer in the film. Certainly there are black captains and higher in Boston, but his blackness, rightly or wrongly in our society, brings in factors that detract from the movie. Doyle should have been a rough, tough Irish man--actually Harris should have been Doyle and Freeman should have not been in this movie. Talk about politically correct. We have a pedophilia film with a mournful, soulful Boston police captain who is almost eager to allow private detectives work with the force. That is also beyond credibility. Perhaps Affleck and his girlfriend could have gotten involved, but it would have taken a lot more convincing story telling to make it happen in a believable fashion--in this film things just happen. We have a series of clichéd set pieces (bar scene, scene with bad ass drug king, scene with uncaring mother. There is NO continuity and little believability in all the scenes. I understand many viewers liking this film because there are so few adult films on really serious subjects and this film seems powerful and compelling. However, it never comes together and for reasons listed above this never rises above an average film that concerns a firecracker topic (child sex and abuse).<br/><br/>The only interesting moments, and above average acting by Affleck, come at the end when he is deciding whether to do the right thing or take an action that is wrong but more emotionally satisfying. In these final moments, we see what might have happened in this film to make it a good one. I blame the director, Hollywood darling Ben Affleck, (who also co wrote the adaption of Lehane's probably good novel) for the problems in the film. He fails to get good performances from his cast and takes a serious story and degenerates it into a soap opera--a poor one at that."

Harris: ""That's not the kind of 'if' you want to bring into your life."" It's the story of a three-year-old girl apparently kidnapped from her single mother, Amy Ryan. Ryan's sister hires two amateur young sleuths from the neighborhood, Affleck and Michelle Monaghan, to poke around and see if they can turn up any leads on the girl's whereabouts. The police, Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman, as a captain in the BPD, cooperate reluctantly.<br/><br/>The cops advise Affleck to give up the search because the girl must be dead, but he and his partner persist, leading to a couple of deaths, including that of the child who is evidently drowned in a quarry. Some time passes. A friend gives Affleck a hint about a child molester. Affleck calls Harris and as they approach the house, more shootings and deaths occur. I'm being deliberately vague because this plot is full of twists and odd plot turns, many of the most important ones revealed in momentary flashbacks. The result of this directorial decision, unless my brain is turning to tofu, is some confusion about the details of events. Anyway, I'll let the plot go at this point.<br/><br/>The general impression a viewer gets from the movie is that Boston, the city that gave us Paul Revere, Benjamin Franklin, Indian pudding and the baked bean, is now about as ugly and dangerous a place as New York City. This is a very naturalistic movie, meaning you don't get to see any ritzy restaurants, there is no shot of the Old North Church, and nobody goes water skiing on the North Shore. The F word is used exactly one million, two hundred, and three times. I counted. There is little bonhomie. Most of the people seem to slouch around in black Gothic rags with crucifixes or St. Christopher medallions used as fashion accents. A goodly number smoke marijuana (Gasp!) or snort coke, even after it spills on the floor. Bad guys may die, but so do good guys, and some of the best of the good guys wind up in the slams for reasons that are at best arguable.<br/><br/>And that's the crux of the film -- that arguable quality. Should a person live according to inflexible principles that may be too lofty for practical use? Would you insist on telling the truth, though the heavens fall? (See ""Prince of the City"" for an examination of a similar dilemma.) More specifically, if you found a child who had been kidnapped by a loving family, would you insist that she be returned to her immoral and uncaring biological mother, knowing that in doing so you would see the law upheld but would be consigning the child to an almost certainly wrecked life? Casey Affleck is the central figure, and he provides a sketchy narration. It's hard to judge his performance. He displays little range but maybe that's how he's decided to draw the character. His voice has all the semihemidemiquavers of Jimmy Stewart's but none of the expressiveness. Morgan Freeman is impressive, as always, a sublime actor. Michelle Monaghan's character seems to be in the film in order to prove that Affleck is heterosexual and to provide him with something to risk losing. The best performance may be given by Amy Ryan as the child's flawed mother. It's a most difficult role, too. Ryan has to walk a fine line between genuine but fleeting motherly instincts and frivolous self indulgence on the other. It's hard to see how anyone could have done better than she did. Ed Harris does well, too, as the cop who is willing to recognize a distinction between formal principle and pragmatism, and to be willing to sacrifice for a good that is outside the law. But then everyone is pretty good. Not a sour note in the bunch.<br/><br/>Warning: Children under the age of 35 may fall asleep. This movie is made for adults. Shots are fired in only two scenes, and they are mostly pops and flashes in the background. There is no sex or nudity. There are long scenes in which nobody wrenches someone else's head off and pees down his neck cavity. They just sit and talk. The film doesn't provide instant gratification -- not during the meandering unfolding of the plot, nor at the end.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck directed. He needs a little seasoning but his judgment is generally good. The script is a bit weak in presenting us with that dilemma, by the way. The protagonist is in a quandary over whether to punish good guys for breaking the law in order to achieve a greater good. But that makes him more than ordinarily extrapunitive. After all, earlier he murdered a helpless child molester and THAT doesn't seem to bother him much. He's better at forgiving himself than at forgiving others. The script kind of skips over that little problem. <br/><br/>See it if you can. You won't wind up whistling a happy tune but you might find yourself wondering about the issues raised here."
"MOscarbradley","10","3","5","9 June 2008"," A terrific 'thriller' that raises more questions than it answers
","OK, so Ben Affleck won an Oscar, along with Matt Damon, for writing ""Good Will Hunting"", the controversy at the time being that they had a little help from the likes of William Goldman. He was also sexy, funny and even charming in ""Chasing Amy"" despite playing a misogynist pig. Then it all went wrong. Good looks notwithstanding, bad movies choices and an almost total lack of anything resembling charisma ensured that while Affleck was seldom out of the movie news, albeit for all the wrong reasons, his career was all but over. Until now, but this time Ben has stayed, perhaps wisely, behind the camera, casting instead his almost unnaturally talented younger brother Casey in the lead.<br/><br/>""Gone Baby Gone"" is a terrific movie; ostensibly a thriller about the kidnapping of a young girl from a blue-collar Boston neighborhood, (its release in Britain held up until now because of supposed similarities with the Madeline McCann case), this brilliant film asks more questions than it answers, posing a number of moral and ethical dilemmas. This is a movie to ponder over and which you will take away from the cinema with you, (and no, I don't think there are any resemblances between this and the McCann case).<br/><br/>Adapted by Affleck and Aaron Stockard from a novel by Dennis Lehane who wrote ""Mystic River"", it shares with it the same blue-collar Boston milieu and which it captures to perfection. Indeed it seems to me a much more accurate representation than was Eastwood's film. Rather than borrowing from his mentors Affleck has learned from them and this is a remarkable assured directorial debut. (We shall over look the one about the lesbian wife and the meat-hook).<br/><br/>It is also terrifically well acted. Casey Affleck, so good in ""The Assassination of Jesse James"", is perfectly cast as the young Private Investigator hired by the child's aunt to head up the investigation, knowing, as she does, that many people in the locale will not co-operate with the police. It's a beautifully written part and Affleck plays it superbly. He is matched by Ed Harris as the policeman not beyond bending or breaking a few rules to get what he wants. The film's real revelation, however, is Amy Ryan as the child's drug-addicted mother. Ryan plays her unsympathetically and although her character isn't on the screen very often she remains crucial to the film's development making this as much a movie about the nature of parenting as it is a thriller. Ryan won almost every award going last year, only losing out on the Oscar. She's amazing but then so is the whole movie. You may feel by the end as if you've been kicked in the stomach. Yes, it really is that good."

","The moment the first note of the theme song came up on the screen, tears started to fill my eyes... I knew that the directorial debut by Ben Affleck, ""Gone Baby Gone, was going to be a Great Film. All you had to do was LISTEN. All you have to do is HEAR.<br/><br/>You will be transported from the land of the living to the land of innocence lost and long gone and the longing for what we knew long ago and far away... it's that place we all know and long to return to that doesn't have a name.<br/><br/>You don't even have to watch the screen, even though you wouldn't want to miss a frame... This gorgeous, touching, heartbreaking soundtrack by Harry Gregson-Williams follows every fast-paced twist and turn down the rushing river that takes us on this tale of ""right and wrong."" The story is heartbreaking morality play, about the choices that we find that we must make, even when we don't want to take a side, and none of them seem right. The musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams perfectly sets the stage. The actors played their parts to the hilt, so that you could barely say who was ""right"" and who was ""wrong."" I will be thinking about this story for a long, long time.<br/><br/>Talking about the soundtrack, you could be a blind person and not have to watch a frame; just sit and listen to the voices and the song: you would know the tale of love, longing and loss, right and wrong and how we sometimes try to do our best. And so often do our worst. <br/><br/>I have come to believe that people are all too often ""too terrible for words."" They are selfish, greedy, full of fear and hatred; they are self-centered and cruel... Then along comes those few people who aren't. And those are the ones we call Heroes and Saints.<br/><br/>This is one of the best films, acting, directing and soundtrack I've seen in a long, long time. Simply tremendous... it was almost ""three stories in one."" I wish it could have gone on longer as a sequel, as there is so much more to the story to tell. <br/><br/>This is a tale that takes us to the land of innocence, so long ago and far away, which still survives in spite of whatever errors or terrible deeds we do. There may still be hope for us all... * * * * *"
"Buddy-51","7","3","5","5 April 2008"," a nifty directorial debut
","Working for the first time on the opposite side of the camera, actor-turned-director Ben Affleck has delivered a solid, if imperfect, crime drama entitled ""Gone Baby Gone,"" based on the novel by Dennis Luhane. Ben's brother, Casey, and Michelle Monaghan play a pair of missing-persons investigators hired to find a little girl who disappeared from her Boston home three days earlier. Her mother is a foul-mouthed coke-fiend who is not very particular about the company she keeps and who seems strangely reluctant to cooperate with the authorities working to get her daughter back. Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris co-star as cops whose involvement with the case grows ever more complicated as the drama unfolds.<br/><br/>Affleck co-wrote the screenplay - his first since 1997's ""Good Will Hunting"" - with Aaron Stockard, and together they have gone beyond the surface simplicities of the standard whodunit to probe the ethical complexities that are, for good or for ill, an integral part of law enforcement work. As the central character, Patrick is continually confronted with the moral relativism of his actions, be it in negotiating with child abductors without police authority, shooting down an unarmed pedophile who has just murdered a child, or going after a crooked cop who reveals a legal indiscretion to him in a moment of drunken confidence. Yet, when all the murky details of the case are finally revealed, Patrick realizes that, when it comes to doing what's ""right,"" even he has a line over which he will not cross - even if, by refusing to do so, he loses the one thing that matters the most to him in his life. And yet there's still no guarantee that the choice he makes will be the best for all concerned in the end. As an over-arching theme, the film also points out how difficult it is to raise children in a world in which so many adults are themselves deeply troubled and maladjusted.<br/><br/>As director, Affleck has extracted fine performances from every member of his large cast, most notably Casey, Freeman, Harris, Amy Madigan and Amy Ryan, impressive enough to have earned an Oscar nomination for her work here.<br/><br/>The multi-layered script occasionally defies credibility and pushes too hard to make its points, but ""Gone Baby Gone"" is at least willing to explore the ethical uncertainties of life and to honor that stance by ending on a note of ambivalence and ambiguity. That alone makes it a rarity in commercial American film-making."

The look and feel of working class Boston is the best I've ever seen. He used a lot of locals, and it shows.

","When you read a comment like that, you might think that the movie brought on feelings of nostalgia for me or took me back to a place and time of some significant meaning. If you did think that, then you're dead wrong because what I really meant is that this movie is so ridiculously bad and mind-numbingly stupid that I had to dumb myself down to the level of a 13-year-old on crack to actually enjoy it. You see, it was 11:30 at night on a Sunday and I had contemplated going back to Blockbuster and bitch-slapping the cashier for not warning me about the rotten garbage I was about to expose my eyes to, but I was too tired so I decided to make fun of every line in the movie instead. And if you judge it by that scale, it ranks up there with every Jean Claude Van Damme movie ever made.<br/><br/>I love Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris, but they gotta do something good now to redeem themselves.<br/><br/>Maybe if Casey ""Same expression on his face at all times"" Affleck could speak like a human and not a midget with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, the movie would have been a bit better. I mean, you can't understand one damn word he says in the whole movie. Annunciate, you're an actor! And what exactly was the point of even having Michelle Monaghan's character in the movie? They could of cut her out completely and the movie would have been a valuable 18 or so minutes shorter. Believe me, no one would notice.<br/><br/>One thing the movie didn't have a shortage of was one liners and stupendously ridiculous comments at every turn. If I closed my eyes and tilted my head just so, I could hear Stallone moaning ""Yo Adrian"" followed by Schwarzenneger stating ""I'll be back!"" But then I remembered, those were actually entertaining movies so I knew it was just my imagination playing tricks on me.<br/><br/>Bottom line: I would rather have a root canal with a jackhammer while a diseased rat gnaws on my rectum than have to sit through this piece again.

","The ideas and questions of kidnapping and ethics presented in this film have great potential, but it folds under a weak script.

For the majority of its duration, I thought it would be something significant as the story was heading in that direction, but I was ultimately let down. <br/><br/>Story flaws aside, the dialogue is quite atrocious and the acting did nothing to help this. Afflec's inexperience shows itself most abundantly here. <br/><br/>The overall style comes off rather trite and exaggerated as well:<br/><br/>The music is too melodramatic <br/><br/>The Boston heritage is overdone<br/><br/>The voice-overs don't complement the story (the narrative voice-overs are unnecessary and the transition voice-overs are excessive)<br/><br/>And finally, the characters are uninteresting. With the exception of the little girl, I don't care about any of them. Deaths happen frequently, but I feel no emotion when someone hits the bucket. Rather than being characters with wills and souls of their own, they are players in a pre-destined plot. Morgan Freeman gives an excellent performance as usual, but this is the first film I've seen him in where I am apathetic to his fate and purpose. This is an important, powerful, and moving story.

I knew him from the Ocean's movies and from Gerry. I've heard he's brilliant in Jesse James, but now I've witnessed it for myself. He is the new one to watch of his generation. His performance was so nuanced, but so captivating. Every emotion played on his face and Ben gave him lots of close-ups so we could feel it. I completely believed in his character. I was also extremely impressed with Ben's directing abilities. Wow, he has really developed into a more-than-competent film director. Some scenes were so effective and held me in a trance. The scene where Patrick joins the cops in the raid on the house was beautiful, when the scene went silent and time stood still for those very long seconds. You felt every heartbeat in Patrick's chest. The cinematography was beautiful...such gorgeous and luscious shots of those downtrodden neighbourhoods. All the performances were first-rate; however, I do have to agree with some reviewers that Morgan Freeman seemed to be out of place. He is just too big for the small role that was bestowed upon him. Although I love Mr. Freeman, I think a lesser-known actor would have been more effective. Amy Ryan was spot-on as Helene. A brave performance with no hesitation to reveal every flaw and no clichéd attempts to redeem this pitiful woman. People don't change. I could go on and on.

I just watched it recently, and I thought it was pretty good. Showing a dark side of Boston, perhaps addressing corruption in the police, and perhaps addressing whether kids living in a bad situation should be removed from that, by any means necessary.
I had no issues with Casey Affleck's acting. Some reviews below have made mention of his diction or manner of speaking. I had no problems understanding him. His GF in the film seemed under-written, more like someone there to react to his decisions, rather than an important part of the film.
Ed Harris was his usual great self. Morgan Freeman as well, although in a lesser role.
The ending has also irked some of the reviewers below. The way I see it, many people ended up dying for no reason, maybe they weren't good people, but they died, all just to take this little girl out of her bad situation. Yes, she was returned to her mother in the end, but what message does it send if people with money and connections are able to decide the fate of whether a child should stay with a parent or not? The ending actually is more hopefully. While she is back with her neglectful mother, she has gained a stable male figure (Casey Affleck's character) in her life as well.
A pretty good drama thriller, as dark and dreary as it is, the ending is actually hopeful and reasonably 'happy'."

Unsurprisingly given it's from a Lehane novel, the twists and deep characterisations dovetail seamlessly with the very real feel of a Boston neighbourhood, the sense of place and community superbly marshalled by Ben Affleck (in what was his debut as a director). The story is so strong it makes us the viewers part of the search for missing Amanda, which in turn forces us to answer the ethical quandaries thrust upon Patrick Kenzie.<br/><br/>With tech credits firmly in the plus column and the director un-showy and assured enough to keep the key third act from dragging the picture down, this proves to be very good film making. Pic only has minor faults to be bothered by. Monaghan is a fine actress but she is hard to take here in a street wise role, though with a nicely cast Casey Affleck dominating their scenes she gets away with it. The sharp of mind should pick up on what is driving the mystery forward, whilst the ambiguity at resolution point can go either way for respective viewers appreciation or otherwise.

"Screen_Blitz","9","2","3","19 September 2017"," Gone Baby Gone is full of twists and turns that take you on a powerful, uncompromising journey of pain and deceit
","Ben Affleck has shed beautiful light on his talent as an actor on screen. But about his talent behind the camera? Making his directorial debut, Affleck crafts a dark and twisted tale about every parent's worst nightmare: the kidnapping of a child. Packed with unexpected twists and powerful emotional resonance to keep the heart pounding to its very last breath, Gone Baby Gone is an uncomfortably profound experience that dares to leave you convinced of the unsettling events that unfold on screen, the opening minutes of exposition, to the shocking twist of moral dilemmas and the blurred lines between right and wrong. By no means is this a comfortable picture to sit through. It is dark, grisly story where the moments are levity are as scarce as water in the desert. After all, the events are inspired by the novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane who also wrote 'Mystic River'. Set in Boston, the director's hometown, this film follows Patrick Kenzie (played by Casey Affleck, Ben's younger brother) and Angie Gennaro (played by Michelle Monaghan), two private detectives who are hired by Lionel (played by Titus Welliver) and Bea McCready (played by Amy Madigan) to go under investigation for their missing four-year-old niece Amanda, initially against the will of her drug-addicted mother (played by Amy Ryan). As the two dive deeper and deeper into the investigation, they are confronted with suspicious secrets involving local drug dealers, gang members, and the local law enforcement that leaves them questioning everything they about this case. <br/><br/>Thanks to Ben Affleck, this is a mystery/thriller that avoids following the tracks of a straightforward narrative, but instead drives its stories through misdirection and moral ambiguity to leave you questioning every character involved with this case. Although the story takes a while to pick up with its slow exposition during the first half, it powerfully builds up the layers of the characters and sets up for the rigid complexity of the story. Much of this pays off during the final stretch when the lead character Patrick and Angie are forced to confront against the demons that threaten their moral pedestals. And Affleck captures the events with pure grit and emotional magnitude with just enough tension leave viewers shivering in their seats. Setting the action in the middle-class Boston is perhaps no surprise as Affleck knows the town very well, but he also uses this location to great advantage by capturing the dour environment of a place riddled with crime, drugs, and prostitution. Once the events finally reach a conclusion, there is still a sense of uncertainty underlined by moral ambiguity of the characters. At the end, viewers are likely to find themselves divided on whether the character made the right decision or not. It comes to show that no goods come without punishment. As for Casey Affleck, he puts on a great performance. Though nothing I would consider Oscar-worthy, it effectively shows he has the acting chops he rarely gets the demonstrate unlike his older brother. Michelle Monaghan makes good use of her talent as well. Again, nothing that shouts for Oscars. Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris, unsurprisingly put on blissful performances. Arguably the most profound display in the roster is Amy Ryan who makes a convincing impression of a mother with a low-life persona who nonetheless is anxious of finding her daughter, even though her volatile personality does little to show it. The movie never lets any of its inspiring stars go to waste. <br/><br/>Gone Baby Gone is a profoundly riveting mystery/thriller with a patent of powerhouse performances, an uncompromising package of snappy twists and turns, and a surprisingly strong directorial efforts by Ben Affleck. It is not a pretty picture, it is a dark one bound to leave even the most desensitized viewers squirming in their seats. Bloody is also a word not worth leaving out. Above all, it proves Affleck has just as much charismatic talent behind the camera as does in front."
"resetzero","5","2","3","29 April 2017"," ""It just plays out like a short series of a TV show"".
","This movie is a good example of how a book can work poorly as a movie. Books don't work the same as movies. They're broken up into segments, and have multiple semi- climax points throughout, to keep the reader hooked in each chapter. To adapt a book to a movie, you kind've have to rewrite it, to make it flow better. I don't feel like this movie achieved that. It just plays out like a short series of a TV show. The way the main Casey Affleck's character moves from one case to another mid movie just stalls the progression of the story, and the little boy in the bath sequence didn't make any sense to be in the movie. I think it would've worked better if they stuck with the Amanda case the whole way through the movie, instead of going back and forward. It just made it confusing, and not interesting enough to try and work out.<br/><br/>Visually, this movie is nothing special. Similar to the story, its shot like an episode of CSI. There's nothing theatrical about this movie. No great sound design, no great cinematography, no real stunt work. It just seems like it was filmed quickly, cheaply, and executed poorly.<br/><br/>I will admit, in the end when the story finally comes together, it all makes sense, but by that point, it was just like ""yea, fine... it was him the whole time... next movie""."
"Gideon24","8","2","3","10 November 2016"," An unsettling but riveting story with a disturbing ending...
","The kidnapping of a little girl named Amanda McCready is the genesis for a dark and unapologetic drama from 2007 called Gone Baby Gone that offers disturbing surprises at every turn, rich with unsympathetic characters involved in an ugly story that literally had my stomach tied in knots for most of the running time.<br/><br/>Set in the sleepy little hamlet of Dorchester, Massachusetts, we learn that Amanda has been missing for 36 hours and the police investigation seems to have stalled. Amanda's aunt (Amy Madigan) hires Patrick (Casey Affleck) and Angie (Michelle Monaghan), investigators specializing in missing persons to aid in the investigation. Amanda's mother (Amy Ryan) is a drug addict who has been working as a drug mule to support her habit and her actions may have been directly behind Amanda's disappearance, but this is only the beginning of one of the most bizarre criminal conspiracy involving addiction and police corruption. This is another one of those movies that is very difficult to review without major spoilers.<br/><br/>More than anything, this film is a triumph for director and co- screenwriter Ben Affleck, who has mounted a story of stark realism where nothing is as it seems, most of the characters have hidden agendas and are not necessarily likable...this is the first film centered around a kidnapping that I recall where absolutely NO sympathy is evoked for the victim's mother...this woman appears to love her daughter and takes responsibility for what happens on the surface, but when we first meet her, she seems blissfully unconcerned and the picture of a woman who has no business being a parent.<br/><br/>As I've mentioned in other reviews, actors turned directors seem to have a knack for getting great performances from their actors and this film is no exception. Ben puts a lot of trust in brother Casey in a complex role and he absolutely commands the screen here and works well with Monaghan, a relationship we are on board with as we meet them but this story tears them apart. Solid support is provided by Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris, John Ashton, Titus Welliver, and especially Amy Ryan, in a gutsy and uncompromising performance that earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.<br/><br/>This film is not an easy watch, but it's worth the trouble and I promise that when you've finished watching this, if you're a parent, you will run immediately to your child and hug him forever."
"seymourblack-1","8","2","3","24 April 2015"," A Thought-Provoking Child Abduction Drama
","Child abduction dramas make unpleasant viewing for most parents, so it's particularly pleasing that in the case of this movie, anyone who gets over their reluctance to watch it will be richly rewarded by the thought-provoking way in which it addresses some difficult ethical questions, considers the role that conscience plays in people's decision-making and asks whether it can ever be right for individuals to take the law into their own hands. This is a movie that starts off very routinely but rapidly becomes extremely gripping as each new development unfolds.<br/><br/>When a 4-year-old girl goes missing from her home in the Dorchester neighbourhood of Boston and the police investigation doesn't produce any early results, the girl's aunt, Bea McCready (Amy Madigan) hires a couple of small-time local private investigators to assist with the search. Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and his business partner / girlfriend Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan), who normally specialise in missing persons cases, have very good connections in the area and are quickly able to gather information that discredits Helene McCready's (Amy Ryan) account of where she was on the evening when her daughter went missing.<br/><br/>The police officer in charge of the investigation, Captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) doesn't appreciate the involvement of Patrick and Angie but in accordance with his obligations, assigns Detective Sergeant Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Detective Nick Poole (John Ashton) to co-operate with the couple and share information. Single mother Helene McCready is a hard-drinking drug addict who, on the night of her daughter's disappearance, was with her boyfriend Skinny Ray Likanski (Sean Malone) and it soon becomes clear that they'd stolen some money from a local Haitian drug lord called Cheese (Edi Gathegi). Skinny Ray had been murdered shortly after the theft and after the detectives locate the stolen cash, they set up a meeting at a quarry with Cheese so that his money can be returned to him in exchange for the little girl.<br/><br/>Things go terribly wrong during the meeting when the girl seemingly falls from a great height into a pool at the bottom of the quarry and is apparently drowned. Captain Doyle (whose own daughter had been kidnapped and killed years earlier) accepts responsibility for what happened and takes early retirement from his job. The whole case is then regarded as wrapped-up but a number of discrepancies that Patrick recognises, lead him to continue his investigations until he discovers that the kidnapping and the theft of the drug money were all part of an elaborate conspiracy.<br/><br/>Patrick ultimately has to make a decision knowing that the course of action he takes will have a huge impact on the lives of Captain Doyle, Angie and himself as well as one other significant character in the story. The fact that he will have to live with the mixed results of his decision makes him do what his conscience dictates, even though this involves paying a high personal price for his actions.<br/><br/>Patrick is a man who sees right and wrong in very straightforward terms and satisfies his conscience by doing what he believes is right. Remy Bressant, on the other hand, can do something wrong and still have a clear conscience where he knows that the end justifies the means.<br/><br/>First-time director Ben Affleck shows great care and assurance in his work and is especially effective in making the depiction of a working-class area of Boston seem utterly convincing. He also brings out good performances from the entire cast with Amy Ryan (as the thoroughly obnoxious Helene) and Ed Harris providing the standout contributions."

","I found this movie to be well worth watching. It was perfectly cast and very believable. Being that Casey is from Massachusets he fit the lead characters role perfectly. I did have some difficulty understanding him at times, but I think that may have more to do with the microphones not necessarily being close enough to him when he spoke. I did not read the book, so don't know how close to the book the plot is, and I really don't care. I watched the movie to be entertained by a movie, not to compare it to a book.... The movie was well directed, scenes were very well done, with the exception perhaps at the quarry. I plan on watching again, which I seldom do, because I enjoyed it so much."

","A little girl is reported missing. Her name is Amanda MacReady and she is 4, she appears cute, innocent and photogenic – so her picture is all over the news, as is her mother Helene pleading for help. The local police are all over the case, lead by Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman), who has lost a child of his own.<br/><br/>Helene's brother Lionel and wife Bea are not as confident in the police's ability to track down their beloved niece, so at the urging of Bea they contact a local finder of missing people to assist in the search, hoping that local knowledge will help.<br/><br/>Enter Patrick (Casey Affleck) & Angela (Michelle Monaghan), a young couple in their early 30s who use their local contacts and smarts to track down people – though not normally children. Angela is especially reluctant to take the case, fearing what a negative outcome might do psychologically with a 4 year old involved.<br/><br/>Bea however is quite persuasive and frankly desperate for help, so they decide to have a quick look at Amanda's room and a quick chat with her Mum Helene before declining the job offer and this is where we learn quite a deal more than we had to this point.<br/><br/>It turns out that away from the cameras and sympathetic faces that Helene is a very different person indeed – in short she is a pointless waste of inferior DNA: a drunk, drugged, ignorant, neglectful, judgmental slut who at times genuinely expresses a desire to be reunited with her daughter, only on her terms and if she doesn't have to help out in any way.<br/><br/>Faced with this knowledge Patrick decides that Amanda deserves all the help she can get.<br/><br/>The Boston PD aren't initially helpful – Jack Doyle actively warns the young couple away from the case and expresses real reluctance to provide the assistance and co-operation that they are entitled to as Missing Person Detectives – but once it is obvious that the two are ""in"" a meeting is arranged with the two lead detectives on the case, Remy (Ed Harris) and Nick (Beverley Hills Cop's ""Taggert"" himself John Ashton). During the meeting once again it appears that Patrick is being mentally mocked by the more senior detectives until he gives the detectives a breakthrough that he sourced through discussions with some, let's say, ""colourful locals'. The breakthrough information disputes an earlier account made by Helene, so they all head back to reopen questioning.<br/><br/>The ensuing investigation takes the now quasi-quartet deep into the seedy underbelly of the Boston area, along the way they encounter drug users and dealers, thugs and general low-lives – most disturbingly the trail seems to lead to some known paedophiles that reside in the area. While Patrick is more streetwise than his missus Angie and shows a steely resolve and unwavering conviction regardless of what he is faced with, Angie is apparently witnessing the real world for the first time at its lowest ebb, and it would be fair to say that she is gobsmacked and somewhat out of her depth.<br/><br/>There are red herrings, dead ends galore and new developments to be dealt with. Just when it seems that they are closing in on the truth something – or someone – new pops up out of the blue to provide further confusion. Because we as the audience are discovering along with the investigators there is genuine interest and at times surprise as the truth gradually unravels.<br/><br/>Without detailing all the twists and turns I must point out one scene in particular which takes Patrick and an acquaintance deep into the underground, after a tense Silence of the Lambs style standoff the conclusion of the scene triggers events that escalate proceedings towards the conclusion.<br/><br/>Despite my trepidation at seeing the name Ben Affleck on the poster, and the somewhat depressing subject matter, I love Gone Baby, Gone. The dialogue is gritty and realistic, the performances uniformly great, especially Ben's little bro Casey, who as it is mentioned in the film does look incredibly young, but proves both as a character and an actor that impressions can be very deceiving. This young bloke already has a very impressive body of work on the CV, and without the matinée good looks seems destined for a fine career as a character actor or supporting player.<br/><br/>On first viewing a couple years back I immediately felt that this was an especially impressive film but I thought the plot took maybe one twist too many. A second exposure to the film uncovered a wrinkle I had earlier missed, with full understanding came an even greater appreciation.<br/><br/>I watched The Town recently and was once again impressed by Affleck's script selection and direction, The Town is a fine film – but this film is a mile better than The Town. I truly believe that if Affleck used an alias on the poster this would have received even greater acclaim and might even be seen as the decade's companion piece to Memento or Children of Men – Gone Baby, Gone is THAT good.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 9 / 10. A labyrinthine plot, excellent performances and uniform credibility across the board make Gone Baby, Gone one of the top films of the last decade. (And Phantoms was the BOMB Yo!)"
"Movie_Reviewer_from_LA","7","2","3","24 January 2011"," When is the right thing the wrong thing?
","Ben Affleck, who proved he could write, with the Oscar-winning ""Good Will Hunting"", and act, with ""Hollywoodland"", now demonstrates a remarkable flair for directing, as well, in the superb ""Gone Baby Gone"". This gripping 'lost child' drama, cutting through the layers of lower-income South Boston, displays amazing sensitivity, and Oscar-caliber performances by a top-notch cast.<br/><br/>Adapted from Boston novelist Dennis Lehane's best-selling novel, the film unapologetically views a neighborhood crushed by poverty, alcoholism, and drug addition, yet clinging to a stubborn pride. When a little girl disappears, the child's aunt (Amy Madigan), frustrated by the slow progress of dedicated cop Morgan Freeman, hires local detective team Casey Affleck (Ben's brother) and Michelle Monaghan to join in the search. Despite only cursory assistance from the detectives handling the case (Ed Harris and John Ashton), Affleck discovers a web of lies and deceit, starting with the child's drug addict mother (Oscar-nominated Amy Ryan). As the layers of deception unravel, questions of integrity and 'best interest' are raised, lifting the film far above a simple detective story! In many ways, Affleck's 'Patrick Kenzie' is a descendant of film detectives of the past, from Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe, to Lew Harper; a man with a code of honor and unshakable integrity, hidden beneath a flippant exterior, facing a world where morality and truth are colored in shades of gray. It is a nearly impossible situation, and Casey Affleck is extraordinary in the role, capturing the anguish of a man whose virtues might destroy any hope of happiness. Equally good are Monaghan, combining beauty, stability, and humanity, and Harris, whose true character unfolds gradually, in a remarkable acting tour-de-force.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck's compassion and deep devotion to the people of the grittier side of Boston makes him an ideal storyteller, and provides an authenticity to each scene that only a 'native' could provide. This certainly doesn't 'feel' like the first production of a novice filmmaker...<br/><br/>Bravo, Ben!"
"D-Hillman75","9","2","3","2 January 2011"," extremely powerful drama
","I was never much of a fan of either Ben or Casey Affleck, and so originally had no desire to see this film. But I kept hearing good things about it, and so tuned in one afternoon when I saw that it was on TV, coming in midway through the film. I watched about five minutes before turning the TV off -- not because I didn't like what I saw, but because I was so impressed that I wanted to order the film and watch it from the beginning. I wasn't disappointed; this is the film that made me a fan of both Afflecks.<br/><br/>Casey is terrific as the gumshoe searching for a missing little girl through the gritty, dangerous streets of a very blue-collar Boston neighborhood, sticking his nose into places where he is so obviously not welcome. Ben Affleck's direction is incredibly deft, patient, and subtle. There are a myriad of twists and turns, not just in the plot but in the characters themselves; everyone has a dark side and even most of the so-called bad guys have understandable, even noble motivations. <br/><br/>This is a drama but be forewarned: there are several bursts of very graphic violence and the language is very, very rough. There are no easy, pat, Hollywood-type solutions to this film, either, and some viewers may be frustrated by the ending, but that's exactly one of the reasons that I found it so satisfying; it feels messy and real. One of the best crime dramas that I've ever seen."
"teo-sun","9","2","3","26 November 2010"," The real dark of a soul lies beneath the surface.
","This is the first movie that shows the art of direction of an ex-blockbuster actor like Ben Affleck, and, i must say, i'm really impressed. Based on another stunning novel by American author Dennis Lehane, ""Gone Baby Gone"" is a cold,sad,moving and unpredictable masterpiece in his genre. Affleck stars his brother Casey in the role of a young private investigator chasing the kidnappers of a little girl, daughter of a drug addict. The movie unfold slowly on the dark side. The cast is perfect and the direction of Ben can show us the multiple faces of Boston, of his people, with the voice of Casey that explain us, like a guide to tourists, how people lives, how people struggle in his neighborhood, without hope, without color, in a twilight-zone existence, and the truth is far from easy... A movie that rise from the others of his genre because has the ability to move different ideas, deep thoughts in the finale. It's not easy to direct a movie like that, it's not easy to use a topic so delicate yet so dark like kidnappings, but here Affleck shows that he can truly amaze us, so that we can breathe the real atmosphere of a plastic reality where the real life, the real problems, the real dark lies beneath our smiling faces.<br/><br/>Go see it if you haven't yet. This is a must see. My word. A+++"

","There's nothing better than a noir or detective plot done well. The thrill of the chase, that impenetrable web of mystery, those brave private investigators who carve their way through labyrinths of deceit, bad guys and double crosses. It's just so damn juicy when done well.<br/><br/>""Gone Baby Gone"" isn't a great film – first time director Ben Affleck is still learning the ropes – but its got a script that knows how to jerk its audience around and is filled with some great performances, most notably young Casey Affleck in the lead. Casey, so great in ""The Assassination of Jesse James"", charms us with his lopsided grin, his guttural voice and kind face. He and his girl are our Bogarts, and together they work their way through the film's mystery (the kidnapping and potential murder of a child) with workmanlike efficiency.<br/><br/>7.9/10 – Author Dennis Lehane wrote both ""Mystic River"" and ""Gone Baby Gone"", both films trying to examine the effects of a shocking crime on a close knit community. ""Mystic River"" may have better production design and a more palatable sense of tragedy, but ""Gone Baby Gone"" has a better lead hero in Casey Affleck. He's a humble and likable private investigator, immediately endearing. <br/><br/>Still, this is old school mystery fiction. The true noirs of today are such widely different films as ""Inland Empire"", ""The Wire"", ""Mulholland Drive"", ""Eyes Wide Shut"", ""Boarding Gate"", ""Miami Vice"", ""Girlfriend Experience"" etc, all offering a far more sensual world of overlapping labyrinths and unresolved conflicts. They are noir as globalized conflict, whilst fare like ""Mystic River"", ""Gone Baby Gone"", ""Zodiac"" etc are decidedly retro.<br/><br/>Worth one viewing. Though excellent for a debut, once you know the film's outcome, director Ben Affleck's aesthetic isn't seductive enough to keep us coming back for second helpings."

"ctomvelu-1","7","2","3","3 August 2008"," Depressing crime thriller
","In GONE BABY GONE, director Ben Affleck does a bang-up job with a difficult novel adaptation. If you spot similarities to MYSTIC RIVER, it's because the author (Dennis Lehane) is the same and the setting is almost identical. In South Boston, a little girl goes missing and a private eye (Casey Affleck) is called in by her aunt (Amy Madigan). Affleck and his partner/lover (Sandra Bullock lookalike Michelle Monaghan) are more used to tracing skips, but he decides to take the case against his partner's advice. In the middle of the case, another child is snatched and a known child rapist appears to be the culprit. But did he also snatch the first child? Before the movie is over, almost everyone involved will be damaged or dead and have their lives turned upside down. Casey Affleck, a surprising choice for the lead much in the way Owen Wilson was for ENEMY DOWN, is supported by veteran actors Morgan Freeman as the police captain and Ed Harris and John Ashton as a pair of grizzled police detectives. This movie is not for the faint of heart. It is bloody, extremely vulgar and comes to a very disturbing end that many are likely to find unsatisfying -- much like the ending of MYSTIC RIVER. That's Lehane for ya, and Ben Affleck at least had the courage to end the movie the way the book ended. For the guys, there is a hell of a scary, ultra-realistic shootout in the second half. The rest of the film is mostly talk, although interest never flags."
"bandw","7","2","3","30 July 2008"," Raises significant questions
","This movie plays as a police procedural and thriller, but what propels it are the underlying moral questions it asks. Is it all right to kill (well, actually murder) a depraved pedophile who himself has just killed a seven year old boy? Is diverting captured drug money to a good cause acceptable? Is it better to return an abducted four year old child to her drug-addicted excuse for a mother, or clandestinely spirit her away to a better home? These are some of the questions faced by private investigator Patrick Kenzie and his partner, and lover, Angie Gennaro as they investigate the disappearance of a small girl from a lower-class Boston neighborhood.<br/><br/>Director Affleck clearly has a feel for the rhythms, and sometimes even the beauty, of this Boston neighborhood which provides an authentic backdrop for the story. But the proceedings are convoluted and ultimately not believable. Did all of the (well-meaning) conspirators really think that they could get away with their plans?<br/><br/>Ed Harris turns in a dramatic performance as a cop working with Kenzie; Michelle Monaghan is fine as Kenzie's partner, although she is not given much to do; Morgan Freeman has limited screen time and, at this point in his career, he can toss off a performance like this as easily as Tiger Woods makes birdies. Then we come to Casey Affleck. I think he has a chance of being one of our better actors, but I felt he was miscast here. He has a unique screen presence that suggests powerful emotions beneath his controlled exterior. Some have complained of his mumbling, but that speech pattern seemed appropriate to me. What I had a hard time with was his youthful, preppy appearance that stood in stark contrast to his tough guy character who was on congenial terms with a number of bad-asses. The film tried to exploit this disconnect, but it didn't work for me, since Casey Afleck projects no menace. I think this role calls for someone like a De Niro or Nicholson."

Harris was exquisite as some kind of godlike knight in the guise of the epitome of a hard bitten cop. I usually hate cops as a matter of principle, but Harris really had me going there. And WHO was that guy playing the ex-alcoholic uncle? He was so authentic he just blew me away. He had a pivotal role in this movie and whoever hired him should be commended for choosing him for the part.<br/><br/>BUT : There were parts of the movie where what the actors said was hard to hear, and this is definitely the only reason for me giving it a nine instead of a ten. Affleck should get his pipes operated on, because he shows much promise as an actor, but he sounds like a cat with his throat cut being introduced to the dark side of vise grips. And through all this noise, I never got to hear WHO was that little girl in the bathtub. Where did she come from? If that isn't explained away satisfactorily, the whole movie's just another cheap sham and crumbles away.<br/><br/>Excusing this anomaly, putting it down to the defective sound quality and going on with it, I really was drawn in. I watched it at home and the ending had me swearing, gnashing my teeth and furiously pounding the table. That's exactly what a good movie should do.<br/><br/>Just before the credits, when Affleck's character does his ""benevolent watcher"" bit, if you had given me a free ticket to smoke some people, nobody would have come out of that house alive but the little girl.<br/><br/>""God protect us from other people's good intentions"" should be the tagline for this movie.<br/><br/>Definitely one of my ""might buy"" DVDs.

"fwomp","9","2","3","20 February 2008"," Team Affleck
","I think it's safe to say that Ben Affleck may belong behind the camera rather than in front of it. With such disasters as SURVIVING Christmas, JERSEY GIRL, and the shockingly bad GIGLI {shiver!}, he's not the best leading guy. His only saving graces as an actor have been GOOD WILL HUNTING, DOGMA (saved by the dialogue), and HOLLYWOODLAND (his best performance to date).<br/><br/>Directed and co-written by Ben, GONE BABY GONE shows a talent previously unknown to him (or us!) But another Affleck has appeared on the screen and his supplanting of Ben was cemented this year with his rock solid performances here and in THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD. I'm speaking, of course, about Ben's younger brother Casey. Young, hip, handsome, and with a broad range of abilities, Casey has proved himself to be a stellar young actor. His portrayal here in Gone Baby Gone as private detective Patrick Kenzie was superb, showing us a delicate looking guy with a tough interior.<br/><br/>The story, too, is fascinating in that it makes the audience think about life's choices. When a child is kidnapped from her home, everyone is a suspect. Two police detectives named Remy Bressant (Ed Harris, A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE) and Nick Poole (John Ashton) are suspiciously too close to the case, and even Patrick is eventually shown how upstanding yet corrupt they can be. The abducted child's mother, Helene McCready (Amy Ryan, LOOKING FOR COMEDY IN THE Muslim WORLD) is seen as a drugged out slut who seems to care little for her missing child. Did she have anything to do with the disappearance? Time and again the audience is shown multiple possibilities and sometimes it's easy to figure out that someone was involved in dubious activities. But if they were involved in the child's abduction remains foggy up until the very end.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman (10 ITEMS OR LESS) plays Captain Jack Doyle, the person responsible for the local missing children's investigations. Always a strong presence, Mr. Freeman is seen as the uptight yet extremely respectable lawman who finds himself in the wrong place at the right time. His ""involvement"" may come as a complete surprise to many.<br/><br/>This is a great drama with many tense moments that'll have you squirming in your seat, wondering if the poor little girl is dead, or perhaps wishing that she were so that this torture would end (after seeing what a pedophile is capable of later in the film, one begins to get this sickly feeling).<br/><br/>Ben Affleck is to be commended for directing such a taught series of events that lead and mislead with just enough finesse to keep audiences guessing. It's also a great take on morality and what that entails. Sometimes doing the right thing is the wrong thing ...as weird as that sounds. It is our decisions that make us who we are and bind us to futures we may not feel comfortable with. This is something that is brought out to impeccable perfection at the end of the film as we watch Parick (Casey Affleck) sit on a couch and stare blankly at a television set. The pain and satisfaction of it all is who's sitting next to him."
"robert-temple-1","1","8","21","28 June 2008"," Horrifying child abduction drama
","Sometimes reality impinges on fantasy. While this film was being made, Maddy McCann was abducted. By a strange quirk of fate, the four year old girl abducted in this film looks like an identical twin of Maddy McCann. Can you get more disturbing than that? Sensitive souls should not try to watch this film, as they will not be able to take it. This is really, really heavy stuff. Most of the characters in this film are either drug takers or drug dealers. We have here the famous American Underclass. If you are into cocaine, this will all be familiar to you perhaps. Just about everyone in the movie is disgusting and revolting in some way, sometimes to such an extent you think the impossible has been achieved: the film might be described as vomit-as-celluloid. The various murders and mutilations are not necessarily shown in the fullest grisly detail, so hurrah for a tiny bit of restraint. This film was written by Ben Affleck and stars his brother Casey Affleck, who is really extremely good, and the only moral character in the story. He has however a bizarre girlfriend payed by Michelle Monaghan, who looks just like Michael Jackson except that her eyes are so wide apart they look like ears. She spends most of the film hanging back, looking disapproving, dropping out, and throwing a wet blanket on everything. Lots of negative energy there, and a major script and directorial weakness, and frankly a bad actress. With the exception of old pro Morgan Freeman, everybody in this film mumbles so badly that nearly half of the dialogue is incomprehensible. Even old pro Ed Harris delivers a long drunken speech which he forgets to articulate, so we only get half of that too. I don't know what's wrong with the sound technicians these days. I think they have had their brains removed and implanted headphones in their place. Once a director stood by the camera during shooting and would have noticed everybody was mumbling, but ever since they started sitting in chairs and gazing into TV monitors and call that directing, they don't notice anything but how the shot is framed. Big deal! The story of this film is fantastically clever and complex, and ends up being more shocking even than the two child abductions. The story also deals with genuinely profound moral dilemmas in an honest way. It was earnest in intent. But the reason why the film is terrible is that it is a vision of unremitting hell and we have enough of that already, thank you very much, Affleck brothers. Why not make something pleasant to watch sometime? Wouldn't that make a change?"

","""Gone Baby Gone"" follows two Boston area detectives investigating a little girl's kidnapping, which ultimately turns into a crisis both professionally and personally.<br/><br/>This film cemented Ben Affleck's career as a director and a storyteller, and very rightfully so.<br/><br/>Long after I had finished watching the film, the main thematic question lingered in my mind, which is a merit to how much of an impact the film makes on the viewer - especially with strong imagery used to portray these theme-defining moments.<br/><br/>Mainly, the choices that we consciously make - what is right and what is wrong? Or are they just choices that we have to make, then live with the consequences (which is easier said than done) ...<br/><br/>Set in a run-down Bostonian environment, the milieu feels very authentic in the way it shows the people living here and their short tempers - which is obviously influenced by Ben Affleck's own Bostonian background. It was refreshing to see him having translated his experiences of the borough onto the film so well.<br/><br/>The performances of Casey Affleck, Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman are most commendable in this film - allowing the audience to empathize with their characters' actions despite the shades of grey we see in them.<br/><br/>The scenes that unfold the plot succeed in conveying the sense of suspense, distrust and ultimately disturbance that would come from investigating a case such as this - and make excellent use of the characters to make these situations tense and unpredictable.<br/><br/>Unlike my usual habit of thinking about a film's flaws after watching it, the only flaw I could think of here was the prominence of Michelle Monaghan's character (or lack of it). Being one of the two detectives mentioned in the premise, we never really see her do any detective work. Casey Affleck's character does all of the investigating, leaving her character sidelined, hence severely underused. Her only importance comes at the end where the protagonist has to make a major choice which would affect their relationship.<br/><br/>But this flaw comes nowhere close to hampering the experience of watching this appreciable film."

","Gone Baby Gone appears to be about to end at four different points but then veers off with a new twist. My impression is that something as surprising and ingenious as Chinatown (PolanskiÂ´s ending) was being aimed at here, but the execution was not nearly so convincing. That said, it is a thought-provoking film, raising a variety of interesting questions about justice.<br/><br/>Should (imdb will not allow me to write this word? what?) who kill their victims be summarily executed by vigilantes? Should people who kidnap children in an effort to help them be subjected to the same penalties as those who kidnap children for nefarious purposes?

"ma-cortes","7","1","1","19 March 2020"," Nice and well played thriller with a lot of surprises, twists and turns
","Good thriller, though some downbeat, adapted from a novel written by Dennis Lehane. Here Ben Affleck gives a top-notch directorial debut. When little Amanda goes missing, despair emerges and hopes are dim. She is from a noisy neighbourhood where residents are not disposed to talk to the cops who are investigating the case : Ed Harris, John Ashton under superior orders to Police chief : Morgan Freeman. While her druggie mummy : Amy Ryan, has incurred the wrath of a drug kingpin. Those are reasons enough for Amanda's devoted uncle :Titus Welliver and aunt : Amy Madigan to contract a young team of private detectives , the soft-spoken, wry Patrick Kenzie : Casey Affleck, and enjoyable Angie Gennaro : Michelle Monaghan. But then things go awry when the investigation deepens with turns as well as twists, where doing the right thing begins to look all wrong and viceversa.<br/><br/>A decent thriller steeped in the unkillable grudges , continuous betrayals , compelling ambiguities, dark secrets and tribal loyalties of South Boston. All of them finish into an astonising ending, in a conclusion puzzle-solving development that turns to be convoluted and surprising, at the same time. Main cast and support cast are very well. Casey affleck, director's brother, is terrific. He is the film's backbone playing the obstinate eye private, being helped by his colleague and girlfriend, Michelle Monaghan in an inert role, both of them carry out the deep investigation that ends up into fateful consequences. Ed Harris is fantastic as the cynical, squinty police inspector who investigates the case along with the forgotten secondary of the 80s John Ashton. Of course, the great Morgan Freeman as the heartbroken police chief who knows sorrow all too well. But is Amy Ryan who steals the show as the junkie mother, she creates a role who is at once pathetic and fearsome.<br/><br/>It displays an evocative and dark, at times, cinematography by the fine professional cameraman John Toll. As well as thrilling and stirring musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams. The motion picture was competently directed by the famous actor and director Ben Affleck, though it has some flaws and it results to be a little depressing and disagreeable. Ben Affleck is a good actor who has starred a lot of big boxoffice movies as Suicide squad, Smokin' aces, Paycheck, Daredevil, The company men, Armageddon , Pearl Harbor, Good Will Hunting. He has also directed a few and well-deemed films, such as Live by night, The Town, Gone baby gone and his greatest hit : Argo that had seversl Academy Awards. Rating 7/10. Better than average. Worthwhile watching."

Weather or not they find this little girl alive, if at all, is going to be up to you to find out, you're going to have to watch, and trust me, it will be worth your time. It's going to have one of those endings that's going to be debatable between two viewers who are going to agree or disagree. Sometimes, people do the wrong things for the right reasons. In general, kidnapping is wrong. The film is carefully handled, has a smooth pace, great dialogue, and a controversial but satisfying ending.

","'Gone Baby Gone' is one of the strongest and most realistic mystery/drama films of the last decade. It is often difficult to buy into the storyline of films like this, either because they are too far- fetched, or the plot isn't properly developed. This isn't the case with 'Gone Baby Gone', it is very well-written and the characters all feel very realistic.<br/><br/>This is a drama film more than anything and there is a lot of emphasis on the dialogue. The viewer has to pay attention to pick up on plot developments and the film has some very good and well-timed twists.<br/><br/>I was impressed and thought that 'Gone Baby Gone' was a good film all round, with a convincing and well-constructed plot and an interesting and realistic bunch of characters."

","Our choices make our realities, either good or bad. The question is; what is really good or bad? Is the world black or white? Can there be grey areas? These are the type of questions you will be asking yourself after watching this magnificent film.<br/><br/>Gone Baby Gone is based on Dennis Lehane's Mystic River. It follows two Boston private investigators that are given the case of missing 4-year old Amanda McCready. During the investigation, the private investigators work with Boston detectives in hope of finding Amanda alive and well.<br/><br/>To my shocking, this film marks the directorial debut of Ben Affleck. I have to say, he did more than a great job. Ben's brother, Casey Affleck, and Michelle Monaghan star as the private investigators. They both were authentic in their acting. The acting all around was very realistic which I believe is vital to this story.<br/><br/>Speaking of realistic, the montages of urban Boston were extremely authentic. The extras used looked like they lived in the streets of Boston their whole life. This really made me feel the story was real and I was watching it unfold right before my eyes.<br/><br/>The writing in this film is wonderful. It kept me on edge and had me thinking, there has to be more, something just doesn't seem right. The actors did a great job of portraying the story line. I like how despite Casey being a ""young looking fellow"" and presumably under qualified, according to the detectives, he had the guts to question everything, even when it could cost him his life.<br/><br/>Overall this is a great mystery that you deserve to unfold. This film questions morality and exploits human behavior. I loved this film and I bet you will too."

REALLY splendid and well worth the ""price of admission"" even if the story is nothing special. Wonderful cinematography also makes this a film worth viewing.

","I saw this after watching Argo as I became interested in Affleck's work as a director. This movie is pretty well done, so I give Affleck kudos for good direction. Obviously Ryan is amazing. Much of the acting is very good. I was not very impressed with Casey Affleck or Michele Monaghan who basically play the two leads. There are stronger actors out there than these two that could have conveyed much more heart to two complicated characters.<br/><br/>The ""meh"" in my title largely stems from such an implausible plot!! We have a little blond girl whose abduction is major local news for weeks. We are to expect that she has a chance to live in anonymity with an older couple without anyone noticing that suddenly they have a child and she looks an awful lot like that girl from the news? Sorry, I cannot suspend my disbelief to that extent. I understand that was true to the novel, but it was a bit hard for me to swallow.<br/><br/>The ending is great. I know people are really mixed on it, but I just thought it was so powerful. I probably would recommend this film. It's entertaining and well acted."

","So am I the only one on God's green earth who thinks Casey Affleck's acting in this movie was pitiful? Honestly...I almost turned the movie off after his totally pathetic scene in the bar where he tries to make you think he can actually kick a drunkard's ass! But, like a trooper, I kept watching and thinking to myself ""it can't get any worse"". What saves the movie is the wonderful story-line, and the supporting cast members (namely Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman, and Amy Ryan). Casey's acting was totally forgettable to me in this movie. With all of that said, I did give him a second chance in the Assassination of Jesse James. I had a TOTALLY different reaction to his acting abilities in this movie. I thought he was wonderful, convincing, and well deserving of the Oscar consideration. Honestly...you have to ask yourself one question about Gone Baby Gone. Would Casey have gotten this part if big brother wasn't directing it? Like the judges always say on American Idol...""pick the song that defines you"". That song for Affleck was The Assassination of Jesse James, not Gone Baby Gone. Just keeping it real dog."

","What kept me glued was the consistency of Patrick's character. As indicated by the opening voice-over, he was seeking to save his soul even as he walked among characters ruined by corruption. Patrick is something of a saint without conventional piety, or at least none shown here, willing to make hard choices and willing to take the consequences. At the end. I am left convinced that the child has acquired a guardian angel who will do whatever he can to make sure no harm comes to her but with no certainly that he will succeed. Affleck is certainly superior to his brother as an actor, but I think that even Ben could have made Patrick convincing. Director Affleck obviously has a lot to learn, but he has made a damn good movie. Many of those above have pointed out things he could have done better, but the actors save him from some of his mistakes, and the end result is worthy of real praise. I agree he has found his proper niche, but he is also beginning to find his feet as an actor and--it seems--as a person."

","""Gone Baby Gone"" is a well done mystery. But it's slow to thrill you and doesn't put you on the edge of your seat, though you will be guessing things to the very end. But the filmmakers give you something else to take from this film besides a mystery. A clue to this should be the gentle narration at the beginning of the film from Patrick Kenzie, played by Casey Affleck, talking about how he knows everyone. We see flashes of people in a Massachusetes neighborhood, with Patrick going up and greeting them. It's an excellent setup for Patrick's down to earth tactics in approaching his cases - and for his general principles.<br/><br/>""Gone Baby Gone"" is ultimately a morality tale. It's a society tale as well. The main conflict in the story revolves around the disappearance of a little girl named Amanda. Patrick and his girlfriend Michelle are hired to investigate the disappearance of the girl. Their reactions to the case are key to the story. In many ways, the heart of the story is reaction to such atrocities.<br/><br/>For those reactions, we are given several views, from the victimized parents, to the neighbors, to the different police officers attached to the case, including the hard, veteran Detective Remy, played with precision by Ed Harris and the police Captian Doyle, a minor but pivotal role for Morgan Freeman. Ben Affleck uses this palette of characters to paint a painful morality tale about children in society.<br/><br/>This is a film about children. It's about our sometimes condescending views towards parents and asks the question what would you do when you see that sort of injustice. Working in a field involving children, this film struck a chord. Ben Affleck directs the film as if looking for a right answer to injustices against children without burying the film in manipulative sentiment. It's an insightful affair and a good vehicle for Casey Affleck as actor and good feature directorial debut for big brother Ben."

","I must admit, I have never rated Ben Affleck as an actor, but at least he does manage to speak in an intelligible manner. This is not the case with his little brother Casey, who is so urgently in need of diction lessons that I had difficulty understanding anything he said. Such was the extent of his ineptitude, that I was obliged to read the subtitles in French so that I could decipher his incoherent, garbled mumbling.<br/><br/>This dirty, seedy, depressing film, peopled with unpleasant individuals and peppered with foul language left me feeling sullied, and debased. The script, which felt contrived, was far too steeped in crude, base American ""gutter talk"" and contained more gratuitous expletives than I can remember in any film, even surpassing ""Goodfellas"", for example.<br/><br/>An ""in your face"", graphic representation of the low-life culture of Boston's seediest neighbourhoods; it makes for a miserable film which should be immediately consigned to the garbage bin, never to re-emerge. The only saving graces were the solid performances by Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman, who can always be relied upon to produce the goods.<br/><br/>Watching this film, and also Affleck's last film, Smokin' Aces (which was also atrocious to my mind) it is hard to believe that this is the same person who gave us such a magnificent film as Good Will Hunting in 1997, for which he wrote the script (together with Matt Damon), and for which he rightly received an Oscar.<br/><br/>Whereas Good will Hunting was a film to raise the human spirit, to restore faith in human nature's triumph over adversity, Gone Baby Gone is the exact opposite. It debases the human sprit, dragging us down to the lowest common denominator, where phrases stuffed with foul expletives are the height of eloquence; where the main characters have a vocabulary of no more than a few hundred words, and where depravity, cruelty and perversion are the norm.<br/><br/>Having swallowed the hype surrounding this film, I had been really looking forward to seeing it. The great Ben Affleck's directing debut, the coincidental parallels with the ""Missing Maddie"" case in Portugal, etc. However, it didn't take long for disappointment to set in - closely followed by disgust.<br/><br/>No, I didn't like this film very much, and the sooner Hollywood stops making films like this, the better.

"WriterDave","9","4","9","29 October 2007"," Masterfully Crafted Descent into White Trash Hell
","In some ways, ""Gone Baby Gone"" plays like a horror film. It depicts a seedy world full of drug dealers, murderers, corrupt cops, pedophiles, child killers, and down-on-their-luck Bostonians trapped in an urbanized ""white trash"" hell where the two African-American characters, a Haitian drug lord and a noble police chief (Morgan Freeman), wield the most power from opposite sides of the law. Director Affleck showers his hometown with humanistic shots of everyday people milling about, seemingly minding their own business, while their world decays and rots around them. The socio-political subtexts of ""Gone Baby Gone"" tick quietly like a time-bomb underneath the surface of an otherwise rote crime flick about the race to find a missing four year-old girl. I imagine this deep, dark, and morally questionable under-pinning is what has kept mainstream audiences from connecting with the film while critics have hailed it as a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Adapted from a Dennis Lehane novel (author of the similarly themed and depressing ""Mystic River""), ""Gone Baby Gone"" is masterfully crafted from the opening shot to the closing scene. Ben Affleck proves to be a far better talent behind the screen than in front of it, and while the casting of his younger brother in the lead role may seem like nepotism, Casey Affleck gives a richly complex performance as the private eye who uncovers the truth behind the kidnapping of the little girl. The dialog, strung poetically with grim and vulgar Bostonian street-talk, reminded me of ""Good Will Hunting."" With Ben Affleck credited as a co-screenwriter here, this film disproves the popular myth that Matt Damon (or an unnamed third party) was the primary force behind their Oscar-winning screenplay for ""Good Will Hunting."" <br/><br/>Like the best of the actors-turned-directors (Robert Redford, or ""Mystic River"" maestro Clint Eastwood), Ben Affleck is able to get his cast to deliver amazingly rich performances oozing with pathos. Ed Harris, who sometimes over-acts in one-note fashion, is a powerhouse as the lead officer on the case and delivers quite possibly the best performance of his career; his character's seething rage and fractured view of justice will leave you literally shaking. Amy Ryan, as the strung-out mother of the girl, delivers the type of pitch-perfect portrayal that the Supporting Actress Oscar was tailor made for. Casey Affleck, following his great turn in ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" shows that he is an actor to be reckoned with, raw and emotive, and equal or superior in many ways to contemporaries like Ryan Gosling. Older brother Ben is such an actor's director, he even manages to deliver a heartbreaking scene towards the end where Michelle Monaghan (in the otherwise thankless role of girlfriend and partner to the male lead) displays a range you didn't see coming.<br/><br/>For the acting, for the dialog, for the intricately complex and devastating crime drama that unfolds, and yes, for the directing, ""Gone Baby Gone,"" as depressing a piece of subversion as it is, ranks as one of the year's very best."

It ultimately deals with a moral dilemma, which I cannot discuss without utterly spoiling the film. Suffice it to say that Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan do a terrific job as well as Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman and a host of smaller role players that helped Ben Affleck to create so genuine a film. Possible spoiler occurs here- I loved the final scene in the film as the camera pans away and the viewer is left to think what is going through the head of the Casey Affleck character at that moment just after a doll's name is revealed to be Annabelle instead of Mirabelle.

This one easily trumps Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"". but is definitely not a movie for everyone. Prudes will be turned off by the language and the lifestyles portrayed. But all things considered, this flick is about as real can get. The earthiness of ""Southie"" is palpable and Amy Ryan's performance makes you want to just reach out and slap Helene McCready across the kisser. Casey Affleck was born for the role of Patrick Kenzie and I hope to see him again in 'Darkness Take My Mind,' or some other vintage Le Hane thriller. Michelle Monoghan makes a delicate but perceptive Angie Gennaro and Ed Harris turns in one of, if not his very best as a burned out veteran detective. Amy Ryan gives an Oscar worthy performance as the 'Slut Supreme', Helene McCready. Morgan Freeman, though thoroughly admirable in the role of police captain, seems out of place in an environment historically not given to racial tolerance, despite the name Doyle.

I have to say, rarely do movies ever affect me in such a way that they stay with me long after the credits have rolled. There have been very few. But Gone Baby Gone is one of those movies. It is one of the best movies I have seen in a while. The acting and directing are superb. Casey Affleck is quickly becoming one of the best young actors in Hollywood. He is very convincing as a ""no nonsense, doesn't take any crap off of anyone"" person who will stop at nothing to get to the truth of the matter. And Ben Affleck just may have found out what it is he is destined to do. Although he is passable as an actor, his strength is clearly in screen writing and behind the camera. He has created what I consider to be an almost masterpiece here. The end of this film is the most bitter-sweet conclusion I have ever seen. The decision that Affleck's character is forced to make can all be boiled down to one word...integrity. He had it, and he made the decision that was right. There's a famous saying that rings true here: Most of the time the hard thing to do, and the right thing to do are the same. This movie hammers home that idea forcefully. And it's easily one of the five best movies of 2007."
"Milky-Sheep","10","3","6","3 April 2008"," The Most Important Movie Ever Made
","I can some this up in one word... AMAZING! It is the movie I have waited my whole life to see, it is the best motion picture I have ever seen. Ben Affleck has gone from joke, to the best thing since sliced bread, he has crafted a film that in 30 years I will be telling my children about, and while they will be bragging out Saw 35, I will be telling them about the cold day in which I was sick as a dog and I sat on my couch and watched the best movie that was ever made, and how it made me feel human, it made me feel that not everything is bad in this world, that people with a lil common sense and heart can make the right decisions, that this is a movie that needs to be viewed by everybody and quite possible be a film that could change peoples thought processes and change they way they live. This, to me, is that powerful! Ben Affleck, I salute you, you sir have made the most important movie ever made!!!! 5/5"
"kornrocker65","9","3","6","29 March 2008"," Great debut
","On the surface, Gone Baby Gone, is a crime thriller about a child kidnapped from a cocaine addicted mother and the private investigator recruited to find her. Beyond that though, the plot only continues to get thicker every step of the way through the film.<br/><br/>Upon hearing of this movie I was slightly intrigued, mostly because of the Oscar nomination attached to Amy Ryan who I had never heard of. After watching it though, I was very pleasantly surprised. The movie was considerably well made, a great start for Ben Affleck's directorial career. Based on a novel by Dennis Lehan and adapted by Ben Affleck, Gone Baby Gone starts out with a deceivingly simple plot and expands and grows with great intensity. Simply put, the story is wonderfully written. <br/><br/>There is an impressive mix of character dynamics in the movie. In other words, certain characters relations to each other greatly facilitate a complex and interesting story. Along with its fine plot, Gone Baby Gone has a phenomenal cast and they help to display these dynamics excellently. On top of Amy Ryan's Oscar nominated role (which is quite deserved I think), Casey Affleck, Ed Harris, and Morgan freeman deliver splendid performances as well. While the performances are what we should expect of actors with the experience of the latter two, Casey Affleck is deservedly building an impressive resume too. In keeping with a good plot, deeper messages in the story very thought provoking. In some senses, it displays the traditional dilemma of ""do the ends justify the means"" but does so in a way that makes it too hard to simply take one side or the other. <br/><br/>An outstanding debut for Ben Affleck: the director. Thanks to an extremely well written book and Ben Affleck's directorial talent Gone Baby Gone is a great movie and I definitely recommend it to those looking for a deep, edgy drama."
"dback66","9","3","6","10 March 2008"," Phenomenal Movie
","This was one of the best movies I have seen in some time. Casey Affleck does a great job and will soon be (if not already) one of the coveted actors in Hollywood. This movie is very genuine with plot twists and keeps you thinking and guessing all the time. Ben Affleck did a fantastic job directing this movie and should have been nominated in my opinion. Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman play their supporting roles flawlessly.<br/><br/>If you are in the mood to see a movie that will make you think about life, what goes on around you, the gut wrenching decisions that you sometimes have to make, and how lucky you are, in addition to being entertained at the same time, this is it."
"ebrowner","5","3","6","28 January 2008"," Decent picture for Ben, not that great overall
","I realize Ben Affleck set the bar really low with Pearl Harbor, Gigli, and Reindeer Games but that doesn't mean we should give him more credit than necessary for decent work. This picture has 5'2"" 110-lb Casey Affleck as the star ""detective"" who apparently can easily knock down people a foot taller. Absolutely ridiculous and totally miscast. The story was interesting, but predictable at the end (did we think the girl was really dead?). It was interesting to see Morgan Freeman as the ""bad"" guy but there were too many clues that gave the ending away.<br/><br/>Casey Affleck's character's girlfriend was equally annoying. She gives him crap for continuing to obsess over the missing girl case but then when he finds the truth, she judge's him for how he wants to handle it. And she suddenly can't deal with how he handles it to the point where she must declare she can't stay with him. He did all of the leg work with hours of dedication and passion, IT'S HIS DECISION TO MAKE! It's not reasonable for her character to suddenly not respect the man she ""loves"", it's annoying. She's conveniently thickening the plot so Casey's character has an even bigger decision to make. Or maybe it was a good excuse to get out of the relationship because he is a tool.<br/><br/>The movie was filmed well with natural scenes shot in Boston, but Casey Affleck, his moron girlfriend, and predictable plot twists ruin it."
"dhdeelen","5","3","6","27 January 2008"," Affleck's voice
","The thing I hated the most about this movie was the voice of the main character Casey Affleck. I don't think I've ever heard a slower and more annoying voice as his. It seems as if he doesn't move his lips and mouth when he talks. In fact, sometimes it's hard to understand what the heck he's saying. Because of this voice thing the movie just didn't seem to catch me, and seemed simple, superficial and predictable. Another thing that bothered me was the fact that Affleck's partner could be erased from the movie and nothing would change. She just didn't make hings better and the relationship between the two wasn't convincing at all."
"DonFishies","8","3","6","27 October 2007"," Not perfect, but all around excellent otherwise
","Even to this day, I have yet to understand how the trend of Ben Affleck bashing started. Yeah, the man has starred in some pretty awful films, but then, which supremely entertaining and brilliant actor has not? Is there really something so godawful and putrid about Affleck's style that just seems to irk everyone into stereotypically bashing him? It bothers me to no end, but after being one of the few campaigning for awards recognition last year for his dazzling supporting turn in the otherwise forgettable Hollywoodland, and now after seeing his written/directed effort of Gone Baby Gone, I can only hope that these stereotypes will come to an end.<br/><br/>Gone Baby Gone revolves around private detective Patrick Kenzie (Ben's little brother Casey Affleck). Kenzie is hired, alongside with his live in partner Angie (Michelle Monaghan), to help police find a missing little girl. Kenzie, known for his knowledge of many of Boston's degenerates, seems to be a natural fit for the job. <br/><br/>What follows, at its core, is a tale of morality. While I have never been the biggest fan of preachy films, Affleck manages to side step any reverend-esquire moments, and focuses in on simplistic cause and effect. Thankfully, in all of his years in Hollywood, he has managed to understand the thin line between gracious ponderings and blatant throat shovings. Even at its most convoluted moments, Gone Baby Gone stays very focused, and does not attempt to dwindle into the territory better suited for veteran directors and writers. The film does not play itself off as amateur on any instant, but it does not feel well rounded enough to be considered having been created by an expert.<br/><br/>And as much as I wanted to adore each and every frame of this film, it does have its flaws. The opening hour, as you more than likely have read, plays off immaculately, even if it feels like it could have been tightened more than it already is. For someone relatively new to the production side of things, Affleck pulls this off with finesse and grace. He knows just the right moments to play tense, and just the right moments to stay soft and brooding. It is thrilling and just all around excellent. But then, the film kind of trails itself off after it hits its emotional peak in the middle. As it builds towards its inevitable conclusion, it just plays itself a bit too loosely, and packs in a bit too much. Never once did I attempt to calculate its plausibility or question what was happening, I just think that Affleck wanted to cram far too much of Dennis Lehane's original work into the relatively short running time of the film. As said, for as convoluted as it gets, Affleck tries his best to keep it straight-laced, and for the most part, content aside, he does very well for himself.<br/><br/>What he also does well (or at least helps to do well), is bring the grittiness of Boston to life. Filled with images of his former neighbourhoods, the film is positively loaded with a sense of authenticity. This is a movie about Boston, from somebody who knows Boston. And with every passing moment, the film just reeks of being accurately depicted. I felt like I was living in that city, and never once did I think anyone had traveled out of there. It is just so accurately represented that the visuals practically become a character of their own. Having all the normal townspeople appear in crowd shots and in passing was a nice touch on his part as well.<br/><br/>He also does wonders with the script. Having co-written with Aaron Stockard, Affleck brings a real sense of urgency to the film. The words are hard-hitting, and have a solid impact on each scene. I wanted to try and not compare to the Oscar-winning Mystic River, but as the film went on, it just became impossible. Except while River wallowed in its own pedantic melodrama, Gone succeeds in consistently delivering the same awe-inspiring tone. It is heavily dramatic (and darkly hilarious in more than a few instances), but it knows when to stop pushing itself. It never overstays its welcome, and not once did I feel like it was trying to one-up itself like Clint Eastwood's take on a Lehane novel. I just think they could have better worked out the kinks of the second half of the film.<br/><br/>And if Affleck does great behind camera, than his actors do equally great in front. His brother Casey is an absolute marvel leading the film. I never thought of him as a lead actor, but seeing his genuine finesse and bold attitude at work here, I think that Hollywood just may have a new young lead to add to its rank. There is never a dull moment when he is on-screen, and his character's ballsy attitude helps propel him past even the likes of his own brother's best performances. This is a career making turn, and I can only hope that we can see such unbelievable work in the future.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is excellent as well. Ed Harris does wonders for the enigmatic detective Bressant. Tapping into the same frightening and thought-provoking demeanour as his character in A History of Violence, Harris lays on the strong acting and never once lets up. Morgan Freeman, much like Monaghan, appear very little in the film, but help really round out strong moments in the film. I just wish Affleck used them more. Amy Ryan is another particular standout as the mother of the missing child, and helps to bring a solid sense of pathos to the characters and to the film itself.<br/><br/>Even with its problems in the second half, Gone Baby Gone is a solid and well rounded effort from everybody involved. It deserves all the attention it gets, and I can only hope that means good things for Ben Affleck.<br/><br/>8/10."
"michael-laury","1","7","20","7 May 2008"," Total Waste of Time
","If you have children, you should probably skip this film and avoid the horrible ending. The main character makes a very unmoral choice regarding care of a child at the end of the film which frustrated my wife and I and made our stomach's sick. <br/><br/>The plot was very deep and twisted, but the film was very boring. Also, there was cursing on almost every other word which seemed absurd due to all of possible choices of good words out there. I guess the curse words reduce the amount of original thought needed to make a good film.<br/><br/>The fact that others rated this movie so high shows how far American values have gone downhill."
"smccurdy-1","3","9","29","21 October 2007"," Slimy, ugly, hideously amoral people doing their thing.
","The current market's hunger for this type of film baffles me. The fact of the hunger itself is not disputable. People want to experience the dark side of humankind up close and personal. There is a desire, expressed $9 at a time at the box office, to get within smelling distance of the most unsavory of characters. I have endured this type of film in the past with a sense of responsibility to have open eyes to the world around me. A sense that by understanding these ideas, issues, and people I might come away with some sense of how to make my world better. This was not a film for that.<br/><br/>Without question, both of the brothers Affleck have proved their ability to do their assigned jobs. Casey carries the movie with no false moments. Ben's turn as director proves he knows how to tell a story with a camera. The problem is with the story itself.<br/><br/>Without getting into spoilers or summarizing the plot suffice this review to say that the movie raises the question, ""What does it mean to do the right thing?"" It does so brutally and paints a picture of a world I don't know why anyone would want to live in."
"d_horton-86913","1","4","10","26 May 2019"," Absolutely awful
","Terrible terrible film, no way is it 7.7, it's more like a 4.5, hence the low score from me to even the reviews up"
"Cedric_Catsuits","1","4","10","7 July 2011"," The worst film I've ever seen.
","Quite why Ben decided to stick his kid brother in front of camera and direct him to perform the most wooden and emotionally void imitation of himself that is possibly imaginable, is a mystery to me. Whether Ben - who I actually rate very highly as an actor - could have rescued such a drab and soulless attempt at story-telling is questionable, but at least he would have made it worth watching.<br/><br/>Poor old Morgan Freeman is so hopelessly miscast and underwhelmed by the whole sorry affair that you can almost see the tears in his eyes. Michelle Monaghan is nothing more than a mildly fruity stooge to the wooden and tasteless Affleck. She barely utters a single half-decent line, and is usually seen behind Affleck - presumably prompting and poking him in the back.<br/><br/>Struggling to stay awake - nay, alive - through scene after scene of the lamest and most dilute screenplay I can ever remember, I entirely lost the rather serious nature of the plot unfolding. As it turns out, it folded right back up again, and frankly it should stay there."
"clombim","7","4","10","24 October 2007"," This movie should have been rated NC-17.. NO CHILDREN SHOULD SEE IT
","Good movie. But after the credits rolled and the house lights came back up, I was shocked to see a 30-something couple leaving with their two young children. My guess was they were 9 and 7 years old.<br/><br/>My first thought was 'wow, they must have been well behaved, they did not make a sound during the movie'. My next thought was 'wow, there were lots of adult situations and foul language' and all the other things that constitute an ""R"" rating. I would never bring my young kids to an R rated movie like this.<br/><br/>Then I realized what terrible people they were. Why would you horrify your grade school aged children by taking them to a movie where the subject matter is child kidnapping? Even worse, one child was murdered and tortured by a sadistic pedophile."
"Jonny_Numb","8","4","10","23 October 2007"," Exceptional...another gem from 2007
","Wow. I'll admit I'm not a fan of Ben Affleck, but if ""Gone Baby Gone"" is any indication of his directorial prowess, I may have to reassess my opinion. Based on a Dennis Lehane novel (co-adapted by Affleck and Aaron Stockard), ""Baby"" hits with grace and rawness the notes played for heavy-handed melodrama in Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"" (another Lehane adaptation). An exceptionally satisfying mystery, well-textured through character instead of action (though there are several harrowing scenes of violence), with a script that consistently plays against our expectations without resorting to cheap cop-outs and last-minute twists. Affleck stages seemingly simple dialog exchanges with the same amount of visceral intensity as, say, a shootout in a derelict building. While some of the Boston accents are so thick subtitles wouldn't have been unreasonable, the actors nail their rich, complex roles: Casey Affleck as a freelance missing-persons finder (don't be deceived by his baby face and short stature; he has definite leading-man potential); Ed Harris as a cop assigned to the case; Michelle Monaghan as Affleck's partner. In this type of literary adaptation (and no, I have not read the novel), the tendency to emphasize certain passages can lead to a heavy-handed execution (""Mystic River,"" again), but Affleck does a good job of keeping things grounded in reality--the performances possess a raw naturalism that seldom conveys a Hollywood polish, save for Morgan Freeman, whose small yet crucial role is essentially a reprise of the ""wise elder"" he's been playing since ""Se7en."" But overall, ""Gone Baby Gone"" is one of the most surprisingly satisfying films of 2007--the type of character-rich meditation that hits hard, and is not easily forgotten."
"icma45","8","4","10","21 October 2007"," Good Movie...would recommend to others
","Most movies can't hold my interest for the full 2 hours or so. This one did. It is a typical drama where the story seems to indicate the obvious perpetrator and then twists and turns in the story reveal a surprise ending. I could see this movie take the same route but liked it nevertheless. I don't think this is Ed Harris' best movie (I loved him in Enemy at the Gates)and Morgan Freeman is always a joy to watch. Michelle Monaghan is rather bland. However, Amy Ryan plays her role with perfection. Casey Affleck is rather hard to believe in his role. I would have preferred someone a little stronger but can't blame brother Ben for giving him the job. The bottom line is the story is good enough to overcome any of these shortcomings."
"crosuwg921","10","5","14","19 October 2007"," Great!!
","I just saw the movie on it's opening night. Ben Affleck definitely revived his career with Gone Baby Gone. The story was attractive from the start and kept me thinking the whole time. Casey Affleck turns in a fantastic performance that allows the audience to connect to him emotionally and mentally as a character. Ed Harris plays his role as good as could be expected. Morgan Freeman shines and new shining star Michelle Monaghan captures the audience with her performance as well. This movie will make you question your motives and forces you to rationalize with every possible aspect of the movie. This movie is not for small children but for someone who enjoys a good suspense thriller tied in with an emotional war within. See it!! Fantastic!!!"
"jdesando","Null","31","140","27 September 2007"," Gravitas without Gigli
","Something about Dorchester, Ma., makes directors such as Gus van Sant (GoodWill Hunting), Clint Eastwood (Mystic River), Martin Scorsese (Departed), and now neophyte Ben Affleck (Gone Baby Gone) go for its working-class realism that celebrates the abrasive friendships of hard-knocks' sharing and the comfort of life-long neighborhoods. In Gone, Affleck's script recalls the lost child motif of Mystic and the betrayals of Departed, with less of the latter's intensely-felt terror and more of the former's existential angst.<br/><br/>Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan are hired to find a missing little girl, but as any aficionado of the thriller knows, there's much more to the plot than this. While the first hour plods through the increasingly boring CSI rituals of gathering evidence, the last 45 min. are reflections about the demands a conscience makes on contemporary relativistic challenges that could be settled at either end of the ethical spectrum.<br/><br/>If you allow me the almost irrelevant example, the Iraq war could be thought of as the greatest humanitarian effort in the world's history or the greatest foreign relations blunder in American history, depending on how you view things. Affleck's film engages this kind of Platonic give and take between the ideal and the real with a denouement that leans toward the ideal without fully making its case.<br/><br/>In other words, I liked the dialogue between police captain Morgan Freeman and private detective Affleck about the fate of the lost child, a sparring that raises the film from mediocre whodunit into a dissertation about the ethical maxim that the ends do not justify the means. Along the way, Dorchester is evoked with more realism than in Mystic River, largely through montages and cutaways of real denizens and a few local actors.<br/><br/>But the film's adherence to clichÃ©d cop techniques such as interminable interviews with locals to build a case keeps this from being a groundbreaking effort by the new helmer. But, hey, even Eastwood used these techniques. Yet, Eastwood has gravitas and no Gigli."
"santegeezhe","4","3","7","18 February 2008"," Not really worth watching
","I found this film to not really be worth watching. It wasn't god awful, just slightly below mediocre.<br/><br/>First off, I should state that I don't really enjoy the thriller genre all that much, so there's a chance this film was simply lost on me. However, having said that, I still feel it's not a very good movie.<br/><br/>This film is rough going from the get-go. The plot and characterization are fairly clunky. It seemed to me like the first third of the movie consisted of Casey Affleck walking around Boston trying to prove how ""down"" he was with the primarily blue-collar denizens of Southie (or whatever the hell). This was pretty laughable to me. I just couldn't take this skinny dork seriously in the role of street-savvy tough guy. I also found it hard to believe that the real police would give this private eye the time of day, let alone cooperate with him fully and involve him in their investigation. It just didn't ring true somehow. Consequently I was never really able to suspend disbelief and actually get into this movie.<br/><br/>Fast forward to an hour or so later: I awaken on the couch glad that this movie is over and with no interest whatsoever in how it turned out. Better luck next time Affleck(s)."
"wellquite","2","3","7","28 January 2008"," Very predictable bad movie.
","I don't normally comment on films but after this was given 8 out of 10 I had to put the record straight. From the very beginning of the film I knew that I wasn't going to like it. Poor acting from both the main characters makes this one to miss. If you want a film that's watchable get a copy of Mystic River. I can only guess that having Ben Affleck as the director was the only reason this film was ever made. I found it hard to understand the slurred speech from most of the main actors, the only reason Casey Affleck was in the film was because of his brother, looking at Casey's past acting roles, well bit parts really no reason for this talentless wonder to make a major stage debut. At one point Patrick hides behind a wooden door to stop someone shooting at him, obviously wood in the USA stops bullets does it? The Angie character was so cardboard cut out I actually wished it has been an inanimate object. I found myself wishing both of them would die at the end so that I could feel watching the film wasn't a complete waste of time. The highlight was seeing the credits. Just goes to show if you have a few Hollywood blockbusters under your belt you can make just about any old rubbish."

","I wanted to see this movie as it was getting very good reviews and they were right. This is a very good and interesting movie with both Ben and Casey Affleck doing a very good job. I have to say I was put off by all of the profanity. I wish that Hollywood didn't always believe that people ( even those on the lower end of the socioeconomic ladder) go around talking like that all of the time. And if the people of Boston talk like that all of the time I'm glad I don't live there.<br/><br/>The plot was exceptional and the cast was great. Of course the veteran actors Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris and Amy Madigan did their usual great job and they had so much great material to work with. But the not so famous also were right on key.<br/><br/>There was also exceptional writing which has been missing in Hollywood of late. I am usually good at guessing what will happen next but they got me a little at the end. This movie is thought-provoking and my husband an I talked about it for a long time after it was over. This is an Oscar worthy piece that everyone should see. 9/10"

Boston locations are perfect and the movie does show that there is heart and soul in even the most difficult life situations. Cudos to Ben Affleck for writing and directing a movie that has its own sense of being and for bringing this movie to the screen.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck pulled no punches in breathing life into this film; Casey Affleck brought it home with a stunning performance."

","When a little girl from a Boston neighborhood is abducted, the child's aunt hires a local couple to ask questions of the neighborhood residents, who may know something about the child's disappearance but won't talk to the cops. Adaptation of Dennis Lehane's novel, co-written by Aaron Stockard and Ben Affleck, who also directed, is a bleak whirlpool of low-life characters, drug dealers, drug addicts and gangs. Some of the violence hits hard, yet Affleck cannot seem to stage his major sequences (to say nothing of his smaller moments) without artifice, and no one comes out of the picture looking good (you know there's a problem when even Morgan Freeman, portraying the suspicious police captain, fails to register). In the central role of the streetwise young man whose life is irrevocably changed by the kidnapping, Casey Affleck (Ben's brother) is an uninteresting screen presence, matching his garbled line readings (for 'realism') with open-mouthed reactions and shifting, faraway stares. *1/2 from ****"

","'Gone Baby Gone' is a fantastic film. It is the sort of film that keeps you on the edge of your seat, thinking to yourself what the outcome will be. There's plenty of scenarios that went through my head as the film progressed. There is plenty of twists and turns and the flashbacks link the film together well to fully explain what has happened.<br/><br/>When I started watching, all I knew was roughly what the plot was. I didn't expect it to be so complex and thrilling with so much more going on that just an investigation. It really will keep you guessing.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book so I don't know if some cast members aren't a true representation of their character. But I can say I thought they all done a great job at making this film believable. I thought Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan were superb in the lead roles. Morgan Freeman was as good as ever, he wasn't in it much but by the end you will see he plays a key role in the story. Amy Ryan who played the missing child's mother was also superb as well as all of the supporting cast.<br/><br/>It's a tension building story that I can't recommend highly enough. I really enjoyed it. Cleverly made, well acted, good action and great suspense. A great directorial debut from Ben Affleck. I am now looking forward to seeing 'The Town' and 'Argo' for the first time.<br/><br/>9/10."
"mehmet_kurtkaya","4","2","4","2 June 2008"," Good idea but poor follow-up
","I thought of quitting this movie a few times. Acting is very shallow even ridiculous at times, characters more like actors rather than real persons, script is pretty bad in the middle. But the ending was good that's why I gave a four instead of a one.<br/><br/>I think Ben Afleck first thought the end and then reverse engineered it. And the whole development of the story is poor. The point where this whole thing went beyond belief is when the drug dealer supposedly phoned the cops for releasing the kid in return for money. At that moment, I thought why the hell should they meet in the woods, everybody knows everybody, where they live etc, they can call each other. So why the woods, then the obvious question why would the drug dealer call the cops instead of the private detective he spoke with and he knows well. Even acting on that scene seemed bad, including Morgan Freeman's. After that scene the movie sagged, and even the supposedly script twist of corrupt cops turn into good intentioned cops worked out poorly. But the ending was quite strong, deep and meaningful.<br/><br/>This movie can be an example of how a good idea can be turned into a bad movie."

","Just watched this the other day and was so pleased. This movie is great and delivered on every level. I've admired Casey Affleck's work since Good Will Hunting, but after seeing The Assassination of Jesse James and Gone Baby Gone, I am convinced that he is an amazing actor. The supporting cast is fantastic, Ed Harris is so talented and Morgan Freeman is always good. The actress in the lead as the little girl's mom is so good it's scary. She portrays a drugged out, selfish, terrible mother to a tee. The plot has some great and surprising twists and kept me on the edge of my seat. Some scenes were so raw and quite disturbing but an unfortunately startlingly accurate depiction of some of the sickness in the world today. Ben Affleck should be so proud-amazing job."
"tracampanella","8","2","4","6 April 2008"," Bad actor, great director
","Wow, Ben Affleck really did deserve that Oscar he won for writing Good Will Hunting. I thought it was a fluke (like maybe there were ghost writers involved), but watching Gone Baby Gone is proof positive that Affleck belongs behind the camera and not in front of it. The directing is fairly rudimentary (mostly static shots, close ups, med shots, stiff blocking) but the script is fabulous, allowing the film to flow smoothly, quickly, and cohesively. There's a lot going on in this movie, but in Gone Baby Gone you never feel lost in the narrative nor question the motives of the characters (as you do in many other films in this genre). The performances Affleck gets out of his actors, especially his brother, are amazing (this is the best work I've seen from Ed Harris since Truman Show.) Congrats Ben, you keep this up and you may just win another gold statue."
"katcelata","9","2","4","4 April 2008"," You will think about this one for a LONG time.... A++++
","This is a very fine and precise film. Casey Affleck brings a very textured and multi level performance- well lets get away from that fine talk- Affleck's performance is top notch, and hurts your heart. If you are a reader of Lehane's books, you are NOT going to be pleased with Angie Gennaro. Looking at her in the context of the books, the film portrayal is weak, whiny and extremely lacking. So, to enjoy the film, you have to leave what you know from the books at the door. It's a pity, because in Lehane's Mckenzie/Gennaro series, Angie is the strong hard hitting character, and it is a pity the film didn't chose to act on this- however, let's be practical, you only have so many minutes in a film, and this director chose to develop Patrick- very VERY well... I am a Bostonian living away from home. This film broke my heart- the accent was spot on, the background was perfect, everyone in the film was a bit of my life. There are raw and hard choices made here. This is a film that you will think about for a long long time, like Mystic River. Ben Affleck knows where he comes from and obviously worked very hard, and picked a perfect crew to see him through. He can be proud. The cinematography is first rate, and often heartbreakingly beautiful.Truly an asset to the mood of the film. MOOD is key here- there is very subtle play of music, and very subtle play of the neighborhood. It is a RICH texture. No one can re-create a Boston story, Spenser, or Lehane, or what have you without knowing that there is always ONE character in the background, and that is Boston's particular character of neighborhood- it is VERY different from any city in the US, even NYC. Affleck catches it, undoubtedly because he grew up with it. It is in his blood, and makes him who he is. Had he not gotten this, he would have failed Lehane, and never carried the story over in such a way as to win our hearts, and BREAK our hearts in half... These are all our failed yesterdays, all the kids we went to the High with, all the places we left, and wondered about - or didn't leave and are ashamed of. A very TRUE TRUE film."

","Ben Affleck's directorial debut has nothing but strengths in my book, strong performances by actors and actresses that for the most part are getting screen time in a film that showcases their abilities to play truly dramatic characters.<br/><br/>Casey Affleck truly shines in this movie, you can see the effects on his character of the decisions he makes, one of the few times in Hollywood where I can actually see a character on the big screen change before my eyes throughout the 2 hours that I spent on this movie.<br/><br/>This film also made me truly think about and respect the decisions each and every lead character makes, Affleck, Freeman, Harris, and Monaghan (sp?), I understand why each made the decisions they did, and the film truly made me wonder what I would have done had I been in the same situation.<br/><br/>Long story short, see this movie, it is by no means a film for those looking for a shoot em up, or a thriller based on nothing but cheap scares, but for those of you who are willing to view something that truly makes us look at ourselves in the mirror, bring our own morals out in the open, and ask, what would I have done, then this movie is a can't miss for you."

","On sep. 10 2007 i said the departed was the best movie i had ever seen, well now it is second. This movie wsa truly amazing. Ben Affleck has truly found a gift in directing (he sucked at acting, and everybody knew it). The acting in this film was top notch and Amy Ryan did deserve the Oscar. This movie told viewers that not everybody is a good person even if they look like they are. When i read the book, i wanted to watch this movie so bad, i got posters and articles and even the DVD.I recommend this film to anybody who liked the departed and goodfellas. Please whoever reads this article, who hasn't seen the movie rent it, buy it, whatever just watch it and you will love this movie."

","I watched this on the trails of no country for old men and I have to say that my mood after that wasn't very ""happy"" to say the least. But I have to say thank-you Ben Affleck because you have restored my faith in film because I was starting to think that any film that todays Hollywood would have you believe it to be a masterpiece is actually garbage. But not in this case this is a highly touted film and i agree on all fronts and in fact I really think it should have gotten more Oscar hardware.<br/><br/>Now the film. Well where to start the casting agency big ups the entire ensemble cast i can not remember seeing any cast more perfectly casted and i talk extras and all it made the film so much more realistic and genuine. And by the way if there are any people doubting Bens bro and his acting abilities well don't I think he should have at least been nominated with Daniel day lewis for best male performance at the Oscars no joke.And the directing well Ben has nailed his first attempt and if this is any indication of what he will bring to the screen from behind the camera then i truly cant wait. <br/><br/>This movie raises many questions like what can any man be capable of doing in the right circumstances and asks of you the viewer what is right and what is wrong. What truly is amazing about this film its ability to do this without compromising the end result. I think many films in the vain attempt to create a film with a message and meaning lose direction and eventually destroy the film itself.<br/><br/>everyone should see this film"
"DaleP1979","10","2","4","11 March 2008"," Perfect!!! And a Surprise.....
","First of all, I am not sure if I have ever given any movie a 10. But I am giving it to this movie. I rented this movie the other night for my wife and I to watch, on my night off. I was kind of hesitant to rent it, cause I didn't really know much about it. I remembered seeing a few previews when it was in theaters here, but it didn't receive a lot of buzz. (And honestly, it didn't stay very long in the theaters here.) But I rented it,... and I am very pleased that I did. This was an incredible movie. It is smart, realistic, and makes you think... even after it is over.<br/><br/>This isn't a ""polished"" typical Hollywood movie. It feels real. The actors seem real in their roles, and not like actors. The plot is realistic. And the emotions this film portray are real.<br/><br/>And as a person who went through A lot as a child, and saw A lot,...... the child abuse/ neglect that this movie presents us with... is very realistic and emotional. And my eyes did get watery during this movie, due to the choices and situations that were there to be made.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't try to paint a black and white picture of what the director feels is wrong and right. It simply paints a picture and leaves the judgment up to you. Who were really the bad guys? Were the bad guys really bad? Were their intentions right? Or was Casey Afflecks character right in the decision he makes at the end of the movie?<br/><br/>And the ending was perfect. Left you thinking and debating in your own mind. What would you have done? What emotions was his character facing? Did he regret his decision?<br/><br/>Give this movie a shot!!! Definitely wont regret it."

Who is capable of making them? The mother? or police?""<br/><br/>First off all good directing and some good performances. Harris was pretty good, and so was little Affleck. But the acting is not the best part of this movie. Plot is magnificent. Very good story, structured and handled very good. I love movies that asks questions to you without making you uneasy. Well i saw it, and i say now it is really hard even for me, someone who is not actually in that situation, to make that call. For that movie there is no happy ending that's for sure. Just like the real world.<br/><br/>Normally I analyze movies very rationally. But for this one i take my day off. I think this is a very good movie, and should be seen without hesitation."

"movedout","8","2","4","31 January 2008"," Gets under your skin and stays there
","Boston resides in the marrow of the Afflecks. Ben Affleck directs his younger brother Casey to an arduously plaintive performance as an amateur Boston gumshoe in his adaptation of novelist Dennis Lehane's ""Gone Baby Gone"", a film that is so quietly accumulative in power when its collapses in morality become tangled in its web of inescapable rot, and where those who seem to have good in them always get hurt.<br/><br/>When 4 year-old Amanda McCready is abducted from her working-class Dorchester home, her aunt and uncle (Amy Madigan and Titus Welliver) ""augment"" the limp search conducted by the police when she hires local detectives Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and his girlfriend Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) to sift though the neighbourhood and extract information from its distrusting merchants and volatile proles. The elder Affleck adroitly portrays Boston's inherent tribalism and rotting facades with the duo's tortured investigations through the diseased surfaces that recede from the pale daylight into shadows and grime, and eventually through the city's underground of venality so terrible a thing to imagine that it gets under your skin and stays there.<br/><br/>Closer to an affecting study of unravelling communal drama than a riveting crime piece, this urban notturno draws on its mileage when the investigation into the little girl's disappearance reveals dark secrets and a trail that leads in circles, discovering more than what they sought to know about themselves. Characters like the girl's mother, a social parasite named Helene (played fiercely by a noteworthy Amy Ryan), balances and evocates the film's residual outrage and pity for its ravaged denizens. Further populated by magnificent performances from Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman as jaded cops, it lends Affleck's directorial debut a confident swagger that allows focus on the material, so unafraid of disturbing its audience, to keep patience in its mauling eruptions of nihilism.<br/><br/>There's both a deepness of procedurals and an authenticity of time and place in the script's constant turning of the screw, the narrative wheels churn as damaged children and ineffectual adults begin to take the stage. It just gets darker and more intense in the film's inspection of gnarled human nature, and the reasons that coerce it is at the centre of its slow-burning style, giving it an effectively sustained dramatic tension as its moral convictions become no less irreducible.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck's ambitious and unremittingly desolate purview of his turbulent city is never intellectualised, but instead remains meticulously modulated to the emotional resonance of Kenzie as he journeys from one stinging moral decision to another, evincing the confluence of conundrums that's entrenched into the very fibres of the people we are and aspire to be. ""Gone Baby Gone"" presents to us how warped and strident individual instinctive moralities can be and what the right thing truly entails in a world that remains unresponsive to the inner cries of the film's palpitating bleakness."
"legutsa","10","2","4","26 January 2008"," Close to perfect
","The story is powerful, the acting is on key, and the direction is stressful, which actually serves the film. If anything, Casey Affleck could have used a little more muscles and Michelle could have put more drama into her role, but overall the characters fit the plot rather well. Overall the actors were just superb. The end is not what I expected, or what I would have liked, but it is in line with the main character: A lamb among wolves, sweet inside and tough on the outside. A religious crusader: What haunts him are not his evil deeds, but the good ones. He knows people do not change, but he is willing to follow his principles rather than his common sense. Casey portraits this conflicting detective perfectly. There are few movies that make you sad when they end. This is one of them. I just wanted it to go on and on. Hell, I would like to see more movies like this one!"
"JapaneseDad","6","2","4","19 January 2008"," Good atmosphere ruined by preposterous plot.
","This film reminded me of Mystic River: great location, good acting, utterly preposterous plot that relies on a crime committed against a child for fake emotional weight.<br/><br/>The twist in the story, that a gang of police officers would participate in a murder and kidnapping plot to 'rescue' a child from a broken home, has probably never happened in the history of modern North America. Given that, how can you buy it as the central device of the movie? <br/><br/>A really good movie wouldn't have to rely on cheap 'save-the-children' sentimentality to give the film moral weight, and its too bad when you realize that a great Dorchester location and a very compelling Casey Affleck are wasted when the absurdity of the story reveals itself about halfway though."
"LazySod","9","2","4","9 January 2008"," Whoa... This is a surprise
","When I read that Ben Affleck directed this film I had a sinking feeling. I like some of the films he plays in but the most of them are DVD material and not worthy of cinema time. Decided to give it a chance anyway though and I can honestly say that was a wise choice.<br/><br/>The film tells the tale of a kid being kidnapped and the search for her that starts. As well as a lot of other events that tie a number of people together. The story is told from the eyes of a pair of private investigators that get hired by the aunt of the kidnapped kid. This viewpoint works out very well. The film has a good tension to it for its full length. It's also highly sentimental, pulling all possible tricks to keep the audience on its toes and reaching for handkerchiefs. This isn't entirely bad though and never pulls away the force of the film.<br/><br/>The best of the film comes after it ends though. It leaves one thinking for a good long while and if there ever was a film where the tag line really defined it it is this one... Everyone wants the truth, until they find it. It can't get any clearer than that.<br/><br/>9 out of 10 rocked up emotions"
"maxgregor","10","2","4","6 January 2008"," I never thought I'd say this but Ben Affleck is a true talent!!!!!
","And I mean that.<br/><br/>Its a tragedy that due to current events in the news this wont be shown in Europe and I can see why. But Im lucky enough to know some people in the business that got hold of a copy.<br/><br/>From the poetic commentary to the shocking twist that you don't see coming. Every inch of the script is written with a real understanding of the place and the characters.The plot keeps a steady pace which in some way seems to go faster than it is.<br/><br/>The acting as is tough and gritty. I kept finding myself thinking about on the water front with Marlon Brando to give you an idea of the kind of level and feel of performance I'm talking about. Casey Affleck shines and in my mind after this is the modern day Bogart. Ed Harris is eclectic and there is one scene outside a hospital with the two which in my mind will become a classic.<br/><br/>The film is beautifully shot I think it gives a far better feel of the darkness of the Boston crime world than the Departed ever did. But Also has a lot of affection for the place and people. Even the extras feel like whole developed characters.<br/><br/>I hope this film gets the international release it deserves and that Ben Affleck turns his back on a mediocre acting career and directs because after this he could become one of the greats go and see it"
"charchuk","4","2","4","23 December 2007"," Typical thriller masked by faux morality
","It's been said that the twist(s) in this film work better because they're placed in context and they have an ethical side to them. But I disagree. This film is just as gimmicky as your typical psycho-thriller, and the fact that it attempts to hide its tricks under moral dilemmas makes it even worse, I think. It starts off well enough: it's engaging, it's interesting, it's got some meaningful things to say. But then it hits a brick wall, and has to work fast to try and regain its momentum. Once the twists starting coming fast and furious, I grew tired of them, and the ethical issues the film brings up failed to move me or excite me in any way. It just seemed like an excuse to present a fractured narrative without falling prey to the typical criticisms of the form. And the end of the film came so quickly, I didn't get shocked or surprised by the 'big reveal'; I just didn't care. I barely thought about the moral questions the film raised, because they didn't have much of an impact on me at all.<br/><br/>Still, the film is well-made, exciting at times, and has an interesting concept. In other words, it's just like a typical thriller, not some meaningful ethical debate. The performances are all solid, but no one was really amazing - none of the characters are really given a chance to believably grow all that much. All in all, it's just an average crime thriller, but not much more."
"ikanboy","8","2","4","28 October 2007"," A great gritty movie with a deeply unsatisfying ending
","It's in all the magazines. Ben Affleck has returned as a force to be reckoned with; as a screenwriter and a director. After ""Good will hunting"" I knew he'd be back, but he really surprised me with this gritty, no nonsense, what the F... morality tale. Affleck goes back to his roots in Boston; the hard scrabble existence lived by too many of the urban working class. But he goes deeper into it's rotting underbelly, and it's a sobering ride.<br/><br/>A little girl goes missing; purportedly kidnapped; and for God knows what! Private eye Casey Affleck and his partner (Monahan) are asked by the grandmother to help uncover leads in the neighborhood that they are more familiar with than the cops. This doesn't sit well with anyone; not the cops; not the rest of the family; and not with his partner. But Casey is a straight arrow and he plunges ahead, and soon uncovers some pertinent evidence that throws them together with two hard bitten old cops (Ed Harris and John Ashton) who attempt to set up an uneasy alliance. Things go bad and the story seems to be hanging in limbo when along comes another child kidnapping, which goes off even worse. But it sets off alarm bells in Affleck as he realizes that Harris hasn't been straight with him about the earlier kidnapping.<br/><br/>Once again he plunges ahead against the pleas of his more cautious partner, and slowly he comes face to face with the truth about the first kidnapping. To me, and probably the majority of the audience who view criminals as scum, the end has an acceptable solution. Until Casey Affleck pushes his straight arrow morality, and then the movie goes flat, so horribly flat, leaving me (and probably 95% of the ""when it comes to doing what's best for the child morality is Black and White brigade"")totally deflated, angry and cursing Ben for following what was probably the book's ending instead of a more satisfying one.<br/><br/>The movie is way to good to be ruined by the ending, and for those who view hard realities as moral challenges, then this ending's for you. For those who like to be thrown curve balls that raise profound questions about what is the right thing to do, then this is for you too. But I bet that the ending will dampen the ""you must see this movie"" word of mouth that makes for a golden day at the Box Office. I wonder if the suits told Ben this, and I wonder if he told them to take a hike?"
"jnaylor284","9","2","4","26 October 2007"," A Very Intelligent Crime Drama
","Rarely does a movie of this type leave me with a ""punch in the gut"" feeling when the last reel ends. ""Mystic River"" was excellent, but ""Gone Baby Gone"" was even more effective in my opinion. This is not about being black and white on moral issues, but about the many shades of gray, depending on each person's point of view. Excellent casting and pacing. Just when you think you have it figured out, something else happens to re-color your view and shape your opinion. Taut, suspenseful, and never boring. Each character had an important part in supporting the story. An intelligent drama about the human condition and the consequences for decisions made for all the right reasons by each character."
"Roland81","8","2","4","25 October 2007"," A wonderful crime-drama
","When I saw ""Hollwoodland"" last year I could not help but be impressed with Ben Affleck's terrific portrayal of George Reeves, Hollywood's original Superman. Not to say it was his first good performance, but as of late he hasn't brought much to the screen in terms of quality work (Daredevil anyone?). With his directorial debut, ""Gone Baby Gone"", I think Mr. Affleck has found his stride in a way that he has never before found on screen. The film is based on Dennis Lehane's novel of the same name. He also penned ""Mystic River"" which Clint Eastwood turned into an Oscar-winning masterpiece, so the comparisons are inevitable, but I think Affleck's film stands strongly on its own.<br/><br/>""Gone Baby Gone"" tells the gritty story of private investigators Patrick Kenzie, played by Casey Affleck, and his partner/girlfriend Angie Gennero, played by Michelle Monaghan, as they attempt to track down a missing four-year-old girl in south Boston. Telling you more than this is impossible because the twists and turns in this film come at such a fast and furious pace that anymore info could ruin the viewing experience.<br/><br/>Casey Affleck's performance is terrific. When first I heard that Ben Affleck was using his brother, who is probably best known for his role as Virgil Malloy in Ocean's 11 and both its sequels, I was a little skeptical, yet I could not have been more wrong. He seems to blend into the neighborhood like he belongs, which of course he is supposed to. Patrick seems aloof, sometimes funny, but that quickly changes as events spiral out of control. Later in the film when he makes some decisions that will surprise you, I think the audience understands why, even if they don't agree with him. This is a real breakout role, the younger Affleck's first real commercial lead and I think we will see more of him sooner rather than later. I for one am looking forward to future projects from him.<br/><br/>That said ""Gone Baby Gone"" has some of the best supporting performances you could ask for. Ed Harris' performance as the police detective heading the investigation is fierce. He is a terrific counterpoint to Casey Affleck's quiet, more subtle role. Morgan Freeman, who plays the police captain overseeing the investigation, is good, but he has such little screen time that he takes a back seat to everyone else. Michelle Monaghan has done a terrific job as the uncomfortable partner/girlfriend who thinks they are in over their head before they even begin. Last but certainly not least is the setting of south Boston itself. Ben Affleck's use of real locations and local extras really shows the downtrodden lifestyle of Southie. Everyone and everyplace fit perfectly.<br/><br/>It took guts for Ben Affleck to take on such a heavy piece on his first attempt. The subject of child abduction and the moral quandaries the character's face is daunting to say the least. The overall ""what would you be willing to do to save a child"" theme is not light fare, but I think Ben Affleck has brought it together wonderfully. ""Gone Baby Gone"" is a real stand out in the crime-drama genre and may even see some recognition come awards season."

"BecksyKane","9","0","0","21 May 2020"," A powerful Boston drama
","Gripping, and at times disturbing - Gone Baby Gone is a powerful Boston drama with multiple revelations & a compelling resolution thats up for ethical debate.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck delivers a tremendous adaption of Dennis Lehane's novel, authentically depicting the bleakness of Dorchester, it's people (mostly degenerates) and it's surroundings - perhaps on par with Clint Eastwood's adaptation of Mystic River.<br/><br/>Casey Affleck is just bloody brilliant in his role as Patrick Kenzie. As he narrates the film, we are given additional insight into his motivations and perspective of the world around him. During the film, he comes face to face with repugnant characters and is forced to grapple with his naive ideologies of right and wrong, and the fundamental teachings of the Catholic Church. Throughout, he delivers a careful, subdued & stoic performance - showing just the right amount of emotion to express his turmoil as the events unfold.<br/><br/>A performance that has to mentioned comes from Amy Ryan as Helene (the mother of missing Amanda). A trashy coke hoe, and a sad excuse for a mother - she prefers binge drinking, mouthing off & watching Jerry Springer to co-operating with the police on her daughters disappearance. From the outset she garners such hatred - you are tempted to believe that wherever Amanda is, she's better off. At times she does displays genuine concern for her daughters wellbeing and it's hard not to feel empathy for her in some way, though it seems a bit of an act to bask in the news spotlight.<br/><br/>
About half way thought the film, there's a sort of false ending then the story picks up again and goes full speed into a gruesome discovery and major plot twists delivered in the form of flashbacks.<br/><br/>*spoiler*
One scene that stands out for me is when Affleck's character teams up with local drug dealer Bubba to find known paedophile Colwin Earle & his associates, the Trett's. The bathroom sequence was wonderfully filmed, shots alternating between the sink; the bathtub, Affleck's reaction and his reaction. The music that accompanied this sequence made it all the more emotive and I actually felt nauseous watching it. Truly harrowing.<br/><br/>The ending is definitely a talking point for the audience to discuss where their moral compass resides - was Patrick right? Or did he make a massive mistake that he'll live to regret?<br/><br/>All in all, this is a wonderful film with excellent supporting roles from Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris & Michelle Monaghan. A must watch if you like crime/thrillers."

","Gone Baby Gone is a strange mishmash; it begins brilliantly, the acting is mostly superb, the detail convincing, dialogue great. Dennis Lehane wrote the novel it was based on and perhaps the sprks in the script originated there. But the denouement - or the entire last third of the film - didn't hack it. Maybe it worked more convincingly in the novel but it ran out of steam and seemed too contrived. This film is - dare I say it - entertaining and almost great in parts; but the whole doesn't make it. Ben Affleck's brother is a slightly better actor than his brother; but he is similarly 'dull' and he does not carry the movie as his character is required to do. His tough act in the bar didn't convince me. The film leaned heavily on better actors; Ed Harris, Amy Ryan, Morgan Freeman, Michelle Monaghan, Titus Welliver, and everybody else are outstanding enough to carry the less than watertight story. A cameo by Edi Gathegi almost steals the show for me; and Michael Kenneth Williams, who I seem to remember in The Wire?, is brilliant. But ultimately this film is not as convincing as Mystic River, but it is still Lehane enough to get me hooked."

It is directed by Ben Affleck who, in his first attempt behind the camera, delivers an excellent crime film, tight-plotted and with great characters. The performances by the main actors, especially those by Ed Harris and Casey Affleck, are top-notch while the tempo of the story's unraveling is such that it never wears the viewer down. Morgan Freeman plays a secondary, though crucial, character and he nails the role as well.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a child disappearance and the plot begins when the uncle and aunt of the missing girl, little Amanda, ask from Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro, two private investigators with a lot of connections to Boston's underbelly, to help them with the investigation. The tough city neighborhoods seem to be the most appropriate setting for a crime story to take place and Boston is a character in itself, as it is true for many of Dennis Lehane's novels. There is a lot of mystery, little doses of suspense and some great twists that make the film one of the best films of the genre for the 2000-2010 period. The finale is thorough and satisfying, giving all the answers to the -many- questions raised by the complex and elaborate plot. In my opinion, ""Gone Baby Gone'' along with ""Mystic River"" (2003) is the best big-screen adaptations of D. Lehane's crime novels and two of the modern classics of this kind of films."

","Gone Baby Gone is a well-directed, well-acted and emotionally complex film. It's not an easy movie to watch, but it presents its gritty reality in a way that makes it hard to look away. The actors, especially Amy Ryan, disappear into their roles and heighten the sense of realism. The film also brings up some interesting moral dilemmas that are sure to be a catalyst for conversation. Well done, Ben Affleck."

","I was very skeptical with this one, as Ben Afflecks work in ""The Town"" just didn't convince me at all. For this one, it was slightly better i think. Well, as some of the reviewers already wrote, Casey Affleck is just not very believable in his role and you can hardly understand what he's saying. It was slightly better than in ""The Killer Inside me"", there his performance and credibility are just horrible and i was asking my self ""really, are they serious""? . It seems Ben Affleck kinda pushed his brother into this role my all means or is it just a coincidence, i don't think so. Ed Harris is very good, but doesn't really fit in very well. Same for Morgan Freeman."

","Well, my original review has disappeared. So be it. GONE tells the tale of a missing 4 year old and a private eye's desperate search to find her. The trouble is, the mom is a sleazeball who doesn't deserve the kid back. Directed by Ben Affleck, GONE is atmospheric and stars his baby brother Casey, who does a decent, DiCaprio-type turn as the detective. The film is full of great supporting players, including Michelle Monaghan as the private eye's girlfriend and partner. Other familiar faces include Morgan Freeman, John Ashton and Ed Harris. The movie follows the Dennis Lehane novel quite closely, right to the downbeat conclusion. Well worth a look, although those expecting another MYSTIC RIVER may be slightly disappointed. I was not."

","There are very few movies which force you to think what is right and what is wrong. But after watching this movie most of us will be forced to think about the situation depicted in this movie. Ben Affleck impresses in his directorial debut and his younger brother carries his role well. The way Boston is captured on the camera is very captivating.It can be said that the character of the city has been shown really well in the movie. A strong cast of actors also works in its favor.But the biggest question that this movie raises is whom you can trust and who you can not. For this thing alone, Gone Baby Gone is an intriguing movie and will surely stay in the viewer's mind for a long time."
"Awesome_Abe","6","0","0","17 July 2010"," Feels more like a top-tier TV crime show than an actual movie
","Acting: Everyone acted very well and always kept the proper level of tension. The only (minor) problem with the cast is the role of Ed Harris, needless to say he played the part extremely well (as usual) it's just that the moment you see him on screen (Possible ''Spoler Alert''!)you already know that his character will end up having a secret of some sort.<br/><br/>Music: This films has an excellent score and makes good use of music (in a background and on-screen) <br/><br/>Cinematography&Editing: The camera is always good (not spectacular) but spends to much time showing us sights of the city bridging sequence from sequence.All you need is one set of these a movie unless their is something important to show.(which in this case their isn't) The only faults with the editing is that the action scenes never really chose a style switching between various techniques. The only scene where this was a real problem was when a character jumps of a cliff into the water, the only reason this was a problem was how it was done. The character quickly realizes what might be in the water, briefly a character yells no, enter the slow motion. I don't dislike slow motion but in this scene it was not used properly, only one shot merited it.<br/><br/>Story: The story is quite a good one, about a child abduction and it's investigation. The story tells a very intelligent tale with plenty of twists and turns, unfortunately it's pacing isn't always perfect often making the story very linear and doesn't always allows the viewer to think about whats coming next. The film quickly gains speed until a mid-way action scene where it loses it's pace, then spends the rest of the time building up to a ''different'' story which moves away from searching for the child and more about the protagonist cutting through a web of lies told by a dirty cop. The two story's eventually add together after an intense action sequence inside a house of two drug addicts and a pedophile , and then leaves you with a very strong thought provoking finale <br/><br/>75% <br/><br/>A good crime drama that is near-perfect, just faults from a bit of repeditive camera shots, some minor ''overblown'' action shots and a slightly unbalanced linear story. Feels like a grade ''A'' CSI episode."
"insomniac_rod","8","0","0","26 June 2010"," Very good modern cop movie.
","I wanted to see this movie after praising it's trailer. The plot goes directly to the point and crafts plenty of interesting situations involving the kidnapping.<br/><br/>Through great character development we can make our own explanations towards the plot's main situation. For example, the audience creates hyphotesis towards choosing a ""responsible"" for the kidnap.<br/><br/>The plot twist really got me because it can happen when you are a powerful and intelligent person.<br/><br/>The moral between the decision at the ending will split commentaries and opinions and that's what makes a movie really good. When you feel the plot, think about solutions, and delivering your opinion then you experience a good cinematic effort.<br/><br/>Some moments reminded me of ""Seven"". For example, the settings that were investigated, the moral ""problem"" at the ending, and the ""mature cop-young cop"" contradiction in relation of methods.<br/><br/>The acting is great. Casey Affleck has an instant on-screen charm and delivers a credible dramatic performance. Love the guy's clothing. Michelle Monaghan is too hot to be true. She's like the perfect girlfriend and looks very next door. I didn't agree with her in the ending but oh well. Morgan Freeman has little on screen time but manages to pull a very good performance. I love Ed Harris and he does a great job as always. John Ashton and Amy Ryan are really good and totally complete the natural performance that is required.<br/><br/>The score is great. Helps to create a tense atmosphere (like in the shooting during the ambush). The cinematography really adds a sad tone to the movie. I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>This is a very good movie with a sad vibe, interesting sub-plots, great acting, remarkable score, and delivers different kinds of human and social messages.<br/><br/>I want to see more from Kenzie and Genaro!"

","Gone Baby Gone caught me by surprise.<br/><br/>I was expecting it to be a good film. Everything I had read said so, but I was late coming to it: its exposure in the UK was limited and compromised by comparison with the Maddie McCann child abduction case. So I knew little about it other than that it was about a child abduction, directed by Ben Affleck and starring his brother Casey.<br/><br/>Well, yes, it is indeed good. It is a gripping drama which keeps you guessing all the way through (I hadn't known, but wasn't surprised, to see that it was based on a book by Dennis Lehane, who wrote Shutter Island). And, on the level of a rather dispiriting, rather seedy crime drama, it succeeded admirably.<br/><br/>Then the last fifteen minutes or so arrived, and everything changed. Suddenly this detective story, with its unexpected twists and turns, became something very much deeper, addressing the fundamental issue of whether morality is, or should be, black or white. And it is this element of the movie which will stay with me well beyond the usual afterlife of a movie.<br/><br/>In passing, I should mention that the cast are all excellent (particularly Casey Affleck, Ed Harris, Amy Ryan and Amy Madigan), and Ben Affleck does a remarkable job on his first movie as director."

","Ben Affleck did a fantastic job directing this. There were a few sequences where Ben is trying to figure it out, but stylistically he keeps it even, dark, on the grit and focused. Excellent job.<br/><br/>Casey Affleck's performance wasn't really award-worthy, but he did surprise me. He was solid. Ed Harris was great, per usual, as was Morgan and the rest. Really, the performances, there weren't any standouts, aside from maybe the missing girls mother, who was terrific in her character. <br/><br/>The story is one that will leave a lot of questions open in your heart. There are so many gray-areas on the question of morality, after one watches a fine movie like this, where a child is involved it gets treacherous finding your true feelings. Feelings become splintered. <br/><br/>This was a terrific film, I recommend it."

Terrific performances from Casey Affleck, Amy Ryan, Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman et al. Also note worthy is the film's great sense of place. The world of the film feels real, and not like a tinsel-town projection of a working class Boston neighborhood. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck brings surprising subtlety and depth to his directorial debut, and ends up making one of the most intelligent Hollywood mysteries in recent years. <br/><br/>There are flaws; the last 1/3 isn't quite as strong in terms of plot â€“ a few twists hard to swallow.

It's great for Affleck to be directing a cast of Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris, and his little brother Casey Affleck in his first ever movie.<br/><br/>From beginning to end, I was in a trance watching this film.

","I've been thinking a lot about this movie everyday since the day I saw it seven days ago. The fact is this movie really makes you think. Its like, what did I just see? It actually disturbed me a little bit. This is a completely thought provoking film. Its about bad parents, a city's willingness to find the truth, and a missing girl. Secrets are uncovered throughout the film, dark, unthinkable secrets. It completely takes you by surprise. Ben Affleck has suddenly become a powerful filmmaker, showing us our world's dark side in all it's horror and disgrace, and beyond that, our weaknesses. Perhaps more perfectly than any other film I've seen, this film shows us in a completely shocking way, how far some people are willing to go. The tag line to this film sums it up perfectly: Everyone wants to find the truth... Until they find it. The picture starts with Casey Affleck's character talking about the city of Boston as we see different shots of the city, its really beautiful, and right then, I knew this was going to be no ordinary movie. From the beginning, the director makes you feel what the characters are feeling, this dark atmosphere. The ending of the film at first was not what I wanted, but when I think about it, the film would not have been as good without it. If you have yet to see this film, prepare to ponder it for a long while after witnessing. 10 out of 10."
"Chiyonosake23","5","0","0","2 April 2010"," an amazing movie with an irking ending
","I avoided this movie for a long time, I dunno why, because it looked like a really good one, but i had some prejudices toward Ben Affleck as a director. Turned out i shouldn't have had any. This movie is really good, with awesome and very well written dialogues, suspense, and drama. The kidnapped little girl clichÃ© was done so many times, but this was one of the best in this genre. But a bit predictable thou, when the old captain retired after a monologue, how hard it was when his little girl got killed, and after they didn't find Amanda's body in the lake i was sure Morgan Freemans character kidnapped her somehow. I was right. When the haiti drug-dealer showed up, i knew he will be blamed, killed, but turn out to be innocent in this case. I was right. But in one thing i was wrong. I thought when they found Amanda, that the private investigator guy will eventually see, she has a better place there and leave it be. I was wrong and i am very angry i was. I know this is just a movie, but seriously, can someone really be this stupid? I mean the whole first half of the movie was about how bad person the girls mother is. How she is a crack-addict, no-good, mean, dirty-languaged imbecile. How could the main character think she will be a good parent? Why shouldn't he just left the girl and that poor old cop to be happy? That scene was heart-breaking, and i think if there really are people who are this ignorant, blind-folded, driven and fanatic that this guy was, well that is maybe even more sad then the kidnapping itself. Otherwise, excluding this great unpleasentness in the end, which is just MY opinion, so no need to crucify me for it, this film was great, and very-very thoughtful. Mr Affleck, congratulation, you have one more fan for what it worth."

","Ben Affleck surprises with this tale about a Private Investigator, some Cops, and a missing girl.<br/><br/>This is not a pretty film; there are no stunning frames and no obvious special effects. Think Seven...gloomy, atmospheric, peering into the shadows.<br/><br/>And as in Seven, a wizened, life weary cop (played by Morgan Freeman) is played opposite a young investigator (played by Casey Affleck).<br/><br/>But, unlike Seven, the chemistry doesn't quite get there.<br/><br/>There are stunning performances by the girls grandmother and main investigating cop (Ed Harris, though you wouldn't know it right off), but Freeman is on-screen for a very small amount of time, and Casey is so dense he becomes impenetrable.<br/><br/>Having said this, 'Gone Baby Gone', remains an intriguing, tempered film, deftly Scripted and Directed by an actor whose talent can no longer, be disputed.<br/><br/>No wonder Ben Affleck's reputation in inner-circles Holloywood, is consistently more flattering than tabloid news reports."

"blanche-2","8","0","0","3 January 2010"," Excellent, and a great directorial debut for Ben Affleck
","Ben Affleck has taken a lot of criticism in recent years; kudos to him for staying in the fight. Here he makes his directorial debut in ""Gone Baby Gone,"" and takes a hand in the screenplay with Aaron Stockard. The story's pedigree is excellent, as it's based on a book by the author of ""Mystic River,"" Dennis Lehane.<br/><br/>Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan are private investigators in Dorchester, Massachusetts, who are hired by the family of a kidnapped four-year-old girl. Though the police are on the case, it's felt that these two have some good connections and can get people to talk. It turns out to be a much more complicated situation than they realized, and comes down to, finally, a moral dilemma for the detectives.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris are the law here and give excellent performances, as does the low-key Affleck, who plays his role very realistically. Monaghan is very good with him, and their conflict is an interesting one that you'll be giving quite a bit of thought about after you see this film.<br/><br/>Having watched a lot of Nancy Grace, I don't have any doubt what I would do, but everyone will come away with a different opinion, I think. Truly a stunning film, murky, and capturing the working class atmosphere of Dorchester and the society we live in, where there are no easy answers anymore, if there ever were."

","The story drives me crazy because I can't help feeling for that little girl. This is a sign that the performances are really quite good. Casey Affleck plays a guy who is moral but tightly wound. His Catholic affiliations are always on the front burner. Do we as a society have a right to intervene when the parent of a child is just despicable. Is this grounds for trying to set things right. I believe what is good about both the book and the movie is that there are no simple answers and we have to, at times, deal in some absolutes. The performances here are very good and I liked that violence is not laughed off. When Affleck's character kills a man, he is haunted by the image and fear for his mortal soul. There are, of course, more questions but I am not going to throw in any spoilers. The performances are quite outstanding and touch at the heart."

","Kidnapped girl. White trash parents. Rookie detective/cop looking to redeem him/herself. Seedy underworld. Yada Yada.<br/><br/>That's what I thought going into this. I should have known better when I knew quite well that the script is based on a book by Dennis Lehane, a Boston-based writer that I've come to really admire the last few years from works like ""Coronado"" and ""Mystic River."" Like ""River,"" ""Gone Baby Gone"" delivers a fairly realistic portrait of working class Beantown, layered with characters that while on the surface seem a little hacked from the same template, reveal layer after layer of gray, never making you feel very good about them or about yourself by comparison.<br/><br/>I really admired two things about this film. First, the way it takes you down one path so sincerely, really involving you in a story, then just dead-ends. You look at the clock going...""Uh, right...there's an HOUR left in the movie."" Then you start down another, much shorter, corridor...and it dead-ends too. Then you start the final act, which takes you in another direction entirely, though in retrospect it ties everything else up and --- for me --- creates a satisfying denouement.<br/><br/>I know many people will take issue with that, but that's the second thing I like about the film's story. It has a strong moral center. It really challenges you to take your emotion out of your judgments and view right and wrong for what they are. I don't want to say any more, as I know if I had known more about the plot, this movie wouldn't have been even remotely as enjoyable. It's a good ride.<br/><br/>The casting is knock-out. You get an exceptionally strong break-out perf from Casey Affleck, who I had only seen in smaller supporting roles prior to this (with the exception of ""Gerry"") and not what you expect from veteran character actors like Amy Madigan, Amy Ryan, Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman (which really surprises me), and John Ashton, who's always wonderful, and whom we still see far too little of."

Though the police, played by Ed Harris and John Ashton, are initially reluctant to help, they end up working together to solve the case, but there is far more to the kidnapping then it first appears. Not all of it makes sense, but so engaging are the performances and so poignant the issues at stake that it isn't hard to look past them and get dragged into the story.<br/><br/>The Performances: Casey Affleck received a lot of completely undue criticism for what is a fine performance which would have earned many other actors an Oscar nod, Michelle Monaghan is quite good as his girlfriend and the conscience of the story, Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman as usual are absolutely superb, as is Amy Ryan and there really isn't a weak link on the acting side.<br/><br/>Gone Baby Gone is a thought provoking, though in many ways ludicrous story, grounded by gritty performances and skillfully put together by an under rated director.

A child disappears, investigators search for clues, drugs and money are exchanged, a plot is uncovered, the child returns back into the crack-addict mom's hands. At the end, she even asks the Patrick Kenzie to watch her child as she goes on a date. She is still living in her shitty, gang-ridden neighborhood. The girl would have been better off, morally and justified, if she was living with one of the detectives. I wasn't surprised at the movie. Nothing really new was discovered. On top of it all, there is a lot of vulgar language. I think I counted the F word about a hundred times in 1 hour of viewing this film.

","This movie is what you call a can't miss movie it has all the makings of a great film and let me be say that it is a great crime film at that, probably one of the best since Street Kings and Narc. It's execution and style almost borders on Noir and it does so with oh so much style and grace. Ben Affleck proves that he's as good an actor and screenplay writer(Good Will Hunting) as he is a director. Ben Affleck surpasses his previous screenplay which he won the Oscar for( which was just as good here) and creates an intricately woven and malicious Crime Mystery.<br/><br/>When I first heard about this movie I had absolutely no interest in crime films I was more into Sci-Fi then crime. But now after almost three years and finally deciding to see this film I'm glad I did. This crime drama is powerful in it's execution and sinister in it's play on words and scenarios. It moves along like a wicked little machine taking you here and there and everywhere in it's story all the while keeping you totally in tune with the plot and the going on's of the film. It's so wrapped up in it's story that when you start watching it your slowly but surely drawn in and to tell you the truth this movie won't let you out until it's over and done with. This movie has a very well rounded cast of actors that all display there talents above there normal status quot, Casey Affleck is one who stood out in this film his strong performance drove this film and made it something more than just your run of the mill crime film, his performance stole the show him and Ed Harris blew away anything they've done in the past and have made a strong stand here and came out on top. Michelle Monaghan was beautiful as always but she got sandwiched by Cast Affleck and Ed Harris' strong performances and is almost a throw away in the film(which her character was anyways.) Morgan Freeman who's small but pivotal role was not a scene stealer but he did exceptionally well for the time he was on screen.<br/><br/>All in all this film is something you can't miss, it's a study in the devious corrupt nature of man and the true meaning of justice for children. It's a film that you can see over and over again and it will still have the same affect as the first time you watched it. It's a devious ride of sin, lies , love and making the right choices even if they affect those around you. Gone Baby Gone is a movie that is going down in the crime section as one of the best of all time, and it rightfully deserves it this films delivers non-stop mystery and deceit that is hypnotizing and engrossing, All in all this is a can't miss thought provoking Crime drama that must be seen to be believed. Gone Baby Gone delivers."

","I don't know a whole lot about how well this movie did in fests, at box offices or with the awards ceremonies...have to look that up soon. All I know is, Ben Affleck ought to be given lots of awards for this. It is an outstanding drama and a nail biting thriller. A superb cast including Casey Affleck, Titus Welliver, Ed Harris, and Morgan Freeman (who is incapable of anything less than perfect acting) about the abduction of a tot in Beantown, and how members of her family hire 2 private investigators to ""augment"" the search, GONE BABY GONE should seal Ben Affleck's talent and credibility once and for all.<br/><br/>There is not much negative I can say about it. The only problem I had was a few too many F words every other sentence at first, but after some time, it toned down a bit. It wasn't any worse than GOOD WILL HUNTING, and the Southie of Boston is not a sweet, cuddly neighborhood.<br/><br/>The plot is as twisty and complex as any high quality thriller you can compare it to, including one of my recent ""brilliant but cancelled"" TV series, KIDNAPPED. The acting, writing and cinematography are top quality. Casey Affleck gives a wonderful performance as the main character from whose viewpoint the story is given.<br/><br/>The ending is not easy to watch, resulting from a dilemma about morals and ethics. You feel angry, but you're not sure who to be angry at, and you're not sure if there was any way for the story to come out well from all angles. The ending is another reason this film is excellent. Nothing is force fed to you, and you make your own decision whether things should have been done the way Patrick did them.<br/><br/>I'll give it an A+."

","When you're a novice director, it helps to have an ex-studio honcho help you. Co-producer Alan Ladd.Jr had variously headed up Fox, MGM/UA, and his own The Ladd Company. However, a film still needs a strong screenplay......and the rest. GBG(2007) delivers all that at virtually stratospheric gravitas level.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck maintains a surprising pace in his directorial debut because he is both brave, and has a lot to tell. And maybe it's Ladd's influence, but GBG shows true ""vision"": the film's style of telling suits its subject-matter, and it poses its clever ideas audience-inclusively, without sugar-hit/adrenalin/overly-emotive score manipulations. Giving people exactly (and only) what they want is pandering; whereas offering them brands of antisocial insanity becomes unworthy of distribution.<br/><br/>Affleck certainly does not pander to anyone here. That was unlikely, since the Affleck brothers (as well as the original author) are all smart ""Southies"" from Boston's working-class Dorchester, where GBG is set. The director was certainly ""writing what he knew"" when he co-adapted the fourth of Dennis Lehane's pentology of private investigator novels with Aaron Stockard.<br/><br/>The opening documentary montage imperceptibly blends Affleck's fictional scenes on the street, thanks to his deft directorial hand. Patrick Kenzie's morose narration sets a sombre tone of survival in this harsh world of scarred people; the (real) montage had revealed a shocking number of wheelchair-bound, accident-prone gunshot victims.<br/><br/>The younger Affleck (Oceans' 11-13) is a revelation as the ""31yr-old"" PI, business-partnered with his live-in girlfriend Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan, Eagle Eye(2008)). Their relationship seems confusing until you realize that despite inexperience with serious missing persons cases, they're actually great at finding people desperate to disappear. So.....just like that, the writers turned their ""liability"" into advantage.<br/><br/>Kenzie's droning about the farcical police presence at the missing toddler's home cleverly draws us into his professional skepticism. Surprisingly, the police captain himself heads up the search. Capt.Doyle (the deeply trustworthy Morgan Freeman) promises dutiful police co-operation to these competing PIs by way of his detective Remy Bressant (Ed Harris).<br/><br/>The plot races ahead, in keeping with the speed of recovery being of essence in kidnapping cases. Layers of the shocking truth begin to peel away with the discovery that Amanda's mother Helene (Oscar-nominated Amy Ryan) is extremely ""working-class"", and is probably causally involved--as the intended target. Clever Kenzie misses nothing in his investigation of her, the local barflies, or Bressant.<br/><br/>Within 3days the case unfolds to a shocking apparent result, but no body is found, despite Angie flinging herself into a quarryful of water to save the little girl. Unfortunately we're never allowed to appreciate Angie's true desperation, because it implied the deeper story, so her/extra scenes were dropped--unbalancing the PI duo.<br/><br/>This reveals GBG's one flaw: Affleck's overeagerness to mire his audience.<br/><br/>The nighttime quarry scene wasn't staged well enough to properly hint the plot. Deliberately unlit and haphazard, it forced us to catch sight of Angie too late for our emotional involvement. As McTiernan admitted about HIS similar-case Russian cook in Hunt_for_Red_October(1990), the ""seeding was frail"". Audiences should have kept emotional pace with Angie our co-protagonist--or else why have her--but the need to confuse us overwhelmed the young director. (Taking your audience out of the movie is NOT THE SAME as having them give up hope for the kidnap victim!)<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Ben Affleck must be commended for his courageous choice of stalling the plot halfway. Of course, this occurs in Lehane's book, too, but Affleck is so confident that he has the film's second half return to the ""same"" insoluble Dorchester despondency with Kenzie's morose narration--lulling the audience into a false ignorance.<br/><br/>When the case re-ignites in a different direction, Kenzie can't resist walking alone into the home of a suspected paedophile. What happens next makes us question who, if anyone, should ever be allowed to carry a gun, yet some things still don't add up. Ever-vigilant, Kenzie drags his employer, little Amanda's uncle Lionel (Titus Welliver, he of the handlebar moustache), into the local pub for a confession.<br/><br/>Lionel's revelations constitute Lehane at his best, as the avuncular alcoholic finally falls off the wagon. His dialogue just gets more powerful the longer Lionel talks, since the plot now raises the dilemma of ""mothercare"" within harsh communities, when the mother is herself a product of generational poverty/neglect.<br/><br/>Rabbit-proof Fence(2002) punched out Australia's similar history in this regard; GBG(2007) now raises/augments the argument by reminding us of the consequences even WHEN we're ""wise as serpents yet innocent as doves"".<br/><br/>So it's breathtaking for a first-time director to tackle such a deep, structurally unusual film yet still get both story and execution close to perfect. GBG's vision and style, subcultural authenticity and devastating perspective make it far more deserving than the one Oscar nomination it failed to win. We are indebted to all three amazing writers; together they satisfyingly ask all the right questions, and galvanize the morose reality.<br/><br/>Their gutsy movie pulls no punches depicting this situation's moral inertia, either. A lesser film might not have known how to finish, but GBG's ending was always anchored by the reveal of underbelly subculture remaining more-or-less the same. Despite the family upheaval, little Amanda still loses. The film's deepest indictment of underbelly mothercare is represented by Helene's neglectful ignorance of her daughter's doll's name. Throughout the movie we know it as Mirabelle from news reports, until the toddler corrects her stunned babysitter in the very last scene. Such powerful writing is due no doubt to Lehane's previous years as a counsellor of abused children.<br/><br/>Everyone is superbly cast, but ""Taggart""(John Ashton, Beverly Hills Cop(1984)) steals the show for simply not aging in 23yrs!.....The unexplained lack of Oscars still bothers me. Perhaps GBG's audiences (and critics) became uncomfortable stuck in their moral muddle, plus angry over being deliberately mired by the director, but other than its ""obfuscation scene"", GBG is pretty flawless. Thank you Afflecks, Lehane and Stockard, Alan Ladd.Jr, Jill Quigg, and Dorchester.(9/10)."

","I hate Ben Affleck like poison, hated every role he's done - and I've seen Dogma and Chasing Amy. So it was with more than a little trepidation that I slapped this DVD into my drive wondering if I've wasted my money. But I have to give credit where it's due, he's more than passed muster with this film.<br/><br/>Dennis Lehane's source material has good characters as usual, although the story might be predictable to more seasoned film lovers. Everyone puts in a good performance with perhaps Casey Affleck being the weakest. That would be because his role was the most complicated, at turns considered and shooting from the hip. Still, in a movie of this caliber it's like saying that the second flautist was the weakest player in the Boston Philharmonic. Unless you're looking to criticize, you won't really notice.<br/><br/>The movie is pure Hollywood, it doesn't break any new ground nor are there any moments in the film that the film geeks will rant and rave about. But it's Affleck's first film - there's plenty of time later for him to improve if he wants to be Kubrick. If you enjoy a good movie, sit back and watch this one. I heartily encourage Affleck to continue pursuing directing and maybe give the acting a miss for as long as possible."

","I was really optimistic about Ben Affleck creating a legacy in Movies as a writer/director. Dogma, which is one of my fave pics, was such a masterpiece at the time it was released. A rebel movie for the mid 90s teenager. And then a few years later he made Gigli, a movie i will reserve comment on as i might be banned from ever reviewing again. Im glad to say that he has redeemed himself with this absolute gem of a movie.<br/><br/>I wont go into the storyline as you can get that from the synopsis, but i will delve briefly into the the issues this movie tackles as well as the performance and general production value review. Casy Affleck is, I believe, a real find, a character that comes across as you average Joe, but still with a gleam of intensity. The movie is about a kidnapping but the story revolves around him. What was great was that although i wanted the girl to be found, i found myself more interested in how events would influence him. The filthiness of Boston's underworld was so elegantly conveyed by intermediate editing before focus was shifted to characters, so we are submersed (if you allow yourself to be) into the very environment that this kidnapped girl is being subjected to. The music and camera work was so perfectly in sync that at times i experienced a noir, Gothic feeling even though it was only Boston The decisions our protagonists has to endure were so emotional that you start questioning whether your personal morals and values, things you never questioned before were actually sincere to your fellow man or only to yourself. Its easy to chose between right and wrong, but what happens when you have to choose between a right decision and a ""righter"" one.* I hope Ben keeps it in this vain, and continues to churn out classics, that ask us to be better citizens of the world. Well Done *I still don't know which would have been the righter one. (better check it out so you know what I mean)"
"lexo1770","8","0","0","8 December 2008"," Ben Affleck a genius? Get out of town!
","Ben Affleck's film career has been, as they say, ""chequered"", meaning that his resume consists of a lot of total dogs and a small handful of nice appearances here and there. Up until very lately, I had always been inclined to agree with the British film critic David Thomson, who wrote in 2004 that Affleck was ""lucky to have got away with it so far"".<br/><br/>Because Affleck really isn't a very good actor, or at any rate not a consistently good one. When Kevin Smith attempts to hang an entire movie on an Affleck performance (Chasing Amy, Dogma) Affleck looks wooden, but when Smith brings the actor in for a quick, mischievous cameo, he seems to be galvanised - he is effective as a thuggish boyfriend in Mallrats, and his smirking few minutes as both Holden and as himself in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back are good fun.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, though, anyone who can see the point of Pearl Harbor or Gigli needs to gain some serious perspective. Then, in 2006, he delivered an unexpectedly lovely performance as the fading actor George Reeves in Hollywoodland - overweight, sagging, stoical and with a touching sense of faded glamour. When we in our house heard that he'd a.) directed a movie and b.) it was supposed to be pretty good, we were interested - mildly.<br/><br/>I started watching Gone Baby Gone with a sense of let's-just-give-this-ten-minutes, and it says much for Affleck's sense of pace that the movie is, to be begin with, both thoroughly unenjoyable and totally gripping. It's a subject which has a lot to say to any parent: the four-year-old daughter of a working-class Boston woman (Amy Ryan) has gone missing, and two private investigators (Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan) are asked by the woman's sister-in-law to help with the police investigation. The initial twist is that Helene, the mother, is a deeply unsympathetic character; she's a bored, slobbish, neglectful mother who drinks beer in the middle of the day and seems almost uninterested in what has happened to her daughter.<br/><br/>Before the film is over, you will have changed your mind several times about Helene, and indeed about pretty much every other character. The film starts like a detective thriller, but it isn't one really. It's a highly intelligent and subversive film about family and morality and the cost of doing the right thing.<br/><br/>Full marks to an excellent cast. To begin with I found Casey Affleck's voice sort of irritating, but his performance is actually very subtle; the film plays very well on his capacity for blue-eyed innocence. Amy Ryan is truly remarkable as Helene. Everybody else is just spot on; there's a scene in a bar, featuring mostly non-professional actors, that makes you marvel at how unbelievably unfriendly the modern American drinking hole can be.<br/><br/>My admiration for Gone Baby Gone grew as it went on and I'm glad I watched it to the end. The final image, a simple shot of two people sitting on a sofa watching television, is one of the saddest and grimmest moments I've seen as a film-goer recently. The film sticks in the mind. Affleck should make more films as a director, because on the strength of this movie he already deserves a more illustrious place in cinema history than his acting has so far managed to earn him."

","Really a shame that Ben Afleck diluted the books characters, and plot with a poor screenplay and miscasting of the main characters.<br/><br/>When I read the Denis Lehane book I fell in love with the characters Patrick and Angie. The book gave me the impression that Patrick was a dark, hard-drinking private eye, who could handle himself in a fight. I pictured him around 6-1, 190lbs. Denis Leary would have been my choice for the part. Angie in my mind was a voluptuous Italian girl, who would swear back at the tough guys, but had a heart of gold. Casey Afleck, and Michelle Monaghan were OK, but Casey Afleck is about 140 soaking wet. Remember the bar scene, he can't even put down a guy who was shot twice by the bartender. Angie(Monaghan)is pretty but without the curves needed to fill Angie's character. Amy Ryan did a great job. There are about 3 other Lehane books with Patrick and Angie...and it would have been great if the first movie started with actors who could fill the whole of the character."

","Ben Affleck an actor who has been unfairly criticized for his choices as an actor, walks behind the camera for his directorial debut in 'Gone Baby Gone'. A story set in Boston, Casey Affleck, a private investigator, is given the task of finding the whereabouts of a missing child.<br/><br/>The premise has the opportunity to propel this film into a suspenseful and thoughtful study into missing child cases. Although it does have its moments of intensity and suspense, there is not much subtlety in trying to cover the obvious red herrings and the eventual outcome. <br/><br/>If one considers the character Casey Affleck plays, who is supposedly known locally, he approaches his investigation with brash disregard for sensibility - where is the logic of antagonising the local community especially when you are already on first-name terms? Casey Affleck's partner Michelle Monaghan acts rather against character near the finale, used rather as a tool to fortify the difficult predicament that Casey Affleck already faces, which I felt was not necessary.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck does a good job behind the lens but the story to me is rather contrived in order to reach its eventual conclusion of an insurmountably tough moral choice."

","Casey Affleck is nominated for best supporting actor in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford; the results of which will be known within a week of the writing of this review. Affleck will probably not win, but he certainly deserves the nomination. In my mind, he is the star of The Assassination... - a film I did not enjoy even though the acting and the production values were superior. In my mind, if you want to see Casey Affleck at his very best thus far, watch Gone Baby Gone.<br/><br/>Gone Baby Gone is a gritty morality tale directed and co-authored by Casey's more famous brother, Ben. It is one of four novels know as the Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro mysteries written by Dennis Lehane. The story takes place in a working-class neighborhood of Boston where there is nothing glamorous - drugs and crime seem to reign supreme in this place where the residents eke out meager subsistence. Kenzie and Gennaro are asked by the relatives of a missing girl to take up the search as they feel that the police are not doing their best efforts.<br/><br/>The missing girl's mother, Helene McCready, is an addicted slattern who doesn't seem worthy of motherhood or, for that matter, any modicum of human sympathy. In the part of McCready is Amy Ryan who is nominated for an Oscar as best supporting actress. Ryan surely deserves the nomination for she gives us a character whom we must certainly hate, but for whom we feel sympathy. Ryan is really good in this part.<br/><br/>As the investigation proceeds there are many twists and turns - none of which I'll relate in fear of spoiling the film for anyone who has not yet seen it. In the end, it all comes down to a weighty moral decision that must be made by investigator Kenzie. I must admit that I do not agree with his decision, but the superior acting of Casey Affleck enables me to understand the choices made by Kenzie.<br/><br/>These two Affleck brothers are a powerhouse of talent, and I am sure that their gifts to cinema will continue for many years to come. They both know the Boston neighborhood and the people who inhabit that space and bring nobility to persons who would most surely be considered ignoble by the majority of society."

","...perhaps because ""Gone Baby Gone"" is apparently near and dear to his heart. Based on the novel from the guy who wrote ""Mystic River,"" with a decent screenplay by newbie Aaron Stockard, ""Gone Baby Gone"" is set firmly in the midst of Affleck's beloved Boston; ""Beantown"" ambiance permeates the film thanks to some superb 2d-unit photography and the wholesale cooperation of the neighborhoods involved, all the better to tell a gritty little tale of kidnap, murder, and subterfuge. The ensemble cast, headed by the director's younger brother, Casey ""Soul Survivors"" Affleck, is near-perfect, its weakest link being Michelle ""Eagle Eye"" Monaghan, and even she's really not terrible, just not quite credible as Affleck's partner in the private investigation game. Standouts include Amy ""The Wire"" Ryan as the white-trash mother of the kidnapped child, Amy ""Field of Dreams"" Madigan and Titus ""Deadwood"" Welliver as concerned relatives, Ed ""The Abyss"" Harris and John ""Beverly Hills Cop"" Ashton as the cops involved, along with the ever-reliable Morgan ""need you ask?"" Freeman as the final link in the mystery that young Affleck's P.I. is trying to solve. Beautifully framed and shot by John ""Tropic Thunder"" Toll, scored without too much overt manipulation by Harry ""Shrek"" Gregson-Williams, and with great production values for a sub-$20mil venture, ""Gone Baby Gone"" may be a tad predictable, but is still an engrossing melodrama deserving of the time spent watching it. The younger Affleck proves that his work in ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" was no fluke, and the elder amply demonstrates that his talents behind the camera may well exceed those in front of it."
"ametaphysicalshark","Null","0","0","3 October 2008"," Surprisingly excellent, well-acted directorial debut from Ben Affleck
","Adapted from the (very good) novel by Dennis Lehane, ""Gone Baby Gone"" is a powerhouse of a directorial debut from Ben Affleck, and is an unexpectedly excellent, powerful crime drama with, thankfully, a sense of realism and authenticity required not only for the film to be good but for the subject matter to feel deserving of dramatization as opposed to ending up as mere sensationalism.<br/><br/>Although Dennis Lehane is quite a talented author I find much of his work suffers from long passages of prose which ultimately prove to be purely masturbatory and do nothing to enhance the novel. If you're going to do that sort of thing you better be darn good at it but a lot of his work ends up coming off as sub-Elmore Leonard. On the other hand he can boast a brilliant sense of character, setting, pace, and the ability to write stunningly realistic and involving dialogue. One doesn't need to look past his episodes for television masterwork ""The Wire"" to see this. All that's needed to adapt one of his novels well for the screen is a talented, intelligent screenwriter and as much as ""Mystic River"" was praised to the high heavens, and as much as I love Clint Eastwood's work as director, ""Mystic River"" was simply a flat, bland screenplay filled with flat, bland characters which was adapted from a novel with nothing but involving, interesting characters. Do Ben Affleck and Aaron Stockard succeed in not only staying true to the novel in style and sensibility, but bringing the characters, the dialogue, the sense of authenticity to the screen? <br/><br/>Yes, they do. This screenplay is a triumph. It's about as good as it possibly could have been, and considering the subject matter and all that could have gone wrong, how much of it could have felt sensationalist, how the twists and turns in the tale could have felt like a cheap soap opera rather than proper drama, it's just an incredibly intelligent and tasteful script. Similarly Ben Affleck's debut effort as director (er... not counting a certain short from the early 90's...) is quite excellent, showing not only the quality handling of actors which you might expect from an actor-turned-director, but a wonderful ability to use shots to their full effect, a real sense of position and narrative place, a real sort of naturalistic style. There's one wide, far-away shot late in the film, coming after an especially claustrophobic scene, which is just beautifully-shot.<br/><br/>The Kinzie/Gennaro novels are Lehane's attempt at hardboiled genre fiction. They usually contain more humor, more self-conscious style, and more general light-heartedness than ""Gone Baby Gone"" did. Lehane successfully created a hardboiled crime novel which dealt with very touchy subject matter (an investigation into the potential abduction/molestation of a child) but never felt like a genre piece unworthy of its subject matter. It never felt sensationalist, and being Ben Affleck's favorite novel it's not all that surprising that he manages to bring the same sort of sensibility to the film version of the story- it's both a tremendously effective genre piece and a powerful piece of drama. This is genuinely good, exceptionally well-acted stuff, featuring one of two excellent Casey Affleck performances from 2007. <br/><br/>8.5/10"

","There's an interesting though flawed story in Gone Baby Gone, but what is most notable about the film is actually its fascinating view of the underside of a working class Boston neighborhood. There is a very authentic feel to the characters and situations. You can't call it a love letter to Boston, since it deals with the seedier parts, but there is a genuine affection for this world.<br/><br/>In structure this is a detective movie. At times it made me think of Raymond Chandler's novels, not for the style, which is decidedly different, but for the distinct, interesting characters and the rather convoluted and unlikely story.<br/><br/>Performances are terrific across the board, particularly from Casey Affleck and Ed Harris.<br/><br/>The weakest element in the movie is the character of Patrick's wife Angie. The problem is not the acting (although the actress does come across as a little too stylish for her working class neighborhood), the problem is that the character seems superfluous. She is said to be Patrick's partner in the detective business, yet she acts simply as a tag along. She really doesn't do anything, take any actions, come up with any ideas; she mainly just tells Patrick everything he's thinking of doing is a mistake. If they'd just made her his wife this would have been fine, but it just seems weird to make her his partner since she seems to bring nothing to the partnership.<br/><br/>Still, it's beautifully directed and acted and the plot has some interesting ideas, although not much one could actually call a surprise. It is overall an excellent film."

","I'm still ambivalent about this movie. There's questions about the plotting that mean I'll really need to watch it again - at least that won't be so tough an ask as it is with the bulk of the movies I see.<br/><br/>The one thing that I do immediately give the writers and makers of this film credit for, though, is for taking on complex issues up-front, and not ducking and hiding from them, or finding convenient coincidences to ease difficult decisions. They face up to the questions of, say, the sort of people who shouldn't be allowed to have children even if they were the last people on earth, of the value of the life of even the lowest coke-dealing, drug addict, child molesting scum, and of just why it is that so many children are left in, or given back, to the care of parents like these. I've never been able to understand the thought processes of government bureaucrats and court arbiters and police who make and enforce the decisions that see screaming children torn from the arms of loving grandparents or carers to be handed back to aggressive, drug or alcohol affected parents, only for, predictably, those same kids to turn up dead or brain damaged in a short space of time. Casey Affleck's character's explanation for his actions makes a stab at explaining why such decisions get made, and sure enough, mistaken and all as they might be, at least they're made in good conscience.<br/><br/>Whether that excuses them is another matter. Casey manages to shatter the lives of himself and his girlfriend, of Lionel and Bea, and of Doyle and his wife, while not providing any conceivable benefit to the little girl. In fact, the final scene seems to point to her long-term detriment. Does he wonder about the correctness of his decision? We can only wonder too.<br/><br/>The film was fascinating, thought-provoking, well-made and well-acted. It's the best Ed Harris performance I've seen for a while, and Casey Affleck was very good, although it'd be nice to see Michelle Monaghan get a role that didn't just require her to look pretty (which she is, of course).

All the performances in the film are superb, with in depth character studies, and the direction maintaining a tone of objectivity and compassion throughout.<br/><br/>Our reaction was, and that of many in the audience, that 'Gone, baby, gone' left one asking oneself, and debating with family and friends, some very tough questions, about the very relevant-to-our-times issues raised in the movie, long after leaving the theatre."
"jpschapira","8","0","0","14 August 2008"," What would you do?
","This is a film about moral dilemmas, about which side you take and about what you decide to do with the things you know because of how you think they'll affect you in the future; and it's directed by Ben Affleck. I don't point this out as a major thing, but the truth is I never quite liked Affleck neither quite disliked himHis ""Gone Baby Gone"" made me choose one side: I like the man. <br/><br/>Based on a novel by Denis Lehane (the man who wrote ""Mystic River""), Affleck and Aaron Stockard tell the story of Patrick (Casey Affleck), a private detective who has never left his neighborhood and sometimes takes care of finding those people the rest don't feel they have to find anymore. With his camera, courtesy of John Toll's photography (one with beautifully constructed images and sequences, if I may say), Affleck makes sure that we feel the familiarity that the main character shares with the neighborhood. Peacefully he lets us see the streets, the people who walk them and a sense of security provided by Harry Gregson- Williams' score. <br/><br/>But of course, every place that appears really safe never is, and soon Patrick and his girlfriend Angie (an unexpected portrayal by Michelle Monaghan) find themselves in the middle of the solving of the abduction of a little girl that's all over the news. She's Amanda, the daughter of Helene (a solid Amy Ryan, though not amazing as everyone said), a drug addict and clearly unstable woman who took her daughter to the bar where she consumed as she was consuming. <br/><br/>The character of Helene is the first and the main moral aspect that Affleck provides in his movie. Throughout the film Patrick will encounter individuals he knows-after all, he's lived in the town his whole life, and he says it- and meet others he doesn't, of whom most also have deep moral concerns. Two key players are Remy Bressant and Jack Doyle, policemen played brilliantly by Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman, respectively. <br/><br/>Affleck's narrative as a first time director is absolutely impressive, as he puts the Patrick character in the middle of the tale as the individual who not only knows more about what's going on, but apparently wants to know more than the rest. Morality takes over his actions, as he looks like Jack Nicholson's role in ""The Pledge""; a man with a promise to keep, no matter what. <br/><br/>What's great about Patrick is that he slowly starts realizing he cares more about what he's investigating than the rest, and this makes him suspect. The thing is that, masterfully after an hour of film, Affleck makes us believe the case is close and provides Patrick with one of those speeches that usually appear when films end. So maybe personally Patrick's not so consumed with his investigation, but he inevitably becomes consumed afterwards, because of some revealing conversations that activate his thoughts again, and because he realizes the person he cares about the most is driving more away from him as time goes by. <br/><br/>Without question, there are two keys to the success of ""Gone Baby Gone"", more a personal drama than the resolution of an apparent crime (as ""Mystic River"" was). The first one is Casey Affleck's starring performance. I wonder what it would be like to be directed by your brother. I suppose it would be fun, because here Casey delivers a perfect portrayal in what represents his first major role in twenty years of acting. <br/><br/>The second key (though we already knew about this, because of what Affleck did alongside Matt Damon with ""Good Will Hunting) is the script: so plausible, unpretentious and connected to reality, it shows its magic with emphasis in two conversations; one that Patrick has with the Harris character and another one he has with the Freeman character. <br/><br/>And it's like Matsan (who wished the film had ended at the conversation with Freeman) said: in a very good movie that doesn't take sides and leaves the decision to the viewerWhat would you do?"

","This movie was above average. I liked it and didn't guess the twist at the end. My only complaint is some of the bad language could have been left out. I don't think is was necessary. A woman hires two investigators to help the police with the disappearance of her niece. The child's mother is a drug addict and liar. The PI put together clues and figure out what happened to the child. It's over drugs and money and work out a plan to get the kid back. But things go wrong. It's several months later and one of the PI, Patrick, gets a lead on another case about a molester. He does something shocking and figures out the case with the little girl may not be completely over based on a conversation with one of the cops.

"pyrocitor","9","0","0","23 July 2008"," Emotionally harrowing, mesmerizing crime mystery
","""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" goes the timeless saying, and such is a maxim increasingly applied to the film industry through the years. Though originality and strikingly fresh and new ideas are often sought as the storytelling ideal, there remains something to be said for a not all together unfamiliar but resoundingly quality effort within known parameters. It is on this front that Gone Baby Gone proves a rousing success - despite being primarily recognized as another crime mystery by the author of the more renowned Mystic River, the film proves such a staunchly quality package to warrant differentiation, as well as being recognized as the emotionally harrowing, gripping and flat out powerful mini-masterpiece that it is.<br/><br/>While the story, adapted from the Dennis Lehane novel, is well tread ground for those experienced in the crime or mystery genres, making some of the more crucial plot twists apparent before the fact, it scarcely detracts from the execution, beautifully elegant in its simplicity. Touching upon themes of class struggles, moral ambiguity, corruption as well as Catholic introspection worthy of Scorsese (Mean Streets is an obvious influence), the sheer authenticity on display makes for a genuinely compelling immersion into the slums of Boston in all of their sleaze and grit. These are real people having real interaction in real environments, transfixing the viewer by the near complete absence of Hollywood showiness or sugar-coating - rather than a finely tuned script, the impression is given of peeking over the shoulder of those interacting in real life, and the picture is more often than not a pretty one. <br/><br/>Director Ben Affleck seems to have found his true calling with this remarkable directorial debut, as both his stellar script (co-written by Aaron Stockard) and emotionally charged directorial presence throb with passion and dedication for the film. Keeping the pace reflective and riveting without ever having to rush, Affleck holds the tension on a slow burn throughout while retaining every ounce of emotional intensity - the result being a slow, steadily affecting immersion in the story, making each twist all the more gripping, each raw human interaction all the more draining and eerily moving. Some beautiful cinematography, sublime editing and an affecting, minimalist score which only on occasion falls back on convention complete the stunning overall product<br/><br/>Casey Affleck cements his status as a genuinely bankable leading man as rough but vulnerable investigator Patrick Kenzie, as his truly powerful, stoic, brooding presence anchors the film, his understated simmer and brutish emoting retaining the audience's full sympathies through every twist and turn. In contrast, the highly talented Michelle Monaghan disappointingly proves one of the film's weaker aspects as Kenzie's girlfriend and investigative partner, though not through lack of trying. Despite her best efforts, and impressive fuming in emotionally heated scenes, Monaghan is saddled with an insulting lack of character, often given nothing to do but stand around silently, making for a criminally choppy and underdeveloped character and a waste of considerable dramatic potential. However, Ed Harris proves at the top of his considerable game as an abrasive police officer, a dynamic powerhouse of a performance. Similarly, Morgan Freeman provides his usual quiet dignity and class with a subversive twist as a shady police captain haunted by the death of his daughter, and Freeman's wistful eyes offer uneasy entrance into a damaged soul - a truly affecting and resonating performance. Amy Ryan also impresses as the sleazy, drug addicted mother whose daughter was kidnapped, managing a brusque charm amidst her countless foibles. <br/><br/>Despite few storyline surprises being in store, the real surprise is how flat out mesmerizing the film is, its constant eerie calm and claustrophobic intensity making for a thoroughly riveting and draining watch, near inevitable to haunt viewers for days afterwards. With sturdy, lyrical directing and rock solid performances aplenty, Gone Baby Gone breathes fresh vigour into the hard worn crime drama, easily worth a watch.<br/><br/>-9/10"

","I first heard of this film more given its release date than for the film itself given the (continuing) Madelaine McCann saga. Then with the DVD in front of me, I wasn't sure if it was worth spending an afternoon to watch. Firstly, it's Hollywood so I assume all the characters will be cardboard cut-outs with a plot line simple enough to be understood in Arkansas drive-ins. Wait a minute- Ben Affleck is the director?!?! Come on! No wait, it gets better- it stars his BROTHER! And Morgan Freeman as yet another cop. Not only does this seem like further evidence of extremely lazy casting, but he looks almost a dead ringer for Nelson Mandela who turned 90 this week. And he's supposed to be retiring EARLY in the film! So perhaps all this led me to be pleasantly surprised. The characters don't seem much more developed from standard British cop shows on the telly, but they aren't tarted up either. The plot is complicated without being too complex which allows the view to be involved without being taxes. I do have an issue with some of the twists that seem too contrived, particularly at the end, but in the end the message leaves one actually thinking about one's own personal position- this is after all what made Million Dollar Baby so controversial and successful. The direction is tight, and performances understated. Since the Pearl Harbour debacle Mr. Affleck has really taken his craft seriously and sought to earn respect for his professional development. I certainly recommend this film, writing as a cynic. www.lairdkeir.spaces.live.com"
"TheFluffyKnight","8","0","0","26 June 2008"," Gone Baby Gone
","One of the problems with the film industry is the oft unavoidable delay between inception and release. Whether it be an overlong production, or some outside influence or controversy, the gods of fate will all too often cause a film dealing with or alluding to a current event, to be released after said event has ceased to be current. Such is the case with actor Ben Affleck's directorial debut Gone Baby Gone, whose plot bears striking similarities to the case of four-year-old Madeleine McCann, who was abducted just last year.<br/><br/>This parallel, still fresh in the media memory, is bound to bring just as much publicity as the director, who until 2006s Hollywoodland, had made a career on decidedly lowbrow roles. So it would makes sense that, following one of his few serious roles in the aforementioned film, Affleck would turn his attention to helming a just as serious piece.<br/><br/>And serious it is. Gone Baby Gone, with its urban setting and seedy themes, could easily be described as noir. But absent are the expressionist shadows, fast-talking private eyes, and veiled allusions to unsavoury criminal activity. Instead we have the rundown neighbourhood of Dorchester, Boston. As private investigators Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and Angela Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) scour the community for clues as to the whereabouts of kidnapped four-year-old Amanda McCready, the neighbourhood almost becomes a character in its own right. As shots of neighbours gathered on doorsteps and children playing in the streets contrast with darkly-lit discussions of drugs and child abuse, we really get a sense for the living dichotomy of the neighbourhoods we so often see on the evening news.<br/><br/>Neither does the film shy away from the question that always threatened, but never surfaced during the already mentioned McCann case: how little chance is there of finding this little girl alive? As Captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) tells the two investigators, if the child isn't found within twenty-four hours, only ten percent are ever recovered.<br/><br/>The film's performances perfectly capture this sense of hope, despair, and desperation. As can be expected from his recent Oscar nomination, the younger Affleck makes the role his own. The shy and awkward youngster who half-smiled his way through a myriad of uncomfortable silences in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is still there, but Casey moulds this persona into something tougher, but still hopeful and, in some ways, naïve. Freeman is obviously as professional as ever as the police captain in charge of the search. And Ed Harris delivers another reliably solid performance as a jaded police detective partnered with the private detectives.<br/><br/>But then there's Michelle Monaghan, something of a weak link. This is not a slight against her talent or ability; on the contrary, she is a fine actress, as is most readily observable in the unbelievably entertaining Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. No, the problem comes in the validity of the character. Gennaro has little to do throughout the vast majority of the film. When she is used, she acts as more of a conscience for Kenzie than as a physical element in the narrative. She questions her partners actions, or reassures him when he himself questions them.<br/><br/>Having said this, Gone Baby Gone does sometimes benefit from the presence of a walking, talking moral compass. As the film progresses, our own moral stance is challenged. Without giving the plot away, we join Kenzie in re-evaluating our preconceptions about who is right and wrong when it comes to the protection of children. Please don't take this as meaning that the film sides with child abductors; that would be absurd. But when the parents are distant and neglectful, who is to say what is best for the child? This tricky moral quagmire is accompanied by an equally tricky narrative one. While the first half is a simple search narrative, Gone Baby Gone's second half snakes around so many twists that it is difficult for us, not only to keep track of the plot, but too keep track of who is right and wrong. Characters who seemed good turn bad; characters who seemed bad turn good; and some who seemed good but turned bad, turn good again.<br/><br/>The confusion finds its way into the older Affleck's assured camera work. For the most part, the cinematography adheres to that loose, semi-documentary style that has been favoured in recent years. But occasionally, when the action threatens become as confusing as the plot, we are treated to an almost nauseatingly shaky camera: the characters are unsure of what is going on, and so are we.<br/><br/>When it comes to tally up the box office receipts, it is a shame that a large portion of the money Gone Baby Gone will make will be due to its parallels with recent media events. Because this is a surprisingly well-crafted and assured debut from the always polarising Ben Affleck, and it deserves to be watched and judged under its own merits, of which there are many. As a thriller you could not hope for anything more. And as an exploration of the moral pitfalls of investigating child abuse, well, thoughts will be provoked."

","From the simple basis of a child going missing from her bedroom - with its terrible overtones of the Maddy McCann and Sharron Mathews cases in Britain (completely unintended as the film was made a good year before those cases hit the headlines) - we are taken on a downward spiral into the underbelly of the American Dream. This is a world where, to quote Patrick Kenzie (Casey Afflick), the people were born in the cracks and then fall through them.<br/><br/>Drug dealing, alcoholism, abuse, corruption are all encountered as Kenzie and his assistant Angie Gennaro (the underused Michelle Monaghan) 'assist' the Boston police in their search for young Amanda Mcready. The characters are all, with barely an expectation, the dregs of the earth, and show little, if any, concern for the missing girl, especially when their own interests become threatened. As the plot unravels, and quite a complex one it is too, we begin to realise that this is a film with little hope, either for the missing girl - and a poor young boy who also becomes a victim of the depraved nature of some of the characters - or anyone else caught up in the case.<br/><br/>At the heart of the film lies a moral question - is it right to commit a crime which society finds heinous for what may be the right reasons? It is to the credit of the intelligence of the film that this question is not answered with any easy options, instead it is us that are left to consider our own response to this dilemma.<br/><br/>As one might expect from a film of this quality the performances are universally excellent, from Casey Afflick (building on the promise he showed in 'The Assissin of Jessie James by the coward Robert Ford'), to the ever reliable Morgan Freeman. But the outstanding performance comes from Amy Ryan as the missing girls' mother, a disgusting slice of humanity, who cares more for her drinking, drugs and men than her daughter, who she uses on drugs trips etc. The final scene further emphasises the uncaring nature of the character, and further questions our response to the central moral question.<br/><br/>The direction is also excellent, and you would never guess if you did not already know that this film is a first effort from Ben Afflick. This shows great promise, and it is just possible that American cinema has found another actor/director in the mould of Eastwood and Penn.<br/><br/>This film is never an easy watch, and you will not leave the cinema full of the joys of spring, but it will give you an insight into a part of America that normally remains hidden from view"

","It's refreshing to have people have the guts to do what's right. Patrick did do the right thing.<br/><br/>A person needs to know where they come from and to be with that family unless it is unhealthy to live with. Which in Amanda's case the mother wasn't good for her to live with. But the characters that tried to keep her in a healthy upbringing chose to do it unlawfully. <br/><br/>What I DO NOT UNDERSTAND is, where the heck are the social services? After Amanda came home the social services should have found out how drugged up the mother's past was and put her either with the mother's brother's wife (who obviously loved her) or Patrick or to a healthy loving adoptive parents. I really don't think the ending was realistic at all. It really bothers me. I really like the film, directing, acting, and what not but SERIOUSLY that ending is not realistic! Social services are better than that and I know they wouldn't have had Amanda with her mother if they new about the burns, the drugs, the money, the neglect. Patrick did the right thing. Those cops that kidnapped her were burnt out on their jobs, the mother's brother was confused and desperate, and the girlfriend wasn't thinking with her head but her emotions. It really bothers me to see a character that chooses right against higher power (cops) and against his girlfriend and gets a lousy outcome for doing so. <br/><br/>Again, the movie's ending is not realistic and therefore I cannot give it a 10 out of 10 as i would of liked. I just finished watching the movie, so i""m pretty passionate about what i saw. Patrick did right. And the movie should have been more realistic about the social services.

"dsmith901","6","0","0","22 June 2008"," My view
","This was a better movie than I expected given the fact it was Ben Affleck's first directorial effort and he shamelessly cast his own brother in the lead role. And it is Casey Affleck's performance I felt was the weak point of the film, along with some clumsy scripting in spots. IMO Casey was just not believable in that role, which calls for someone with a lot more substance. His attempts at masculine toughness were somewhat embarrassing. The best I can say for Casey is he did not completely destroy the movie, even if he did seem to be in a semi-trance most of the time. Fortunately for him he was working with some really great actors, though they did overshadow him at every turn. But the success of the movie lies in the story itself, which was both gripping and haunting, as any story of children in danger would be. Ben himself seems to have a good feel for story-telling though his visual style is ordinary at best. His feel for dialogue is not much better - but I realize he is not a master writer and not likely to ever be. My advice to Ben is stick to just the directing - if he leave the scripts, camera work and editing to more talented people he will do just fine. Oh, and stop casting family members in lead roles."

What let my overall impression down were huge holes in the story, quite a few things that didn't make any sense at all, and the absurd desire of the creators to add as many turns and twists to the story as they can possibly squeeze in. Seven people dies to save one little secret? Highly unrealistic. I will not go into divulging any of the spoilers, but the second part of the movie was so hollywoodish, in the worst sense of the word, that it was almost on the verge of laughable. Also, several key scenes were shot hastily and without any respect for the viewer, just to carry on with the unrealistic plot. The bottom line: it is an OK movie, but with some huge gaps in the storyline and direction."

But they encounter some negative vibes off police captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) with his own tragic history with his own child who views them as amateurs and the two heavy handed cops assigned to the case, Detectives Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton) who they are lead to form an uneasy relationship with. Although the family appear distraught, the little girl's home life is revealed to be no bed of roses, with her coke addicted mother Helene (Amy Ryan) and shady relatives. Eventually it appears to have been solved, only for events to take a sinister turn and for things to turn out in a way no one could have expected.<br/><br/>This arrived pretty much out of nowhere for me, and is probably one I wouldn't have bothered with if I hadn't become aware of the plot line and the rave reviews it had received. It turns out it was actually held back due to it's parallels with the Madeleine McCann case and indeed, as a film it does eerily resemble the case, both in the little girl's resemblance to Madeleine and the theme of the home life of her family turning out to be rather undesirable and some scabby family members trying to milk cash out of it. I often tend to disagree with critics who give a lot of films the five star treatment, but they were spot on here as Ben Affleck has proved a better director than actor and has crafted a fittingly bleak, edgy, gritty and exciting thriller full of unexpected twists and turns that keep you hooked right to the end.<br/><br/>With his younger brother in the lead role, we are presented a raw, unflinching film that isn't afraid to show the grimy reality of undesirables living in run down, poor, drug addled areas and the depravity in the trail of child abduction cases. Just when it looks like it's wrapping up and the film's over, but you're sitting there thinking that's ended rather quickly, the film pulls the trick a couple more times until the film gets it's real ending that pays off in a way you couldn't have expected it to.<br/><br/>With such a credited cast list, it's no surprise that some great performances help keep the film afloat, especially the reliably great Freeman and Harris, an actor I could always take or leave before but who here really gives his role as a tough, unflinching cop a vitality and edge that makes him stand out.<br/><br/>Listen to the reviews this time (especially mine!) as this is one of the most well made and satisfying thrillers you'll have seen in a long time. *****"

","There can be no doubt that this is a very controversial subject area. Child abduction is a horrible thing for any parent or relative to contemplate. The film is very interesting in the line it takes and the head it reaches is a thought-provoking (if rather bizarre) dilemma.<br/><br/>Casey Affleck is great as the young detective to investigate the disappearance of a young girl in his neighbourhood (the oh so subtly named Amanda MacCreadey is the girl's character). But of the two, his partner, played by Michelle Monaghan, is far more believable. Morgan Freeman is solid and does a great job of portraying his character during his brief appearances.<br/><br/>Overall though I think my hat is off to Ed Harris, who plays a seriously tough police detective, and is actually quite terrifying at times.<br/><br/>I think the film is a little too on the ""band wagon"" - the parallels to the Madeleine McCann story are too in your face - but it is presented sensitively, and there can be no denial that it has a delicious twist, and the ultimate question is left hanging in a very poignant manner. I'll be interested in seeing how Ben Affleck's directing skills progress."

He treats the subject with such care it's impossible not to like his character, as an actor his is stupendous. Absolutely marvelous.<br/><br/>The tough private eye Patrick Kenzie was raised in a poor and dangerous neighborhood of Boston, and works with his partner and girlfriend Angie Gennaro generally tracking missing losers in debt.<br/><br/>When the four year-old Amanda McCready is abducted from her apartment, her aunt Beatrice 'Bea' McCready calls the police and the press, and the case is highlighted with the spots by the media.

And hell you haven't even seen the movie yet.<br/><br/>Who should see this? Intelligent people. People who want to come out of a movie thinking about what they just saw. People who want to see an incredibly well made film.<br/><br/>It's also one of those rare movies in which it can easily be said that the less you know about the story going in, the richer the experience. There's no clear twist ending to give away, but rather a layered story that unfolds like a Russian stacking doll with a moral dilemma at its core.<br/><br/>My final verdict? Its most likely the best film of 2007. It's definitely part of my top 50 greatest of all time. And unmissable well crafted film that demands your attention even if the subject is to hard to face. A well rounded cast and a beautiful story is merely the tip of the iceberg. Go see it now."

","May I start by saying that I quite like Ben Affleck. Sorry, but there was a real need to write that. I will explain.<br/><br/>Of late Ben Affleck has been on the promotion circuit in the UK. After many delays ""Gone Baby Gone"" has finally gotten itself a UK cinema release. It has been interesting to observe that in literally every single interview with the man, there has been a comment on the supposed antipathy of film critics towards Ben Affleck as an actor.<br/><br/>Well, I certainly wouldn't consider Ben Affleck to be the greatest actor of his generation. He is not even the greatest movie star of his generation, which, of course, has got nothing to do with acting ability. This, as I see it, puts Ben Affleck into the same category as 99% of the actors working today, and those people do not get the same level of criticism.<br/><br/>Who to blame? The tabloids? The fame game? The fact that for a period of time Ben was in love with J-Lo?<br/><br/>Oh, dear. Give the guy a break, will you, please?<br/><br/>So, then. Ben's directorial debut. Will the critics like him more as a débutant Director? Is ""Gone Baby Gone"" worth a look?<br/><br/>Oh, yes. You just might say that.<br/><br/>""Gone Baby Gone"" is, perhaps, not as completely assured a Lehane adaptation as Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"" (the revelatory final 40 minutes maybe could have been paced a little better), but it is frequently a very good and sometimes great movie. Casey Affleck proves that his breakthrough in ""The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford"" was no flash in the pan. His baby faced, quiet and introspective private investigator, with a streak of street wise steel running through him, is just a brilliant piece of work. Definitely one of the performances of the year. Casey Affleck is the pivot around which ""Gone Baby Gone"" turns. He is rarely off screen and easily holds his own against great turns by Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman and the Oscar nominated Amy Ryan. Only Michelle Monaghan is a tad underused as Casey Affleck's sidekick/girlfriend, although she does have a great couple of scenes towards the end.<br/><br/>""Gone Baby Gone"" is much more than just a private investigator/mystery/thriller. It is a throwback to one of those great Robert Altman and Arthur Penn movies of the 1970's. Downbeat, naturalistic, subdued, bleak, with an almost documentary feel. Real streets and real people, not film sets and actors playing it downtrodden and dirty. ""Gone Baby Gone"" swims deeply in some very murky and morally dubious waters. This is the question: How prepared are you to do the correct thing, when it is not necessarily the right thing?<br/><br/>What would you have done when faced with the question posed to Casey Affleck at the end of the film? Do you lose your soul or do you lose your conscience?<br/><br/>See it. ""Gone Baby Gone"" is one of the best films of the year. I cannot recommend it enough."

","Ben Affleck, here directing (!), has bottomed out for a five year stretch on the other side of the camera since starring in 2003's notorious Gigli. There followed a half dozen films you'll not care to remember, wiping out all that good will he generated with Good Will Hunting. It's been easy to forget that Affleck has talent (even an Oscar) ... he just cannot choose projects.<br/><br/>Now, as director, he's making back some ground. He's returned to surer background too  his hometown of Boston and a fractious suburban milieu. This is the setting for a morality plagued mystery-thriller, based on the novel by Dennis Lehane (of Mystic River), but Affleck shows surprising control of sentimentality and builds suspense well. Perhaps not so surprisingly, he works well with his cast - of mostly excellent character actors - to illicit drama that is convincing and persuasive.<br/><br/>That said, if Affleck sits with you on the couch at home, best not let him choose a DVD ... or even hold the TV remote."

","An interesting movie about what happened to a little girl that disappeared, involving characters like the mother of the missing girl, her relatives, the police and private investigators out to find her. The mother of the girl could be characterised as being ""poor white trash"" and there are many nasty possibilities as to her fate.<br/><br/>Casey Affleck plays Patrick Kenzie, one of the private investigators recruited to find the girl. He disconcertingly looks like the love child of Ben Affleck (his famous brother) and David Byrne, of the band Talking Heads, perhaps. HIs partner in the movie is the lovely Michelle Monaghan, who plays Angie Gennaro, his lover & fellow private investigator.<br/><br/>Kenzie's qualities are illustrated in some formulaic scenes which establish his ""tough guy"" credentials, as Hollywood leading men are supposed to have.<br/><br/>This movie strives to be profound, I think, but it does leave unexamined some Hollywood clichés as to what is right & wrong. In any case, it does serve up some interesting dilemmas to engage the viewer.<br/><br/>That is best illustrated by the character of Kenzie. He's meant to be some sort of model of justice and integrity, but really, some of his actions made me squirm and question his morality. The act that most troubled me (and I won't reveal it here) was, I think, a populist appeal to the mob. Plenty of contradictions in Kenzie for people who like their characters complex.<br/><br/>This might be a movie best viewed on DVD so that you can go over scenes to nut out what is going on...a device which is used on TV cop shows would have been useful...a guy just summing up what happened, along with a flashback of it. There was some of that in the movie, but it wasn't entirely easy to follow (with regard to the crucial event at the quarry).<br/><br/>Gennarro is lovely to look at but isn't very well fleshed out. She does have a crucial dilemma of her own to deal with but I was unconvinced by it, as she was otherwise Affleck's handbag for most of the movie.<br/><br/>Dark at times in the subjects it explores...not for the squeamish."

The surface of this movie is pure mystery, a girl's disappearance shakes up the neighborhood - but underneath there lies moral and emotional shimmering, and that's where great acting-performances kicks in; the crackhead-mother is brilliantly played by Amy Ryan, and Ed Harris turns out a rock-hard police-detective, but Casey Affleck's first lead-role as Patrick Kenzie is truly breathtaking, showing his fully capable of a lead role.<br/><br/>This compelling thriller asks difficult questions, and the clues revealed throughout makes it one of the most thrilling movies so far this year.

","I liked this, I really did. Actually, the fact is that I wanted to like it more than I could. It's well told, honestly characterized, and pretty much as the Boston street cops might see it. But, for me, there's a couple of problems... Anyone familiar with the Kenzie/Gennaro series of books absolutely knows that, 1st - Angie is much more of an action person than was given to Michelle to work with. She seems so, well, ""secondary"" to the plot line. In the books she's much more a central figure and quite a bit more outspoken. The second, and perhaps the biggest problem I had with the movie is in the portrayal of Kenzie himself. Kenzie is supposed to be a big guy. Casey Affleck isn't. Kenzie is MUCH more action oriented. Again, not so for Affleck. His director brother, Ben, seems to be trying to not get him hurt. A nice brotherly touch, perhaps, but certainly no Kenzie. Finally, and this is purely personal, I hated the ending with a passion. I certainly do not expect all wine and roses, but it seemed such a letdown."

"powerfull_jedi","8","0","0","1 March 2008"," If this is was to be expected from Ben Affleck-directed movies...
","This is Ben Affleck's directorial debut, after his acting career has been somewhat reduced to being fairly mocked on Family Guy, he made this movie which is quite good. This movie had been slightly derailed over comparisons to the notorious McCaan mystery that has been all the talk in Portugal, so understandably there might be tendency to pre-judge and people are likely going to get upset, however close examination of it's plot reveals no similarities to the elusive real world case, but speculation continues... This story centers around Patrick Kenzie, a private detective who's assigned to look for a missing child that sparked a lot of media attention, the child of a single mother who goes missing for hours on end. As Patrick and her partner/girlfriend continue their search, nothing is what it seems and suddenly the truth is much scarier then you might think as the people you trust and the people you meet on this case become more ambiguous. The mystery storyline is quite impressive, with some great twists and turns that you won't see coming(at least not at first). There's also an interesting moral struggle near the end of the movie, which will likely make people take sides over this matter. Acting is acceptable, thought Casey Aflleck didn't strike me as entirely convincing, was it his accent? Because he sounded fairly one tone(ironically kinda like his brother). Patrick is presented as a detective with lots of connections who apparently can wave threats to a sleazy Haitian crook, but his appearance doesn't make it entirely convincing, but the character's sense of morals make up for these shortcomings. Michelle Mohganagan is also acceptable and Morgan Freeman is just being himself. Ed Harris shines as the hardened cop who the audience will keep guessing as to his true intentions. Overall, it's an acceptable cast. You can say that Gone Baby Gone is also well shot, with some shots of people walking around Boston, emerging you into it, but also the underbelly of civilization is briefly shown through petty thieves and most disturbingly in the house of a coke-addicted couple and their child-molesting buddy(quite a shocking scene, even if when it's not entirely shown). The soundtrack feels just about right. This is a great movie and I recommend everybody watching this."

","A somewhat faithful adaptation of the novel with the same name, and a solid directing effort from Ben Affleck. His brother Casey is rightfully garnering more and more attention recently since stealing the The Assassination of Jesse James show, but I was already following his career after a wonderful turn as a wanderer in Van Sant's Gerry. Here he delivers a fine performance, but one which is marred only by some poor directing. I simply did not buy the 'bad ass' modes he transitions into from time to time, and would have preferred to see him as more of a loser, the guppy in a shark tank role, but unfortunately they decided to beef him up and transform him (really he looks like he could play a sixteen year old) into one of the sharks. This results in awkwardly delivered dialog and conclusions of scenes in the most of the sequences where there is a confrontation. <br/><br/>I also found parts of the film needlessly confusing, it would have worked more effectively for me as a thriller had they played and edited it straight through. But instead we are treated to several misleading shots that seem put in simply to confuse the audience and twist the plot away from it's otherwise lackluster ending. I was very pleased with certain elements, and there are some tense, well executed moments, such as the scene in the bar near the end where a robbery seems to be taking place, but really it's something much more sinister. I also really enjoyed all the female performers. But ultimately, it just wasn't my flick. I prefer a movie to develop more organically rather than tether itself to a moral or 'big idea' from the outset, leaving some scenes stranded as necessary social commentary filler. This tends to make actors a slave to the script. But still a thoroughly thrilling film, however disturbing some of the subject matter is, and I'm going to be sure to follow Casey Affleck carefully from now on, the man (boy) has a great career ahead of him."

","Wow, just wowI did not expect Ben Affleck to be such a potent film director. His acting was just mediocre at best for me so I avoided this because of that, a little biased on that count. Nevertheless, he proved me very wrong. He crafts a fascinating tale of a detective hired to find a missing child whose mother is a cokehead. It seems a bit offish at first why he would take this job, but the pleas of the sister are quite convincing. With the whole police force looking it looks like he is not needed, but as it turns out he is the key to it all. Things are not what they appear at all and that slowly becomes apparent despite best intentions. What drew me in so well to this film was the main character played brilliantly by Casey Affleck. He is soft-spoken, but seemingly confident and yet humanly afraid. His sense of right and wrong is what I liked most though. It was such a sincere performance. Add to that a great story full of gray areas through which this character has climb and it stands as one of the best of the year.<br/><br/>Spoiler Alert: What struck me as so great was that it not only unraveled like a very good mystery, but all that it was hauntingly real bringing back all these news reports of missing children and the tragic endings to those tales. In fact, he becomes involved in a similar spin-off tale with a tragically killed child, which eventually leads to the unraveling of the original case. It would not have been possible without his moral compass as it were, which would not let it rest. Moreover, it was the rightness of the ending and the heartbreaking reality of who gets to choose that makes this such a great film to me. He does the right thing and yet loses practically everything from his partner to the money, but it feels so right and he knows it.<br/><br/>Great film"

","Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and his girlfriend Angie Gennaro (Michele Monaghan) are private investigators who are known for their knowledge and contacts within Boston's blue collar world. Patrick himself is native to the area and so his connection to the people that make it up run deep. When Lionel and Beatrice McCready (Titus Welliver and Amy Madigan) approach them to help find their kidnapped niece Amanda (Madeline O'Brian) both of them find themselves in a case that runs far deeper then they imagined.<br/><br/>Gone Baby Gone is a rough movie to watch but is powerful nonetheless. Ben Affleck enlists the difficult lower class areas of Boston almost as if they were characters for the film. The heavy Bostonian accents, punctuated with the famous short temper that many Irish descendent's are known for, give the film sense of life that other movies of this genre often lack. Many of the characters seem real simply by the way they hold themselves in a manner that one would expect someone from the wrong side of the tracks. The characters of Gone Baby Gone are for the most part stuck in a hopeless cycle that often accompanies those who grow up in a area known more for drugs and poverty then anything else.<br/><br/>Patrick and Angie soon discover that Amanda's mother Helene McCready(Amy Ryan) was involved in a plan to rip off a drug dealer who she worked for. Helen, the stereotypical addict mother who cares more for her next high then her own child, proves more of a challenge then a help for the two which later becomes an issue. It is Helen's behavior and attitudes towards Amanda that will set the real moral question behind Gone Baby Gone.<br/><br/>Police captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman), who is less than pleased at having two private investigators help the police, assigns Detectives Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton) as contacts for Patrick and Angie. It is Remy in particular who becomes an important character once it is assumed that Amanda has been killed by the very drug dealer that her mother stole from weeks earlier. His own actions will also set the scene for the final question that both Patrick and Angie must ask themselves.<br/><br/>Gone Baby Gone takes several changes that turn the entire case upside down. Even after Amanda's suspected death, Patrick and Angie discover that that it wasn't a drug dealer but Lionel, Remy, and even Captian Doyle who were behind the ""kidnapping"" of Amanda. Lionel wanted a better life for his niece, Remy and his partner saw chance for money, and Jack wanted an opportunity not only to save a child but to perhaps replace the daughter he himself lost years earlier.<br/><br/>The truth is made known only after several deaths and even then the question still remains difficult to face. Once it is discovered that Jack and his wife are raising Amanda in a safe country home far from the drugs, booze, poverty, and a life that will never escape her neighborhood, Patrick must decide if what Doyle has done is really in Amanda's best interest or if she should be given back to her mother. Remy's own death and confession of various illegal activities meant for the greater good forces Patrick to realize that if right and wrong are to be separate then the ""right"" way to do things must always be done no matter what. And that includes giving Amanda back to a mother who in any other situation would probably care less about her. It's a difficult choice that leads to Doyle's own arrest and Angie leaving him after pleading for him to leave Amanda far from Boston.<br/><br/>Gone Baby Gone isn't just a kidnapping or mystery movie. It's a movie that forces one to ask whether or not if justice and being right are always worth the price that both demand. It would be easy to argue that Patrick should have left Amanda with Jack but in doing so one enters a very dangerous slippery slope. As Remy proved through his own actions, doing the wrong thing for the right reasons can still lead to negative consequences. Doing the right thing can also lead to such an ending but in this case honor has been served if one is willing to hold to a greater standard then just emotions. Patrick must live with his choice but he could argue that it is choice that he was glad he made and one he can live with. <br/><br/>9/10"

"dfranzen70","8","0","0","16 February 2008"," Compelling, tightly plotted Baby feels authentic
","Like its cousin Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone is based on a Dennis Lehane novel about an abduction. And like Mystic River, the novel - and the subsequent film - takes no predictable route to reach its conclusion and offers no easy answers to complicated problems. It doesn't just tug at your heartstrings, it snaps them in twain, reattaches them, and yanks them out again.<br/><br/>The three-year-old daughter of Helene MacCready (Amy Ryan) has gone missing, and the child's aunt and uncle approach private detectives Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) to help the police with the case. The detectives agree, albeit reluctantly, because a case of this scope and magnitude (including a lot of media attention) is a little beyond their purview.<br/><br/>During his time on the case, Patrick makes discoveries he wish he hadn't made, and facing opposition from people he knows in the neighborhood, the police, and even his lover, Angie, he makes quick decisions with the best of intentions. Some of these decisions work out well, and others change his life for the worse, forever.<br/><br/>The first thing that strikes you about this movie is how authentic everything feels, from the actors to the sets. The movie is set in a crime-ridden section of Boston, with plenty of working-class (and a lot of low-class) denizens with their almost stereotypically comic accents and coarse language. But although Affleck is a local boy, most of the cast isn't; this is, I believe, what they call acting. And, like Clint Eastwood's Mystic River, director Ben Affleck seems to have fully captured the desolate, desperate, and bitter lives of dishonest, disreputable people who often turn to crime and other shenanigans to get by in life. Affleck's Dorchester is unyielding, where hard people live.<br/><br/>Another asset is the film's narrative thread. Although the story is told linearly, it's not easy to guess ahead of time what's coming. And it's not a product of the film's moving quickly, as some films do (a fast-paced film means less time for the moviegoer to spot holes in the plot), as there are realistic lulls around every scene's corner. At one point in the movie, with the benefit of watching it at home, I had to pause it quickly to assess the situation at hand, and I tried to predict where the movie was going. I was wrong. It's tightly plotted, but it's not unjustly or implausibly plotted, not in the least.<br/><br/>Casey Affleck, who looks very much Ben's younger brother but apparently got all of the acting genes in the family, is superb as the conflicted but driven Patrick. His youthfulness notwithstanding (he's only 32), Affleck has the poise and guile of someone much older, a fact that's even noticed by other characters in the film. Faced with incredibly difficult decisions, Patrick has an unwavering sense of what is truly right, but he's never a single-minded, ignorant zealot who knows what he knows. At times during the case, Patrick's faith is shaken, and by the end of the movie he's not completely sure he's made the right decision. In other words, what you get at the end is not a neat, happy ending at all, a fact that shouldn't surprise those who have seen Mystic River.<br/><br/>As the anguished (but loose) mother, Amy Ryan notched a Best Supporting Actress nomination, but my opinion is that it's not a nomination that's entirely deserved. Ryan is good, especially for a fairly inexperienced actress, but she's not so commanding or compelling as to warrant that sort of accolade. Faring about the same was the usually steady Morgan Freeman, who's okay here but whose role (and use as a plot device) is a bit underwritten.<br/><br/>In fact, it's plain that this movie fails only where Mystic River succeeded so strongly; the former did not lapse into clichés, and Gone Baby Gone does. Although the movie generally presents plenty of plausible twists, some of the characters are rather predictable. The final resolution of the plot, in fact, seems almost too obvious in hindsight. Because of this, Gone Baby Gone just misses being a great movie, and instead it has to settle for being a pretty good film with an exhilarating performances from Casey Affleck and Ed Harris."

And, as one indescribably feels every here and there during the film, it seems unnecessary or uneven. Nevertheless, it is really Ben Affleck's undercurrent of shock that he forces us to face about Dennis Lehane's reflection of the relentless nastiness of human beings. This film is a vengeful testament to superficiality and wrongness of all claims against Ben Affleck on the basis that he is a boyishly attractive movie star and other gross underestimations of ""pretty boys"" in Hollywood like Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. Ben Affleck, yes, handsome Hollywood hunk, directs a film that, instead of flaunting style, grits with a hard-edged rusty- kitchen-sink realism.<br/><br/>His younger brother Casey Affleck, an endearing character actor, gets his break as the lead here, in a down-to-earth, street-smarts role as a private detective who is used to handling vicious, shady people in grimy, scuzzy areas of Southie, but even having grown up around it can't prepare him for what he will have to witness and decide. Coarsely sexy Michelle Monaghan, who was hilariously callous in Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, plays his detective wife, a motherly sort whose compassion she knows may blend dangerously with her work. The most powerful performance in the film, however, is delivered by the barrel of volatile explosives that is Ed Harris, who I don't ordinarily find as appealing as I did here, enlivening his capability of being intimidating and silently warning you of an ominous, lurking, terrifying side of him. He delivers a beautifully down-home monologue at one point about the innocence and rudimentary forgiveness of children. He chokes up, but shoves the tears back with anger. (His partner is played by John Ashton, who it's good to see again. Where's he been since the Beverly Hills Cop films?)<br/><br/>The film's uncompromising brooding with its dark, extremely depressing subject of child abduction pays off with certain poignant moments, possibly showing wisdom in both Lehane's writing and Affleck's rendering of its effects, as the movie shows us the importance of the effacement, recognition, and understanding of even the most painful experiences because they are what make the great ones great, as are reflected in the most disturbing images of the film and the most relieving ones. The story's culmination to its ultimate dilemma is such an uncompromising example of facing the world, in which black and white is a myth and grey is virtually always the reality. And no matter what the resolution comes to be, it may not boil down to black and white even still."

","Ben's directorial debut is classy, but much of the credit goes to the stylish cinematography. The storyline itself, IMO, isn't anything new despite the numerous twists. Definitely see it if you're a fan of the genre. It starts out slow and boring, but do try to pay attention because the smaller details do matter later on.<br/><br/>About Casey Affleck however, I remember seeing him in smaller roles in the past, but never really noticed him. Then he became the talk of the town with numerous recognitions for Jesse James, which I have yet to see but plan to rent it right after this. IMO he does a decent job here in Gone Baby Gone but lacks a bit of emotion, and his style of speech is very debatable. His mumbling is unique and probably acceptable for one or two choice characters, but if he always talks like this then it tends to go against him. He is still very far from other fine actors like Christian Bale, but is one to look out for. Decent performance in this film, but the real star here is Ed Harris, absolutely brilliant and shamefully underrated."

But beyond that, this movie was given power and impact, not from taking sides in a polarizing situation, but from its clean, incisive and Solomon-like viewpoint, a viewpoint which is made more poignant by the commentary of the protagonist, who did choose sides.<br/><br/>I am awed by every facet of this movie, and thank the Affleck brothers, Aaron Stockard, Dennis Lehane, and the entire extraordinary cast for the gift of this movie."

This film sees a 4 year old girl abducted, so her aunt gets 2 private investigators to find her. Now Casey Affleck is great in this role, he really gives the drama across incredibly well and even gets you to question the events of the film. The supporting cast is also really good in this film. Michelle Monaghan does a great job as Affleck's partner and their chemistry is really good in this film providing the backbone of the films strengths. Morgan Freeman does a superb job in this film and really provides a character in shades of grey and performs it perfectly. Ed Harris is really good in this film and just like freeman plays up the shades of grey in this film very well, and everybody else in this film does a good job. The story is fantastic in this film as you feel how heavy this situation hits the people involved and as plot twists go all of them really work. The ending is also a great look at social commentary on what is right and wrong. The script is also top notch with the dialogue between everybody really good and convincing in this realistic film. The style is alright but it does feel like a lot of these films have very similar styles to them and this film is similar but the formula does work. This is a fantastic film that is a heavy watch but definitely worth seeing."

","It would be no surprise to see Ben Affleck up for another Oscar this year, this time for his directorial debut of Gone Baby Gone. Ben's also back flexing his Academy-award winning writing muscles as he co-writes the story (based on Dennis Lehane's novel) with Aaron Stockard.<br/><br/>Brother Casey Affleck is out of his shadow and is wonderfully credible as Patrick Kenzie, a private investigator in working class Boston, hired along with his girlfriend and fellow PI Angie Gennaro (played by Michelle Monaghan) by the family of a missing four-year-old girl to help find her.<br/><br/>The luminously beautiful Monaghan (of MI3, Made of Honor, The Bourne Supremacy) turns in an understated performance, and the rest of the cast amply provides support. Morgan Freeman as Capt. Jack Doyle is back playing a character he does best (God). Ed Harris as Det. Remy Bressant is gritty and compelling as an officer you either love or hate. Broadway actress Amy Ryan is scarily accurate in her portrayal of the missing girl's druggie mother Helene McCready.<br/><br/>As the story unfolds, lots of twists and fake endings abound, but is nevertheless unraveled well on screen, with enough pockets for personal musing.

"majic-5","7","2","5","10 November 2007"," Gritty policier about the limits of policing
","The movies Gone Baby Gone and Mystic River are both adaptations of books by the same author. Gone Baby Gone was the author's earlier work, and it explores much of the same territory as the later book. Interestingly, the movie versions have a parallel workmanship. Gone Baby Gone was directed by a first-timer (Ben Affleck), with a young actor as the lead, while Mystic River was directed by a very experienced director (Clint Eastwood), with a mature actor in its lead role. One would expect that comparing the two movies would be like comparing a soup to a stew: The stew should be richer, with more texture, flavor, and subtlety.<br/><br/>It's a surprise, then, that I liked Gone Baby Gone nearly as much Mystic River. The reason is that these movies are not really about their police investigation plots. They are about the choices people make when faced with the limits of police in providing justice. With the older characters in Mystic Rivers, one understands that they are at a time in their lives when they're acting largely on personal ethical codes that have been in place for decades. In Gone Baby Gone, one has the treat of seeing a young person thrust into situations that force him to make the decisions that will crystallize his ethical codes for decades to come, as well as the choices of older people fed up with the limits of the police.<br/><br/>The vehicle for illustrating the choice of a young man is Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck), a young private investigator, aided by his girlfriend, Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan). Kenzie plies his trade in Boston's tough, working-class, Dorchester neighborhood. Based on his contacts in the neighborhood, Kenzie provides detectives with the first valuable leads in the case. This leads to the detectives confronting the girl's mother, Helene (Amy Ryan). Helene turns out to have been snorting coke for two hours when she first claimed to have left her daughter alone for just a few minutes. This is where the first of Casey's qualms starts. Helene is not only a coke addict, but predictably, a selfish, immature, and irresponsible woman, thoroughly unfit for motherhood. As the detectives grill Helene, Kenzie's face shows his struggle: If he finds the daughter, should he bring her back to her mother? If he shouldn't, should he lie to the mother about this in the meantime to keep her cooperation? This is just the first of many choices that Kenzie has to make as he follows the case down some very dark and dangerous paths. What's pleased me is that throughout the movie, Kenzie acted exactly as you'd expect an ethical, grounded, but *young* person to act when trying to do the right thing in morally murky situations. There were no heroics that were out of character, none of the deliberations a more experienced and jaded PI would have gone through, and even his questionable actions stem from a desire for a just outcome. The irony is that his investigation keeps getting covertly blocked by more experienced adults also trying to do what's right, but from a more world-weary perspective.<br/><br/>There are some very good performances in this film. Affleck, in only his second major film, turns in solid work as Kenzie. He's believably street-wise, tenacious, stoic, and decent. Ed Harris, as Det. Remy Broussant, is the center of gravity in almost every scene he's in  without chewing up the scenery. But the real surprise is Amy Ryan as Helene. It's tough to play someone as unsympathetic as Helene and still make her believable, and she hits every note perfectly. There were times when I even found myself rooting for her to redeem herself, only to be disappointed when she failed.<br/><br/>There are some problems with the film, as you'd expect with a first-time director. The character of Angie is given too little to do, which is a shame, since Monaghan's performance hinted that she's just as capable an actress as Affleck is an actor. There are a few sequences that needed to be trimmed or cut. In addition, the episodic structure of the film is jerky, looking like it was going to end several times during the film, rather than going smoothly to the next segment. The Dorchester accents get very thick, making a fair amount of the dialog impossible to understand in detail. Morgan Freeman, reliable when playing a straight-arrow character, is unconvincing as someone dealing in shades of gray. But the worst blunder is the speeches passed off as dialog, especially the ones in the movie's climactic scene. They are completely out of character for the people in the scene, and they could have been made into crisp dialog fairly easily, if the director had wanted.<br/><br/>Overall, however, the film's strengths far outweigh its flaws. I look forward to seeing more from both Afflecks in the future."

","45 minutes into his new film, Gone Baby Gone, sitting in a darkened club with a thug across from him, his girlfriend and private detective associate to his right, Casey Affleck delivers one of the most threatening speeches placed on film this year. One wouldn't think so, given the boyishness of Casey, and his struggle to prove himself as a viable and relevant private investigator. The thug pulls a piece out on him, and threatens to kill him for negotiating the release of a little girl who is being held ransom, with which the thug claims he has no knowledge of. Patrick (Casey Affleck) calmly backs off, and engages in a sixty second monologue of the most amazing, threatening words of which I wish I could reproduce and yet am having trouble finding at the moment.<br/><br/>The opening shot of Gone Baby Gone thrusts you into a world that is cruel, unkind, and with no easy answers. As matter of fact, there were no answers. Only decisions, and living with the consequences of those decisions. Our protagonist is not a hero, though he is portrayed as one. The subject matter dealt with is not good versus bad, though it would seem as such on the surface. Life for the average joe is a cruel, unkind force to be reckoned with, those who give into addictions and cause others around them to be hurt. Yet when something catastrophic happens, it doesn't change you, or the type of person you are. It only changes the world around you, and your adjustments to that new world.<br/><br/>Casey Affleck has given his greatest performance to date. More accessible to his audience, more engaging than his character in The Assassination of Jesse James By the Coward Robert Ford, and faced with a moral dilemma of how to distinguish if there really are opposites in a society which paints them as so. Taking comfort in his native Boston accent, Casey Affleck loses himself in his role. This was not the little boy I grew up watching in the Ocean series, the secondary character who shoots off wise cracking lines to his buddies. This was a young, fresh faced man faced with the impossible task of finding a little girl declared missing. He's loving, but cynical. He's tender, but tough, and not afraid to do what is necessary to get the job done.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck, of all people, has given me a film I've long desired this entire year. A smart, intelligent, realistic film that thrills and saddens. The script is amazing, the way everything falls into place by the end of its run time. My body was tense throughout the film. The acting of all involved was impeccable, from Morgan Freeman (whose character takes a surprising turn), to Ed Harris (the man is a chameleon), to the tragically underused Michelle Monaghan. He gives them the room needed to give their characters the dimension and emotion they deserve. If he can continue with this much care and detail to his films, he has a bright future behind the camera. Absolutely brilliant his first time out.<br/><br/>Much like life, this film leaves you with no answers as to what a good decision is or is not. The moral dilemmas we face everyday are embodied in Patrick Kenzie, and like him, we sit, dazed and confused, at the implausible and unbelievable atrocities that make up our society."

","There is a certain grim ambiance that distinguishes Boston as a city. Within the last few years, Clint Eastwood and Martin Scorsese enjoyed high praise for their Boston based dramas. The city has a natural grit that lends itself perfectly to film. While ""The Departed"" utilized the city as merely a backdrop, ""Mystic River"" came to life exploring the tensions of the working class natives amidst the city streets and neighborhoods. Both these movies were released to mass critical and public praise, so it's no surprise that Boston native Ben Affleck would choose to make the city the subject of his directorial debut ""Gone Baby Gone"".<br/><br/>Based on a novel by ""Mystic River"" author Dennis Lehane, ""Gone Baby Gone"" is a fascinating crime drama. The film concerns the kidnapping of a 4 year old girl, and the investigation that follows by a private detective played by Casey Affleck. Assisting in the matter is a loose cannon detective (Ed Harris) and a no nonsense police chief (Morgan Freeman). With each clue and discovery, it becomes clearer that there is more to this kidnapping that meets the eye. Matters of right and wrong become blurred and, more importantly, choice and consequence.<br/><br/>Director Affleck deserves high praise for taking on a challenging subject and his display of excellent film-making skills. He handles the visual and stylistic aspects like a seasoned veteran, and demonstrates excellent storytelling intuitions. In particular, the city of Boston sizzles with life under his sharp eye. I would even go as far as saying that he outdoes Eastwood in terms of capturing the spirit and nature of the streets of Boston. The film opens with a breathtaking montage of city life, and often slows down to observe everyday people about their blue-collar lives. There are also a number of well crafted action sequences that are very effective and intense thanks to their grounded realism. The acting is capable all across the board, in particular, Ed Harris impresses with his intense and evocative performance. Also of interest is the first rate behind-the-scenes crew assisting Affleck. Oscar nominees John Toll and William Goldenberg provide wonderful lighting and cutting, while noteworthy composer Harry Gregson-Williams delivers a haunting score.<br/><br/>The film isn't without flaws, most notable being the plot suffers a few predictable twists and some uneven structure. I'm not one to dwell on this sort of thing. More important are the final shot and subsequent issues at hand. Affleck doesn't take the easy way out with his commentary. The film offers the kind of bold moral challenge that will surely divide audiences and make for great debate long after you leave the theatre.<br/><br/>3.5/4"

The scenes of violence were totally unnecessary and the worst part is they are like in some horror movie not a crime solving movie! The cop who was shot could just have been shot there was no need to show us how he bled from his neck and during that time he was stumbling and holding his neck while his hand was shaking it was a scene of true horror and when he finds the dead girl they didn't have to show her head like some chopped up lamb head it was really disturbing scene in a sadistic kind of way and then the icing on a cake he the good Samaritan shots the men in the head and all in a 5 minute range of time there is no time to grasp the air so you don't puke as the main character was when he saw the girl.

"Quinoa1984","7","3","10","28 October 2007"," a good, sturdy directorial debut for Affleck; brother Casey comes into his own playing a tough Shamus
","Gone Baby Gone is only the second adaptation of a Dennis Lehane novel, and while it's going to probably be the consensus for most (including myself) that the first, Mystic River, is much better. But it might be a bit hasty to compare a film like Eastwood's to one like Ben Affleck's, as it's also his first time at the director's chair for a feature. On the terms Affleck sets it up though it's a more than credible effort. His film takes the story of an investigation into the disappearance/murder of a little Bostonian girl, and the troubles of a Detective (Casey Affleck) who can't seem to wrap his head around the holes in the story as it unfolds- the little cracks that don't make sense. It's gripping mostly as a procedural, and mostly as a revelatory look at the corruptibility of men holding on to power. And it's also interesting in that the mother of the child, played in one of the best turns from the actors by Amy Ryan, isn't some helpless victim but is a druggie and, very likely, an unfit mother. Though not to spoil much in the film, this adds just the right hint of moral complexity to the end of the film, albeit in some contrivance.<br/><br/>In fact, it's little moments, both stylistically and substantively, that slightly hamper Gone Baby Gone. How many times, for example, have we seen the grainy flashback-montages of past events suddenly reconstructed (it might be a change not to see this but to have the audience think these bits out). And the factor of the character Angie is almost irrelevant, which is strange as- from what I've heard of the books- she's supposed to be much more stronger and on-par with Affleck's character, here reduced to either a weepy girlfriend or an underused detective's partner. Plus, the masked-bar robbery and the immediate aftermath is a little far-fetched. Still, these criticisms shouldn't stop anyone interested in the premise or the cast to see the film, in the theater especially. I liked seeing the urban sprawl and the seedier joints (and people, can't forget that), as Affleck goes a step further than Eastwood, and probably even Scorsese, in showcasing the nature of the city the events take place, more akin to noir than anything else.<br/><br/>And Affleck's little brother, Casey, does a lot with what should be a typical gumshoe part. He plays tough for about 90% of the film, but rarely this year has there been a performance so compelling with emotions and focus so set dead-on. Going from a part like in Ocean's Thirteen to Gone Baby Gone is not an easy stretch, as the aimless quality of humor turns to the stark quality of a guy who straddles the line of everyman to bad-ass without missing a beat. For whatever slip-ups Affleck encounters as director, his cast (his brother, and particularly Harris, Freeman gets back to shape after repeatedly playing God), and his sense of place and time, make Gone Baby Gone a small slice of sublime dark drama, neo-noir with a twist of attitude and pathos."

","A morally ambiguous tale is told within a quite murky structure. It seems to wander here and there, without the feeling of anything but free form. Rather reminded me a bit of that similar detective yarn of yore, ""The Big Sleep,"" in which Bogart and Bacall danced around a convoluted script--and managed to get away with it.<br/><br/>The acting in ""Gone, Baby Gone"" is so confident and dedicated, and the production so convinced of itself, that when one ""doesn't get"" everything, one tends to think it's just their lack of understanding.<br/><br/>I suppose if one would make the effort to analyze everything, much of it would make sense. Indeed, the production is designed to make one think all the ends are tied up. Still I've a suspicion that some of it's a conjurer's trick, through crafty writing and editing manipulation. Director Afflect shows us just what he wants us to see at any one time, leaving other ""bits of evidence"" either out or delayed, to create a ""surprise effect"" down the road.<br/><br/>Lead actor Affect slurs and mumbles his way through his lines, I suppose giving a ""realistic"" performance. Some of the violence seemed a bit gratuitous and pat; still, I admit the plot needs some action from time to time to liven things up.<br/><br/>How long this film will ""last"" remains to be seen. I've a feeling it won't be among the ""great"" detective stories, but only time will tell. On the positive side, Messers.

Most of the characters are forgettable with the exception of two: the child's mother, played by Amy Ryan, who gives an excellent performance as a hostile, cynical, drug-addicted substance abuser, and Morgan Freeman whose presence is, as usual, commanding. The story picks up in tempo and makes interesting twists and turns as the characters reveal more about themselves and are forced to make decisions that will affect the little girl who is the object of the search. Except for the first 15 minutes which are talky and slow, this is a good movie."
"ferguson-6","6","2","6","3 December 2007"," Small enough not to matter
","Greetings again from the darkness. Ben Affleck loves cameras. Doesn't seem to matter to him if he is front or behind. As a director, he still tries to be the star. The heavy handed camera work throughout the film really detracts from a decent story that could have benefited from a more seasoned filmmaker. Enough already with the swooping shots from the helicopter, and the grainy night shots showing the tough street types. Nice work from a film a student.<br/><br/>On the other hand, brother Casey does a very admirable job as the lead in this multi-layered story that really doesn't hold surprises, but is fun to watch unfold. Casey's deadpan delivery, stoic stares, monotone mutterings and baby face features combine to give a unique look to our hero. This plays well against the liveliness of the stunningly talented Michelle Monaghan and the heavy screen presence of Morgan Freeman and the manic frenzy of Ed Harris. Young Casey is the calm in the eye of the storm.<br/><br/>Other nice supporting turns are from Amy Ryan, who shows us how not to win mommy of the year; Amy Madigan and Titus Welliver. Additionally, director Ben flashes some of the ugliest humans this side of the Springer show or a Michael Moore documentary. Some would be right at home in the State Fair freak show. That part was more gruesome than the actual violence.<br/><br/>Most certainly this is not at the level of ""Mystic River"", ""Good Will Hunting"" or any Scorcese film, but the screenplay is interesting and worthy of film ... and lacking only a pro's touch behind the camera."
"bobbobwhite","9","2","6","29 October 2007"," No good deed goes unpunished
","At the end................what a moral dilemma! The end of this smart film will not be revealed here but it is the kind that has you thinking and talking for days after. Ben Affleck's directorial debut shows he has the right stuff for stories set in his childhood area of South Boston, as he hits all the right notes to me except for two in this gritty, grim and non-smiling story about child abduction, a situation that is getting to be as common as roadside trash in our rapidly declining society.<br/><br/>The poor white working class characters of South Boston were shown in all their lack of glory, as downtrodden a folk as you will see anywhere in the country, city or rural. Poverty, obesity and other physical repulsiveness(and not just the people),decay, trash, and trashiness were everywhere and in nearly everyone there, and set the scene well for the very harsh tale to follow. Ben's brother Casey was very good in his starring role as a private detective hired to help solve the kidnapping. He is short on emotional range, but that usually fatal defect in an actor actually became a positive in this very serious role, as after much violence and deception, he finally solves the confusing riddle of convolution created by the terrific Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman in their pivotal cop roles involving the kidnapping of the 4 year old daughter of a drug addict single mom, played by the accomplished stage actress, Amy Ryan.<br/><br/>Amy Ryan was mostly very effective overall in her druggie/mom from hell role, but her poised body language learned for the stage was not realistic compared to the slumped over, beaten down body language of the addicts I have seen. But, she did convey well the repulsiveness of the poor white underclass, using gross denial, insult, disrespect, and abject irresponsibility and foul language to the hilt, and was especially upsetting when we saw a ""mother"" like her repulsive self ""raising"" an innocent daughter who would surely pay, along with society, in many hard ways over the years for the sins of her horribly flawed mother. If she was lucky enough to live through it, that is.<br/><br/>Another nagging problem was that Casey's Dudly DoRight character was very conflicted at the end about the dilemma discussed below, but not at all about taking the law into his own hands earlier and making a decision that is only the state's right to make. Extreme moral right and criminal wrong in the same person?.....just like many of the rest of us probably, but disturbing here in that his lawless deed was so in contrast with the rigidly self-righteous stance he took at the end.<br/><br/>Michelle Monaghan was gorgeous and terrific as Affleck's smart and aware girlfriend and business associate and, to me, had the correct opinion of what should have happened in the end. It all boiled down to this......yes, what happens to one child, good or bad, will not change the world much I understand well, but the growing collective evil in the world has to be questioned and examined by all of us when it is seen to grow by the choices we all voluntarily make in our lives that we think are right at the time. So, is traditional moral right always the best solution for any problem? Or, compared to strict traditional moral right, is what is best for one child at a time the practical best answer overall for that child and for society even if it contrasts with traditional moral right?<br/><br/>That is the very tough issue all responsible viewers will give much thought to upon seeing this film. See it...and think hard about the problem. It's a crucial issue in our decaying society, and Ben Affleck showed it here in as convincing yet entertaining a way as anyone could show it in film. But, don't expect a feel-good Hollywood ending as there was nothing of the kind, and I applaud Affleck for making that choice here. One of the best films of the year so far."
"filmfan92","8","2","6","28 October 2007"," Good Baby Good
","Ben Affleck has a lot riding on this movie, but he couldn't have backed a better horse for his directorial debut- combine his smart, sharp approach to film with the Boston flavored sewer poetry of author Dennis Lehane, and you have a match made in heaven. Affleck colors this missing persons thriller with a local flair, the kind of down and dirty authenticity that 'The Departed' reached for but missed. He also proves his skill with directing actors-uniformly excellent actors like Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris give some of their best performances here, and up and comers Casey Affleck and Amy Ryan give some of the strongest, bravest performances in modern movie history. Still, Ben-Ben's first try behind the camera is flawed-the second act sags into a series of script beats and serious speechifying, and he makes the mistake of having Casey provide a few condescending, awkwardly placed voice-overs that had me scratching my head. But for a first try, Mr. Affleck has done better than many-he has crafted what is, for the most part, a powerful thriller with a wrenching ending that will have you talking. Is it perfect? No. But it's absolutely worth your time."

","Gone Baby Gone, Ben Affleck's debut as a feature film director, is a finely textured and thoroughly engrossing crime drama. Showcasing brilliant performances, the film succeeds as both a captivating mystery and as a thought provoking examination of morally ambiguous issues not often encountered on a local megaplex screen.<br/><br/>The film is based on a novel by Dennis Lehane, author of Mystic River, and similarly focuses on the tough, crime laced neighborhoods of Boston. Instead of Clint Eastwood's stylish, almost operatic tragedy, Gone Baby Gone provides a grittier and even more complex, morally ambiguous view of life on the other side of the tracks. The cinematography by John Toll (especially the sparing and effective use of hand help camera work) and editing by William Goldenberg (most effective in weaving together multiple tracking shots and in capturing the reactions of multiple characters within a scene) visually support a sense of intimate realism. The musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams pulls the viewer into the film without overpowering it.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck's triumph in this film is the way in which he allows the actors, or rather, the characters they portray, to comprise the heart of this film. Every performance is unforgettably etched and seems to flow naturally from the background. Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman, Michelle Monaghan, Amy Madigan, and Titus Welliver all deliver extraordinary performances. Amy Ryan delivers an award-worthy performance as a mother who is both repellent and and heartbreakingly pitiable. Casey Affleck follows up his masterful performance in The Assassination of Jesse James ... with another disturbing, but far more understated and complicated performance as the central character. More than any other, his performance draws the viewer into the disquieting moral labyrinth of Gone Baby Gone.<br/><br/>Aside from his work on the screenplay of Good Will Hunting (but definitely not his acting in this film) and his wonderfully self-parodying performance in Shakespeare In Love, I have not been an ardent Ben Affleck fan. With this film, he firmly establishes himself as a talented director. For the first time, I can say that I look forward to the next Ben Affleck film."
"bopdog","9","2","6","19 October 2007"," Signs of a first-time director, but still pretty good. Great cast!
","Actors making their first movie as a director often show signs of the novice. So I find myself critiquing such efforts differently, even if that is unfair or not totally logical. The cast here was superb, the performances excellent. The story had depth, and you could tell that Ben Affleck and his writing partner really tried hard to do something real and meaningful. And... it is nice to be in the States this autumn and winter, to see new movies as they come out!<br/><br/>Nonetheless, as is often the case, there were some tell-tale newbie marks. I don't know exactly how to articulate it--- but maybe an overly stated drama? Or times when things veer toward the obvious, or the melodramatic? Well, not quite melodramatic, here. But without giving anything away, let me just remark that for me, some of the choices made by the lead character, and aspects of the denouement of story, seemed a little too harshly, or simplistically, drawn. I certainly thought what the lead guy, played admirably by Ben Affleck's younger brother Casey Affleck, decided to do at the end was stupid. I thought the character's decision to follow the letter of the law, and turn all the morally ""goods guys"" in to the police, was selfish, immature, and the mark of a guy who is WAY too full of himself. Rather than seeing that as a Greek tragedy, where the hero is doomed to follow his crappy destiny, or whatever, I saw it as an indulgent and destructive action of a narcissist. His wonderful girlfriend was absolutely right to dump his sorry bum, and walk out on him.<br/><br/>So--- was it entertaining? Yes. And pretty good, and worthy to go and see. This may, like with some other actors-turned-auteur, be Affleck's only directorial job. Or, he may keep on and do some more--- he can only get stronger.<br/><br/>Affleck's novice efforts reveal a certain timidity. He was too timid and weak to make a really strong statement about life, in my view. He kind of copped out, and kind of took the easy way, in the story's ending. But, hey, he DID give it a go, and he did a nice job.<br/><br/>If this were a seasoned director's movie, I'd give it a 7. But out of affection and admiration for the ""new guy's"" try, I give it a special-case 9 out of 10."
"bryan-930-337366","3","1","2","21 May 2019"," Book is Amazing, Movie is not
","This should have been amazing. The book has all the elements, including great, vivid characters and setting. The first mistake was casting Casey Affleck, who is too young for the lead role and just not believable. There are some great actors here but without that vivid, essential casting, it all falls apart. And so the movie becomes less compelling, less believable, and less everything. It's too bad too because there are several more books, each one more compelling than the last. This could have been a series starter. Instead, it stops the series cold."

"SweetWilliam63","10","1","2","30 January 2019"," The Rise Of An American Icon
","In his early years, Henry Fonda made a trilogy of films that cemented him as one of the greats. His sixth film 'Young Mr. Lincoln' (1939) followed by 'Jesse James' (1940) and 'The Grapes Of Wrath' (1940). Oh, and 'The Ox Bow Incident' (1943). So four! Four classic films that cemented him in the hallowed halls of -- wait. Can't forget 'My Darling Clementine' in 1946. FIVE! Five great and lasting iconic films. But most of us watched these films informed by what was to come later. It got me thinking, what was it like to see icons like Fonda on screen for the first time. Did people watch thinking ""OMG we're watching something pretty amazing here!"" Did they sense that this was the start of a legendary career? Because that's the feeling I had when I watched Casey Affleck in 'Gone Baby Gone'. This performance was not a one off. No, I was being given the opportunity to see an artist at the start of an epic career. Don't believe me? Check out The Assassination Of Jesse James' and 'Manchester By The Sea'. In each of these films, Affleck portrays the reliable grown up hero for the every man in all of us. The non-hacker who can act a thousand words with a glance. The soft spoken laconicy that suggests vulnerability and unassuredness but belys an inner strength and steely bravery. The hallowed, weary expression of a man with the single minded workaday urge to be good. If you do the math, you know that these people come along once or twice in a life time. Moreover, if fate allows (it usually doesn't), they progress through a long and respectable career leaving the world a better place for it. I watch Affleck work and I find it impossible not to include him in this short list of great American male actors. Hanks is iconic, yes, but he earned it film by film. DeCaprio seemed born to it. Eastwood's doing his best work in the latter part of his career and Pacino and DeNiro are wrecklessly squandering their iconic status with silly movie after silly movie. There are other contenders in his generation (Crudup, Gosling, Hardy, etc.) but Affleck seems to pack the gear for the times as they are. The knowing, quiet guy at the back of the room whose every movement is efficently utilitarian. 'GBG' is his 22nd film. It is a sure bet that forty years from now our great grand kids will be watching Affleck the way we watched Fonda. Directed by brother Ben, who cowrote the screenplay, and with a fantastic supporting cast, 'Gone Baby Gone' is a winning combination of great movie making. But Casey Affleck turns it into a classic. It's why Affleck makes my short list of great American actors for our times and perhaps for all times."
"tabuno","9","1","2","21 January 2019"," A Brilliant Piece of Screen Writing
","11 November 2007. In perhaps the best script of the year, Ben Affleck has reprised his writing talent since demonstrating his talent with his collaboration with Matt Damon in GOOD WILL HUNTING (1997). This amazingly psychological mystery thriller is blunt, hard-edged, raw, and authentic in its depiction of small, inner city-neighborhood life. There are twists and turns here that all eventually lead to a logical but emotionally unsettling resolution that has no right or wrong answers to it. The photography and direction are spot on. Unlike Sean Penn's more cinematically, densely, and overly technically complex INTO THE WILD (2007), Ben Affleck has kept it forward, direct and tell the story along with the hidden blank spaces that will inevitably filled in later that even the protagonist, played by Casey Affleck isn't fully aware of. Except for one brief scene with a crazed woman coming up that starts behind a close door, this movie was technical perfect and perhaps the stereotypical drunken police scene reduced the power of the dialogues, inner turmoil. One of the richest, deeply involving, and compelling movie in years. Nine out of Ten Stars."

"mawandaal","8","1","2","27 December 2018"," Before Gone Girl, there was Gone Baby Gone
","After some time ago watching Ben Affleck in Gone Girl (2014), I also found out that Ben also wrote and directed almost the same themed movie, Gone Baby Gone (2007). This is Ben Affleck's first feature movie as a director. The movie tells the story of a mother who lost her child, the police who were assigned also found no result. Finally, a local private detective (Casey Affleck) is hired to help for searching her nephew. The premise of this movie is almost similar to Gone Girl, isn't it? Both of those tell about a lost person, the difference is in Gone Girl the one who lost is a woman, while in Gone Baby Gone is a kid. We all hope Ben Affleck doesn't lose the momentum in directing this movie, his very first debut.<br/><br/>At first, I thought this was a usual crime movie like any other. But no, I was wrong. This movie is pretty thought-provoking. The good thing and bad thing boundaries are not clear and that makes us wonder whether the characters do the right things or not. Casey Affleck was very brilliant under the direction of his brother Ben Affleck. Ben Affleck made a remarkable behind the scene debut with this movie after having been a triumph with Good Will Hunting (1997) as a writer. As an actor, he did not really succeed in the early 2000s. Only Armageddon (1998) and Pearl Harbor (2001) steal my attention. But after those movies, he only appears in mediocre movies such as Daredevil (2003). We all know, after this movie he really did a good job as a director and his movie finally won an Oscar in 2013. All of his movies are also have darker tones and stylish, and I really like it!"

","I love Ben Afflecks work, both as an actor and a director he has consistently blown me away with his work, while he went on to say great things with his directorial ability I can't say he had a great start in what I found to be an extremely misguided crime thriller. <br/><br/>Another trope of Ben Affleck I find recently is that even when he isn't in a good movie he tends to be the highlight of it and this is the case here to, his work behind the camera is truly excellent here, he's not afraid to go slow and a lot of his shots are done all in wide angles without cuts and it's extremely effective, this film doesn't have a whole lot of action but when it comes he handles it very well, nothing about the violence feels like a movie, but realistic and often shocking. In all his films he uses the location as a character and it's no different here and adds this dark feeling that stays consistent throughout the film.<br/><br/>The performances here are all stellar, Casey Affleck gives a very subtle performance here, you can read a lot of his face without him saying anything and carries a lot of this film for me. Ed Harris is also fantastic in this movie, a very wounded and tired performance then he plays extremely well. Amy Ryan absolutely floored me in this movie, she was so despicable I couldn't believe and absolutely earned her Oscar nomination for her work here. <br/><br/>The ending was handled perfectly in this film, it asks the audience to think for itself and doesn't give any easy answers, it leaves them feeling unfulfilled and makes you look back in the entire film as a whole. It was a bold note to end on and I really admired them for not giving a stereotypical happy ending. <br/><br/>But I find this film to be very mediocre for a few reasons for one, the pacing. This film drags for large portions and honestly bored me quite a bit. A lot of that has to do with a lot of meaningless sequences, the film takes a turn about half way through and nothing ever comes of it other than to extend the run time. Before the ending nothing that happened really stayed with me and makes this film rather dull for me.<br/><br/>I have no issue with slow movies but I have to be invested in the characters for that to be a benefit and I don't care for most of these characters, many of them are one note and just have a tendency to repeat the same dialogue over and over again. I don't care about them so I don't particularly care for the situation. I particularly didn't care for Michelle Monaghan's character, I didn't feel like she had much chemistry with Affleck so I didn't really buy their romance. <br/><br/>The twist in this movie is also very mishandled, not only was it really cliché but a lot of the characters involved with this twist feel forced in and don't feel very within character for them, it adds something to the ending but on its own it does nothing to me except for making me feel underwhelmed. <br/><br/>The Town is one of my favourite movies, Argo is one of my favourite Best Picture winners and I even enjoyed Live By Night for what it was but I really couldn't get behind this film. I like the direction, performances and ending but the film as a whole is bogged down by weak characters, an unearned twist and slow pacing. I'll still watch anything Ben Affleck directs but I can't say he hit the ground running in his career as a director. <br/><br/>5.5/10: C (Mediocre)"

Casey's delivered his top performance i think. And of course magnificent acts by the rest of the cast Freeman, Monaghan, Amy Ryan and especially I would say Harris.<br/><br/>Simply said, this movie will catch your eyes from the first minute to the last, will emotionally moves you and leave thinking about the events and the decisions that has to be made way after.

","There is a certain thing to Affleck's movies - they don't feel flashy. Gone baby gone seems like a straight drama kind of thriller. I watched it in two sittings. After watching the first half I thought it is a no brain-er, but just another police/detective drama. Then the second half unpeeled the layers. But it is not just the story or the mystery, but the Boston setting, the believable cast and above all the moral ambiguity that is shown in the movie that makes it a little haunting as well. A choice that the main character has to make - even you would be left wondering what would you do. Even after the movie ends - it leaves you wondering for a while.<br/><br/>Do not miss this movie - you wont regret watching it. It does have a lot of cuss words and lots of them - may be that's how the neighbor's setting is and some blood but no nudity."

","""I did what I did for the sake of the child.""<br/><br/>One of those rare Hollywood productions leaving the audience questioning their own moral compass once the final credits have rolled. Though a little convoluted at times, the film reveals directorial talents from an unexpected quarter, able to extract top drawer performances from a wonderful ensemble cast. Affleck succeeds in capturing the gritty realism of the Boston streets he set out to achieve. As such, he rejected the use of professional extras, framing his scenes among the local populace who happened to be present at his location shoots. As regards the style of production, Affleck has benefited greatly from working alongside cinematographer, and two times winner of an Academy Award, John Toll. The film is adorned with a majestic score from Harry Gregson- Williams, and despite also profiting from such excellent source material as Dennis Lehane's novel, in remaining faithful to it, the director merits praise for delicately handling the difficult, hard- hitting subject matter. In doing so, the film avoids falling temptation, as does the usual Hollywood fare, to simplistically establishing which characters embody moral rectitude and which don't. Hired by the concerned uncle and aunt of a missing girl to rekindle the failing police investigation into their niece's disappearance, a married couple of private investigators are drawn both into the murky underworld of the degenerates who inhabit the city, and the shady dealings of police corruption, before facing a moral quandary which will tear them apart. The gamble which both Affleck brothers take in trusting to their respective sibling's talents hugely pays off, as Casey Affleck delivers an assured performance in the lead role. The audience learn, just as the police assigned to the case, not to mistake the fresh-faced lead as lacking sufficient steeliness and fibre for the demands placed upon him. This would be the first in a short series of critically acclaimed roles which established the younger brother as one of the most gifted young actors in Hollywood. He is ably supported by his on- screen partner, an under-utilised Michelle Monaghan, who acts as the film's moral barometer. Another standout performance is provided by Amy Ryan, as the foul-mouthed,drug-addled, neglectful mother of the missing child. Deserving of her Academy Award nomination, Ryan presents a 'warts-and-all' portrait while supplying just enough humanity and vulnerability to the role to evince a modicum of sympathy from the audience. In perfecting her accent, she took every opportunity to avail herself of the knowledge of local native, Jill Quigg, who plays her character's best friend. The latter was drafted into the cast by Affleck, impressed at her forceful berating of production staff when the barricades set up for the location shoot prevented her from collecting her child from school. The second memorable supporting performance is delivered by Ed Harris as the cynical and intimidating Inspector Remy Bressant. His seemingly unflinching pursuit of the truth will gradually be peeled away to reveal much more questionable motives. Though labyrinthine, the film's plot acts as its creative core. A botched exchange operation ends with the missing girl presumed drowned, Yet, an unrelated case of child abduction concludes by exposing far more suspect roles played in proceedings by the police investigating team. In the ensuing attempts to rescue the abducted boy, Affleck and Toll handle an especially taut search scene in the pedophile gang's house with both a degree of aplomb in framing the action, and in maintaining great delicacy over such a sensitive issue with such an abhorrent outcome. As our protagonist deals with his own conscience at having taken the law into his own hands, Bressant reveals just how far he is prepared to go to protect an innocent child. As the truth begins to emerge over the fate of the missing girl, it becomes more imperative for further questions to be made at the door of recently retired Captain Jack Doyle - another accomplished performance from Morgan Freeman. Considering his own earlier contentious self- appointed role as executioner, Affleck's character's final decision fuels the audience's debate as to what choice they would have made, allowing the film a power to resonate long after viewing."
"lukas-meister","8","1","2","26 August 2016"," Flawed But Impressive
","Gone Baby Gone has its flaws and i had to decide between giving this a 7 or 8, but i think the strong performances ( Casey Affleck and Amy Ryan are awesome! ) just edged it towards a higher rating. <br/><br/>I will start with the positive things because so does the movie: The first hour is great. It has a solid story ( child gone missing ), which is nothing spectacular or innovative, but if done right it can definitely serve as a good foundation. And in my opinion it is done right in this film: There are well written and well acted characters who all have their own problems, ideals and a certain ambiguity. They are not perfectly fleshed out , but i think they don't have to be when so many characters are introduced in a short amount of time. No time and no scene is wasted in the first hour, everything is placed right where it should be and the well written dialogue supports the slowly building tension. Yes, there are a lot of questions and expository dialogue, but you cant get around them all the time in an investigative story. Here there is room left to find out little details about our characters. I also like how the streets and neighborhoods are photographed because they serve as a constant reminder of where these people come from and what they and we as the audience have to deal with. Most of the things we find out as the movie progresses can be traced back to them and the neighborhoods are used well as an overarching boundary for the story and characters. Ben Affleck delivers a directorial debut with a strong sense of tension, using a lot of close-ups in single- or double-character shots and the often vulgar ""on the edge of violence"" dialogue does the rest to suck you into the first hour of the movie. There is nothing fancy going on, but its as close,raw and real as it needs to be for the sake of the narrative.<br/><br/>That is where the movie starts to go overboard. Even though the entire cast is firing on all cylinders throughout the whole film, the story and the movie itself cant keep up the high level after the first ""conclusion"" because it feels like a deep cut in the narrative structure. Gone Baby Gone tries to touch so many morally ambiguous topics and ask so many questions about human nature that could have probably served as material for three separate movies. As the opening monologue by Afflecks character implies, this is a movie about decisions and if you can decide yourself or if ultimately the things that surround you, over which you have no influence,make the decision for you(predetermined). But i don't know how many important decisions the characters can make before it becomes unrealistic.It doesn't get bad by any means and the film picks up the slack again at the end, but i cant get around the impression that it is more like :"" OK which difficult moral question can we tackle next"" instead of being good storytelling. That said, this movie has given me some food for thought and i can imagine the (great) final conclusion causing some debate among viewers. I definitely thought about it more than once. Strong acting, good directing and writing with just the right amount of suspense should be enough to recommend Gone Baby Gone. Thanks for reading"

Ben Affleck is a great director and also a good actor, I think he would have played this role better. <br/><br/>As for the movie itself, the plot was fantastic from start to finish, I did not see the ending coming at all, and it was all so well executed. I also liked the ending because it really painted the picture of morality vs the law, is the legal thing always the right thing to do?

The real problem lies with the scenario.<br/><br/>The final act of the story asks a very interesting moral question. However, that question is badly asked: the story is so outrageous, nonsensical even, that it hinders the impact that it could have on the viewer. A more realistic script might have made it a really memorable movie, but it just felt like a very long TV episode from a standard crime drama.<br/><br/>Until that final act, the story was good enough. It's failing at the part that could have made it great that eventually makes it just average.<br/><br/>I can't say that I wouldn't recommend this movie, but don't expect a masterpiece."

So what's it got going for it? Simple, it's a great story and screenplay, some great actors doing a great job, great direction and a it poses a question, that's hinted at throughout the film, that's so difficult you'd never want to be put in the position of having to answer it. <br/><br/>The twists and turns to the plot are really secondary to this question but even though you may work out what's happened it'll still have you thinking would you have done the same thing. It's not a spoiler but anyone who takes the time to watch the film will see a closing scene that leaves you wondering if after everything that's happened is this what the main character wanted.<br/><br/>I can't speak too highly of the film as a whole but I'd like to pay a special tribute to Ben Affleck. He'd already won an Oscar for co-writing Good Will Hunting with Matt Damon so this film should not surprise anyone that the script is so good. Considering its quality it's rather surprising that it wasn't received as well as it should have been. Maybe that's because it appeals to a more discerning audience, who knows?

","Ben Affleck turns the tides and surprisingly delivers a wonderful directorial debut by adapting Dennis Lehane's novel into a new American crime classic. Ben uses his little brother Casey to play Patrick, a detective who with his girlfriend Angie (Michelle Monaghan)investigates the disappearance of a young girl who mysteriously vanished from her lazy, drunken mother played with a pitch-perfect Boston accent by Amy Ryan. This story is familiar turf. What Affleck does with this familiarity is turn it into a mind-bending and heartbreaking thriller with intense information about a compelling crime case, and give an in depth analysis of maternity and doing the right thing. Casey gives a knock-out performance and we get strong supporting work from old timers Ed Harris and Morgan Freedman, and especially from the shockingly talented Amy Ryan. By portraying the hardship of industrial and working-class America in the streets of Boston, we come across terrifying and sometimes just plain old ugly Bostonians who all have something to do with the case. Not only does this film end different than you'll expect, it provokes your senses and leaves you filled with wonder and really takes a big fat piece out of your spirit. It's hauntingly chilling and effective while resolving some conflict but implying a long hardship of absence from perfection. By not trying to hard and not giving bogus dialogue or a lousy climax, Ben Affleck proves he is better suited fro behind the camera than in front of it (no offense Ben). He's not doing anything legendary with his direction, but he's giving a hardcore, f-bomb filled story light. By focusing on the internal and external aspects of Patrick's situation, ""Gone Baby Gone"" truly deserves to be recalled years from now as a life-lesson sort of film and a shocking new look at the American crime system. Moral questions to play with coming your way!"

","What Gone Baby Gone is is an intermittently competent urban detective thriller with some good performances and a startlingly authentic look at a side of Boston rarely if ever seen on screen. Affleck reportedly took the same approach that David Simon used with HBO series The Wire in casting extras and some peripheral characters, picking out locals who wouldn't have to fake their Southie accents, trashy clothes, poses and beaten down faces. Indeed, a couple of Wire regulars appear in Gone Baby Gone (Omar as a cop), and that show's idea that the real cops -- the best cops -- spend part of every day walking their Baltimore beat, building relationships, is also part of what makes local boy Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) an effective private detective in the tightly knit enclaves of Boston."

He along with Aaron Stockard have created a great script and have made a film that is powerful, riveting, and very entertaining.<br/><br/>The performances here are great. Morgan Freeman does his usual self of creating a very emphasized character, and the whole other supporting cast was great, including Ed Harris. I thought that they could have picked a better actress for the character of Angie Gennaro, but Michelle Monaghan eventually grew on me. But the film is also this great because of two performances. One of them comes from the award-nominated performance of Amy Ryan. She creates a character that is very true to the life of many people in neighborhoods like this. She gave an outstanding performance, and creates ultimate likability in her character because you feel for her, even though she is also quite unlikeable in her actions. She deserved that Oscar nomination, and one of the best supporting performances of the year. However, as strong as Ryan was, the real star here is Casey Affleck. I am a huge fan of his performance in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, and I thought he gave one of the best male performances of the decade, whether it was supporting or leading. I thought he deserved that Oscar for Supporting Actor(even though I ultimately think he is leading, although it is not a huge issue). But with this he proves he is an actor capable of anything. Whereas his character of Bob in the film Jesse James was very quiet, sort of weak and manipulated, here he proves his character is a strong, mannered leading man in whatever he does. I very much enjoy watching him perform, and he deserved to get an Oscar nomination for Leading Actor, because while his role was not as showy as Ryan's, it was just as strong or even better and he holds the film together. Much better than the nominated actors of the year George Clooney and Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>The film was brilliantly shot, and while I did think it had problems with the editing, it was not a big glitch. I thought the twist at the end was very surprising, and I thought the ending scene was so powerful and heart-breaking. The film was very entertaining, and it also raises a lot of questions about neighborhoods like this and what is better for a child that lives in these ways. I thought this was a better crime film than Fincher's, Se7en and Zodiac, and I hope it does not become forgotten over time."

It makes for some very haphazard storytelling on the part of director Affleck.<br/><br/>Keeping things deliberately confusing this patchwork quilt of a mystery is poorly stitched together as scenes bump into each other rather than transition smoothly. GBG jolts the audience in more than one scene but in Affleck's incapable hands the action wanders and the actors remain unconvincing. He seems content to allow his music score to telegraph the emotions of actors who offer little more than solemn stares.<br/><br/>Offbeat casting can sometimes revive tired genre types and instill something fresh into the recipe but Casey Affleck looks like a runaway from a boy scout troop confining his performance to cold expression and side glances. PI partner and girlfriend played by Michelle Monaghan does little more than stand around waiting to jump in a quarry. The chemistry between the two is non-existent.

Ed Harris is always good but Morgan Freeman, who I normally like, seems like he's just phoning it in here. Amy Ryan's convincing portrayal of the child's irresponsible mother was justly rewarded with an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Affleck's direction is assured for a debut though there were aspects of the presentation that didn't appeal to me. For instance, I felt that Affleck was apt to dwell upon images of the neighborhood more than was necessary. Also, the multiple twists result in a convoluted storyline that moves further and further from plausibility as it progresses. I will say, though, that the film's conclusion does cause you to reflect on the costs of doing the 'right' thing, whatever that may be.<br/><br/>In the end, I recommend this film as an entertaining detective story.

It's simply impossible to accurately follow a book. Even Peter Jackson had to skip a few scenes in LOTR and he had some six hours to tell that story. A film must be seen as an independent artistic work that tells a story either successfully or not. As for the acting I can't say I was bowled over by anyone's performance. Freeman and Harris were effective if predictable. I've seen their act before. I'm not all that familiar with Casey Affleck or Monaghan but their performances were believable. Overall I found all actors to be good at their portrayals.<br/><br/>Personally I like films that make me think. And this did just that. My wife and I talked about it for a long time after we got over the shock of the ending. We debated the characters' motives, whether their actions were justified or not, whether they were reprehensible or not. How we would have reacted if faced with that situation and how far we would go to save a child. So from that angle this film was a success.<br/><br/>Bottom line, to me this film succeeds because it raises valid questions about the value of conscience. After all Afleck's and Monaghans's characters are driven by their conscience although they arrive at diametrically opposed decisions that affect the rest of their lives.

A high profile child abduction case leads to him being hired to investigate on the basis that the fellow locals are more likely to speak to him than the police.<br/><br/>I really enjoy films that make you consider your own values and prejudices and this film falls very much into that category. It's a very fine film and it's only the rather contrived conclusion to the film and the somewhat pointless female partner in life and business that spoils a perfect 10. With Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris providing support you are guaranteed a good cast and Casey does well to take the acting honours. Fine film!"
"mcsheehey","5","1","2","10 June 2008"," Glimmers of Light
","Casey Affleck and Amy Ryan deliver unbelievable performances in ""Gone Baby Gone,"" but unfortunately cannot fully redeem the film. The problems with ""Gone Baby Gone"" are for the most part products of Ben Affleck as director and Lehaine as the ""brainchild"" of the story (the film is adapted from his novel of the same name).<br/><br/>Ben Affleck is obsessed with giving the viewers agritty vision of Boston, the setting of the film, and he goes too far. Instead of grittiness, Affleck's focus on ugly people doing ugly things both on the streets and in the story itself results in-well-ugliness. The city has no glimmers of beauty in this film. Instead of shooting for ugliness outside the main story, Affleck could have shot for beauty and the typical outsider-s view of Boston. This would have allowed him to then, through the story, show the uglier side of the same city. The effect would have been marvelous instead of phony, but alas. Affleck makes other mistakes as well. He and his cinematographer shoot too many scenes in a sort of curious darkness. The most effective scenes in the film are shot in the light of day, and they come mostly at the powerful conclusion. The darkness-based scenes feel manipulative and hopeless.<br/><br/>Still, Affleck's direction is not all bad. He draws forth great performances from his brother and Michelle Monaghan as the cop principles and from Amy Ryan as a drug-abusing ""bad mother."" Morgan Freeman's flat performance and Ed Harris's just-solid performance come about completely as a result of the source material.<br/><br/>Lehaine has done great work before, but the plot of this novel/film is too twisted and too reliant on sketchy coincidences. Only the more simple cop-movie beginning and the fantastic ending ring true. In fact, the middle section, which deals with true colors and pedophiles, is repulsive and contrived. The film includes a plot twist that is completely unnecessary and actually harmful.<br/><br/>While even the convoluted patty of this film-sandwich has some good moments, the film is ultimately derailed. Still, Casey Affleck is a great actor and puts on a good show throughout, whenever the material allows."
"Spaceygirl","8","1","2","9 June 2008"," Stunning directorial debut
","""Gone baby gone' is a spectacular directorial debut for Ben Affleck. The story is brilliant, being an adaptation of a novel by Denis Lehane, he of ""Mystic River"" fame. The acting is mesmerising, Casey Affleck once again proving he's the better acting sibling. Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman are predictably good and Amy Ryan is simply superb. The story is where the movie scores, the moral ambiguity blurring the lines between what is right, and what is more right. Should he have left the child with caring, loving parents or sent her back to her neglectful, abusive mother? The question is one that leaves the viewer reeling and will provoke many arguments once the movie is seen. Simply brilliant!"
"doctorsmoothlove","8","1","2","2 April 2008"," Much more impressive than I thought it would be.
","Ben Affleck, just his name invokes humor and giggles. Seriously, he hasn't yet had a memorable film role. So, when I and probably everyone else, heard that he got a job as a director, I paid no attention to the announcement. However, his new film Gone Baby Gone received much media attention, so I decided to view it during my Panama City Beach spring break vacation. It was the only film that I saw during my uneventful and, daresay, boring break. I was very surprised with Affleck's work. This is a gritty, realistic film that borrows from noir and heist elements to produce a balanced and enjoyable final product. I couldn't believe how well Affleck directed this film. If he keeps directing films such as this one, he may no longer be the butt of everyone's jokes. Our story begins with the kidnapping of a young girl, Amanda, of whom we know next to nothing. As the story unravels, we learn about her disappearance, we believe the story to have ended. This is where a slight problem is revealed. The plot falls down and it takes Patrick's druggie friend to help restore it. Eventually, Patrick becomes aware of a conspiracy by Police Chief Doyle to keep Amanda as his own daughter. Patrick reveals his secret and loses his girlfriend for acting in what he thinks is the best way. <br/><br/>This film is quite an achievement. It is filled with unsuspecting plot twists and nearly all supporting characters are involved in the grand conspiracy. The only irony is that Angie didn't have much of a role other than to look pretty. Patrick raided the old cocaine-addicts house. He also partook much of the interrogation of the drug lord in the first half of the film. Her only significant action was to rescue Amanda's shirt at the end of the first part of the film. Not that it mattered much, but Angie could have added even more charisma to the film. What I especially liked was the extensive character development. Patrick was an easygoing detective who realized the duty he had to maintain order in the police force. His dialog with Doyle near the end of the film was provocative and showed his change. Doyle, on the other hand, became the criminal and child abductor he hated so much. Even Amanda's mother seemed more understanding of her obligation to her daughter by the film's end. <br/><br/>I'm not going to stipulate that Gone Baby Gone is a film for the ages, but I enjoyed it tremendously. It is a rare film that not only seamlessly unravels an intricate plot, but develops strong realistic characters too. Although some may complain about the level of profanity, I found it realistic, given the film's setting. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys crime films or even the old film noir titles. This is about as close to Double Indemnity and the like that we had last year, so do yourself a favor and watch it."
"rhinocerosfive-1","7","1","2","1 April 2008"," Very nice, Ben; so you can stop acting now, right?
","GONE BABY GONE features a not at all bad directorial job by the elder Affleck, and another fine performance from the younger. In my opinion, it's also a much better adaptation of Dennis Lehane's brand of medium-dark pulp fiction than Clint Eastwood's overwrought, unconvincing MYSTIC RIVER.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck and his partner Aaron Stockard have drawn up a more or less faithful script, bleak, sad and pop-poignant like the novels that spawned it. Ben also wrings a lot out of some gritty local casting, and gets strong journeyman performances from veterans Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman, John Ashton, Titus Welliver and Amy Madigan. Amy Ryan is very good, but it's hard to see what all the Oscar fuss was about. Casey Affleck is as good as he ever is, which is to say very.<br/><br/>The thing is, this is a silly story in the first place, with the cynical, unnecessary and unlikely twists common to American detective fiction since Hammett and Chandler started lighting matches with their thumbnails. Like its source material, the movie is at its best when dealing with the strained interaction and bleak emotions of humanity in extremis; again like its literary origins, it is less credible in its handling of plot device and character motivation.<br/><br/>Whatever. Ben Affleck makes a wise career choice for the first time in a while, writing and directing with flashless competence. More of this, please, and less, uh, GIGLIness."

","The movie turned out pretty good, not great but pretty good.<br/><br/>As many of you already know Ben Affleck directed it, this is the first time i see a movie directed by him. Was i impressed? Not Really. He managed to write a good screenplay, but he didn't do so well on putting it on screen. Most of the views were pretty simple, and now and then they were a few helicopter-sky views. I didn't know why because it didn't fit in the movie at all, it was like ""Hey look we have a decent budget which means we can put a camera on a chopper"". Takes more than that to impress me.<br/><br/>Anyway, the story however is based on a missing girl, actually i believe it circles around the whole area of kids being kidnapped. The story was pretty weak but since it was so simple it kept you alert. And with a little matching string music, it actually sucessed.<br/><br/>Anyway i wouldn't say that this is a GREAT movie, it's good but not great. I had a pretty hard time making up my mind on what to rate for this movie. I thought 7 was to low so i decided to give it a pretty weak 8. Think of it as a steady 7 or a weak 8. Like 7.5"
"Gordon-11","Null","1","2","1 April 2008"," Strong and engaging story of difficult moral choices
","This is a film about two private detectives investigating a case of missing child. No one is prepared for the avalanche of shocking events that unfolds during the investigation.<br/><br/>The first half of ""Gone Baby Gone"" is a thriller about the search for a missing girl, while the second half is an emotional drama about the search for truth and moral dilemmas. The great thing about ""Gone Baby Gone"" is that such transition is gradual, without being contrived as it easily could have been. The plot is very strong and engaging. It questions who is fit to be a parent, who is to decide who is fit, and who is to decide a child's future. It's a heavy subject that people will feel strongly about, but ""Gone Baby Gone"" manages to present the issue in a balanced way.<br/><br/>For years Casey Affleck is known to me as Ben's brother. After watching ""Gone Baby Gone"" and ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"", I am impressed and am convinced that he is a serious and talented actor. As for Ben Affleck, his directorial debut is impressive, and I am already looking forward to more of his work."
"m-garafalo","8","1","2","8 March 2008"," A solid effort by Ben Affleck
","Such a mixed reaction to this movie. At times I found myself wanting to love it but I ended up liking it instead. I guess my main complaint was when I watch movies that I want to smack of realism, any unrealistic moment will drop a star or two off it. On the plus side, and to refute the claim of nepotism, Casey Affleck did a great job. For those who say he was too boyish or slight, wake up people. This is what regular people look like. Did you want Clooney in this role, or Wahlberg in another Boston flick? I thought Ed Harris as well did a terrific job as he has does for the majority of his career. The only problem I have with this film is the insularity of the police work. You have a front page abduction and only 3 police officers aware of it? When something of this magnitude happens, there is no way it gets covered up to this degree. Corruption is one thing, but this scenario would be tough to pull off. Morgan Freeman's character, a retired African American all of sudden shows up with a 7yr old white girl? I don't care how forgiving or upscale a neighborhood is..questions will be asked. Suspend my disbelief? I know. The movie wins though because of how they handle the ending. Instead of having Morgan Freeman pull out a gun and threaten to start shooting to save his piece of utopia, he reasons with him. Almost resigned to the fact he is at the end of his rope, he puts the viewer in the position to choose,as well as Affleck which is always a good place to be. You really think the girlfriend has him turned, that is, until you see the state police lights in the background. So, a happy ending it is not, more bittersweet. Sounds like life to me."
"Nearly_Headless_J","8","1","2","8 March 2008"," Awesome movie. Ben Affleck should really stick to directing now...
","Previously, I had never really disliked Ben Affleck but I didn't think too highly of him either, as an actor. Then just recently I noticed his brilliant writing and decent performance in Good Will Hunting, and I grew to respect him a littleuntil a few hours ago when that respect drastically shot up to a much, much higher level than before.<br/><br/>Gone Baby Gone is definitely a triumphant win for Ben Affleck, considering it was his very first directorial venture (not counting the short film he had made years ago as a student). It is a maturely handled, realistic film which continuously shifts between telling a simple story and portraying some truly devastating moral dilemmas. What I like even more about this film is the way it presents the situations (which are again, very human and plausible); it takes to trouble to show both sides of the coin, and leaves the audience to make their own judgment without brainwashing/preaching them in any sort of way. This is especially significant in regards to the climax, when Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) has to make an important decision. The latter is not made out to be ""the only way out"", and nor are the consequences shown to be miraculously fitting to what Kenzie might have had in mind. Just like any real-life decision, the whole situation is portrayed with a hint of neutrality and uncertainty - because after all, we know absolutely nothing about what's going to happen in the future. We can only make our choices and hope we are right.<br/><br/>Looks like I went on a bit of a tangent there so, er, sorry. Anyway, back to the movie. I have to admit that initially, I had been a little disappointed because I wasn't finding the movie asthrilling, as I may have been expecting. But then I realised  the fault had not been the filmmaker's, but my own. Or rather, my upbringing of having seen so many mainstream 'thrillers' that I came to expect nothing but hollow, low-on-substance entertainment every time I heard the words ""detective movie"" or ""mystery thriller"". This movie, may not have the traditional ""in-your-face"" moments but it has something even more special  a heart. Not many filmmakers are able to achieve something like thisAffleck has all the right to feel proud of his work. Oh and of course, my comments would be incomplete if I don't mention the excellent performances by  well, the whole cast. Casey Affleck definitely stood out from the rest but even with their rather short screen times, people like Michelle Monaghan, Ed Harris and Amy Ryan certainly made their presence felt.<br/><br/>All in all this is an immensely well made, impactful movie. I'll be very much looking forward to Ben Affleck's next film as a director.<br/><br/>My Final Rating: 8.5/10."

","Gone Baby Gone I like Casey Affleck and his acting. Knowing Ben Affleck has directed this movie, made me more interested to see it. Reading good reviews and knowing about the story I ventured out to see it.<br/><br/>This is a story of a private detective Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) who gets an assignment to track a missing child. Circumstances lead him to the family of the missing child and then the town police chief Captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) and detective Remy Bressant (Ed Harris). Here he unravels some disturbing truths about drug abuse in family, kidnapping rackets and an underlying mystery. I will not disclose the mystery to dilute your interest in the movie. However, this leaves Patrick in a professional, ethical emotional and moral dilemma. How he overcomes that at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Casey Affleck has his own style of acting and he has done a good job at it. Same thing is with Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris who have given competent performances. The direction is apt by Ben Affleck. He has done a good job on his directorial debut.<br/><br/>The downtown and neighborhood is captured beautifully. Some sequences are also technically of high directional value  especially worth remembering are the ones when the detectives barge into the suspected child kidnappers and silent moments Casey has with his girl friend.<br/><br/>Overall a good movie.<br/><br/>(Stars 6.5 out of 10)"
"cwrdlylyn","6","1","2","19 February 2008"," GONE BABY GONE : Evidence That Affleck Has Potential As A Director, But Not A Perfect Piece...
","GONE BABY GONE <br/><br/>As an avid non-fan of Ben Affleck, I disregarded GONE BABY GONE when it first hit theatres because of my skepticism. When the reviews hit, it started to seem like I wasn't giving Affleck a fair chance b/c critics were favorable. But I allowed myself to believe the positive reviews Affleck received for HOLLYWOODLAND and go see the movie with an open mind... let's just say HOLLYWOODLAND was not a good experience for me and I fervently disagree with the critics on that one! So I was wary of GONE BABY GONE from the start. However, as the film managed to keep some presence through awards-season (for both Amy Ryan and Ben Affleck as a debut filmmaker) my curiosity got the better of me. I'm glad it did.<br/><br/>Not to say that GONE BABY GONE is a perfect film, it does feel a little like a first-time directorial effort. However, it's a film that shows Affleck might have promise as a director that he does not hold as an actor. GONE BABY GONE is a solid crime drama that tells the story of an abducted young girl through the eyes of a private investigator with no experience on this kind of case.<br/><br/>Casey Affleck, in a solid performance, plays Patrick Kenzie, a young man who's lived in Boston his whole life and now works as an independent investigator alongside his girlfriend Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan). Angie and Patrick are roped in to ""enhance"" the ongoing investigation that is taking place to locate a young girl named Amanda McReady. She is the daughter of a drug-runner (Amy Ryan), and she has disappeared under mysterious circumstances from an unhappy home. With the help of Detective Remy Bressant (Ed Harris), Patrick tries to find a way to balance his ethical beliefs with the necessary decisions his line of work present him with. But as Patrick and Angie uncover more of the truth, it becomes apparent this is nothing close to a typical abduction.<br/><br/>The film spends the first half of it's running time exploring the story as if it is your standard kidnapping investigation, but in the second half there is a major shift that brings the film into a totally different direction. The film has received comparisons to both MYSTIC RIVER and THE DEPARTED for basic reasons... using the Boston landscape most obviously. But the film does feel like a blend of the two films, that doesn't quite find the perfect balance to make it all work. Half of the film focuses on the human drama of an abduction like this (like MYSTIC RIVER), while the other half explores corruption vs. honor (like THE DEPARTED). These two parts never come together perfectly for GONE BABY GONE, but it still never goes completely off the rails.<br/><br/>Casey Affleck carries the film well and offers the movie's most nuanced and fully felt performance for my tastes. He proves that he is able to take his conversational and laid back approach to dialogue and lace it with gravitas just as well as he is able to lace it with humor (as exemplified in the OCEAN'S films). Amy Ryan has received a great deal of critical acclaim and awards attention for her performance as the burnt-out mother of the abducted child, and she does a phenomenal job of fully embodying Helene McReady. However, her screen time is limited and the character doesn't really have a change of heart. She is a one-note mess of a woman, and a frustrating one at that. Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman offer typically solid performances, but it's nothing new to see from them. Meanwhile, Monaghan escapes unscathed, but her character has virtually no definition. Though she is always present, she feels remarkably unnecessary and her relationship with Frankie does little to strengthen the films primary themes.<br/><br/>Overall, GONE BABY GONE is a solid, though unremarkable film. It vastly exceeded any expectations I would have placed on a Ben Affleck film however, and I won't avoid his film in theatres next time.<br/><br/>... B- ..."

","This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It grips you and make you think in a deep and very profound way. Does the ends justify the means? That is the central question this movie asks. There are many underlying themes and all are very deep. Age vs. youth, cops who use illegal methods to catch bad people, the nature of families. I think most of all this movie shows how excruciatingly hard it is to make the right choices in life. With morality nothing is black and white like so many people assume so they don't have to spend any effort figuring it out. Thinking about the moral choices the main character has to make will fry your brain, but in a good way. This is the type of movie that will have you thinking for a long time."

They don't intentionally throw you off track so they can shock you. You are just along for the ride and truly feel like you are seeing this through the eyes of the PI as he searches for truth. By the end of the film you aren't ready for the truth nor the choices that have to be made. This is one movie that blurs the line of right and wrong more than any movie I can remember. It is the type that will have you thinking for days, ""What would I have done?"" The thing is that you will be asking that question for more than one part of the movie and not just the climax.

"gradyharp","10","1","2","13 February 2008"," One of the Year's Best Fims: Oscar Ignored!
","Ben Affleck has written (with Aaron Stockard) a superb screenplay adaptation of Dennis Lahane's novel GONE BABY GONE and has proceeded to direct this tough tale with an ensemble cast of both well-known actors and unknown actors and walk-ons from the streets of the Boston area where they grisly story takes place. The result is a film so well tuned and realistic with a perfect sense of pacing and character development that it becomes a remarkable calling card for Ben Affleck's career as a director. That it is going unnoticed (with the exception of Amy Ryan's nomination for Best Supporting Actress) by the Oscars is a grave oversight ! The time is contemporary Dorchester, Massachusetts and Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and his girlfriend/partner Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan), become aware of a missing child Amanda (Madeline O'Brien) in their own neighborhood. The child's aunt Bea (Amy Madigan) and uncle Lionel (Titus Welliver), unable to cope with Amanda's drugged out mother Helene (Amy Ryan), knock on Patrick and Angie's door, pleading with them to help find Amanda: Patrick and Angie are private detectives who just happen to be an integral part of the neighborhood. Reluctant at first to become involved in the now 3-day police hunt for the child, a hunt headed by the respected Captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) who his lost his own daughter in similar circumstances and detectives Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton) and who as a triad feel they are competent to handle the case without the 'immature experience' of the young couple. But Patrick and Angie do become involved, uncover leads within the neighborhood that lead to the clues behind the missing child incident and in doing so, unravel a lot of corruption within the police force, and also discover differences between themselves that threaten their otherwise close relationship. To say more would remove the incredible tension this story maintains all the way to the fadeout credits.<br/><br/>The cast is uniformly excellent, from the smallest roles to the most major ones. It is difficult to single out any performer for praise as this is truly an ensemble piece. The flavor of the film is honest, unflinching, and refuses to ignore the grotesque incidents that must be shown for the movie to maintain its impact. Writer Dennis Lahane ('Mystic River', 'Shutter Island') is a master of detailing the spectrum of responses that ugly matters induce: even the most noble of intentions have their shadowy side. Affleck finds all of this in this excellent film, a film so strong that it easily bears repeated viewings. Highly recommended...but not for the squeamish. Grady Harp"

He came out of it with what ended up to be an extremely beautiful and touching film.<br/><br/>Casey Affleck deserves every award coming to him. His skills as an actor are only getting better.

","I went into Gone Baby Gone with a misconception about what it was going to be about, or rather a different interpretation of the synopsis. I was extremely pleased with the plot, but more so the realism of the story. The plot is so deep, yet understandable, and links us to a moral debate we all struggle with. I considered Casey Affleck a B-Rate actor before this film, but now I can see him becoming a prolific actor. His performance was convincing and incredible. Ed Harris was great as usual, and Amy Ryan was also terrific. The only thing keeping this movie from a 10 is what I consider a lack of character development. Affleck was such an interesting character, I would've loved to see them develop him a little more. There is some subpar acting also, by Michelle Monaghan and surprisingly, Morgan Freeman (who I feel was miscast). Ben Affleck directs well, with elements of Spike Lee and David Cronenberg clearly visible in his style. I'm looking forward to future pictures by him. I would recommend Gone Baby Gone to anyone, but I don't want to release any of the plot details, because I want people to have the same experience I did. This was definitely snubbed at Oscar time, especially the Afflecks and the adapted screenplay."
"asphixia_drop","6","1","2","2 February 2008"," Culd have been more subtle but I liked it
","It's the first screenplay written by Ben Affleck, the first time he's a director (it seems that there's another movie back in 1993) and he did very well. The cast is great. Casey Affleck of course. I started to like him recently when I saw Jesse James. I didn't really notice him in The Last Kiss, my badMorgan Freeman, Ed Harris, Michelle Monaghan.<br/><br/>The movie reaches his goal and makes you think. About justice, what justice, who is allowed to judge, to make choices for others. Does it make you good to shoot a pedophile who just killed a child? Do you feel better when you take a kid away from her junkie mother because you're convinced you're going to be a better parent to him? And do you think giving the kidnapped kid back to his mother after having her fake parents arrested was a good action? The movie could have missed his goal if it had stopped after Morgan Freeman and his wife are being arrested. But Ben Affleck added a last scene where you see Casey Affleck visiting the mother of the kid as she's getting ready for a date. The kid is on the couch watching TV, the mother is leaving and doesn't care about her kid staying alone in the house. Casey proposes to watch her baby. The mother leaves, Casey stays, sits on the couch and thinks. The scene could have been never ending. Watching a man thinking about his action(s), over and over again. Did he act right or not? Yes he knows he acted right because legally you cannot kidnap a kid even to give him a better life. But this moral purpose is killing Casey because he knows the kid would have been loved and happier with Morgan Freeman and his wife.<br/><br/>Does this sound a little manichaeist? I didn't really feel that way. The simple concept of being good or bad is certainly manichaeist but beyond that, I thought it was more about moral in our society. At the end of the movie everyone will be convinced that the little kid would have led a better life with Freeman and his lady. It is undoubtedly immoral to steal a kid from his mother and family. On the other hand it is also immoral not to raise your kid when you're a mother and it should be punished for sure. It's certainly not up to your neighbor to decide what's good for you though, for your kid or for any member of your family.<br/><br/>So you're stuck with you good moral and your big heart. The screenplay is good and unexpected. I thought it was somewhat caricatural and unreal though in a sense that it's hard to believe that the police would actually close such a case so quickly especially when they couldn't find the missing kid's body. Too emphasized too because the kidnappers are the cops, those very ones who are supposed to enforce the law and leave their morale in a closet. On the other side you've got Casey Affleck, a private detective who's better than any cop, upright, brave, persevering. Confusing rightAnd finally the episode with Casey's girlfriend who's like unable to discuss his decision. ""If you do that, I will hate you"" she says. So yeah the idea is thrown at you rather violently, just to make sure you get it and I suppose it could have been done with more subtlety. But it remains a good movie to me and I recommend it."

","As someone who works on movie and TV productions, on the set, often in the sound department, I can safely say that the reason ""montre-1"" saw mics in so many shots was due to the projectionist. He or she failed to position the film correctly, so that the frame was matted properly. During production, there is a ""safe"" zone outside the intended frame, and it acts as a buffer of sorts, or a warning zone for the camera operator. He or she can see if a microphone (or lights, or other crew people, etc.) is close to the ""real"" frame.<br/><br/>The fact that you saw mics in the shots of the trailers shown before the movie further illustrates how the projectionist was not doing his/her job properly. Believe me, this is how films have been made and shown for a very long time, so don't blame the technicians."

","I am mildly shocked that a movie this high-rated can turn out this bad. Classifiable as typical student work, you are basically going to see a big lot of movie clichés stitched together to form an end result that never convinces. The main storyline idea is good, but the script is terrible to the point of being blatantly moronic. All of the persona's in the movie completely fall out of character more than once which makes the story and the characters themselves progressively unlikely and unbelievable.<br/><br/>The summit of this all is typified in the supposed morally superior main character not hesitating for even a second to barbarically shoot an unarmed, crying criminal through the back of the head and - if that's not enough - be generally praised for this by both his cop friend and (supposedly sensitive ánd sensible) girlfriend afterwards. Thinking these are odd morals, the surprise is complete when 'the other difficult moral decision of the movie' (see scripting textbook chapter 4b) is made leading to the child being returned to her righteous mother which, for the main character's girlfriend, turns out to be enough reason to, completely unexpectedly and illogically, start hating her lover and business partner enough to break up completely. This (and the final, utterly predictable scene that follows) completes the story's drama which obviously has been the film maker's objective, but unfortunately it is, instead, more successful in driving home the idea that you've actually been watching a very bad movie."
"dbborroughs","7","2","7","23 December 2007"," Be Affleck crafts one the years best films, or would have been except its source material breaks apart in the final stretch to the end
","Ben Affleck marches toward an eventual Best Director Oscar, maybe not this year, but mark my words he will be getting one if he repeats his stellar work on Gone Baby Gone.<br/><br/>This is the story of a private detective and his partner who are asked by the family of a missing girl to help the police. The family knows that some people won't talk to cops so they hire Casey Affleck to augment the investigation. It quickly transpires that the loving mother was far from saintly and that there are other problems in the investigation.<br/><br/>Brilliantly acted and monstrously wonderful on a technical end this film hopefully will get a boat load of Oscar nominations for all concerned at years end. Casey Affleck, Ed Harris and pretty much everyone else are at the top of the game and reason enough to watch the film. Director Ben Affleck has created a film that is a masterpiece mood and emotion. We are in Boston and these are real people. Affleck has managed to take any notion of this being unreal and a story being performed by actors and removed it from our minds. Thats a huge order when faced with titans like Harris and Morgan Freeman. Its a stellar achievement. I can't say enough, actually all I can say is that he's made something real and tangible, which is the highest praise I know.<br/><br/>The problem with the film is the source material. Based on a book by the Author of Mystic River (another movie/story with plot holes you could drive a truck through) the film suffers from a complete break down of logic and reason in the last half. What is going on, really is so potboiler-ish as to be absurd. I kept wondering if I was missing something, and then realized I wasn't. I know that the twist and turns allow for the exploration of moral question and issues, but at the same time they are unbelievable in any real world sense. The problems are such that it keeps a good film from being what it should have been, one of the best of the year.<br/><br/>Still the technical virtuosity of Ben Affleck and his cast make this a film that you really should see. Acting and directing don't get better than this."

I wanted to say he should go back to acting, but Mr Affleck sucks at that too. While Clint Eastwood creates a genuine empathy in his movies, Ben Affleck thinks that haunting music, long drawn out silences and mumbling lead actors will do the trick.

"robsta23","10","1","3","18 February 2016"," Ben Affleck's Masterpiece
","What a truly great mystery. Gone Baby Gone has all the elements any good mystery story should have - misdirection, crazy twists and turns, and bloodshed (just to add to the excitement). The all-star cast especially elevates Gone Baby Gone to heights that exceed most mysteries and thrillers produced in this day and age.<br/><br/>The person who earned this film an Oscar nomination: Amy Ryan. Rightfully so. Appearing in supporting roles in both The Office and The Wire, Amy Ryan goes well out of her comfort zone to play a druggie coked out of her mind, conflicted emotionally over her missing child (at points she can care less, at others it is heartbreaking how she takes it). It is difficult not to marvel at Ryan's performance; she is completely believable as being psychologically disturbed which is rare from an actress who is sane in her other roles (well, at least in The Wire). It is very difficult to pull off being a convincing drug addict, and Ryan is arguably the best part of this film.<br/><br/>The plot is on and off at points; in the first half of the film it is easy to notice that something seems ""off,"" but it is hard to put a finger on it, making the audience question the events as a good mystery should. The outcome of a mystery should be a surprise, but you don't want to keep the audience completely in the dark if you want the outcome to seem plausible. However, the logic of the situations in the first half of Gone Baby Gone does not add up in ways that are too obvious.<br/><br/>What makes up for this? Practically everything else about the film. The story eventually gets to a point where the morality of certain situations and choices is questioned by both the characters and the audience, and with good reason too. Movies are meant to be about the human condition, and when you have a film like Gone Baby Gone pose difficult questions of what is ethical, or what the greater good is in certain situations, you have an outstanding movie (and it helps when the twist of any mystery is very unexpected).<br/><br/>Gone Baby Gone is an overlooked work by Ben Affleck. It is his best film, but it did not get the recognition it deserved when it was released.<br/><br/>4.0/4.0"

","I didn't enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>I thought the script was messy, poorly developed, and lost all its intensity after Amanda was considered dead. Ben Affleck chose the easy way, he resolved the whole plot by a series of muddled flashbacks instead of getting the audience involved in the process. I won't extend my thoughts on the flaws of the scenario, but clearly there are huge ones.<br/><br/>As for Casey Affleck, he clearly is one of the worst actors I've seen, he is always mumbling and has the same dumb expression on his face all the time. The rest of the cast is average, but how can you blame them when their characters haven't been properly developed ? Where is the depth and the psychology that makes you care about the protagonists ? One last thing I found annoying is Ben Affleck's direction which is bland, really uninteresting nor captivating. And the editing was awful, with quite a few pointless shots and scenes."

Realism is out the window within the first 10 minutes. The ending is so insanely stupid and ""surprising"" in an unrealistic way that This is the kind of sub-mediocre film that usually wins Oscars.

","Gone Baby Gone, adapted from a book by Dennis Lehane, the author of Mystic River, marks Ben Affleck's directorial debut. While the move did pose and interesting moral question, I found the movie confusing, unrealistic, and a little boring. The story centers around a little girls kidnapping. Casey Affleck is a private investigator hired by the missing child's aunt to supplement the police investigation.<br/><br/>I wasn't terribly impressed with the acting. Ed Harris gives a spirited performance as a cop, and Amy Madigan matches his intensity as a protective aunt, but those were the shining stars among weak performances. Morgan Freeman disappointed me, as he is a phenomenal actor, but he plays a watered-down version of a police chief dedicated to bringing missing children home. I can't decide whether it was Michelle Monaghan's performance or the script that left me cringing every time she spoke. Casey Affleck, Ben Affleck's brother, is an actor that does possess talent, and is easy on the eyes, but like Michelle Monaghan's character, was either just poorly written, or just lukewarm in his delivery. It's possible that the casting for these two characters miss the mark, but I certainly expected more from Casey.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck obviously strives to impress us with his directing skills, but in general, his attempt at stylish directing simply made the movie more muddled. With the numerous fades and voice-overs, it gives more of a feeling of confusion than clarity. And matching the stories dark themes with dark lighting made me wonder if I needed to adjust my television's brightness. I was also disappointed in the connection between both Afflecks and the Boston setting. Instead of making a clear connection to the neighborhood, with the exception of thick Bostonian accents, the movie could have been set in any U.S. city. The suspense seemed to come to a crescendo at least three times. The only reason I knew the movie couldn't possibly be over yet was because hardly even half and hour had passed when I thought we were reaching the climax. Ben may be able to pull it off in the future, but at this point his skills are, and come across, amateurish.<br/><br/>The basic plot of this movie is what left me the most unsatisfied. The basic premise of the story is preposterous. I can't explain why without giving away too many details, but I would love to hear anyone disagree with me. The best part of the movie is the previously mentioned interesting moral question, which in itself could be a reason to watch this movie. But if you are hungry for movies with interesting moral questions, I would rather recommend Eye for an Eye, starring Sally Field, and again, Ed Harris."

"johnny-08","8","1","3","28 January 2008"," Great surprise and another proof that actors can direct
","Ben Affleck's first directing try and definitely good one. ""Gone Baby Gone"" is not a masterpiece, 'only' a good movie and one of the biggest surprises of 2007. Why? Story is the most important part of every movie. This one has the story and it talks about disappearance of 4 year old Amanda McCready (Madeline O'Brien). Amanda's mother Helene (Amy Ryan) is drug addict so girl's aunt Beatrice McCready (Amy Madigan) hires two private detectives: Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan), who all also lovers. Chief of police Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) wants to find the girl, as he is tormented with the disappearance and death of his own daughter, so he assigns detectives Bressant (Ed Harris) and Poole (John Ashton) to help Patrick and Angie.<br/><br/>Story is simply great, because you don't know what is going to happen till the end and the suspense is also on top. What is also good is that Affleck managed to present us great shoots of Boston and his interiors are also remarkable (especially house of Trett family). If you have a good script you can attract good actors too. Ben had luck so he could hire his brother Casey for the main role and on that way he managed to escape his own appearance in this movie (which is great because he could stay focused only on directing). Ben also knows abilities of Casey and two of them works just fine. This script also attracted great stars like Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris (my personal favorite in this movie). But Amy Ryan (Oscar nomination) in the role of Helene provides us what this film needs. Great role of mother who is torn between drugs and her missing baby. Only one thing that bothered me in this casting: Michelle Monaghan. Her character is in this story only because of that scene when Patrick has to choose what he will do at the end. Monaghan wasn't given a role so she could show her acting abilities and that is the only weak link of this great scenario. <br/><br/>My favorite scenes are conversation between Patrick and Bressant, when Bressant is drinking (Harris is great!!!) and of course the last scenes in the McCready house and the whole issue that is put in front of Patrick (cause he controls Amanda's future). At the end I've got one plea. Please watch this movie, cause it's good, strong and innovative."

"DICK STEEL","10","1","3","26 January 2008"," A Nutshell Review: Gone Baby Gone
","While Ben Affleck has gotten a number of flak for his acting ability or lack thereof, there is no denying that his directorial debut with Gone Baby Gone deserves the accolades bestowed upon his work, as he directs younger brother Casey in a tale about the seedier side of private investigation, but stripped of noir elements and immersed totally in the wheeling and dealings with plenty of grey.<br/><br/>Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan play the couple Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro who owns a private investigations agency dealing with missing people. Theirs is a small outfit, but they're the go-to persons when you need a second opinion aside from the official investigations by the authorities, the ones who can speak to those in the underbelly of society, whose denizens for obvious reasons refuse to speak to cops. They get called upon one day when the relatives of missing child Amanda McCready (Madeline O'Brien) sought their help to augment police investigations, and as far as statistics go, entering the investigations at this point in time is like entering a fight with one hand tied behind your back, and reluctantly, they decide to first explore their options and study the background, before taking the case on.<br/><br/>It's a fantastic interplay between Patrick and Angie starting off with the latter's fears that results may come in the form of finding the body violated, or in some dumpster. You can't deny that try as you might to emotionally distance yourself from the crime, the fact that it involves innocent children will still somehow grow on you. Worse, the single mom Helene McCready (Amy Ryan) is a drug junkie, which of course presented an additional angle with regards to parental responsibility, and more often than not, you'll find yourself disgusted with her white trash antics.<br/><br/>While the movie coasts along quite ordinarily in presenting both case facts and narrative development as the investigations wore on, what cemented Gone Baby Gone into greatness, is its final 20 minutes. Adapted for the screen by Ben Affleck and Aaron Stockard based on the Dennis Lehane novel, it's filled with incredible melancholy, and ends on a somewhat emotionally sad note with great personal sacrifice. I can't recall a crime thriller of late that gripped you with the finale, especially when many pretenders tried hard, but failed miserably. There's an excellent debate between doing what's right, and what's necessary by the book, although the yardstick of measure definitely differs from person to person. Sometimes, you're stuck in similar catch-22 situations, that it be damned if you do or don't. Depending on your values and principles, you might be called upon to undergo deep questioning of oneself about turning the blind eye and walking away, but unfairly given the constraint of time working against you.<br/><br/>I haven't seen much of casey Affleck's work except for his short appearances sharing the screen with the bigger names in the Ocean's 11 franchise. I thought that Gone Baby Gone allowed him to shine through and convince that he can be a leading man, though not necessary single name marquee yet. Michelle Monaghan however continues with her supporting female roles playing love interests and such, and I guess it might take a while before she's able to break out of the stereotype. Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris lend gravitas to Affleck's movie, and show that they can still chew scenes despite their limited screen time.<br/><br/>Gone Baby Gone has surpassed expectations, and comes highly recommended from me. You might be surprised at the developments at the halfway mark, and might think there's an error in the runtime, but trust me, that's just where the fun begins and the movie picking up from strength to strength."

"Pavel-8","7","1","3","28 December 2007"," Not bad, but it's no Mystic River.
","As I am federally mandated to point out, ""Gone Baby Gone"" is the directorial debut of Ben Affleck, a fact that is impossible to overlook while watching the movie. Sometimes I wish I could watch a movie while completely ignorant of its director, but that's another post. Anyway, Affleck clearly cares about this crime drama, both in content and location, and his loving fingerprints mark the film with a unique raw edge.<br/><br/>For a multitude of reasons, ""Gone Baby Gone"" can succinctly be described as a light version of ""Mystic River"", which was likewise based on a Dennis Lehane novel. The subject matter is equally heavy and thick, also exploring family dynamics through a painful crime involving a child. Both movies are set in Boston, and the one thing that ""Gone"" does better, largely due to Affleck's devotion to his hometown, is capture the seedy bizarreness of the local culture. Beyond that, ""Gone"" trails ""River"" in every aspect, not to an extent that makes ""Gone"" a poor film, but merely a decent one that does not remotely reach the great heights Clint Eastwood achieved four years ago.<br/><br/>First, the story itself is weaker and more transparent, due in slight part to a bit of foreshadowing. The moral waters here are equally murky, but shallower once fully explored. Secondly, the cast is weaker; that's not so much a swipe at a solid troupe includes the always good Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris, but rather reminds how loaded River was with proved, veteran talent (Penn, Robbins, Bacon, Fishbourne, Linney, Harden). The younger faces here, like Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, and (especially) Amy Ryan, acquit themselves well, but they do not possess the gravitas that can make such a film so much better. They are simply in a different league, the NFC versus ""River's"" superior AFC. Similarly, Affleck's movie sports an effective rough look and a less effective uneven flow, as opposed to the smooth and polished texture of Eastwood fluid masterpiece. For a first film though, Affleck's end product is impressive and worth watching for fans of the genre.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Always decent, sometimes quite good, but it's nowhere near ""Mystic River"". 7 out of 10."

It is however the ethical standpoints of the characters which aroused my sense of ""being there"" and which ultimately raised the film over the bar of mediocre good films. <br/><br/>The question is as follows: should Patrick give in to common sense morality and not notify the police that ex-copper Jack Doyle has set up a complex ploy so to kidnap a girl from her drug abusing mother in order to offer the former a better life?<br/><br/>""Yes"" is the answer which a world governed by laws would deem correct (not necessarily moral). ""Yes"" is, ultimately, the safer choice. I say this, because abiding by rules is in itself always safer than not doing so, moral dilemmas notwithstanding. But Patrick, as hinted throughout the film, does not take decisions based on their level of complexity, on their consequences, but on his rigid moral code (=trust in the legal system), which makes him a perfect element of the legal system. <br/><br/>Many films have asked this question, of how moral police duty has to be and to which lengths an officer should go in order to convict a person he obviously deems guilty, but lacks proof to substantiate such a claim. Legally, it is wrong for policemen to facilitate justice in such a manner, even if the outcome is a positive one. But once again, this does not mean that the act itself is not moral, because there is no ultimate decider which has deemed the legal system infallible - the fact that it is man conceived states the opposite. The legal system is a system, in the sense that we require systems in order to function as a social entity. If there was no system, most of our concepts about the world we live in would be void of meaning. Ergo, we need systems to survive in a community, the question being whether and how systems should be changed and if undermining the system is fundamentally wrong. <br/><br/>Now, the system is important because usually, certainty is not as easily attainable as it comes in a film in which we are omniscient. Which brings us to the aforementioned issue - is undermining the system something fundamentally wrong? If we are dealing with a system that nurtures our freedom (as is the case here), then we can safely assume that it is a system we need (totalitarian systems, for example, we don't really need). So should this system break down because our act of undermining it, then we have done severe harm to everyone involved. But if it doesn't, then the act could theoretically be considered.<br/><br/>Patrick's choice is certainly not a consequentialist one. It is obvious that the child's mother is far from fit to nurture her, as the mother's own destructive lifestyle shows. Even the hope of redemption on her behalf is more or less squashed in the ending. Still, this does not mean that Patrick has made the wrong choice. He has however made a more difficult choice, from all perspectives: he lost his girlfriend over it, he threw away what probably was a better environment for the child, and he was left deeply concerned about the situation. It's true that he'd have been concerned any way, but given his decision to ensure the kid's return to her mother, Patrick became obliged to guarantee that his sense of morality did not ruin a small girl's life. Therefore, my interpretation is that his act can only be deemed as correct, if he can himself compensate for the mother's inability to take care of the child. <br/><br/>There is one more issue to discuss: does a mother have fundamental moral right to have her child? The answer to this is simple, as there can't be any fundamental intrinsic moral rights in a world of reason as far as anything not relating to the self is concerned. This means that a mother has a legal right to be with her child, but she can't have any God given right to it, just because she was the one to bear it onto this world. There is no moral worth to getting pregnant and then giving birth to a child. It is the manner in which you take care of it that entails moral value. <br/><br/>So as far as I can tell, the film does not sentence Patrick's judgment. Even in philosophical terms, a utilitarian couldn't deem his choice as good or bad, because its consequences are still uncertain. Somehow though it feels wrong to think of morality as something retrospective, that means as something which can only be judged as time goes by. I say this because I can't see how anyone could truly foresee what consequences his actions will have when he takes them. Sure, one could assume, but would a wrong assumption then mean that the person to have taken it is a bad person? No. The decision itself might be bad, so in this sense, morality can be retrospective, but in the end, it is the individual people we want to know something about, not their choices. <br/><br/>I do enjoy films which put my mind to work. I'm not saying ""mindless fun"" doesn't serve its purpose - and sometimes even when you get wound up by a movie (Deja Vu), this doesn't necessarily mean it is good. Gone Baby Gone is a good film though, with good all around performances. And it also gives you something to think about."
"Chris Knipp","9","1","3","11 December 2007"," Ben Affleck's rough and arresting directorial debut
","In the poor South Boston neighborhood of Dorchester (writer Dennis Lehane's birthplace) the TV news and an avid public are all over a story: a little girl has been kidnapped. Family members want Patrick Kenzie (Ben Affleck) and his girlfriend and partner Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan), young missing persons detectives, to investigate. Police Captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) objects. Police detectives Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton) aren't friendly. But Patrick and Angie are tough and they persist. It's they who unravel what turns out to be one of Lehane's typically tangled webs.<br/><br/>Gone Baby Gone doesn't completely work as a movie, but it's still a very interesting directorial debut for Ben Affleck--who took a wise risk in trusting his younger brother Casey for the central role. Casey's no novice, but never a star till this year. He's arresting as the shifty, insecure Ford in Andrew Dominik's arty Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, and he embodies innocent idealism equally effectively here. Ben also took a risk in deciding to go for grit, with many actual denizens of the low life world it depicts used as minor actors.<br/><br/>Dennis Lehane's story set in the white ghettos of Boston, which forms the movie's basis, isn't as deep and dark and mystical a tale as his Mystic River, filmed four years ago by Clint Eastwood to great acclaim. But the issues this film raises are simpler, plainer, and ultimately more troubling: they go to the roots of the uneasy equation of morality and class. And despite use of some solid pros, including Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman, this one doesn't have the distractions of Eastwood's star-studded cast.<br/><br/>Casey Affleck is small. He's nice looking, but not as commanding or handsome as Ben. He has a rusty, reedy voice that doesn't carry; it just stands in the air. He also has a quality of freshness and surprise, as if the camera's caught him off guard but he refuses to flinch. His Patrick Kenzie will stand up to the toughest, most evil people in Dorchester: he has balls of brass without seeming to know it, or to know any other way. It's this strength from the early scenes, where he's tentative, yet unyielding, that gives conviction to his later choices.<br/><br/>The film is anchored by Morgan Freeman in the important secondary role of the police captain, a man who's lost a child to kidnapping himself and now heads a Crimes Against Children unit. The other main role is Ed Harris' as the feisty, mysterious detective from Louisiana; Harris shows his stuff here; he's hard and slick without cliché. Some commentators have objected to Ben's use of bloated bar bums and other authentic white ghetto locals; they've said these salty characters are too distracting and pull the story down into an inferno of lowlife immorality.<br/><br/>But that's the point. From the first, when Bea McCready (Amy Madigan) and her husband, Lionel (Titus Welliver) appear to seek Patrick and Angie's help three days after the highly publicized abduction of their little niece Amanda, things feel fishy. This is a world so hopeless and off center it crawls with sleaze. It soon emerges that Amanda's single mom Helene (Amy Ryan), Lionel's sister, is a real mess, more into turning tricks to buy drugs than minding her little girl. She's a drug runner herself, and the abductors are probably people she's embroiled with.<br/><br/>The incredible, troubling question that will arise is whether Amanda's mother is at fault herself; if she cared; and obviously, if she was a fit mother. But can she be faulted for the lowness of her own life? Taking us into convoluted lives and twisted emotions warped by deprivation, addiction, and traumatic loss, the story at times seems like a slum version of something from James Ellroy's ultra-lurid (but highly cinematic) ""L.A. Quartet,"" with similarly twisted machinations and motives in a Lehane permutation. Nobody is what they seem to be, except for Patrick and Angie. The unraveling revelations may strain credulity, but they keep you paying attention.<br/><br/>The movie is very strong on atmosphere and situation, not quite so good at sustaining the forward momentum of the action. Most of what happens seems to come through flashback or review. The investigation tale ends, and then it picks up again later. I'm not sure the movie ever recovers its energy, and yet still t it gets much more interesting, despite the fact that it flounders a bit somewhere midway in the denouement. But then the moral dilemma comes hard in the face of the young investigators--and us--an issue so clearly posed and firmly dwelt upon that we carry it out beyond the credits.<br/><br/>8 1/2-9"
"renona","8","1","3","25 October 2007"," Definitely a must see
","Ben Affleck's directorial debut came out strong, as Gone Baby Gone reproduced the same sort of gut wrenching drama seen in Mystic River. Both movies were adapted from books by Dennis Lehane.<br/><br/>The movie plays like a morality tale seen through the eyes of Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck), who plays a private detective in a run down Boston neighborhood. When Kenzie is asked to look into a case of a missing local girl, he and his partner/girlfriend Angie (played by Michelle Mongahan) soon discover the grim realities and horrors associated with child kidnappings. Morgan Freeman plays a police detective who heads the Boston department responsible for discovering missing persons, and Ed Harris is one of the cops assigned to the case.<br/><br/>Although it seems that Patrick and Angela are confronted with moral quandaries just about every five minutes, the movie is not overly preachy, and does not endorse any particular ideology or belief system. Indeed it's very easy to sympathize with many of the arguments made in the movie, including the final one made by Morgan Freeman, which is somewhat of a twist although not quite as much as other reviews have made it out to be. The movie ran for just under two hours, though it sure felt longer due to some of the suspense. There are about three extremely climactic scenes in the movie, which make for some great film making but also for a good bit of downtime to recover and prepare for the next one.<br/><br/>Casey Affleck, who's probably better known for his comedic performances, did a great job as the main character. Although if you only know him from elsewhere, it may be hard to adjust. Morgan Freeman was, as usual, great. And Ed Harris and John Ashton (famous for his role as Detective Taggart in Beverly Hills Cop) were wonderful as a good cop/bad cop team.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was great. But before we crown Ben Affleck as a new Spielberg, it'd be best to see him do a few more movies first. Remember he was also great in Good Will Hunting, and then went on to box office hell with Pearl Harbor, Gigli, Jersey Girl, Paycheck, the list goes on and on."

","Over the last three or four decades it seems novelists and filmmakers have been working overtime to erase the image of Boston we acquired via the works of John P. Marquand and movies like The Late George Apley (from Marquand's novel) so that today we're used to seeing it as something of a Hell's Kitchen with a pahk the cah in Hahvahd Yahd accent. Gone Baby Gone reinforces this concept in an exceptionally fine movie whose screenplay was arguably written on onion skin and slowly peels away layer after layer until ending up almost diametrically opposite where it began.

"shaneo632","8","1","4","25 December 2007"," A surprisingly engrossing directorial debut for Affleck...
","Shaun Munro's Film Reviews (www.shaunmunro.co.uk):<br/><br/>English readers may recognise Gone Baby Gone only through the controversy surrounding its release in the United Kingdom, whereby, due to the recent disappearance of four year old Madeleine McCann, the film's release has been delayed until April of next year. Life's ability to imitate art aside, Gone Baby Gone, based on Dennis Lehane's novel of the same name, is a gritty, competently acted, and surprisingly well-directed effort from Ben Affleck. Not only does the film present an intriguing, winding plot, but it also asks the viewer several questions, and the moral dilemma of the film's climax is a painful, disturbing one which will keep audiences arguing for years to come.<br/><br/>Affleck serves well to throw the viewer headlong into the kidnapping story from the outset, introducing us to private investigator Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck), who is hired by the aunt of the missing young girl. Kenzie's girlfriend, Angie (Michelle Monaghan), is also his investigative partner, and works as a means of opposition to his steely determination to discover the whereabouts of young Amanda. Angie claims that she doesn't wish to find the remains of a child, whether they be dead or alive, if the results may be overly harrowing (such as the child having been heavily abused)  such a view is an interesting one that less daring films would ostensibly choose to omit. However, it must be said that Monaghan's character is the film's weak link, and appears to largely be superfluous  she does little to drive the narrative, and other than one particularly daring moment, she seems to work as a device for Kenzie to bounce dialogue off of, a sidekick of sorts.<br/><br/>Above most all else, Gone Baby Gone is a film comprised of magnificent acting talent, and truer in no great instances than those of Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris. Freeman portrays Captain Jack Doyle, an officer with a chip on his shoulder, and his involvement in the plot's resolution is greater than most would expect at the outset. Freeman assumes one of the more intriguing characters in the film, although no-one is as thoroughly interesting as the super-charged Detective Remy Bressant (Ed Harris). With his facial hair, Harris' look is a departure from the ordinary, yet it provides Harris with the ""badass"" look that the part so very much requires. Much like Doyle, he is wary of the baby-faced Affleck, yet in contrast, he is far more acerbic, and far less calm.<br/><br/>The novel aspect of the film lies within the fact that Kenzie, as not only a PI, but as someone who grew up in the underbelly of Boston, is privy to information, and to contacts that the police are not  he is able to penetrate the hidey-holes of Boston, something which ""stuffed shirts"" cannot. In many investigative dramas, such attributes would appear clichéd or tired, yet due to Kenzie not being a cop, this concept remains fresh and not insulting to the viewer.<br/><br/>The manner in which the facts of the case unravel occurs surprisingly quickly  various discoveries and interrogations lead to a very promising prospect less than half-way through the film, yet the tension and mystery are nevertheless relentless in their intensity. As Kenzie and the police are faced with more and more convincing leads, and as each one is debunked, it only seeks to both fluster and intrigue the characters, as well as the viewer even more.<br/><br/>By the half-way mark, things are looking very bleak indeed for young Amanda, and it is impressive that the film burns so quickly, given the tendency for procedural criminal investigation pictures to keep the viewer in the dark until the film's final moments. Affleck's various monologues bridge the gap between the segmented narrative, which dilutes the passage of time more than you may expect, and more unexpected (yet very welcome) narrative intrusions allay any restlessness the audience may otherwise feel, in keeping them fed with information, whilst still managing to maintain a level of genuine intrigue.<br/><br/>Whilst Gone Baby Gone's main attraction is the painful moral crux that plagues Kenzie in the film's latter moments, it is not just a film of morality, but of religion, and conflicting ideologies in general. In one show-stealing scene between Harris and Affleck, these beliefs clash  Bressant's ideals may not be orthodox, yet he is driven, clear in his ideas, and he garners results. Kenzie, however, is ambivalent in regard to the lengths people should go to in order to protect children, and this ill will is worsened by his Christian upbringing. It makes for fascinating wordplay, particularly in regard to Harris' Oscar-worthy ""You've gotta take a side"" speech.<br/><br/>The picture's end serves up genuine surprises, and whilst it essentially becomes cat and mouse fare, it is very engaging, masterfully constructed cat and mouse fare. The ""big twist"" isn't initially convincing, although the explanation and accompanying moral dilemma are utterly compelling. With everyone, including his girlfriend, against him, and warning him of the potential dangers of his actions, Kenzie must make a decision. He stands to lose a lot, and to damage many people (including himself) with what is the ""right"" choice (at least legally). The turn is one of genuine surprise, and by the film's end, it elicits a disturbing, yet incredibly vital social commentary on how we raise our children.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck has turned many heads with his directorial debut  it is doubtful that many expected his first venture behind the camera to succeed to this high a degree, yet with such an impressive level of acting talent on board (no moreso than the brilliant Ed Harris), it would have been difficult for Affleck to fail. Gone Baby Gone is little in way of inventive film-making, but it is an impressive effort from all involved, and it raises a number of valid moral and ethical questions."
"Monotreme02","7","1","4","24 December 2007"," Powerful performances; succeeds in capturing the Boston atmosphere and a powerful morality tale
","Another in this year's continuous selection of morality tales, Gone Baby Gone raises a lot of questions; deep, resonant moral questions of course, but also some external questions that haven't to do with the film content but rather the talent behind the camera, questions also raised back in 1998. Questions like ""how is this guy, who has an unusual tendency to pick bad movie roles and the wrong people to date, so good at film-making?"", and ""why hasn't he done this stuff before?"", and ""why hasn't he done any more of this?"" Indeed Ben Affleck and Matt Damon's debut-and-only screenplay, Good Will Hunting, is one of the greatest examples of debut screen writing and is intriguing not only because it is so good as a stand-alone work, but also intriguing because the two haven't written a screenplay since. That is until now, when Affleck wrote and also chose to direct his second (mainstream) screenplay, and did such a fantastic job that it's incredibly that he didn't use his Hollywood clout to land a directing job before this one.<br/><br/>Affleck utilizes his intimate knowledge and personal experience of the streets of Boston and employs this experience to create one of the best portrayals of rural city atmosphere in recent years. Affleck paints the seedy underbelly of Boston with immense skill, clearly making use of the sights, sounds, backgrounds and people he grew up with and even putting many of them in the film. Indeed one of the greatest elements working to the film's advantage is Affleck's spot-on brilliant ability to capture the very spirit and atmosphere of the underbelly of Boston, an ability that should leave many directors envious.<br/><br/>Another element working to the film's advantage is the acting. Affleck directs his extremely talented actors to absolutely pitch-perfect performances, and manages to turn his younger brother into a bona-fide leading man. This role, along with his supporting turn in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, are sure to propel his star in Hollywood immensely. Affleck simply commands the film and proves that he is more than capable of carrying not only a complex, intricate mystery plot but also a very heavy moral dilemma and message. Michelle Monaghan is passable but doesn't really have much acting to do, but the rest of the cast deliver stellar performances, in particular Ed Harris as the hard-boiled detective who helps Affleck's Patrick character, and even more so in Broadway veteran Amy Ryan who delivers a frightening, visceral, raw and brilliantly vicious performance as the broken, manic drug-addicted mother whose young daughter's abduction puts the plot's gears in motion. It is a fantastic star-making performance for her as well and this will hopefully be the launching point for a wonderful film career for her as well as for Casey Affleck.<br/><br/>As I previously mentioned, Gone Baby Gone serves as one of many morality-themed films released in 2007, which study and sometimes judge the motives that cause people to do the things they do and make the decisions they choose to make. In the film, based on the novel by Dennis Lehane who is no stranger to dark, Boston-set morality tales, the main character Patrick must choose between understanding the motives behind a heinous crime and perhaps even reaching the conclusion that they were good-natured motives, and between making the decision he thinks is right but may not be. Any film which openly raises these questions and actively engages its audience in the moral dilemma, in effect asking the viewers what they think is right, automatically gets some high points in my book, especially if it is done as effectively as in this film.<br/><br/>That said, the movie suffers from one major drawback in that in the final act it allows the shocking mystery revelations to take over in place of the heavy moral dilemmas and the brilliantly detailed depiction of the Boston underbelly that characterize the first two thirds of the film and make them so brilliant. These revelations aren't all on the brightest side and the whole conspiracy theory is old and rather daft, but the film skims over these parts rather quickly and hastily returns to its previous high levels of quality, characterized by powerfully brilliant and spot-on performances and wonderful, location-based direction from Ben Affleck. As a debut directorial effort the film is even more impressive, and even without Affleck's name on the poster it still works as an effective, engaging morally themed crime-mystery."

","When I saw the first preview of this movie, I got goosebumps all over. I'd read the book by Dennis Lehane, and ""Gone Baby Gone"" is THE one & only story I've ever read which stuck in my gut and my soul without ever letting go. I was a little worried the ending might have been altered in the movie, but I've been rooting for Ben Affleck ever since the public began its mean assault on him, so I figured he wouldn't let me down...and he did not. <br/><br/>The plot was condensed, and some characters changed a little, as they would have to be. The language was updated (perhaps a bit foully) from the clever and ironic original, but the meat of the story came through bright and loud and clear. The direction and acting were brilliant, and so, so real. Casey Afflect was perfect, Ed Harris will surely receive an Oscar, and Amy Ryan was so effective, I didn't even notice she was acting, I was too busy loathing her. Keep your eyes on her future, people! <br/><br/>This is a gritty, hard, thought-provoking story.It's a story I'm so very glad has risen from the obscurity (these days) of print, to the toppity-top of the silver screen. Yay and bravo all around! Oh, and by the way, the ending WAS changed just a little bit from the novel. Screenwriters Ben Affleck and Aaron Stockard made the best decision ever to make the very last scene a study in subtle hopefulness rather than the heartbreaking conclusion to the novel. Both endings are good, but I think the movie's ending will draw more of an audience, and, perhaps, effect more change in the long run. I hope so, anyway."

I can't think of another movie that is so mournful, or another mood piece which so perfectly and beautifully sustains its mood throughout.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck memorably has compassion and empathy for his characters, while not shrinking away from the appalling aspects of their personalities and the grimness of dead-end lives And what a joy to see a thoughtful movie with moral ambiguities, one that is asks hard questions and presents no easy answers. The ethical struggles through which the characters are going are so deeply expressed as to be completely palpable, and this is accomplished without an ounce of sentimentality.<br/><br/>Affleck's non-judgmental stance towards most of the characters adds to the depth and richness of the picture. The film's ambiance is also superb  the production design, costumes, extras all convey such a strong sense of a very particular place.<br/><br/>And what acting! If we didn't know Amy Ryan was an acclaimed stage actress, we'd assumed she was someone Affleck came upon at a bar in Dorchester. She's uncannily good. And a shout out to Amy Madigan, who is just as impressive (and in some ways even more terrifying than Ryan). As for Casey  wow! After The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Bob Ford, another superb and unforgettably self-effacing performance. One of the most exciting things film-wise this year has been his emergence as a major, major acting talent. I love what Mahnola Dargis wrote in the NY Times: ""I'm not sure exactly when Casey Affleck became such a good actor."" A truly haunting achievement."
"tnrcooper","10","1","4","26 November 2007"," life is complicated
","...in contrast to the impression you get from much infotainment. ""Gone Baby Gone"" reflects this complexity. I was mildly hopeful about this film given the intrigue of ""Mystic River"". ""Gone Baby Gone"" looks deep into all of our souls and asks whether we will choose life or death. The reviews seems to capture the essence of the film very well and I haven't got much to add, but I would also like to recognize Ben Affleck's direction which I think became more assured as the film went on. I think at times he overstated the local flavor of the film at the beginning, as though there aren't a lot of other places in the country that can't boast similarly....and there was a part early in the movie in which I thought the climax had come too early. But the mystery just deepens and Ben Affleck grows more confident and at ease with some very delicate moral areas. As noted, Casey Affleck is...well yes, perhaps there is the whiff of nepotism, but in addition, he's really really really good. He is misread as a pretty boy throughout the movie when he actually has a quite clear moral vision. The challenges he and his detective partner and lover Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan playing her character as loving but reserved and professional, perhaps to retain some distance from the horrors of the world) face are endlessly astonishing; I like films such as this, like Mystic River and LA Confidential in which it seems the double-crosses never end, but I didn't see the depth of the horror here coming. The acting is, as also stated by many other posters, excellent. I found the flawed mother Helene McCready played very capably by Amy Ryan. Ryan captures the dangerous flaws of a very troubled woman for whom there may or may not be a lot of hope. Ultimately however, it is questionable whether her sins are more serious than some other characters'. Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman are typically able and Amy Madigan is perhaps the most conventional character in the film. <br/><br/>Dennis Lehane's novel provides the source material for a wonderfully gritty movie, as it did for Mystic River and apparently another upcoming film, ""Shutter Island"" which Scorsese has signed on to bring to the screen, and in which Leonardo DiCaprio is starring. But Ben Affleck's cool, assured direction is most crucial to translating this complex and soulful novel to the screen. This is a modern film in which the value of a human being is recognized."

A lot of people think Ben Affleck is not a good actor, and i would disagree with that, but for those of you who think he is bad actor, he has definitely been taking notes on how to make a movie, because he does a wonderful job. There are some very intense scenes, the scene on the cliff, and the scene where they have to bust into the house, but when the movie ended i felt like i really wanted to love this movie, but it was not quite there. And i feel the reason it was not there is because these cops were searching for a little girl who was not even loved by her mother, and the scene where the mother breaks down crying to Casey Affleck felt forced and felt like it had no emotion in it. And the ending, man, the whole time i was saying there is no way that could be the ending, and it was. The ending was just not believable, and for those of you who have not seen the movie will know what I'm talking about. I am looking forward to more of Mr. Afflecks movies, and this one was very good, but could have been a masterpiece."

","The first thing I have to say is the cast rocked. Harris and Freeman were top picks. Casey Affleck manages his part well. Yes, he's not a leading man, but his character didn't need a Russell Crowe type actor to play him. The storyline is good, even if the characters come off a tad cartoonish. The same could have been said for ""Mystic River"" if the acting hadn't been so spot on. This film's plot is the reverse of ""Mystic River"". In Mystic River, the victims become the purpetrators. In ""Gone Baby Gone"", the purpetrators are ultimately, the victims. These two films share a common theme. There are no good guys. There are no clear cut distinctions between good and evil. Right and wrong become viewpoints rather than right and wrong. And isn't this the ""truth"" of life I mean the real truth? The kind of truth they don't teach in schools or churches. Ben Affleck hits paydirt. Maybe his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame will be made after all."

First off, I was impressed with Casey Affleck's acting as a shrewd Boston citizen. I knew he fit the part when he was the cocky little guy in the bar with the temerity to stand up to everyone there. I also really liked this film because it portrays how sick some people really can be. Also, this movie strongly shows how living in tough neighborhoods really affects the outcome of peoples' lives.

Gripping with excellent acting all around  especially Ryan who deserves a Best Supporting Actress nod for her risky turn as the girl's white trash, reprobate mother.

Is loneliness the natural consequence of strong ethics? Another thoughtful story by Dennis Lehane.It is the right combination of an interesting plot full of twists and a theme that arouses lots of debating ideas about how difficult it is to choose between law and feelings. Besides the story the film is enriched by spectacular performances by all the members of the cast, Morgan Freeman, that beloved couple of Ed Harris and Amy Madigan, and Amy Ryan, almost a newcomer for me. Ben Affleck provided the picture with force and truth, not a minute is empty of action or ideas and he shows too a deep knowledge of the locations, a very important part of this wonderful film."
"paulcreeden","7","1","6","17 April 2008"," A for mood, C for message.
","As a Bostonian, I am always interested in seeing a shared view of my native area. The Affleck view in this film is very familiar to me. I am delighted that somebody has shown the other textures of the greater Boston community. I grew up in the Boston portrayed in the film. Rough working class neighborhoods. No John Adams in sight there. So, Ben, you get an A for the feel of the film.<br/><br/>The plot and the cast are other matters entirely. The convoluted story would probably read well, but the continuity in the film is poor at times. Casey Affleck simply cannot do stoic without looking over-medicated. He's attractive and likable, but he's no Harrison Ford. The pivotal role of the hostile uncle of the missing child is played by Titus Welliver. The portrayal is a major flaw in the movie. He's just bad, as in smoked pork product.<br/><br/>Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman add weight but are very out of place. They simply are too good for the rest of the cast. Amy Ryan is excellent as the South Boston-Dorchester single mom. She captured the essential persona of doper and narcissistic MTV-generation airhead. Amy Madigan is also quite good and believable in her small role.<br/><br/>Uneven and anticlimactic throughout, yet better than watching TV."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","1","6","28 February 2008"," Best Film of 2007
","Gone Baby Gone (2007) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Ben Affleck's directorial debut is nothing short of a masterpiece and deals with two private investigators (Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan) and their search for a missing four year old girl. To say anything else about the plot would ruin the film so I'll leave it at that but I really, really loved this movie. I'm not one who thinks current films are all horrible and the future of cinema is dead but I will say that I'm a bit nervous that the character dramas that depend on acting, direction and a great screenplay might be dead. With this film and Sean Penn's Into the Wild my nerves are calmed a bit because we've got at least two young directors with balls. This film asks a lot of hard questions and gives a lot of hard answers and sometimes they'll make you wanna cry while at other times they'll make you want to commit murder. The film deals with a very ugly subject matter and deals with some of the lowest forms of scum yet the heart in this film is untouched by any recent film. This is an ugly picture that will turn a lot of people off but Affleck never pulls any punches and it constantly giving the viewer something to think about. I've always enjoyed Affleck as an actor but this film proves that his given talent is as a screenwriter and director.<br/><br/>The film features a terrific cast all of whom should be remembered at Oscar time. Casey Affleck has a lot to handle here and going into the film I wondered how he would do and it turns out he comes off brilliant. His character goes through a lot of changes throughout the movie and the viewer must follow him through all the questions asked of him. At times I was fully behind him but then there were times that I wanted to punch his teeth down his throat. Even with me hating some of his actions, Affleck makes the character all his own and never gives a false move. Monaghan is equally great as his partner and the screenplay allows her to be a full character and not just some sidekick. Her reasons behind wanting to find the child and her fears are different than her partners but this too works wonders within the script. The supporting cast is full of great actors including Ed Harris as a Detective on the case, Morgan Freeman as his Captain and Amy Ryan as the child's mother. Harris gives the performance of his career because, once again, the rich screenplay gives him so much to do that he's able to explore his character and show ever side of emotion. Freeman has a smaller role as the Captain who has his only child murdered and he gives a speech about that, which is perhaps the most haunting thing in the film. The Robert Shaw/Indianapolis speech in Jaws was one of the most haunting speeches I've heard but this here comes pretty damn close. Ryan, playing a crackhead whore, is also marvelous and once again benefits from the screenplay.<br/><br/>Taking place on the mean streets of Boston, the film perfectly captures the mood and ugliness of the ""poor"" side of town, which is full of drugs, prostitution and various other things. The dialogue is so rich that you'd think you were watching a documentary with real people and real situations. There's a lot of racist and homophobic talk here with various slurs being thrown around and this here is something missing in our politically correct times. The screenplay simply shows how some people are and this is something I respect. Affleck handles all of this material like a veteran so it's shocking that this is his first stint as director. I certainly look forward to what he has to offer in the future because he's clearly got talent behind the camera and behind the typewriter. This film starts off depressing and doesn't get any lighter throughout the rest of the movie. It's dark, disturbing and at times downright brutal but it has balls, which is something more films need. What I also loved are all the clues that are given in plain sight yet we don't pick up on them because we don't know they're clues. The film has a couple big twists and turns but not once did I feel cheated because, as I just said, the clues are given in a fair manor. I won't reveal the ending but the film offers people two sides and I'm sure people will be split 50/50 on what should happen. It offers a lot of possible discussions, which is another thing more movies need."

","The first fifteen minutes of this TV-style murder mystery are so self-importantly humble and earthy that I had little hope for the remainder. Apart from occasionally looking self- consciously saint-like, Casey Affleck performs well as a very unlikely PI; his partner (Michele Monaghan) is so badly characterised and plotted that she's mostly a waste of space. However, she's a lot more subtle a performer than most in this overblown mess of grittiness. Ed Harris has never been so bad; Morgan Freeman is given a ludicrous part, made to intone great speeches, and doesn't convince for a moment. Nevertheless, amongst the rampant phoniness, working-class atmosphere laid on with a trowel, stupid plot and pretentious dialogue, there are some nice touches, strong melodramatic scenes, and a satisfying ending, but it seems that murder mysteries nowadays always have to be about mega-depraved scumbags. Why are the bourgeoisie so obsessed with fake low-life? Rhetorical question."

","This movie, almost like no other, is the kind that leaves you in a moral quandary as to what your own actions would have been given the situation private investigator Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) found himself in. Kenzie, who fashioned his ideology on moral absolutes, was resolved to not only solve the case of a missing four year old girl, but to seek justice for those involved in her disappearance. It all sounds fairly straightforward, but the unfolding of this story is anything but. Midway through, the viewer is brought to the conclusion that the young, kidnapped child has been murdered in a ransom gone wrong exchange, only to find the plot has grown considerably more complex with questionable characters ostensibly on the right side of the law finding themselves culpable in a spectacular cover up. Saying anything more would be a tremendous disservice for anyone who hasn't seen the film, and this is one you really must see. But it's not for anyone who can abide sitting on the fence regarding what's right and wrong. The answer is so glaring that it uses the closing scene to illustrate the moral dilemma Affleck's character has created by virtue of his actions. You have to ask yourself, can a good guy trying to do all the right things ultimately make a bad decision?"

Ben Afleck later went on to do The Town, which is also a good Boston crime drama, but he has a better combination here of more suspense, tighter writing, and a really good storyline that will keep you guessing- in a good way!<br/><br/>Ben's brother, Casey Affleck shines in this role, and embodies the disgruntled Boston kid who's trying to make an honest buck and get out of the life he was doomed to live as most Bostonians (as depicted well in this, The Wire, The Town, etc.). Every actor and actress cast here fits the part well and adds deeper layers to the simple plot. Ed Harris brings his A game as always, a great supporting role by MIchelle Monaghan, who is finding crime drama's a comfortable zone with True Detective, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Machine Gun Preacher), and Morgan Freeman (who borderline plays a believable role as a police captain that isn't just Morgan Freeman being Morgan Freeman). It was also cool to see a handful of The Wire (heralded as one of, if not the, best TV crime dramas) alum appear here as they fit right in.<br/><br/>Just when you think the movie is wrapping up and the plot has taken a turn you expect, it veers off course.<br/><br/>8/10 stars for an enjoyable thriller that examines what it truly means to do what's right, and living with the choices we make: good or bad."

Affleck has successfully captured the essence of a written mystery on the screen. The production engages viewers not only on an emotional level but on an intellectual one. As the onion-like layers of the story are peeled away to reveal new ethical dilemmas that force the lead character to question what truly is ""right,"" we are invited to answer those questions alongside him then evaluate whether the consequences of his choices justify the decisions he made.

"parkerrodney","6","0","1","5 January 2019"," There is no moral dilemma here,
","Gone Baby Gone<br/><br/>Gone Baby Gone is a gritty crime drama about a missing girl who is essentially is kidnapped to save her from her neglectful mother. There are twists and turns in the movie as it integrates into the script the seediness of an urban Boston community and attempts to convince the movie goer that there is some type of moral debate which permits citizens to take matters into their own hands when social service and law enforcement can't fix complex social issues.<br/><br/>Gone Baby Gone was an enjoyable enough movie to watch and personally I found the acting, casting, locations and situations convincing and supportive of the plot. I also enjoyed not knowing where the movie was heading. This was a refreshing change from the usual. Where the movie has difficulty is the lack of credibility in the reasoning of the plot. While parents kidnap their own children, relatives don't generally conspire to do so and then have the child raised by total strangers to that child. They call social services.<br/><br/>The one major thing that I take issue with is that at one point in the movie Casey Afleck, who plays the role of the self-righteous protagonist, executes a man who killed a child, and is never held accountable for his actions. This flies in the face of his subsequent actions when he then turns in a retired police officer for his role in the kidnapping and conspiring with others to keep the child safe.<br/><br/>At the end of the day this movie is about the reality of the absolute rights of motherhood against people who feel that they can conspire to kidnap a child, because they believe they are acting in the best interest of the child. Given this simple notion, the movie can end but one way, they get turned in. It would be chaotic to live in a society where people can commit crimes because they believe they were acting in the best interest of someone, a thing or an idea.<br/><br/>Bottom line is that GBG was entertaining enough, but there really is no moral issue here, and kidnapping is still a crime."

Casey was so good in this and love him in so many ways other than just being Ben's cute little brother, I was the cute little sister of a bigger than life older brother so I can relate to his plight! He truly is a great actor and I hope to see more of him in bigger films! I love that he made such a difficult decision in the end that many will hate or love or be completely lost at what was right. He definitely made what I felt was the right one as hard as it was and not knowing how this precious girl would be impacted by it. The truth sadly sometimes is the hardest but the right thing. That sweet child deserved to live her life by truth. I was adopted and was very fortunate to be raised by good and loving parents but they told me at such an early age I never thought it was a bad thing and was taken aback by others responses when they found out I was adopted, like it was a huge thing. I do wonder now about why I was given up and wher I really came from but if my parents had stolen me from a mom who probably should have given me up because she just wasn't capable of giving me a better life and found out later on well that would have screwed me up royally! I'm sad my biological family gave me up and have questions of course but if they didn't want to give me up and I learned my very loving parents actually kidnapped me from a terrible mom but loved and wanted me, wow. How could you handle that so I know he made the right decision. My only issue with the movie was Amy Madigan not being there at the end. The one person who truly loved and cared about the girl from the start! I would have loved to see her get to reunite with that precious girl. Loved that Casey was obviously going to make sure the girl would be safe going back to a not so great mom, she was and continued to be a crappy mom but what about Madigan? Maybe child services could have placed the girl with her?"

All the extras seem to be people who really lived in this world and not like stock movie characters. 
Same can be said about the way all the characters act. There are scenes in this film which are far away from typical Hollywood movies, where the protagonist wants to find something out and the people just flat out insult him and say the same things over and over, just like it would happen in real life.<br/><br/>The story is very intriguing and deals with themes of morality and what right or wrong really mean, it's very well told and you try to figure it out for yourself.<br/><br/>The movie also looks very good, has some intense scenes of action and drama, all the actors are fantastic and the end will make you think about the movie for a few days...<br/><br/>All in all, i recommend this intense and very real feeling thriller about doing the right thing...and maybe you will think to yourself: ""What would i have done?"""

There are some seriously incredible scenes and it was just pure gold from the moment when Patrick enters house and in the end shoots child molester. How they managed with all information that they had and how they were solving case is pretty good but it was at times hard to watch but then they throw some incredible scene just to get you focused again. There was too many characters to get deeply to know them and to set an opinion but then it was very twisty and it was nice. It was also incredible to see how our characters struggle mentally and with a lot of doubts. Material for the movie is seriously great and combined with performances that are on top you get a great movie. Casey Affleck was Patrick and he was incredibly moving and his dedication in getting everything straight was truly great. Michelle Monaghan as Angie was also amazing as she is not afraid to show emotions but also how much she wants to help. Ed Harris was Det.

","There have been so many movies about this topic lately one would think our streets are teeming with creeps looking for kids to steal around every corner. While stranger abductions are less common say, being struck by lightening or drowning in a bath tub, it makes for good drama and thus, scores of ""missing kid taken by pedos"" films come out every year.<br/><br/>In this hackneyed gem, we are set in a tough south Boston hood with a bunch of actors straining to over do accents. Ben Affleck's brother plays a private dick who is hired for his hood connections to help the real cops find the little missing girl. Then, things start to get twisted, and a confusing plot unfolds. <br/><br/>It's kind of ironic that Morgan Freeman plays a character who thinks vigilante kidnapping is OK, remember in ""Seven"" he told us ""when you have that child you spoil him or her whenever you can""...... well, it sounded like good advice at the time. Now , we have a country that has the most spoiled teenagers ever, growing into dysfunctional adults who are never going to be able to contribute.<br/><br/>This film shows a drug addicted mom who seems partially responsible for the kids disappearance, and some side plots that include Affleck's brother vigilante killing a pedo. Nothing really new here, same old Hollywood message- "" if an adult male even MIGHT have HARMED a child he deserves to die, and ""you can act as judge, jury and executioner"", also, ""kids good, adults bad"". No wonder we have the highest population of men in prison on the planet.<br/><br/>In real life , most kids who are murdered are done in by their parents (95 percent), and said parent is usually the mother, so , actually most kids killed are killed by women. But this film shows the typical pedophile killer, and inserts the question "" is it OK to abduct a kid if he is in a bad home""? <br/><br/>We now see the results of two decades of spoiling our kids rotten. I think the question is ""are we getting to the point where we are going to start removing kids from suspect quality homes""? Maybe we are already there. I think the Morgan Freeman character means well, but they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions."

","Gone Baby Gone is the first direction of Ben Affleck, and he did a great job. Although I don't like his directing style because of his unique directing trademarks, which also appears in his other works, The Town and Argo, but I think his a better director than actor. <br/><br/>Let's start with the many good things. The movie is overall great, mostly because of the key moral question in the ending. The cinematography and the two male supporting actors, Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris are also great. On the other hand, the main characters, played by Casey Affleck (Ben Affleck's brother) and Michelle Monaghan are a bit underdeveloped, and their performances are quite weak. It was a bad, but a totally understandable choice from Ben Affleck to hire his brother for this quite complicated role. The main problem with this film is it's plot. The story has huge plot-holes and most of the details and procedures of the investigation are unbelievable.<br/><br/>The main question is that Casey Affleck's character was right or not, when chose to call the cops to Morgan Freeman. I think his decision was fair and loyal, but a bit foul, because it's true, that the little girl's life would have been so better to have Morgan Freeman and his wife character as her parents. Maybe she wouldn't even know true truth.<br/><br/>This film is well-made and definitely worth a watch and thinking about it's main question. But I also recommend an other film in this theme, which is I think better than this. That's Dennis Villenueve's Prisoners (2013).<br/><br/>8/10"

This movie had a real gritty feeling to it, showing the ugliness of people. I loved seeing Amy Madigan and Ed Harris in the same movie (even though their paths don't cross).

","Ben Affleck is an uniquely talented actor. His authenticity as an everyman is admirable, but his directorial debut needs a lot of work. While the substance for greatness (as in future projects) are there, but they have not been put all together yet. The east boston neighborhood and the characters Ben chose shows a lot of care. Ben generally gotten good performances from his actors, notably his brother, Casey in the main lead. The female lead is an exception. Michelle Monaghan did such a low key job in the midst of a gripping story, seems uninvolved, not something the script calls for. Perhaps the thought was to give Casey all the big moments. But I think a stronger female lead could add to the story. Now about the story, I admit it poses a strong moral dilemma but the way it played out was strange, and mostly directionless. There could have been 4 or 5 places the movie could have ended there. A more seasoned screen writer could have rendered a more competent and believable story, but Affleck spreaded himself too thin by being writer,director and producer at the same time. Ed Harris's talent is wasted as his character was dispensible. Morgan Freeman was almost dispensible, too. For first effort at directing, Ben has some work to do to make it to the same class as a Ken Howard. Speaking of directorial debut, go see ""Play Misty for Me"" by Clint Eastwood. He was great the first time out and been great ever since !"

I also like this movie but looking at it just to examine Ben Affleck's directing eye, I have to say it isn't all that. The story is pretty good but does that thing where it spins things around, kind of like Gone Girl; but Gone Girl does it better. This movie is about a druggie mother who loses her child and her sister in-law hires a young detective to find the child. There are plot twists and whatever. Parts of it could have been better but I watched the whole thing without wanting to take a break so I guess that speaks volumes. The plot of the film is broken into 3 acts, like most films however the tone and feel of each act is noticeable, which isn't a good thing. However I'm not sure if it is the directing or the script to blame. The ending is powerful in meaning but just needed a little extra push. Like I said, I just watched the film to note Ben Affleck's directing chops because I'm sure we're going to get a solo Batman film directing by him."

","Even though prior to ""Gone Baby Gone"", Ben Affleck has turned in some impressive performances like ""Hollywoodland"" and ""Changing Lanes"", still the mass has never fully warmed up him. While fellow comrade Matt Damon has branched out quite nicely in the Bourne series and the Ocean's series amongst other films, Affleck has lagged quite badly in poor films like ""Paycheck"" waving the white flag to surrender. Even his relationship with Jennifer Lopez did not further enhance his acting career in fact it hindered him even worse.<br/><br/>Affleck decided it was time to give directing a whirl, I mean what could go wrong? In fact he made a smart career choice here. He had successfully adapts Dennis Lahane's novel about child kidnapping to the big screen while not watering down its drab mood and its scrupulous contradictions. This is the forth installment involving a pair of Bostonian private eyes in hot pursuit, this adaptation not only conveys an intriguing story going for it, but the conflicts it has in store will likely have you drawing up conclusions of your own. <br/><br/>The tone of the story carefully executed by Affleck and his co- writer Aaron Stockard, through the mind of Investigator Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) growing up in the mean streets of Dorchester where he's lived since childhood. He joins forces with his girlfriend and professional partner Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan), Patrick is quite resourceful at cracking crimes that the cops neglect. <br/><br/>When a young toddler named Amanda McCready (Madeline O'Brien) vanished without a trace, Patrick refuses to be involved in a media saturated investigation. But when her concerned aunt and uncle (Amy Madigan and Titus Welliver) begs him to do this investigation, he finally accepts. In the investigation Patrick and Angie link clues that leads to Amanda's inebriated mother Helene (an amazing Amy Ryan) the investigation starts to easily piece together. By an hour into the movie, we are lead to believe that the plot has unfolded, but then something takes a turn in a contrasting direction. Patrick believes that these clues are not all that what they seem to be. So he goes into more deeper investigation. <br/><br/>Filmed in the tough and gritty streets and bars of Boston, everything about Boston comes to life here making the authenticity quite sublime. The gratitude for that goes to ""Braveheart"" cinematographer John Toll for capturing the landscapes and very unsettling feel of a noir film that's a bow of respect to the one's from the 1950's. <br/><br/>And showing that he's not below his brother's legacy, Casey Affleck exhibits that he was perfectly cast to play this pivotal role. Born in the suburban city of Falmouth, Massachusetts Casey's accent was spot-on. Even though he has a boyish visage and quite a disturbing demeanour, his foul-mouth perpetually angry expressions add significance to this ultra violent film and at times it might even surprisingly catch people off guard. And even though Monaghan's performance is not well-structured as Affleck's and her character is not as developed, she still manages to release emotions through those pretty eyes of hers, which was never intended for the script let alone the novel. <br/><br/>And sure the motives within the characters are not decipherable, ""Gone Baby Gone"" relishes more on asking the viewers not entirely on what is the right thing to do, but more towards if we exactly know what the right thing is."

While watching this movie, Clint Eastwood came to mind. If he would have read the script, he probably would have said that something is missing in the very structure of the script, which would damage the ending.<br/><br/>The main character is a hunted detective. He has a temper problem, he grew up in violence. He has loose hands and an arrogant side to his person. Why? Well, there we go: we never learn. Does it really matter that we don't learn? Well, not in the beginning, or, in a movie that completely focuses on the crime. And yes, in the beginning the story seems to be about abduction of a kid. But when the story evolves i'm starting to interest myself for the detective. Why? Well, wihle the story evolves and unfolds twister after twister our detective keeps on struggling with his character. His girlfriend is notably restrained. Her silence is like a scream for answers. So script-wise that smells like a psychological subplot, doesn't it? Being a Eastwood-lover - especially his last great movies - i'm waiting for a sub-story to come to surface which give the movie a kick into the psychological drama that is in fact going on here. But our hunted detective just continues to be his hunted self..... When is this gap of information damaging the story? When the main-character makes a hard-to-swallow decision - were no other then his back-ground story could explain, why he does that. It is then that I realize i watch a half finished script.<br/><br/>Were the story of an abducted child could have changed into the real story - the resolution of a tormented main-character - i'm left with a very unsatisfied and unexplainable ending.<br/><br/>Nevertheless: an 8.

The most difficult scenes include that weird family of a drug addict couple and their child molester house mate. The scenes in the house are weird and creepy. Casey Affleck (Ben's brother) is fine in his role but another actor could have been better. The plot and mystery behind the kidnapping is so convoluted and unbelievable.

Now, I gave the film 8 stars out of 10 because, although its efforts may have been faulty, there were definite glimmers of hope, for example, the tension built in the house of the child molester and cocaine lovers really brought me to the edge of my seat, but in the end, the movie attempts and fails at trying to recreate the grittiness of films like Se7en, and the tension of films like Zodiac."

The girl disappears once and for all and, even though they drag the lake and don't find anything, we're supposed to believe that the girl has 'gone' for good and is dead. Of course she isn't.<br/><br/>The film is definitely thought-provoking, but only succeeded in depressing me on every level. Not one person benefited in any way from the decisions made in this film. The aggressive cop was killed and his wife widowed. The private detective broke up with his long-standing girlfriend, who is also single again. The Morgan Freeman cop was arrested and sent to prison instead of retiring in peace. The little girl subjected to a selfish c*nt of a mother, effectively abandoned all over again. So everybody comes out the worse because the world is a bag of trash and we're left to contemplate what could have been if some less honest decisions had been made.<br/><br/>There were too many moments of non-credibility too. Hitting a biker-type over the head with the butt of a gun in a bar and walking out with your back turned against the bar door. No way. Sixteen marauding guys pouring out of that door with guns and shotguns - that's what I was expecting. Being chased up the stairs by a fat woman with a gun, breaking into a room, bolting the door and then resting your shoulder against that door in repose - again, saved by that magic door, with no shoulder bashing or bullets firing through, just a convenient pause. A girlfriend who doesn't rely on her motherly instincts to return a baby girl to her MOTHER, but instead thinks leaving the girl with strangers is the right decision, but worse of all, her boyfriend's contrary decision causing the couple to split up. Ridiculous, considering there was no previous evidence that the couple were struggling in their relationship at all.<br/><br/>I suppose it was a credible film as a whole - Morgan Freeman having lost his own daughter at 11 or 12, effectively kidnapping the child for himself and his wife as a replacement, but I didn't feel the emotions.<br/><br/>And afterwards I checked out the director, just to make sure. Ah, Ben Affleck. I've got nothing against him as an actor, but The Town was ridiculous - especially the car park shoot-out scene, and Argo was boring, boring, boring, so no surprises there. The film was dull, depressing and pointless, pivoting on the back of a society where nothing good comes out of it all. The only beneficiary of the events was the drug-addled mother, who seemed to do OK in the end. And that's the message the director wants to put across? We all do good and behave morally, but either die, go to prison or suffer? But take drugs, don't give a damn and society will pull us through. Smug man."

It challenges the idea of a ""perfect America"" and brings into light the other half of America in particular boston (the hometown of ben affleck). From start to finish, it keeps you on the edge of your seat and just when you think there is no more thrills the director slams you in the face with another thrill. This movie is a combination of excellent filmography, amazing directing and even better acting. A truly amazing film."

","I'm usually not one for 'formula movies', though this one is commendable for Ben Afleck's wading into it all. The story is fairly gritty, and the twists and turns wishes to inflict whiplash on the viewer. But the pay off is what one may suspect right from the beginning. But it's Ed Harris that totally blew me away in his role. Ed's certainly been good in other movies.And I thought him greatly convincing as John Glenn in The Right Stuff all these years. But when I accidentally stumbled upon this movie, he was so into his character - I couldn't tell if it was Ed or not while I was watching it. Finally when the credits rolled and confirmed it, I was truly impressed! For those who like mystery and intrigue movies, I'd say it's a good 7.5 flick. But Ed's performance definitely bumps it up a nickel IMHO."

","It's a thriller and suspenseful film for sure but is hurried up.<br/><br/>At times, we need to set aside our beliefs the rules and what we stand for, to save a life. The last scene where Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) baby sits Amanda (the little girl) made me ask a question, ""What is home?"" Is home something that makes us happy or is it something, where we have people whom we know but they just don't bother if we even exist or not. Poor Amanda was home just to be taken out in what forms a good detective case. Like the mother who said that the dolls name was Mirabelle, the little girl says it's Annabelle. Gosh, the mother does not even know here kids favorite toys name.<br/><br/>The taking is good, but screenplay is hurried up, I could not understand in the climax where there were too many scenes flashing, now whose perspective was this all shown. So it's hurried up and does not give us space to contemplate quickly and appreciate how the case was solved. Cinematography was good and so was the whole setup that is art direction. Acting was good especially by Ed Harris. But Casey Affleck did disappoint me at places where I expected a lot as he promised in this. Others were good and especially Amy Ryan as Helene, the drug addict mom stood out in her role.<br/><br/>All said and done, I recommend a watch for those who like some fast paced movies. It's not all good pace either, it's sluggish and a routine case till we find what happened to that baby, it took one hour for that and the next hour just rolls on so quick that too many things are revealed in too less time. I am not happy with editing of this film. It's just not right for me and it did not work for me..<br/><br/>It's 3/5 for a good movie for sure, yet it falls short at places to be said a must watch."

","It's a lower class Boston neighborhood. There's a little girl missing and her mother is Helene McCready (Amy Ryan).

However the case isn't all that simple. Helene is a drug addict. Police captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) is in charge and doesn't care for the newbies.

Better still, Casey Affleck gives a real break out performance. Amy Ryan is just as good as the white trash mother character. I'm only disappointed with Michelle Monaghan.

"ALauff","7","0","1","1 April 2014"," Byzantine
","Returning to the hermetic Boston neighborhoods of Mystic River, a familiar atmosphere of blight and hopelessness pervades Gone Baby Gone, which presents a morally byzantine world whose laws don't always protect the innocent, making the very idea of doing the right thing a vastly complex negotiation. The story concerns Casey Affleck as a private investigator hired by the family of an abducted child to augment the search. He's intent on cracking the case and restoring the child to her family, but the job proves much more troubling, revealing twists of motivation that severely test his steady, Catholic-informed code. Ed Harris is terrific as a passionate veteran of a child crisis unit. He and Affleck share a perfectly written scene following a bloody siege on a squalid house of horrors, in which Harris reveals unethical choices he's willingly made in the past to benefit at-risk children. This five-minute exchange unearths buried secrets and personal thresholds, forecasting on a character level the story's climactic decision. (Crucial is Affleck's rejection of Harris's moral relativism, a necessity in this ethical morass.) Although director Affleck stumbles somewhat in the third act, which employs one too many misdirecting flashbacks (and requires one to piece together some story threads almost by inference), the final 10 minutes are finely judged, including a devastating final shot. Films that approximate life's situational complexities are all too valuable, and this one is exceptional in that regard."
"jimbo-53-186511","6","0","1","8 March 2014"," On the whole it was a good film, but it could have been so much better
","Sometimes it's difficult not to go into a film with high expectations and when I read the IMDb summary and saw its current rating I certainly expected an emotional and moving film, but sadly I didn't have these feelings during the film or after it ended.<br/><br/>OK, just to give a brief overview - 4 year old girl gets kidnapped and the family of the kidnapped girl are unhappy with the way that the Boston police are dealing with the kidnapping. Therefore, the little girl's family decide to hire 2 private detectives Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) to investigate the kidnapping.<br/><br/>The main problem for me was the utter vileness of the little girl's mother Helen McCready and her sidekick. When Kenzie and Gennaro are asking her questions about her daughter she's uncooperative and unhelpful and deliberately makes life difficult for Kenzie and Gennaro. Why would you behave in that manner when someone is trying to help you find your daughter? Fair enough, we learn that she is a drug addict which explains her erratic behaviour, but I just found it hard to empathise with a character's cause when that particular character is so vile. The very fact that later in the film she does a complete U-turn from a drug addict to a seemingly loving and caring parent was admittedly nice to see, but it also wasn't entirely believable and also felt somewhat contrived. Her change in character just came out of nowhere and is one of those instances where audiences are just 'expected to accept it'.<br/><br/>The next problem we come to is Casey Affleck. I'm sorry but he was so wooden in this film. He seemed to have no emotional range and his irritating monotone voice just ended up getting on my nerves. One can assume that big brother Ben had a lot of influence on what goes on in this film as he was director and writer and I feel that may explain the reason that his little brother was cast in the lead role. This is something that should never have happened. <br/><br/>One aspect of this film that I liked was the writing; so we learn that chief of police Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) kidnapped the girl in order to give her a better life than her mother was able to give her. Now some people have criticised this as being a lame plot twist and poor writing, but I disagree and I happen to think that this is one of the strongest aspects of this film. The fact that this film is able to open up an entire moral argument at the end of the film is just genius. The very fact that this film poses many moral questions at the end can only be taken as a positive and I always feel that any film that leaves you asking questions at the end or raising moral objectives can only be taken as a positive thing.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck did manage to get quite a few things right; direction, cinematography, writing, and acting (for the most part) were all relatively good. Ed Harris is always watchable and put in another terrific performance as the corrupt police officer Remy Bressant. Morgan Freeman is also good fun to watch, but he didn't get as much screen time as I'd expected. <br/><br/>As previously mentioned, this film was a 'good' film that had the potential to be a great film. However, a couple of vile characters coupled with Affleck's wooden acting prevented it from being an excellent film. I felt no emotional connection to the film and found it hard to root for someone who was basically a 'selfish drug addict'. I'd recommend watching it, but it's only a 'weak' recommendation."

","Gone Baby Gone is one heck of a film. The first time I watched it I LOVED the tense atmosphere, the complicated characters, the labyrinthine plot and the impossible moral dilemmas it set. On my second viewing, I thought it was even better Knowing what was going to happen, I could concentrate more on the underlying satire of television news, the skewering of a culture dependent on drugs and booze, the subtle little clues throughout which pointed to the final solution... It truly is a thinking person's masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck directs his brother Casey, and together they seem to make a great team. Affleck Junior plays a young-ish private eye, and together with his girlfriend seem to be the only ones with a firm moral compass in the picture. They're searching for a missing little girl, who's mother is a serious addict to every vice known to man. She plays up her 'grief' for the cameras, but the reality is she really isn't that bothered about the disappearance at all... heck, the little lady even seemed to get in the way of her daily fix.<br/><br/>What starts off as a minor investigation liaising with the police quick escalates into a tense game of chess, as our detective finds himself in the midst of conspiracies, cover-ups, threats and outright murder. Friends are few and far between, and even the ones you THOUGHT you could trust have to be scrutinised to the Nth degree. This kind of knotty storyline has been done on many an occasion, but very rarely with the style and finesse which is exhibited here. The city BREATHES, the air HUMS with anticipation and when the people TALK, you listen.<br/><br/>Finally, we have the ending, which is destined to be one of those classic Water Cooler moments. As in... what would YOU do? There are no easy answers to that... people would get hurt either way, and would you break a heartfelt promise if you thought it was in... someone's best interest. All difficult questions, inspired by a film which puts these complex matters on the agenda and delivers the respect demanded of them in spades. Brilliant. 9/10"
"ThomasDrufke","10","0","1","20 February 2014"," Thought provoking, Casey Affleck's best performance
","I recommend the film 'Gone Baby Gone'. I have seen around a thousand movies and over a hundred crime movies. In my opinion this is the best crime movie I have ever seen. Ironically it was only the first directed movie by Ben Affleck. Usually a first time director has trouble creating a great film as a whole, as he/she deals with the immense responsibility that comes with directing a feature length film. The movie revolves around two Boston detectives and partners in life that come across a nearby kidnapping and are hired to ask around the neighborhood to find out as much as they can for the family of the kidnapped girl. The movie is based off a series of Dennis Lehane novels about the two detectives, all taking place in Boston. This movie was made off a relatively small budget but it involved some of the biggest actors in Hollywood. Affleck got his younger brother Casey Affleck to star, along with Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris, Michelle Monaghan, and Amy Ryan to round out the stellar cast. It wasn't made to be a typical blockbuster so I think it isn't known to the community as much as 'Argo' is, Ben Affleck's most recent directorial effort. Even without making a lot of money it garnered critical acclaim and currently holds a 94% approval rating on rotten tomatoes. I think this film is vital for anyone who is or is planning on being involved with law enforcement. Even though the main characters aren't exactly the most prestigious detectives, they bring humanity to the film and it really forces you to become invested in the characters even at the darkest of times. And it is a very dark film, it introduces many themes that aren't for everyone's viewing. That being said there are several scenes in the movie that standout. One scene between Ed Harris and Casey Affleck's character is compelling because both of them are detectives but also stand on opposite sides of an argument. Patrick Kenzie (Affleck) had just killed someone because he found a dead child in their house, while helping Remy Bressant (Harris) try to bust this household of another kidnapping. Kenzie is second guessing and having regrets about what he just did, while Bressant stands firmly on the side of murder being right depending on who you do it to. Both men had been drinking so their judgment was impaired. The reason this scene is so interesting is that both these men believe in taking down the bad guys, but at the same time don't agree on how to do it. The dialogue in this film is worlds above a normal movie. I think some of the values that we can take away from this particular scene is that we will never all agree on everything, but if we learn how to better deal with these issues maybe it can help resolve them. This film deals with many moral dilemmas that are still relevant in the world we live in now. The ending scene is also one of the more debated issues I have come across. And an issue that I myself that gone back and forth with several times. Without spoiling anything, the ending is a decision between nature vs nurture, and what is really best for a child who grows up without parents who truly care about them. Affleck gives a voice-over in a few parts of the film as a reminder that this is what the film is really diving into. He constantly brings up that he believes it's the things we don't choose that make us who we are, which would make us assume he believes in nature. But also in the film there are clearly decisions that are made that oppose that argument. Kenzie and his partner are faced with decisions that actually define their relationship, which suggests nurture. That's why this movie is so powerful, it doesn't give you the black and white answer, it lets you decide for yourself what you think is right while also giving good evidence for both sides. Luckily, I have never had to deal with a kidnapping so I can't speak from experience, but it is one of the more thought provoking movies I have seen. It has taught me several things for life but the main lesson being, don't hold back from believing in what you want to, but also taking into account that there isn't always one right answer. I really do hope that more people can see this movie because of the impact it had on me. I can't recommend this movie enough, it is always the first movie I suggest when friends ask for a movie recommendation. The themes from this movie will stick with me for a long time. Overall 'Gone Baby Gone' is a heart pumping experience that anyone involved or interesting in crime should watch."

","Debut directorial film from Mr. Ben Affleck. I REALLY enjoy this film, lots to like about it and very few things to dislike.

I think Affleck is a great director with a lot of promise and has made leaps and bounds from where he was ten years ago. I believe that Affleck has some great films in him and will impress us even further. He has made a mark on the film world so far with this, The Town, and Argo (which of course won the best picture Oscar but Affleck was snubbed on being even nominated for best director) so I can only imagine where he will go next."

","Ben Affleck might not be the actor you look forward to but definitely he is the director with deep knowledge of its subject. The movie starts as mystery, soon becomes emotional crime drama and ends as a food for thought. The moral ambiguity that movie aims is very well depicted through its characters and leaves you asking for, did he make the right decision? Casey Affleck (Ben Affleck's brother) is credible as private detective. Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris provide right amount of punch. The movie grows on you scene by scene and in its finale it tears you apart. It touches the level of perfection in its final minutes, most movies dream to."

Seems they did it for the money. Hrm OK sure, a bit of a stretch, especially since the movie is ending soon. <br/><br/>Then bam! 10 minutes later, we're slammed with the jaw dropping revelation that ex police chief Morgan Freeman had something to do with it. About 5 more minutes before everything is clarified to us.

","People are in awe of Ben Affleck these days with his astronomical rise to another level of stardom and his charming ways of capturing those momentous images on camera. Frankly speaking I don't get the hoopla around 'Argo', I didn't see much into it and my dubiousness is not because of the pro American sentiments obvious in the movie. I will talk more about it when I write about that movie, another day. I enjoyed watching The Town because of it's spunkiness. But the movie that triumphs over these newly featured ones is his directorial debut 'Gone Baby Gone'.<br/><br/>I do like to make confession that I have made an attempt to see this before but I couldn't, I found it slow pace and Casey Affleck that to be replica of James Franco in that Oscar ceremony. But what a imbecile I was to ignore such work of pure awe. The movie starts with a beautiful voice over by Casey Affleck then moves over to the main story. It's has Boston city named all over it, in it's wide shots, in it's short glimpses and in it's people. As the detectives makes conversation with characters played by Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman, there is a Tarantino- ish feel to it albeit not with the devilish music background. Casey Affleck character is developed with the morals and chauvinism of a do- gooder. He rarely shows fear in his eyes and his persona is very enigmatic.<br/><br/>I found a lot scenes in this movie that were worth remembering but I won't mention those because I might have to sound spoiler alert. There are moments of disgust not because there is blood or violence(hardly) but the kind of people shown and how they live their life. As the secrets box keeps opening, there are things that come to fore, characters get more intense, they develop backstory and this whole whirlpool of characters and their stories boils down to questionable climax. I know some people might be left unsatisfied with the ending, but what could he do. He made a decision that nobody agreed on, he made it by himself he lost everything and there is no chance he could go back on it. It's against him. By the way you get a ominous feeling at the start when Angie asks Patrick if their is a good life and if this case can change anything worse about it.<br/><br/>Performance wise everybody is top notch, Casey Affleck holds that grip and control over his character that I have seen rarely. Michelle Monaghan is little subdued and I thought like the makers wanted her to have more but it didn't permit. Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris with their ferocious performance are like fuel to this movie. Every now then the sparks fly when they staple those dialogues. Titus Welliver, Amy Ryan and others were superb throughout their acts. A pat on the back of Ben Affleck, rightfully his best movie for me. Back ground music keeps up with the pace of the story.<br/><br/>A must watch for those who like the movies with mind inducing thoughts and questioning morals.

I am happy for Affleck; as an actor he was always just ""eh"" to me (aside from his classic portrayal of high school asshole O'Bannon in Dazed and Confused). He has found his niche. I don't even need to ever see another film directed by him to know that. But it would be a shame if he didn't continue. I've never been to Boston, only know less than a handful of people from there, but this felt real and authentic. I loved it. Often times I find some of the hardest subject matter to handle (child abuse, murder, rape, injustices against innocents)makes for the most impressionable films.

"Hey_Sweden","8","0","1","19 February 2013"," An impressive directing debut for Affleck.
","After taking something of a break from the Hollywood scene, actor Ben Affleck managed to successfully reinvent himself as a filmmaker, and ""Gone Baby Gone"" proved to be just the start of good things, with ""The Town"" and ""Argo"" having also gotten their fair share of critical acclaim. He certainly knows his milieu here, having hailed from Boston himself, and does an excellent job at collecting a variety of totally authentic local characters. He also adapts (with Aaron Stockard) the novel by Dennis Lehane, which tells the tale of a childs' abduction. Bens' younger brother Casey stars as Patrick Kenzie, a private investigator who specializes in missing persons cases, along with romantic & professional partner Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan). The two of them are hired by the girls' aunt and uncle to supplement the work that the police are already doing. They find themselves getting personally involved as they pursue the leads, both in and out of the company of detectives Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton). Even when it seems as if the case has come to a conclusion, Patrick realizes that too many people have not been playing straight with him, leading to a rich amount of twists and turns. Excellent location shooting, gorgeous cinematography (by John Toll), and an emotionally heavy story are all assets as Affleck takes us on this odyssey. Giving this story resonance is the way it poses a big ethical dilemma: what, really, is the best thing to do for others? Should underhanded methods be permissible if a motive is pure? Viewers will appreciate being intellectually stimulated while they are entertained by the multi layered, complex script. The acting is superb from all of the players: Amy Madigan is sincere and sympathetic as the little girls' aunt, Titus Welliver solid as her uncle, Harris compelling as the lead detective on the case, and Morgan Freeman a tower of strength as usual as the police chief. Casey A. proves himself capable of carrying a picture, but the performer who stands out the most is Amy Ryan as Helene, the girls' trashy mother; she's no less than completely convincing. All in all, ""Gone Baby Gone"" is an effective achievement: deliberately paced, atmospheric, and satisfying, with a wrap-up that doesn't necessarily provide all the answers but raises interesting questions. It comes highly recommended. Eight out of 10."

Ben Affleck, never really considered a leading man in the acting business, proved for the first time (and not for the last) that his directorial skills are top notch.

The film takes place in Boston, mostly in its underground world, and does a great job of portraying the twisted mechanism that governs the crime scene and all its members.<br/><br/>Enhanced by great supporting performances from Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman - who play the two shady yet plausible Boston area police officers - the cast astounds with an unusually realistic attention to details in the representations of regular working-class folks, who are trapped in an intrigue that's literally making them go insane after only a short period of time. In all its sensational, captivating glory, the story presented in Gone Baby Gone looks as though it's been taken straight out of a newspaper's front page, delivering many real-life moments of pure drama. Apart from depicting the step-by-step investigation, the film also aspires to be a considerable psychological piece, pondering how the mess surrounding the case rebounds on the personal and professional life of the main character. Patrick, giving all that he can in order to discover the truth, begins to doubt his sanity and becomes infuriated with his inability to cope with what's been happening around him.<br/><br/>As usual in this kind of movies the truth is hidden several layers deep, and in order to reveal the whole one has to go through a troubling amount of more or less acceptable evidence. Every new and unexpected fact found by Patrick adds up to the masterfully build suspense. Though unmistakably intense and utterly gripping, Gone Baby Gone offers one twist too many and changes its message for a less entertaining, yet still perfectly valuable one. In the world of corruption and hypocrisy nothing is certain, and Ben Affleck's debut feature is not only a taut and downright realistic thriller, it's also a hard-hitting exemplification of all the values that rule this shabby place."

","Missing persons, incl. children is a serious issue in almost every country and movies related to the topic provide a good basis for distinguishable performances both on and behind the screen. Director Ben Affleck (his first respective attempt, by the way) has done a pleasant job inviting doers like Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris to participate (his own brother Casey is OK as well), but the screenplay is numb at times and even meetings with mobsters are incredibly calm and colorless. The role of policemen in the disappearance is also strange and it is hard to believe that experienced cops would find only such a solution we realize in the end. I cannot say that I am fond of constant chases and bursts, but Gone Baby Gone is too slow for a crime drama where the main focus is not on a single detective like Agatha Christie's characters. Thus, the movie is above average, but nothing special."

","Gone Baby Gone feels like Affleck is making amends with the audience for the one too many mistakes he has claimed to make throughout his decade-long career as an actor. From beginning in heavy-dramas to the occasional comedy in the nineties, to sporadically diverse films like the passable Daredevil and the odious Surviving Christmas, also making tabloid headlines for his relationship with Jennifer Lopez, Affleck's career has been inconsistent and sometimes even depressingly bleak. I have always stood firm on my praise for the man; he plays one of the best straight-men in films and always takes a confident step on to the screen, asserting his determined mindset and impenetrable swagger.<br/><br/>Affleck has informed me that as far as power goes, I haven't seen nothing yet. He takes a bold leap in the director's chair with this picture, as he films his younger brother Casey assuming a role of great impact. He plays private investigator Patrick Kenzie and is partners with his girlfriend Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan).<br/><br/>The two have recently been hired to find a young kidnapped eight-year-old named Amanda (Madeline O'Brien), yet find complications arousing at every corner from the girl's drug addicted mother, Helene (Amy Ryan), two other cops working the case (Ed Harris and John Ashton), and the police chief (Morgan Freeman). And do not fall under the impression that this is a straight-forward, linear cop drama, because Gone Baby Gone hesitates not to employ twists and turns in every direction; much like a real private investigation.<br/><br/>The film's beautifully authentic photography turns Boston into its own grim character, depicting a working class city with a lion's weight of pressure at rest on its shoulders. Performance-wise, the film is highly significant, with Casey taking a good portion of the credit, proving his name should be just as popular as his brother's. It also goes with saying Morgan Freeman is effective and convincing here, and Michelle Monaghan takes the role of Patrick's girlfriend with a pleasing amount of substance, fortunately evading the depressing cliché of ""the girlfriend role."" The brothers Affleck prove that both are worthy of recognition, and both can provide their viewers with a rousing, unsettling setup sure to bring up debate and dissent. Gone Baby Gone isn't as forceful or as gripping and effective as Clint Eastwood's Mystic River (perhaps the only way for the film to be made is that it must be captured through a cold lens), yet its audacious writing and directing provides the audience with one of Affleck's admirably slickest efforts in film.<br/><br/>Starring: Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris, Amy Ryan, and John Ashton.

"KineticSeoul","8","0","1","29 September 2012"," A great directorial debut from Ben Affleck
","Ben Affleck's directorial debut shows that he can be a good director, probably more than a actor. Well as long as he has the right source material. The story is written by the author Dennis Lehane and this movie is based off of it. Seeing how ""Mystic River"" turn out to be a great movie. It's not a surprise that Affleck wanted to make his debut directorial movie with Lehane's story. This doesn't have that cold feel that ""Mystic River"" has but it doesn't make it any less intriguing as it progresses. In fact this movie gets complicated as it progresses in a good way. So without giving much away Patrick Kenzie(Casey Affleck) is a private investigator that gets hired to find a kidnapped girl of a cocaine addicted mother. And he is partnered up with his girlfriend Angie Gennaro(Michelle Monaghan), Monaghan always plays the girlfriend or wife character well. And Capt. Jack Doyle(Morgan Freeman) is also head in the investigation. Throw in Ed Harris as Remy Bressant and you got yourself a great detective thriller style movie. This has some great dialogue and phrases that sticks with you. Anyways less you know about this movie the better. Overall this is a intriguing mystery movie that is enjoyable and sticks with you for a while. If you enjoyed ""Mystic River"" there is a high chance your gonna like this one as well.<br/><br/>8.6/10"

","I enjoyed this movie a lot. Great acting, well crafted dialog, etc, etc... I think where it doesn't hold up as well is in the believability of the end. The thing is that by the time you get to the end you are already emotionally engaged in the characters and events and so the plot twist is easier to swallow. However, when you look at the facts on paper or even just stop to think about the end a little critically the believability falls apart. Police chief risks his career, free life, and everything else to try and save a girl from a bad home situation by adopting her via kidnapping. I wish people's hearts were this big in real life but they aren't (and police chiefs aren't this dumb to think that they can abduct a girl, plaster her face over the news, and their police friends will come over to visit not ask any questions, and they can just enroll the girl in school under a new name without anyone noticing). Of course, it raises an interesting question of 'what the right thing to do' is when you see a child in a bad situation but its not a real world option being chosen so it pretty much disqualifies itself from asking the question in anything other than a utopian fantasy land. Maybe it sounds like I'm hating on this movie. I'm not. I wouldn't change the ending plot twist. It was still fun to watch with it. However, I'm not going to give it 10 stars either I think 8/10 is fair considering it succeeds on many fronts and surpassed my expectations. A 3 or 3.5 star film. Recommended!"

Morgan Freeman turns up as a retired police captain who is a good man trying to make a difference. Tough choices must be made, and they lead to one of the best endings I've ever seen.

","Morgan Freeman must buy a lot of Hollywood lunches. He was the worst part of the movie. ""Hey what film are we doing?"" Same sincere and righteous Morgan, with different lines. The best part of the movie was Casey Affleck who demonstrated a lot of range. The character development was on par with a decent popular TV drama and can't be compared with any of the best of them. Lots of clichés in the gritty city. The story was better than the screenplay, which was rife with all the dialogue we could expect people to say in the situations they were in. Was that Ed Harris hiding behind the goatee? Oh yes, there he is trying to make something stick from that awful script. More editing would have helped a lot so that the clichés and the standard boilerplate dialogue could be tightened into a more dramatic and punchy story. The moral quandaries held up and elevated the content quite a bit above an ordinary cops and robbers drams. The ending could have gone in many different directions and resolved into something worth thinking about, which saved the movie."
"bloktarifa","5","0","1","4 March 2012"," A good idea gone bad
","First of all, I am trying to be realistic as much as possible and calmly criticize or praise a movie after watching. I have read a lot of critics saying this movie is either ""great"" or ""horribly bad"", if you ask me, it's neither of those two. Casey Affleck plays somewhat though guy, but as the movie progresses there is nothing to support his attitude, lines or behavior. I don't even want to comment the whole plot, some people find it great and some find it impossible. I would just say it is plausible, but not so much convincing. <br/><br/>***Spoiler alert***<br/><br/>What I find most disturbing is the biggest gap in the story, the moment when Patrick executes Corwin. Although I find his action understandable and even justified from the moral point of view, there is no doubt he committed crime and he should be prosecuted. Instead, the movie just moves on, without any explanation, even a lame one, why he isn't at least arrested if not convicted for his crime. I also don't understand if we are supposed to believe his actions are somehow covered up, but he shot a man in the back of his head and I don't see that so easy to cover up. <br/><br/>Having all this in mind I just couldn't rate this movie with a 6 stars (which I see as ""passing"" grade). I rated it 5 stars, for interesting story, good actors but a bit disappointing twist and end."

The script by Affleck and Stockard is also great. They rightfully chose to cut the angles and went to the core of this story. They did well. For his first movie as a director, Ben Affleck is doing a very good effort, especially with his cast. There are a bunch of great actors in this, Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris, Amy Ryan and Amy Madigan, and they are all good. The only thing that bothers me is Casey Affleck. He's done a good performance, but the only problem is he doesn't look like the part is described in Lehane's novel. So it's hard to believe is as tough than he has to. But the couple is completing with Michelle Monaghan is OK. They fit well together and you have to believe in them to like this movie. It's a brutal movie, with a lot of violence and coarse language.

","Gone Baby Gone marks Ben Affleck's directorial debut and another boring film. I think Affleck did a great job in his casting, all the actors are at the peak of their form especially the extras who feel genuine. The ending is also thought-provoking but it is too bad the film is so boring. The movie goes on far too long and twists its plot so far that it becomes silly. In the end it is more preposterous than ridiculous. I had the same problem with Mystic River, another Lehane adaptation. Though that one was better-written and directed, this one seems to be what is left over from Mystic River. Affleck did the best he could and there are no losers in the cast, just the writing and source material itself."

","I watched Ben Affleck's 'The Town' last year, and I was quite moved. Ben Affleck's directorial capabilities had me enthralled. His directorial debut is equally good if not better. The thing which I love about Ben Affleck's direction is how he manages to bring the best out of a city. I mean, after watching 'Gone Baby Gone' and 'The Town', Boston no longer seems an unfamiliar city to me. Such is the impact of Affleck's direction. <br/><br/>The movie is of the crime/thriller genre. But it grew out of 'being just a suspense thriller'. It handles a very sensitive issue in a complete and justified manner. The movie is about two private investigators, hired to investigate the case of a missing child. As the story progresses, the turn of event slowly occurs in an intriguing and surprising manner. The movie has every element which a thriller should have. But certainly the main feature of the movie is the blend between all those twists and turns and lives of quite a few people, especially those who live at this city. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck cast his brother Casey to play the role of the main protagonist. Casey, as Patrick Kenzie, is superb. His character is pretty much reserved but also has a certain steeliness about him too. He showed this steeliness, especially at the climax. He said those dialogues in such a manner that audiences would get convinced that he was doing the right thing. Michelle Monaghan, as his partner and girlfriend, did justice to her role. Amy Ryan, as the missing girl's grieving mother who is also drug addicted, was a class act. She handled the transient nature of her character beautifully. Morgan Freeman had little scope and he did well with that little screen-time. But one, sure, needs to mention Ed Harris as Remy Bressant, the police detective. His performance, especially in the scene where he was drunk and talked about 'planting evidence', was remarkable. <br/><br/>In the end, the movie stands tall because, it shows that a man should do what he feels right, no matter what everyone thinks. Patrick lives with his decision, even though that might be a wrong decision. This sort of movies always remains vivid in memory, even after the credits gets rolled. Another thing about the movie is the music. I can hardly remember a background score which was not good or not suitable. Harry- William Gregson, surely, is a genius. From the opening score to the end, the background scores played their parts to keep the charm of the movie in tact."

I know most people thought he did very well in this movie, but something about watching a 5'7 160 pound skinny guy act like a hard you know what and a guy who is friends with everyone just didn't strike me right in terms of whats realistic.

","'Gone Baby Gone' starts off as a tough urban thriller. If its protagonists seem too young and beautiful to be genuine private detectives, and too refined to be pistol-whipping gangsters, there are some original elements in the story. But then, the original tale concludes surprisingly early; and what follows are progressively more unlikely developments including vigilantism, a police-led conspiracy, and the discovery of said conspiracy by the hero. What's worse, the drama shifts from being led by plot, to character (only the lead characters are not so interesting), and then to issues (although the ""issue"" here is the almost impossible one of what society should do with bad parents; although there is surely no useful solution to the problem if the question is framed in this way). To be frank, the end result is more silly than tough."
"MBunge","7","0","1","13 July 2011"," Who'd ever think that ""Ben Affleck, director"" would turn out to be a good thing?
","In his directorial debut, Ben Affleck wraps the mystery of a missing child in the social dysfunction of Boston's white underclass to produce a haunting tale of the choices people make and the choices the refuse to consider.<br/><br/>Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) is a private detective. He and his live-in girlfriend, Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan), specialize in missing persons. Usually that means people who are missing in the sense that they've skipped out on their debts, but then they're hired to find the missing daughter of Helene McReady (Amy Ryan). Helene's not the one who hires them, though. She's a boozy addict and the sort of mother who leaves her child locked inside a car on a hot day. It's Helene's brother and sister-in-law (Titus Welliver and Amy Madigan) who hire Patrick and Angie.<br/><br/>Working with detectives Remy Bessant and Nick Poole (Ed Harris and John Ashton) under the skeptical watch of Captain John Doyle (Morgan Freeman), Patrick and Angie plunge into a world of drug dealers, child molesters and the Irish Omerta code of ethnic white Boston. And when you think their investigation is over, it's really just beginning.<br/><br/>The society of working class Boston is at the heart of Gone Baby Gone. It's a world that is rarely seen in popular culture, unless it's being laughed at on Jerry Springer or Maury Povich. These are people who exists very much like their ancestors did in Europe hundreds of years ago, living their entire lives inside a small geographic area and seeing everyone from the outside as out to get them. Patrick Kenzie is essentially a white version of Shaft whose connections and upbringing allow him to glide through ethnic white Boston in a way the police can't.<br/><br/>Director Affleck handles the film's multi-layered mystery with a fine hand and structures the story so his actors have more to do than serve The Almighty Plot Hammer. His direction is a bit more mannered here than in The Town, befitting a slightly less confident storyteller, but he effectively blends his vision with the strong performances of his cast.<br/><br/>There are only two flaws to Gone Baby Gone, one minor and one not so much. Casey Affleck looks far too young to be Patrick Kenzie. Even if the ages of the actor and the part technical match up, someone like Patrick should be far more weathered and worn than the fresh faced Affleck. The movie even explicitly acknowledges that, though such recognition doesn't change the noticeable contrast. The other problem is that Gone Baby Gone is ultimately about two extreme decisions, only one of which fits the character who makes it. The decision is defensible within the context of the story, but it doesn't make sense for the character. Without giving too much away, someone who pals around with drug dealers enough that a dealer will do him a significant favor for friendship's sake is not someone who's going to adopt an absolutist moral view on anything. This off-note in an otherwise compelling tale robs it of some of its emotional impact.<br/><br/>With Gone Baby Gone and The Town, Ben Affleck has established himself as potentially one of the best filmmakers of his generation. We'll have to see if he can grow from here or if he'll settle for being something like the Woody Allen of Boston-based dramas."

","*** NOTICE: This review contains spoilers *** I just watched this film on DVD nearly four years after it came out in the theaters and was very disappointed. I was interested in seeing Ben Affleck's directorial debut and was very underwhelmed. I agree with many of the other comments on this message board who felt disappointed with the script, acting and directing. I never read the book, but I think Casey Affleck was miscast and I never believed him to be a tough guy. His understated acting style got annoying quite fast. He would always seem to be barely emoting his dialog and top that with a Boston accent? Hello, I had to turn up the sound quite often -- you want to really like your protagonist and root for them. I always felt disconnected from Casey. Didn't like the character. Monaghan was okay, but at times just seemed to be along for the ride -- and the shocker! She wants the little girl to stay with Morgan Freeman's character and Affleck wants her returned to her low life mother. Ah, the moral dilemma that will tear at the foundation of their relationship. I felt Casey's character never really had an arc or changed at the end, he felt the same way throughout and characters need to change at the end of their journey. In the scene when Casey discovers Morgan Freeman has the little girl and he walks back to his car -- when I saw the State Trooper cars approaching with flashing lights my heart sank. I said to myself, ""you idiot, you really called the troopers on him?"" If Casey had gotten into the car and drove away -- there's the proper ending. Then of course we see the ending scene where he's at the house and the deadbeat addict mom is leaving her kid for a date with barely a babysitter on board. Casey ends up babysitting the little girl. Great life the girl went back to, eh? At least she's with her mom -- who Casey says, ""might change."" I guess that was the point? Allowing us to make a moral decision for ourselves? Hell, I would have preferred the little girl to live with Morgan Freeman's character - he really loved her and she filled in for his deceased daughter. Oh, Ed Harris - great actor, but here he was chewing up the scenery compared to barely registering Casey Affleck. Wow, and the Mystic River sweeping aerial shots flying over Boston neighborhoods as transitions felt false to me. Completely underwhelmed. I hope to see ""The Town"" next as everyone was raving about it as a masterful heist film and Affleck's second directing job."

","Who would have thought that Ben Affleck, the actor star of abominable films like Armageddon, Pearl Harbor and Paycheck could end being a good director? He gives us a solid debut with this Boston set crime thriller.<br/><br/>Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) is a private investigator in Dorchester, a rough working class area in Boston. There is a lot of media coverage about the abduction of Amanda McCready, a 3-year-old girl from the area. Patrick and his partner Angie (Michelle Monaghan) are hired by Amanda's family to help find the child. He can talk to the people who won't talk to the police. But this is not a simple case, Amanda's mum, Helene (Amy Ryan) is a drug addict, and she has just robbed a local Haitian gangster Cheese (Edi Gathegi). They is also the conflict with the head of the investigation Capt. Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman), who sees Patrick as an unnecessary outsider who just wants the money. Patrick has to work with an experience detective, Detective Sergeant Remy Bressant (Ed Harris), looking at all lead and using their contacts to find the child.<br/><br/>This film is based on Dennis Lehane novel, who also wrote the novel Mystic River, which was turned into a film directed by Clint Eastwood. I personally think that Gone Baby Gone was a better film then Mystic River was. Here, Ben Affleck and Aaron Stockard have written a tort script, telling not just a crime thriller, but also morality tale, and a tale of a rough working-class community. This is a fine writing job.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck shows he is a much better director then he ever was as an actor. He had a steady hand with the camera, having some well crafted scenes, keeping the film tense and having excellent pacing throughout. He makes a good film and should hopefully direct more films in the future.<br/><br/>They is a good cast, Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman are both of course excellent actors and show their talent again in this film. Casey Affleck shows that he has a good future as an actor, and offers a solid performance in the lead role. So does Casey's partner in crime Michelle Monaghan. Amy Ryan performance is also worthy of note.<br/><br/>Other fine feature of the film is the cinematography by John Toll, shooting some lovely looking shots. He is a man who has offered top quality work over the years, like in The Last Samurai, Tropic Thunder and the Thin Red Line.<br/><br/>Overall, a very good film.

","The Afflecks have teamed together on a full blown project that isn't too bad. It seems to stretch thin plausibility for the sake of ""entertainment"" twisting and turning it's way through a plot. There were quite a few character actions that didn't make much sense (spoiler) for instance, someone diving off a 40 foot cliff in water at night time not knowing how deep it was, or busting into a house with gun-fire coming out of it. Preposterous. However the acting in the movie seems satisfactory. Casey Affleck shows he can act maybe even better than his older brother. Towards the end though, questions seemed posed for the sake of controversy rather than natural resolution. And way, way too much swearing - left and right, up and down...sourly bad. Mixed review maybe worth a rental or better yet pick it up at the library."

","When Patrick and Angie back out of the bar they had trouble in,they show the Front of the bar we hung in. It is called Cataloni's. If you look they show an alley that runs between the bar and the building next door. There are a set of stairs that lead up to the Strand theater. Also you can see St.Kevins church and school. My wife's whole family went there and I got married there. This is the second time I have seen this location used in a TV/Movie. I saw it years ago during a ""Spencer for hire"" episode. Of course when Robert Urich crosses the street he does not cross Hancock street where the bar is but he ends up on Washington street in Roxbury.I always get a kick out of stuff like this. You could tell someone from the Boston area made this film. They got most of the little things right like the accents,locations and such.

","Obviously I don''t like the flippant title but this directorial debut from heretofore lightweight actor Ben Affleck packs a solid punch with this dark tale of child-kidnapping at the doss-end of society. Along the way it posits some tough questions about who decides what's best for a young child growing up in a, to put it mildly, dysfunctional household. Sadly every year brings with it some sensational story of the kidnapping and / or abuse of some tragic infant - fresh in the memory, certainly of UK citizens is the apparent kidnapping of baby Madeleine McCann whilst on holiday in Portugal and frankly and tragically too many other child abuse cases to mention (the death of ""Baby P"" being the most recent high-profile story here) so that plots like this will always have topical significance.<br/><br/>There are lots of good things to savour in this movie, most prominently the fully idiomatic playing of the cast, especially by the lesser known leads, little brother (Ben's image, to be truthful) Casey Affleck and his partner Angie Gennaro, who become embroiled in a sensational child-kidnapping incident amongst the low-life drug-fuelled underclass in Boston. I would argue however against the casting of the biggest name here, obviously Ben's old co-star chum Morgan Freeman, whose presence almost overpowers the movie and unfairly, in my opinion, skewers the viewer's critical faculties by the nature of his movie persona with its reputation for truth and trustworthiness - the final twist, in which his significance comes to the fore, fails to malign enough, his admittedly good intentions. That point itself is much better made with the excellent closing scene, where Affleck gets to witness at first hand the depressing outcome of his moral decision at the crux of the film as he witnesses first-hand the boozed-up, sluttish mother, only too happily abandoning her recently returned long-lost daughter to anyone passing (on this occasion, Affleck) so she can enjoy a night on the town - the fixed shot of Affleck and the child on the cheap sofa, staring mindlessly at the child's only toy, a TV screen, stays long in the memory. On a side-bar, I also found the utilisation of the background music very effective and the better for being so sparingly used.<br/><br/>Fault-finding badge in place, however, besides my casting concern over Freeman noted above, I did occasionally find the plot just too ppaque, as, for example, we see played and replayed in a different way each time the key hand-over scene in the dark by the lake, while for me the ending was a bit too pat - such a tautly-drawn narrative just didn't need the plot twist grafted on here and I will lastly admit to having a lot of difficulty in listening clearly to the sometimes mumbled, occasionally incoherent dialogue of the characters.<br/><br/>However, minor caveats aside, this was a welcome raw, tough and uncompromising movie, well-paced from start to finish. Get thee behind (and not in front of) the camera, Ben!"

","As a fan of these Dennis Lehane novels, I was intrigued to see this film. As the Afflecks are actual Bostonians, it looked like the basic needs of the deep local Boston culture could be captured by these brothers who know the town and its nuances. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, Michelle Monaghan as Gennaro was simply awful casting. The character in the books is very Italian sexy through Patrick's eyes, which is a wonderful part of the Boston ethnicity of the whole book series. Nothing against Michelle Monaghan, but she was just wrong for the role. Casey Affleck on the other hand, wasn't bad, as he clearly understands the local flavor. Ed Harris was simply amazing too.<br/><br/>The folks who made this film though, did some amazing casting of local Boston actors to really capture the poor underclass of what the neighborhoods are like.<br/><br/>Lehanes books are sometimes frenetic, and the filmmakers tried to capture that here, but all in all, it was so so. Its hard to capture the richness of the characters developed in a book within the limited time given to a feature film, as we have seen zillions of times over.<br/><br/>There are so many cartoonish characters in the Lehane books, and there could have been a tad more done to introduce some of the bizarre characters that inhabit the books (Bubba for one).<br/><br/>All in all, a fair first shot at a complex book.

"r-a-johnston","7","0","2","30 June 2009"," Hard novel to bring to film
","I was very curious to see what the movie would dilute or drop from the story entirely; to be fair the novel is so complex it would be essential for much to go. Lehane's stories are generally convoluted, although very enjoyable, and I think this is one of his best. I found the conclusion extraordinarily moving in the book and was pleased to see the film kept faith with the original ending. In advance I had been betting it would sell out for a soft ending. Of course one difficulty this introduces is that the film does not have enough time to set up the contrasts in personalities, motivations etc. In the film I don't think the mother is sufficiently vacant and selfish to really make people want to see her be denied her child. Similarly, the different options that could be available for the girl are not contrasted far enough. The film cannot quite capture the huge sense of deprivation present in her life. Establishing these ideas explicitly is what should make Kenzie's difference of opinion with the other protagonists so striking. I think this deficiency is evidenced in other comments written here from people who I assume have not read the book.<br/><br/>I thought it was enjoyable movie that I could easily watch a second time. Affleck and Monaghan fit their roles in a pleasing way. Affleck is younger than the character I had in mind and Monaghan is more demure, but they worked for me. I found the main cop characters pleasantly convincing. On the other hand, I was disappointed with all the bad guys none of whom were very developed, but I guess there simply wasn't enough room/time for them. However, the single most displeasing aspect of the whole film was the use and characterisation of Bubba. A lost opportunity for a larger than life character; the actor was also physically far too small as well.<br/><br/>One aspect of the ending I find irritating is why the treatment of the Morgan Freeman's character is so harsh. Once Kenzie (Affleck) has decided the child is going back to the mother and made it clear that he won't be persuaded otherwise, then surely a return could be arranged that did not leave Freeman and the uncle in prison and the lives of both their wives destroyed? After all, none of the characters, Kenzie included, are above bending the law. On reflection, may be this is actually more acceptable in the movie where Freeman and the uncle are less sympathetic and seem more motivated by money and less by the child's interests."

","When I read the back about a kidnapped girl I wasn't too excited to see the movie. They bore me with their excessive action scenes, extreme story lines and predictability. But my father wanted to see it so I didn't argue. The first thing that turned me off was the swearing, I know in those neighborhoods with violence, drugs, etc... well in most neighborhoods now a days is a lot of swearing which I don't like. The one thing that kept me watching was the believability of the characters. All of them are written and acted as people you would see in real life. Never over the top, raw, with beliefs that make sense if you were them. With views even how wrong it may be you can understand their thinking. The actions, the horrible and sad things you see happen in real life. The story was very captivating, you are watching everyone thinking is it him, is it her; they all had bad pasts. Where it ends is when it really begins and then you are left thinking did he do the right thing. This movie made you think at every moment, made you feel and understand every character. Made you question right from wrong. It didn't have a lot of action. A lot of fighting. It had no nudity. It was a really good movie worth watching if you like movies that make you think from beginning and even after the movie finished.<br/><br/>A woman who uses drugs and neglects the care of her child comes home to find her missing. Not completely telling the truth about her where a bouts at the time she left her daughter alone.

First off, it was a tense and scary detective story, but then it became a story about Right and Wrong, leaving the audience to judge the actions and the characters. While it's full of violence, depravity, and bad language, it is a memorable story that deserves to be discussed. The actors are uniformly superb, especially Morgan Freeman in a very sympathetic role. Casey Affleck is excellent as the detective with street cred despite his baby face, and Ed Harris does his usual great job playing a police officer. Boston native Ben Affleck directed the movie and filmed it on location, giving it a sleazy, but apparently accurate look at life in the area.<br/><br/>The moral dilemma posed at the end is not easily answered.

","This was an unexpectedly great movie and I didn't know what was going to happen, but when it reached its conclusion I was left wondering about the moral dilemma that Patrick (Casey Affleck) faced. I felt that I agreed with him and he did the right thing, yet it was an impossible decision to make. If a child is missing, the detectives who agree to take on the case feel honour-bound to continue to search until they find the child. It seems like a simple matter, but this film reveals how complicated it can be. Along the way, we meet a collection of low-life characters who make the viewer feel depressed about the society we live in (or at least in that city) and wonder how any child can grow up safe. It could have the effect of disillusionment with the story, but the attitude of the two young private detectives is a beacon of hope: they know the difference between right and wrong. Even though their responses to the final dilemma are different, they illuminate the central minefield faced by anyone who gets involved in child welfare. Since this is one of the most emotive issues faced by our society, it's a compelling narrative.<br/><br/>The performances were excellent and I wondered at several points how the collection of ill-assorted characters was made so realistic. The dialogue was hard to follow in some places because the realism of the delivery was such that I would have needed subtitles, but that didn't detract from the overall experience. The violence was convincing, but not overwhelming. Definitely worth seeing."

","If I say 'Ben Affleck' to you, what's the first thing that comes into your mind? ""Gigli""? ""Daredevil""? J-Lo? Probably not what first brought him to wider attention, coming up with the Oscar-winning screenplay behind ""Good Will Hunting"" with fellow thesp Matt Damon. Thankfully, he's in serious-mode here behind the camera and has directed a chilling but gripping drama that, sadly, was overtaken by real-life and as a result, criminally overlooked.<br/><br/>When a young girl goes missing from a tough Boston suburb, the girl's aunt (Amy Madigan) hires local private detectives Patrick Kenzie (Ben's brother Casey Affleck) and Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) to assist the police investigation. Hoping their experience in the neighbourhood will pay dividends, Patrick and Angie begin to uncover a maze of deception and darkness that lies at the heart of the case which threaten not only the girl's safety but also their own lives in ways neither expected.<br/><br/>With its release delayed in the UK by the tragic abduction of Madeline McCann, chances are that most film goers won't be too familiar with this movie and that's a shame because this is a terrific film. The story, while feeling that it has one twist too many, has a palpable sense of realism to it that I've not felt in a movie since ""Training Day"" and makes the unfolding drama all the more unbearable. Credit must also go to the cast who all add to the authenticity. Probably the best of the bunch is Ed Harris as detective Remy Bressant, despite the presence of the always excellent Morgan Freeman. But what makes ""Gone Baby Gone"" really stand out, for me, is the wonderfully written climax which not only provides the viewer with something to think about but also means that this is one movie that might challenge your expectations.<br/><br/>This is not an easy movie to watch - I was surprised it was only a 15 certificate given the amount of swearing, violence and gore - but ""Gone Baby Gone"" is a film that you should see. There aren't too many thought-provoking dramas that can hold your attention throughout but this is certainly one of them. It does feel slightly too long and like I said, I think it had one twist too many but that doesn't stop this being a great movie, even if it's not exactly a date flick. It's harrowing, chilling and disturbingly real and while it may not be to everyone's tastes, you cannot argue with a film that was much better than you expected it to be. Here's hoping Ben Affleck has ditched his pretty-boy airhead persona for good - can we have more of this, please?"

","Ben Affleck's assured debut behind the camera is an extraordinary achievement by anyone's standards, let alone a first-timer.<br/><br/>It's as authentic a depiction of a city as you could want. The accents, the cast and extras, the locations - everything comes together beautifully to form a complete picture. It doesn't feel researched or studied, it feels like it was made by people with a great affinity for the area, and it was.<br/><br/>It's a shame that at the end of a film marked by such understated realism and naturalism the final twist - the one set on a front lawn - goes several steps too far and is so outside the realms of credibility it shocks more due to the disappointment rather than the surprise. I will say that the ensuing moral dilemma it creates is hugely satisfying though, so the oh-boy-that's-stupid feeling is short-lived.<br/><br/>It's the one single false note in an otherwise outstanding film, and I dare say that the writers and Casey Affleck have given us - in Patrick Kenzie - one of the screen's great heroes. I haven't read the Dennis Lehane novel it's based on, but on screen at least it's no exaggeration to say that Patrick Kenzie is an Atticus Finch for the new millennium. He's the classic Average Joe thrown into something much bigger and important than he, and while he's aggressive and uncouth, he also shows remarkable bravery both physically and emotionally. He'll have to make several tough decisions and sacrifices before the credits roll and it will ultimately cost him everything except his honour and his unerring sense of right and wrong. And Casey Affleck's performance is just stunning. Physically slight yet imposing and occasionally even frightening. Tender and loving, ruthless and callous, yet always noble and dignified.<br/><br/>The mystery is dense and gripping, the dialogue throughout sharp and snappy. And at the risk of sounding too hyperbolic ""Annabel"" should go down as one of the all-time great final lines in cinema history."

","As others have mentioned, I, too, was surprised at how good this movie turned out to be, from the acting (Casey Affleck is great and I'm ashamed to say I assumed he'd only been given the role because of his brother being famous and being the director), to the directing (except for a few interior shots where it was tough to see what was going on because of too much darkness, for which I detracted one point), to the writing, to the suspenseful twists and turns that kept your interest and the local color that were right on target. It was all a great package that doesn't deliver a ""happy ending"" but a powerful story in a real, gripping way.<br/><br/>There were plenty of spots where the story could have had some prurient interest thrown in for the sickies. But, except for one gory scene of a graphically executed body, there was none of that here.<br/><br/>Now there is plenty of nasty (""F"" this, ""F"" that) language, and it's certainly no movie for children to be present for. But it does not turn down the tawdry road that so many movies use to appeal to the baser interests of some viewers. It holds to the high road and keeps the feeling gritty, real but painfully pure in many senses. There are few if any ""cop outs"" but just good, skillful entertainment that enthralls you from the beginning with surprises.<br/><br/>In a strange way, it's also a great couples movie. There are opportunities to have some deep discussions afterward over ""What would I/you/we have done?"" to actually make a relationship stronger.<br/><br/>Again, a strong, stinging surprise and a must see.

","Director Ben Affleck presents a gripping film about the aftermath of a child abduction.<br/><br/>Wait a minute. Director Ben Affleck? Yes indeed. The often maligned actor and gossip column fixture serves up a serious-minded, thought-provoking near-masterpiece in his feature directorial debut. Sometimes brilliance comes where you least expect it. Now whatever you do Ben please don't waste your newfound credibility by starring in another Gigli.<br/><br/>Gone Baby Gone unfolds in Boston, which is of course the perfect setting for an Affleck-helmed film. Ben certainly knows the city and more importantly knows its people. And this knowledge is so important as the movie unfolds. Everything seems so believable. Everyone fits perfectly into the Bostonian tableau. What at first may seem a rather simple story will eventually reveal itself to be quite complex. And a group of fine actors, all wonderfully cast, brings that story to wonderfully vibrant life.<br/><br/>In the key role Affleck chose to cast his younger brother Casey. Does that send up a red flag? It shouldn't, the younger Affleck does a tremendous job. He plays Patrick Kenzie, a private investigator who works with his partner (and lover) Angie Gennaro, who is played by Michelle Monaghan. Patrick and Angie's work usually involves tracking down deadbeats. But when a young girl in their neighborhood goes missing they are asked by the girl's aunt to investigate. And from here the story takes myriad twists and turns. Only bit by bit is the full picture revealed to the audience and in the end you may find that the story simply takes your breath away.<br/><br/>Casey Affleck is at the heart of the film but it is the wonderful supporting cast which really takes the film to another level. Monaghan is fine in her role, although you may feel you don't get to know her character as well as perhaps you should. Amy Ryan is a true standout as Helene, the mother of the missing girl. Helene seems much more interested in drugs than her daughter and Ryan is spot-on in portraying this character who at times is sympathetic and at other times reprehensible. Ed Harris is reliably brilliant as Remy Bressant, the lead police investigator into the abduction. Remy is a man of obvious passion and strong conviction. It is an interesting dynamic to say the least to see him working with the young Patrick and Angie of whom he has obvious doubts about their ability to be of any help. Morgan Freeman, John Ashton, Amy Madigan...just a few more familiar faces turning in excellent work. And there are so many lesser-known performers, including some ordinary Bostonians from the neighborhood, who fit in perfectly. All the pieces fall into place and the end result is something special to see.<br/><br/>Gone Baby Gone is not a perfect film but any criticisms amount to just minor quibbles. A couple of characters, most notably Monaghan's Angie, could be fleshed out a little better. The story's turns may make it seem a little hard to follow at times but that's OK because it will encourage you to want to go back and watch the film again to see the clues and unravel the secrets. And this is a film well worth seeing a few times. It's a film which raises some serious moral questions and dares you to decide what you would do in such situations. You'll be thinking about this one for quite a while afterwards. Director Ben Affleck? Believe it. It's hard to see how anyone could have done this story any better."

The cops are involved in finding the girl by default, but the girl's uncle and aunt, obviously wealthy, also get involved. They hire two private investigators (played by Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan) that live in the area and know many of the locals, making them well suited for the case.<br/><br/>A real gripping film which takes many twists and turns throughout, almost leaving you confused half way through, but then people start to talk and villains are exposed.

","I have wanted to watch Gone Baby Gone for some time now but missed it on its cinema release. Finally caught up with it this weekend on DVD.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck's directorial debut is nothing short of breath-taking. For a guy who had never lensed before, this is a truly remarkable feat. Direction was spot on, pacing was solid and the story unfolded at just the right momentum. I loved Affleck and Damon's Good Will Hunting - their screenplay and acting superb in that flick - but he has done it again here with this one.<br/><br/>I won't go into the synopsis of the movie as everybody knows it by now - but i will say that it really gets you thinking at the end. A moral decision has to be made and it is something that, personally, I thought was the wrong decision by the main character.<br/><br/>The scenes in this movie were very realistic - not flash, trumped up over-indulgent luvvy camera work - but simple, straight-forward and effective. Casey Affleck was great in the lead role (his first lead???) and carried the movie very well. If there was to be one criticism to level at this film - it would be Casey's delivery of his lines. At times they were mumbled and coupled with his thick Boston accent meant for a lot straining of ears and rewinds to catch what he had just said.<br/><br/>I don't like figuring out the end of movies (sixth sense caught me completely cold) but this one leaves ample clues all the way through that you will figure what happens well before the reveal. But for some reason that did not spoil it for me. The end scene was a tremendous way to close the movie (not unlike the end of Good Will Hunting either if you think about it).<br/><br/>For me - this was a breath of fresh air and a thoroughly enjoyable film. Well done the Brothers Affleck.<br/><br/>8/10."

"luddenhead","Null","0","1","14 August 2008"," Mea Culpa to the Afflecks
","When this movie came out last fall, I had zero interest in seeing it. Call it my token gesture of backlash for a decade of Ben Affleck hype, otherwise known as the Access Hollywoodization of America. I have spent the new millennium avoiding all things Affleck by conscious choice. So let me unequivocally state that, having just caught this film on cable, I was wrong in a big way. It deserved my business, and I hope there's more to come.<br/><br/>First, Casey's performance as the PI is spot on the mark and pretty darn good. Truthfully, Casey never registered on my radar--my awareness being limited to his being the ""Peter Lawford""/friend of Matt included in the fluffy (but fun) Oceans triumvirate-- so I wasn't expecting much. Plus my idea of PIs was largely shaped by childhood reading (Encyclopedia Brown) and watching Jim Rockford and a host of gas guzzling/Lincoln driving investigators on Quinn Martin shows in the 70's (which viewing paid off when ""epilogue"" later appeared on my SATs). Casey (who strikes me as a cross between an older Frankie Muniz and a younger version of 70's game-show host Art James) certainly is no rugged Jim Garner-type (but Michelle Monaghan is a more attractive sidekick than Angel, and he does get roughed up, Rockford-like, by an armed robber already shot twice through the chest), and he looks too young to be driving a Buick. But he still DOES pull it off in convincing fashion. Whether it be his local familiarity and unforced accent, still evolving experience and maturity, or the touch of world weariness/vulnerability in his uniquely soft spoken voice-- there's a certain ""realness"" and genuine likability to his Patirck which exudes from the opening scenes (where Patrick's sweetly hustling for business notwithstanding his earlier cynicism and his girlfriends/partners reluctance), to how he interacts with the entire spectrum of local folk-- both good and seedy, to his inner soul searching to live up to his own moral standards in making the choices he does throughout. He's certainly not the toughest guy in the neighborhood, but he's decent enough when the situation calls for it-- and most importantly, he's of the neighborhood. It is this more balanced picture of the local environs which distinguishes this film from the similarly-themed Mystic River ---which was just so dreary and filled with unredeemed characters for whom I didn't care that I found it virtually unwatchable.<br/><br/>Perhaps this is best illustrated by the amazing performance of Amy Ryan as the irresponsible and trashy Springeresque mother for whom we should have nothing but disdain, but whose grief is nonetheless real even if her humanity is not apparent on the surface. The heartstrings of the audience shouldn't be tugged on her behalf, but she displays just enough of a maternal instinct that we do, however reluctantly we may want to acknowledge it.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is also first rate. Where have meaty roles been for Amy Madigan and John Ashton the last 20 years? I can't believe its been nearly that long since Field of Dreams and Midnight Run/I Know My First Name is Steven (which ironically had a similar plot line)-- and those are the movies I remember them from. Ed Harris is always super (but didn't need the hairpiece in this one), and I'll never have anything bad to say about Morgan Freeman-- who taught me how to read as a youth. And Titus Welliver, also new to me, is equally good as his world collapses-- and has the most impressive mustache since Rollie Fingers.<br/><br/>As for Ben's directing--- for a first time effort, its pretty darn good. Sure, there are some unnecessary attempts for a Scorsese-like shot or editing (especially the few action scenes), but nothing too obtrusive or which detracts from the story which moves fast and is engrossing without being too ridiculous. I especially like the Hitchcockian symbolism, as in nearly every Patrick scene his moral compass is prominently in the frame (though they likely had to buy out every v-neck t-shirt at Filenes to do so). And though I'm not from Boston (but am plenty familiar with the Irish Catholic neighborhoods of my native NE Philly), you can tell he wanted Boston to be one of the characters of the film and to get it right and he does for the most part--there's plenty of dark underbelly, but unlike Eastwood's film, its not relentlessly dark. What's good isn't all good, and what's bad isn't all bad-- there's plenty of shades of gray.<br/><br/>A few minor quibbles--- Michelle Monaghan-- another newcomer to me (though anybody from County Monaghan or Mayo is OK by me) is underused and hardly Patrick's equal ""partner"", and their relationship is more implicit than developed throughout the movie. Sorry-- but having Patrick remind her ""you know I love you"" at various points in the film doesn't convey the depth of the relationship it needs to. This underdevelopment hurts the climax, which doesn't pack the punch it should have because Patrick's ultimate choice seems to come out of left field and isn't harder. And, perhaps its just me, but the final scene SHOULD have been more memorable; the last wrinkle in the script is superb to illustrate the ambiguities raised by the story. It could have potentially been a ""wow"" moment -- but it stuck me as strangely flat and just too subtle. Maybe the camera just lingered on silently for a little too long, but to me it just didn't capture whether Patrick will be haunted as to whether he made the right choice.<br/><br/>All in all-- highly recommended. I was wrong to have avoided all things Affleck in the new millennium. In fact, thanks to the wonders of digital cable, I have managed to watch two more Casey films (the Last Kiss and Lonesome Jim) and he's just as good in these as well. Next up, the Jessie James film. And I might even watch Ben in Hollywoodland too."
"Pixanaut","9","0","1","1 August 2008"," Stellar.
","I can't recommend this movie enough. Ben's done a very fine job crafting an intelligent and engaging film in both the visuals and as co-writer.<br/><br/>Sincerely one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time (and I see scores of movies). Everyone brings their best. It was great to see Morgan Freeman in this type of role, something a bit different than usual. Ed Harris is always watchable. Casey nailed the role, Michelle was great too.<br/><br/>I feel bad for not being able to support this film when it did its theatre run, but I bought the DVD hoping to make up for it. I feel even worse that it had a bit of a bumpy launch due to tragic situations beyond their control. Bad luck, sad situation.<br/><br/>In the end though, it's just a fantastic film."
"SlackerRus2000","9","0","2","23 June 2008"," This is what Mystic River should have been.
","I read somewhere that the same author who wrote Mystic River, wrote the book Gone baby, Gone of which this movie is based. I didn't understand all the praise and attention Mystic River received, a mediocre film at best. Gone Baby, Gone on the other hand is a masterful film deserving far more praise then I have heard it got and wouldn't mind to hear about it getting an Oscar nod.<br/><br/>The film opens with narration by the lead character. It is solemn yet tense, solemn in its tone, tense in it aimlessness. These words can faithfully describe the movie solemn and tense. Set in Boston, it is a typical detective story that is anything but typical. Other movies set in Boston can't even begin to have the feel and overall street cred that this film exudes (Yeah, I'm talking to you The Departed). Its got the gritty locations and local lingo down perfect (including curse-words, racial remarks and the like). The setting has been overused lately in Hollywood, but somehow seems to feel remarkably fresh.<br/><br/>Casey Affleck is great in the movie, I personally have enjoyed him in every role I've seen him in. He just has great delivery. When he's funny; I'm laughing, when he's sad; I'm letting loose that solitary tear, when he's fired up; I'm ready to crack some skulls. Few actors have that knack and it only helps further entrench the viewer in the story that is unfolding upon them. Coupled with his girlfriend ( I don't know who she is) but she is a solid actress in her own right. Supporting roles by greats, Morgan Freedman, Ed Harris only add more kudos.<br/><br/>I gotta say the story was great, I literally thought it ended two times before it actually did. That is surely a sign of a fantastic detective story. Twists and turns at every moment. Besides being very interesting in its plot twists it poses several morality questions, that you the viewer are left asking in your head at the end of the movie. I won't spoil them, but they are sublimely delivered through an expertly crafted script.<br/><br/>I would liken this film to shawshank Redemption, high praise indeed."

"amateur100","Null","0","1","12 June 2008"," same feel as mystic river, different take, but just as great
","First of all, I would just like to extend an apology to Ben Affleck for having the predisposition that he was solely of mainstream Hollywood, in the likes of Jennifer Aniston and Jennifer Lopez. Although that may have been true of Affleck's past as an actor, as a director, he rivaled if not surpassed Sean Penn's masterpiece take off of a Dennis Lehane novel, ""Mystic River."" Along with his brother, Casey's, performance and an incredibly well-crafted plot in a well-written screenplay, this movie is a masterpiece on its own.<br/><br/>I won't even attempt to dive into the plot, but merely say that an independent investigator, Patrick Kenzie (Affleck) and his wife (Michelle Monaghan) are hired to help find a seven-year-old girl gone missing in what is not as clear-cut case of kidnapping as they want to believe. The film heavily explores the theme of right vs. wrong, and successfully reaches its audience. Never have I felt so torn between two sides in a movie.<br/><br/>Enough said, though. Before I go too far, I just want to tell anybody who reads this to watch to movie. It was one of the better-spent hour and fifty minutes I've taken."

"Terrell-4","7","0","1","10 June 2008"," Amy Ryan shines and there are some fine piece parts...but there also are a lot of ""acting"" moments and sermonizing
","Gone Baby Gone drops more F-bombs than dogs in a public park drop pooch poop. That's only part of the problem with this movie that contains within a lot of wrapping a clever, complicated mystery. Scattered throughout the movie also are what seem to be endless ""acting"" moments for every featured actor, a style of self-aware directing that spills over onto some of the actors' performances, and enough social sermonizing to keep even Sean Penn happy. <br/><br/>Some of my impatience with this movie is because the mystery depends on so much well- planned sleight of hand that it raised my expectations for a solid, complicated mystery drama. The structure and presentation of the drama is well managed by director Ben Affleck. So is any number of individual scenes (when the acting doesn't start getting impassioned). And Amy Ryan as the cokehead mother simply walks away with the acting honors. She does it by making us believe she's what she's acting as, something a number of the other actors, in my opinion, don't quite pull off. Casey Affleck is just fine as the young private investigator who at first believes what he sees and then begins to figure things out. Ed Harris, on the other hand, and made up to look for some reason like Patrick McGoohan on Columbo, chews the scenery as if he were breaking in a new set of false teeth. Morgan Freeman plays yet another variation on his wise, humanistic, aging gentleman. Freeman needs to find a role where he can kick a reporter to death or humiliate a young pair of lovers. Somewhere along the way he has misplaced his real ability to be vicious. Just watch him as Fast Black in Street Smart. <br/><br/>As the story develops there are more and more twists. At first, and putting aside the feeling of the movie being too sincere for its own good, this led to a lot of tricky fun. By the time we reached the conclusion and all became clear, all also became stretched out with a series of mini-dramas that seemed to have difficulty finding a way to stop. <br/><br/>Even Gone Baby Gone's basic argument -- isn't saving a child from almost certain degradation worth bending the rules, even if really bad scumbags pay a price -- is compromised by the naivety implicit in the question. Do we really want to live in a world where the police get to play God and make those decisions? Or maybe we should let the police play God only when it comes to little kids. Or only when it comes to little kids but no more often than once a month. Is there an answer to this apparently weighty question? The movie implies that there isn't. Come on. Sure there is. <br/><br/>There's quite a bit to enjoy in Gone Baby Gone, just not enough, in my opinion, to make a fully professional, satisfying story. But I'll give it this: The movie isn't mediocre and it isn't dull."
"sddavis63","4","0","1","23 May 2008"," Very Disturbing With A Powerful Ethical Dilemma
","This is definitely not the movie you want to choose on those days when you need some light entertainment. ""Gone Baby Gone"" is a dark and disturbing movie that frankly, in the end, left me on a bit of a downer, although admittedly the downer was mixed with the sort of ethical dilemma that I don't mind being left with. I give points to a movie that forces me to do some thinking when it's over, and ""Gone Baby Gone"" definitely does that.<br/><br/>The movie begins as a search for a missing child is underway. The child's family hire a private detective couple (Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan) to help with the investigation - a decision the police (represented by Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris) are none too happy with. Over the next couple of hours, we deal with the kidnapping, with a separate case of child sexual abuse thrown in, and we're introduced to a variety of unsavoury and wholly unlikeable characters (a list that includes the missing girl's drug addicted mother, played by Amy Ryan.) The story is often confusing. With the benefit of hindsight, you can see that it was deliberately so, in order to keep the viewer off balance in preparation for the truly bizarre and completely unexpected twist as the movie plays out its last few scenes. That twist really does shake you up, and leaves you questioning what's right and what's wrong, but, as I said, it also leaves you a bit down, because you know - as does everyone else watching, and as most of the characters seem to know - that what was done was right, but also that it wasn't for the best.<br/><br/>I can't honestly say that I enjoyed this movie, but I'm not sure that anyone intended for it to be ""enjoyed"" in the normal sense of the word. It's both interesting and unpleasant, and - again - I liked the ethical dilemma we're left to grapple with. Still, a movie that leaves me on a real downer can't get more than a 4/10 from me."

He evokes little emotion and besides, his speech is garbled.<br/><br/>Liberals will adore this picture as it brings out the age old conflict of where a poorly raised child belongs- with her mother or outside the environment.

","When Amanda McCready (Madeline O'Brien), a four-year-old girl, goes missing from her Boston residence for three days and Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman), the head of the police's Crimes Against Children's Unit whose own daughter was kidnapped and murdered, is unable to produce any suspects, two private detectives are hired by the little girl's Aunt Bea (Amy Madigan) and Uncle Lionel (Titus Welliver). Somewhat reluctantly, Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and his partner Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) agree to take the case even though they are aware that Amanda's distraught mother Helene (Amy Ryan) is a cocaine addict with nefarious connections.<br/><br/>Crime dramas, police procedurals, and suspense thrillers usually bombard us with buckets full of murder and mayhem but rarely stop to question the morality of vigilante justice. That is what makes Ben Affleck's Gone Baby Gone such a rarity. Co-written by Aaron Stockard and based on a Dennis Lehane novel, it is a film that asks us to think about whether a noble purpose justifies an illegal act and whether murder is any more justified if dispensed by those in charge of public safety than by ruthless criminals. The first half of the film is gritty and authentic in its depiction of the mean streets of South Boston and Affleck's credibility in the role is enhanced by an understated vulnerability which masks his quiet power.<br/><br/>Working with veteran detective Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and his partner Nick Poole (John Ashton), they follow leads to the local bar. Utilizing his local connections, Patrick uncovers the fact that Helene has stolen a large amount of money from a Haitian gangster named Cheese (Edi Gathegi) and they suspect that he is holding the little girl for ransom. Though a raid on Cheese's apartment yields no results, a subsequent phone call sets up a meeting to transfer the money for Amanda but the exchange is botched. From here, the film wanders into unexplored territory that is guaranteed to be a major topic of discussion.<br/><br/>Impeccably acted by an outstanding ensemble cast, Gone Baby Gone is a powerful film that keeps us riveted until the end. Though some may question the veracity of the twist ending, it does raise pertinent issues about how best to protect the innocence of children in a society in which 2,000 children are reported missing every day. Turning from a standard kidnapping narrative, the film raises issues of the interests of society versus individual rights, and whether the end can ever justify the means."
"Bunuel1976","7","0","1","27 February 2008"," GONE BABY GONE (Ben Affleck, 2007) ***
","This is another Oscar contender I managed to catch in time for the ceremony; I’ve never been taken in by Ben Affleck’s supposed acting talent – but it’s also true that his endeavors in other fields, such as his Oscar-winning writing credit on GOOD WILL HUNTING (1997) and his directorial debut here, have been worthier of consideration! The film garnered a fair bit of controversy due to its plot line about the alleged kidnapping of a toddler mirroring the real-life case of Madeleine McCann, in which her own parents may or may not have been implicated; without spoiling the eventual revelation, this element is present in the film as well – but it has been given a decidedly Hollywoodian thriller slant! <br/><br/>Anyway, I have to admit that I was expecting this to be a sentimental melodrama as opposed to a compelling thriller in the MYSTIC RIVER (2003) mould; even if the leads (Casey Affleck, the director’s younger brother, and Michelle Monaghan) are far too young to convince as detectives, the film finds veteran Ed Harris (that most underrated of today’s character actors) in sterling form as a shady cop – abetted by the quiet fortitude of the no-less reliable Morgan Freeman as the Head of a Special Section in the local police force dedicated to missing children (which he personally instigated following the loss of his own daughter!) and, especially, a very good i.e. showy Oscar-nominated showcase for virtual unknown Amy Ryan as the little girl’s ‘bad influence’ mum (foul-mouthed and more prone to sleeping around, coke-snorting and drug-dealing than fostering). Perhaps the film’s greatest coup is that the ending offers no easy answers as to whether a child should be allowed to stay with an irresponsible parent simply for reasons of lineage, given the devastating effect this could have on the former’s grown-up life."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","9","0","1","26 February 2008"," Emotionally draining
","I had heard wonderful things about Gone Baby Gone, it was a semi-silent hit of 2007 and the first film that I've seen that was directed by Ben Affleck which was interesting to see a different side of his talents. Gone Baby Gone is one of those films that is so far from entertainment, but you'll be glad to see at least once. I think because the subject is just so disturbing and has always been a big one: ""In the best interest of the child"", what is right and what is wrong? What are your morals? But what about your conscience? The questions just boggle your mind in this deep intense drama. The actors, a surprising great performance on Casey's part, just seemed to care about this film and that was what made it work without putting people too off about Gone Baby Gone.<br/><br/>A little girl is missing and the search by the police is just failing. When the little girl's aunt asks two private detectives, Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro, who are also boyfriend/girlfriend, to help them on the case. They learn how the drug addict/seller mother was just extremely neglectful of her child, so much to when she took money from her drug boss, he is the suspect of the case, but when that proves to be false, things get more deep and dark. After another child missing/possible murder case, Patrick does to the criminal what he feels best at the moment and then has to deal with the biggest dilemma at the end.<br/><br/>Gone Baby Gone was one of those films that had me shaking after I watched it. I think because I was studying to become a teacher and when I was student teaching, I saw the innocence in children's eyes, why would anyone want to harm them? How could a parent risk their child's life? What lengths would you go to, just to protect a child's innocence? That's the main point of this movie I think, and the crew and cast were absolutely brilliant in maintaining the dignity this story deserved. I would recommend it for a watch, but I think once is enough for me to be honest.<br/><br/>9/10"

","""Gone Baby Gone"", directed by Ben Afleck, explorers the moral choices being made by people involved in the disappearance of a little girl. It would not be prudent to detail the plot as much of the film's effectiveness lies in gentle revelations. Afleck applies a no-nonsense style to the proceedings and casts impeccably. The photography of Boston neighborhoods is rich and striking, as is the portrait-like attention paid to interesting and unique faces. The sense of ""neighborhood"" feels authentic. Casey Afleck is compelling as a private detective charged with untangling the human machinations that contributed to the child's disappearance. Some of the motivations, unfortunately, remain clouded at film's end. Still, this is a small gripe that does not handicap a tense, emotionally draining thriller. There is what's legal and there is what's right for one person and wrong for another. ""Gone Baby Gone"" explores this fascinating ethical conundrum."

","Ben Affleck has managed to redeem himself entirely with ""Gone Baby Gone,"" a detective/mystery film based on the Dennis Lehane novel about a missing girl and the numerous affiliations that attempt to find her. Murder, drugs, poor parenting; the film is an amalgam of morals and ethics with an ending that will inevitably split the audience in half.<br/><br/>For me, being from Chelsea, MA originally, and then moving to the North Shore of Massachusetts, I thought ""Gone"" was more Bostonian than the slightly superior and successful ""The Departed."" Though not all of Boston and its surrounding areas are grim, profane and hard-nosed, the truth remains, a good portion of it is. The quick wit and hilarious swear spouting of Boston drunkards is realistically portrayed, and I found myself shaking my head at some of the back and forth, easily envisioning something like it just around the block. I'll give sincere credit to Affleck and Aaron Stockard for their adapted screenplay, and even more credit to a cast who not once, I think, go overboard with their accents, something even Matt Damon did in ""The Departed."" Ed Harris and Casey Affleck especially.<br/><br/>As far as the film goes, the atmosphere is definitely there. Great use of location, again better than ""The Departed,"" and the instant casting procedure Affleck used in the film works perfectly.<br/><br/>The film manages to build and tear down notions and ideas with ease, keeping you guessing up until the the last fifteen minutes or so, and through sound and logical editing, the film rolls along at a nice clip, never getting too preachy or boring.<br/><br/>Great acting by everyone involved(even side characters had strong presence), inspired direction, appropriate cinematography and a heavy handed story of knowing when and how to make the right decisions."

","The best fiction takes the implausible and renders it believable. Those that have seen Mystic River, A History of Violence, and Monsters Ball should know what I am getting at. Each of these films is flawless, or the flaws imperceptible. The characters in Gone, Baby, Gone were well flushed out and believable. and more than 95% of the movie was tight and masterfully drawn. Amy Ryan did a wonderful job portraying the mother of the kidnapped girl. Cassey Affleck presented as too young and green to undertake the job of finding the abducted girl, but rose to the occasion, again believable. Each of the main characters was convincing. However, two flaws (tricks used in lesser films)render it a good, but not great movie. Thus far I ave avoided spoilers, but the two critical pieces to my argument are. At the transition between the two child abduction cases Cassey is clear the case was never solved, yet we learn different at the climax. The other is When Cassey has an epiphany about who kidnapped the girl he includes data that the viewer saw, but him in his role. Using Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman, Amy Ryan, I would think Ben Affleck may have guessed at the movies potential and would have rewrote those two scenes. My guess is he didn't see the masterpiece potential. The disturbing subject material will limit the audience, and the box office receipts. And the poor treatment in the above knocks it out of the masterpiece box. Ben Affleck has potential as a great film maker and I hope during his his next venture he spend a little more time tightening it."
