"EdYerkeRobins","10","92","97","17 February 2002"," A Brilliant Film - Fun and Multi-Layered
","Adapted from an off-Broadway show, ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" is the end result of 6 years of character and idea evolution by creator John Cameron Mitchell.  Equal parts musical, mockumentary, and drama, the film pleases on all levels.<br/><br/>The film's musical numbers are brilliantly crafted and cross several different genres.  A country-flavored number, ""Sugar Daddy"", appears smack-dab in the middle of all the punk and glam rock tunes, daring anyone to doubt the soundtrack's variety.  The majority of the songs are catchy and great fun to listen to (""Wig in a Box"" even has a karaoke sing-a-long during the second chorus), while staying true to the themes of the movie and Hedwig's life.  John Cameron Mitchell (Hedwig) sings live vocals over a pre-recorded band mix, and this definitely lends more of a live concert feel than if he had simply lip-synched all the songs for the role.  The majority of the cast is reunited from the original cast of the ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" play, so fans of the original play who have not seen the movie need not worry about ""outsiders"" ruining it in transition.<br/><br/>The film's mockumentary nature mainly results from how the songs, being ""autobiographical"", are preceded by scenes of commentary by Hedwig and a flashback from her life.  While the transition from real time to flashback is usually made quite clear, some scenes (particularly the climax, which is a mess trying to piece together) are confusing as to what is real and what is flashback.  The rest of the mockumentary comes between musical sequences, during Hedwig's interaction with her manager, band, and showing of mixed feelings towards Tommy Gnosis, an ex-lover who stole all her material for his own album and is now a popular teen idol.  Her interactions with husband Yitzhak (who, due to an excellent make-up job and performance by original cast member Miriam Shor, I had no idea was played by a woman until I saw ""Like It or Not"", a documentary on the film included on the DVD)  would have made the list as well, had a vital character-development scene with Yitzhak (the only non-Hedwig flashback in the entire movie) been left in the final cut; as it is, Yitzhak serves only as Hedwig's back-up singer and whipping boy, a much less important character.  Most of the film's situations, however, are explained well, via flashback or dialogue, and have well-written gay and transsexual jokes.<br/><br/>Underneath all the humor and the music, however, is the serious theme of feeling spiritually ""whole"".  Hedwig seems to interpret this (through the song ""Origin of Love"" and some interesting animated vignettes) as through finding love and one's soul-mate.  Mitchell, who knows his character better than anyone, gives an amazing performance and is not only able to portray Hedwig's bitchy diva side, but also able to make the audience sympathize with why she acts that way (unlike real-life divas), and how deeply her inner feelings and her failures so far at ""becoming whole"" through a relationship trouble her.<br/><br/>Having not even the faintest idea of what the film was about other than that it was a musical, I was very pleasantly surprised at how much fun I had with Hedwig, and how at the same time it never strayed far from its serious theme.  In its journey from a character, to a play, to a movie, ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" has won over audiences as well as taken home accolades at Sundance, but has not had much mainstream success (chalk this up to its ""controversial"" transsexual main character and the popularity of ""Moulin Rouge!"", an experiment in stylistic over-extravagance, which is bigger and flashier than ""Hedwig"" due to its grand budget but lacks the sense of ""genuine"" emotion in the plot).  This is quite tragic, because in retrospect, ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" was definitely one of 2001's best films."
"zetes","10","146","164","5 November 2001"," I could never hope to praise this enough: 10/10
","No matter how much I do praise it, I'll end up turning people against it. But, let me ask you: what were you expecting when you first heard of Hedwig and the Angry Inch? It's been billed as a punk rock musical about a transsexual from East Germany who was duped into coming to live in a trailer park in Kansas City. So what was I expecting? A gay camp film. I had no doubts that it would be anything else. And that's not to say that I wouldn't have enjoyed a gay camp movie. After all, I liked Moulin Rouge. But I got a surprise that was entirely unexpected: what I experienced was the best new film I had seen in years. And I mean that. Hedwig and the Angry Inch is equally hilarious and touching. Not that I want to spread cliches, but I seriously laughed and I seriously cried, often simultaneously. This manages to be the best American comedy since, damn, Preston Sturges was still writing and directing. It's easily the best movie musical since Cabaret. It's also one of the most heartfelt and passionate dramas, and one of the best character studies I've ever seen. Along with that, John Cameron Mitchell delivers a performance that perhaps hasn't been equalled since, I don't know, Robert DeNiro in Raging Bull, which might be the ultimate cinematic character study. I shouldn't say that, because it might hint that Hedwig is a dark character, but, well, I'd call her just a great protagonist. She's a heroine, especially to anyone experiencing sexual confusion, but even to me, a straight, Midwestern boy. Hedwig is a heroine for anyone who's ever felt that they've been treated like crap their entire life. I wanted to clap for and support Hedwig emotionally throughout the entire film. In short, Hedwig is a character I deeply loved, equal to just a few other characters I've met throughout my extensive journeys in the cinema. Parallel to a situation in the film, if I should ever see John Cameron Mitchell on the street, I'd have to hug him.<br/><br/>I also have another heap of praise that I have to go through before I am done. I've always thought that movie musicals adapted from stage plays were the death of the genre. Only a few exceptions ever seemed more than unimaginative, slavish films that worked only to bring Broadway to an audience who could or would never visit NYC. Cabaret was the one big exception that I had seen previously, but you also hear West Side Story mentioned as being a great film. But, in adapting a stage play for the screen, I always expect the film to seem stranded on stage. To boot, Hedwig had another mark against it: the director, Mitchell again, had never directed a film before. Well, I really don't know what training he had in the art, but it must have been enough. The cinematic art, at least the visual aspect of it, has nearly been forgotten in the 1990s and 2000s, but John Cameron Mitchell creates a visual tour de force as much as he does one of writing and acting. I love the scene where Hedwig the adult reminisces about how his mother forced him to put his head in the oven if he wanted to sing when he was a child. And Hedwig and the Angry Inch's (that's the band's name as well as the film's) appearance outside the Menses Festival next to the port-o-potties. A goth chick, who presumably didn't have tickets for the actual Menses Festival, watches the band in deep curiosity and confusion; Hedwig invites the girl to sit up on stage with her while she relates her past. I also love the sequence where the American G.I. discovers him laying naked in rubble. Hedwig's original name was Hansel, which leads to one of the funniest jokes I can ever recall seeing. Or how about the scene where Hedwig, when babysitting, discovers Tommy, the future rock star who steals all her songs, masturbating in the bath tub? That scene is handled so well that I almost died laughing. To tell you the truth, I don't think there is anything ostensibly wrong with the film, period. I just wanted to talk about the amazing direction because the one review of it I have on hand says ""the direction can't help from being flat."" FLAT? How can you say that it is flat? PS: The animated number and the song that goes along with it is adapted from Aristophanes' speech in Plato's Symposium, about which I wrote my senior thesis in college. The rock star's stage name, Gnosis, is Ancient Greek for ""knowledge,"" which Hedwig actually says in the film. One of the filmmakers must have learned Ancient Greek at some point in his life. Bravo, good sirs."
"Chris_Docker","8","29","31","27 August 2001"," Brilliant toe-tapping stuff
","Already the winner of numerous awards including the Audience and Director awards at Sundance, this is the film of an original stage musical comedy that played off Broadway for over two years. It centres on Hedwig, whose only way of escaping from East Berlin is to undergo a sex-change and assume his mother's identity. Unfortunately the operation goes wrong and he is left with an `angry inch'. Escaping to America, he forms a rock band whilst seeking the soul partner that will fulfil his destiny. Loaded with songs that you will be humming all the way out of the cinema, Hedwig and the Angry Inch is the funniest, most outrageously entertaining movie of its kind since Rocky Horror. Unlike Rocky Horror, it does have some more serious philosophical reflections built into it (mostly via the songs), but it rocks, kicks ass and injects some seriously funny pizzaz into the transgender scene. I had the advantage not only of seeing the UK stage version a few days after the film, but also hearing the director speak about his work at the UK premiere. As a first time film effort it's quite an accomplishment, but as Cameron also played Hedwig in the stage version he had a starter for ten. On the down-side, the film is probably better on second or third viewing, when all the pieces would fit into place, and towards the end there is a tendency to tell the story only in songs and so at the expense of any serious script writing. But still it's a must-see movie."
"rkeefe","10","62","70","15 September 2004"," Amazing movie, amazing Soundtrack
","A true Rock Opera! Not for the small minded. Every song is amazing and wonderful - Origin of Love - is one of the best songs of our time. The illustrated mini-movies through out the movie truly enhance it. Beautiful and tragic. Unlike anything else, Rocky Horror pales in comparison. Amazing performances! I loved this movie! Hedwig is a truly beautiful and twisted character. This movie explains how someone gets to a very unusual point in their life. This movie shows that human beings have faults, emotion, love, anger and strife, no matter what their sex is, or how unusual they seem. The costumes are amazing and the sets rock. All around magic."
"karrisamarie80","9","34","37","14 September 2004"," An Angry Inch is just enough.
","This movie is insane. That's why I liked it so much. The plot and visuals are as twisted as the inch that Hedwig is left with after her botched sex-change. In contrast, the lyrics of the many songs in the this movie are beautiful and poetic. I'm going to search out the sound track for this movie, as the songs were brilliant and inspiring. <br/><br/>This movie shows that everything has two sides that some how merge together to form the truth, The beautiful woman with the ugly, scarred genitals. The everlasting love soured by betrayal and shame. The cravings for success marred by the fear of power. <br/><br/>The unusual story, and the wonderful music make this movie alone worth watching. The amazing acting, outrageous costumes, and fabulous wigs make it a cult classic. <br/><br/>Another success for producer Christine Vachon, and a definite recommend from me!!!"
"preppy-3","8","39","43","20 June 2001"," Very strange but GREAT!
","Tard to follow (at times) but fascinating story about a transsexual rock singer named Hedwig and her quest for fame, fortune and love. Impossible to describe, but a pleasure to watch. Never stops moving and extremely well-directed by John Cameron Mitchell (who also gives a wonderful performance as Hedwig). The songs are loud and good, performed with gusto and tons of energy. A rare Hollywood film that doesn't play it safe with its sexual content and doesn't wimp out at the end. A one of a kind film and well worth seeing."
"philip-ct","10","33","36","14 December 2001"," REVOLUTIONARY, COMPELLING, RE-DEFINING THE ROCK MUSICAL
","Hedwig is an outstanding movie - compelling, rugged, sensitive, in-your-face, and full of committed energy from cast and crew. I used to think that Cabaret was the best musical made, and love the high camp-glam of Rocky Horror. But Hedwig edges these movies in my opinion.<br/><br/>
James Cameron Mitchell imbues Hedwig with dignity, bluster, bravura and credibility. It is an inspired performance, with riveting songs. (I stayed to the very end of the credits, breaking out into song. Bear in mind that South Africans have not had access to the stage play.)<br/><br/>
This film is more original and more daring than the other 2001 contender for 'redefining' the musical, Moulin Rouge. Maybe this is because the main characters are 'filled' in so well, in terms of music/lyrics, others' reactions to them, and by incredibly clear characterising. Hedwig, though over the top, is a cross between Sally Bowles and Frank-'n-Furter. Roll on Sing-along Hedwig!! <br/><br/>The story is quite simple - Hedwig has an angry inch (from a botched sex-change). Hedwig is angry, too, because s/he is searching for a sense of self, for the 'other' (that song 'Origin of Love' is mythical rock which works). James Cameron Mitchell is good as both Hansel (his male persona) and Hedwig; his search for Tommy Gnossis - his creation, his 'Rocky' ? - and ultimate reconciliation are moving.<br/><br/>The end scene is magnificent as Hedwig transforms into Hansel, all male, totally male, while Hedwig is lifted up into the audience. At this point it seems that the film was saying many things about love, about identity, about relating.<br/><br/>A stunning film - and, being a novice to Hedwig (like a Rocky Horror virgin) I thought Miriam Shor was a foreign name for an interesting support actor. Imagine my delight (and mortification) when I realise that 'he' is a woman!<br/><br/>The illusion continues.  <br/><br/>See this film; I agree with the reviewer who calls it 'Kick Ass'. For me it is one of the most compelling and interesting films of 2001.<br/><br/>10/10"
"PF","10","77","90","23 April 2001"," Unbelievably Amazing and Completely Kick-Ass.
","The press kit touts this film as a ""Post-punk neo-glam rock odyssey,"" based on the hit off-broadway show that ran in New York from 1998-2000. Some people have compared it to the Rocky Horror Picture Show, but that's only because it's the only other Glam Rock musical ever made into a movie.<br/><br/>The premise alone should make you want to see it: A rock-and-roll drag queen tells her bizarre life story, starting as a boy in East Berlin, falling in love with an American GI, and going for a sex-change operation, waking up to find nothing but a ""one-inch mound of flesh"" where her organ should be. The story takes more twists and turns after that, and I don't want to spoil anything.<br/><br/>The story is told mostly through the songs, which are perfect rock and roll gems, on par with the songs from Tommy. After only seeing it once, I walked away singing the words ""Six inches forward and five inches back...I've got an angry inch!"" over and over for days.<br/><br/>For a directorial debut with no big-name movie stars, the acting is right on the mark. These are theater people, after all, and there's none of the cringeworthy bad acting you see in a lot of independent films. John Cameron Mitchell gives the character Hedwig so much emotional depth, you forget that the premise is so silly.<br/><br/>The costumes are amazing, as you would expect from a movie with a drag queen as the main character. Hedwig wears no less than 41 outfits, one of which is a dress made entirely of hair. <br/><br/>I came away from this movie totally inspired. It positively electrified me with an energy I rarely feel from movies anymore. And I don't even like musicals!"
"sundog1","Null","80","110","14 June 2003"," A gem in the heap of garbage called ""American film""
","Without gushing, I think that this is the best film to come out of the US in several years. This is the type of movie which demands repeated viewing, and reveals itself a little each time. I'm surprised that the genius of this film didn't receive more accolades at the time, but I attribute that to the socially acceptable restraints of the mass culture.<br/><br/>Absolutely perfect production from top to bottom, makes you laugh out loud... then tears your heart out & puts it back in again. Multi layered & symbolic throughout.<br/><br/>Songwriting by Stephen Trask is sublime. But how the hell can a clown like Eminem get an Oscar & this guy was virtually ignored?! Sickening thought. Cameron Mitchell must have been born for this part... a brave & charismatic perf.<br/><br/>This movie achieves everything that ""Velvet Goldmine"" (yuck) could not... in a fraction of the time.<br/><br/>Anyway, anyone who's got a little freak in them will love this movie. And those who don't ""get it"" should be content watching the rest of American mass market trash cinema."
"patriciamartin","10","34","47","9 April 2004"," Wonderfully sad and funny!
","I am a Male to Female Transsexual and this movie has helped bring across some of what we face in our lives. It did it in a way with comedy with an underlying love story. The story starts as a child and follows her throughout life until her dreams (well some of them) are met. There are may twists and turns along the way making this more realistic to me, a transsexual at the end of her long road of discovery. It is tender to a point of bringing tears and full emotions to you. Only problem I have is that Hedwig is making fun of her condition, caused by a messed up surgery, Thank goodness she can continue to see the good in things, or can she!!!"

","I loved this film. I really loved this film. In fact it is in my top 5 and I don't even like musicals. Somehow I resisted the urge in Blockbusters to rent it on its original release but something about the cover and blurb intrigued me. Fast forward 18 years and I righted that wrong. It is a compelling watch from start to finish. The songs actually help tell the story as do the short animated sequences. This film is so many things. It is genuinely moving, I actually cried at the end, something I never do at films. It explores interesting themes of identity, sexuality, self awareness and love with such a light touch that you don't feel it is a vehicle for a polemic. I have listened to the songs on Spotify since and they are much stronger than I originally thought on first listen via our oldish TV. This film feels incredibly fresh and original. It is also beautifully acted and shot."
"bjorksjoga","10","12","16","23 November 2005"," astoundingly brilliant, somewhat disturbing. A must see.
","This was a film I had planned to watch for an extremely long time, it was lent to me by an ethics professor and I was blown away. I was astounded. Never could I have imagined how visually and sonically pleasing Hedwig would be all at once, yet surprisingly disturbing. And this is coming from a homosexual man who has spent an enormous amount of time around persons who have had sex changes, and innumerable drag queens. Hedwig also gave a startling new look at the collapse of (and years previous to) the Berlin wall. EVEN IF YOU THINK YOU WON'T LIKE THIS FILM SEE IT ANYWAY, you will be surprised. What I took that was even more unexpected than anything else, was great joy in the songs. Each song, particularly ""The Origin Of Love"", and ""Angry Inch"" were songs I would listen to without prompting from the film."
"sehguhc19","Null","6","7","1 December 2002"," Hedwig's Shining, Like the Brightest Star
","When one thinks of the concept of `rock musical,' one would usually think of brainless dance extravaganzas with no plot to be had. Well, ladies and gentlemen, whether you like it or not. Hedwig! The tremendously brilliant Hedwig and the Angry Inch counters the one's stereotype of the rock musical; it has intelligence, ingenuity and a deeper meaning. Unlike its predecessor Rocky Horror Picture Show, it is filmed through an artist's view and has the sexual energy and the integrity to match that of an art film.<br/><br/>
Hedwig and the Angry Inch began as an Off-Broadway musical in 1997, where it achieved cult status and critical acclaim. It is the story of Hansel (Ben Mayer-Goodman/John Cameron Mitchell), a homosexual young man who grew up in communist East Berlin, and dreamed of leaving his war-ridden homeland to find his soul mate. He thinks that he finds his soul mate in the person of U.S. Sergeant Luther Robinson (Maurice Dean Wint), a man who lusts for Hansel, but does not accept him for who he is. He proposes marriage to Hansel, with the promise that he will take him from East Berlin to America. However, Hansel's freedom comes with a price; he must undergo a sex change operation. Hansel's mother (Roberta Watson) gives Hansel her passport, and her name: Hedwig.<br/><br/>
However, things do not go as planned. Hedwig's operation got botched, rendering her with an `angry inch,' and Luther instantly abandons her in a loathsome trailer in Kansas, where she keeps herself afloat with her dreams of becoming a glam rock star. To finance herself, she turns tricks at a nearby military base and becomes a babysitter for the children of commander of the local army fort. As a result, she falls in love with the commander's son, Tommy (Michael Pitt). Hedwig allows Tommy to collaborate on the brilliant songs that she has written and endows him with the rock name of `Gnosis,' the Greek word for `knowledge.' However, when Tommy learns of her sex, he too abandons her, steals Hedwig's songs, and becomes a rock and roll icon.<br/><br/>
The film opens with Hedwig and her band, the aptly titled `Angry Inch,' performing in the straight-laced chain restaurant Bilgewater's, to horrified customers. Hedwig and the Angry Inch, along with their manager, Phyllis (Andrea Martin), have been following Tommy's world tour. In fact, Bilgewater's is adjacent to the humungous stadium where Tommy is performing. During her `world tour,' Hedwig recounts her heartbreaking story through a series of flashbacks, implemented through fades of white and different cinematography (absences of color, quality of film, etc).<br/><br/>
The driving force behind every aspect in this film is John Cameron Mitchell, who starred, directed, and wrote the screenplay for Hedwig and the Angry Inch. This happening was extremely important, because Mitchell derived the entire concept of the Hedwig and brilliantly adapted it for the Off-Broadway stage. The stage version of Hedwig and the Angry Inch involved Hedwig recounting her past experiences through a narrative, so for the film version, Mitchell simply implemented the flashbacks in live action sequences. Even though his performance as Hedwig is deliciously tawdry sexual, through his brilliant acting talent, one is able to have a peek at Hedwig's loves and inner desperation for acceptance. Mitchell derived the basic concept of Hedwig and the Angry Inch from his own experiences growing up as the homosexual son of an army general. His father served in Berlin, and he had firsthand knowledge of the war situation.<br/><br/>
Unlike most other rock musicals, the brilliant songs that Hedwig periodically performed were done so during Hedwig's stage performances, not at random points in the film. This aspect added to the believability of the film, discouraging the absurdity of its predecessors. Stephen Trask, who also appeared in the film, brilliantly wrote the Hedwig's songs. The songs did not have a tinge of campy like Broadway-style songs; they reflected the glam rock principles like the songs of David Bowie and Lou Reed from which they were based. Trask's past is in rock and roll, hence the obvious edge of the songs in Hedwig and the Angry Inch. Mitchell's beautiful voice adds a triumphant punch to all of the songs (he starred in numerous musicals prior to Hedwig.) and lets the emotions of the beautiful lyrics and his brilliant performance shine through.<br/><br/>
Even though Hedwig and the Angry Inch is a very low-budgeted independent film, Mitchell turned to his inventive imagination in order to create a richly beautiful and artistic piece. For example, he used imaginative camera angles to produce special effects. During `Angry Inch' performance scene, he executed a low angle medium shot underneath him to make it appear as though he was flying over a room of revolting people. Then, he executed a high angle long shot to depict the people from his perspective. Also, he used cinematography to change the mood of the film from the beginning to the end. For example, in the beginning of the film, Hedwig wore lush, elaborate wigs and brightly colored costumes and lighting was in warm, pinkish hues to depict Hedwig's more positive outlook. In contrast, toward the end of the film, Hedwig wore stark wigs and costumes and the film was filmed in higher contrast to depict Hedwig's tragic breakdown.<br/><br/>
Hedwig and the Angry Inch recounts Hedwig's journey to find her soul mate: her journey of becoming `whole.' Mitchell derived this concept from `Plato's Symposium,' in which there were three sexes of people (man-woman, woman-woman, and man-man), with four arms and four legs, that were split in half by Zeus and wandered the earth, searching for their other half. Hedwig views herself as being a half of a whole, and thus does not accept herself for who she really is. Her first two attempts at love proved to be futile, and her current relationship with band mate, Yitzhak (Miriam Shor), is shallow and empty. In the face of adversity, Hedwig finds herself tragically alone. In order to find her destiny, she must look to herself for the answer."

His performance as Hedwig is not only incredibly brave, but has the ability to make you laugh, and cry, and sing along at the top of your lungs. The style of the movie walks a delicate line between being too stationary and too flamboyant, and succeeds remarkably. The musical numbers, while not your typical Hollywood production numbers, are full of energy and verve, and contain some of the most biting lyrics I've heard in a movie recently. And the plot, while admittedly thin, serves its purpose. I realize that to some, this may sound like mindless, adulatory fawning, and you know what? I don't care. I loved this movie. 10/10."

","This film is, first and foremost, funny. Hilarious, in fact. Hedwig, the lead character, spews some fabulous one-liners (""One day in the late mid-80's, I was in my early late-20's;"" ""How did some slip of a girly-boy from communist East Berlin become the internationally-ignored song-stylist barely standing in front of you?""). And watching Midwesterners react to Hedwig had me laughing out loud. The movie's second and equally important feature is the music -- clever, tuneful songs ranging across the spectrum from hard-rock to country ballads. The best is ""Origins of Love"", a song spun from a writing by Plato (true!) and illustrated with apt animation. Finally, this film has a message, urging acceptance of our inner selves. You can't ask for more than this! ""Hedwig..."" delivers in poignancy, entertainment and punch."

And from the very first frame, my eyes and ears took turns getting raped, getting tickled, and on and on...when Hedwig sang ""Wicked Town"" and then noticed Tommy kinda hiding but watching, my heart did a flip. Literally. That's when I fell in love with this movie. Then when Tommy ""covered"" that same song towards the end of the movie, I was practically CRYING!!! I selected that same scene over and over, then started selecting other scenes to watch over and over and over again...then I essentially re-watched the entire movie several times over!!! This is such an addicting movie...I saw so many poetic shots, I could feel the love, and I had no earthly clue that Yitzhak was actually being portrayed by a CHICK.

"Camera-Obscura","Null","3","4","5 February 2007"," The phenomenon called Hedwig
","Oh my, this Hedwig is one angry German glam-rocking bitch. <br/><br/>The character of Hedwig was already created in 1994 by John Cameron Mitchell and was gradually turned into a theater show and became a real sensation in New York City in 1999, so the film version was inevitable. One can't help but have enormous admiration for the enormous amount of work and energy he put into bringing this adaptation of his Off-Broadway act onto the screen and produce this riveting glam-rock musical mockumentary about an East-German transsexual singer touring the American Midwest with his rock-band ""The Angry Inch"". <br/><br/>A gifted storyteller and 'internationally ignored' rock singer, Hedwig's disillusions do not inhibit her from pursuing ambitions of grotesque grandness, in fact, it's hard to think of a more narcissistic person than her. Hedwig was born as a boy named Hansel in the former East-Berlin whose life dream is to find his 'other half'. He reluctantly submits to a sex change operation in order to marry an American G.I. and get over the Berlin Wall to freedom. However, the operation is botched, leaving him with the titular 'angry inch.' (from now on, I shall refer to Hedwig in the female form again) After a few years of marriage and ending up in a Kansas City trailer-park, Hedwig pushes on to form a rock band and encounters a young singer, whom she dubs Tommy Gnosis, who eventually leaves her, steals her songs and becomes a huge rock star. <br/><br/>Most of the film features angry Hedwig performing in near-empty diners filled with the occasional fan, but mostly with unwilling suburban audiences, not quite ready for her emotional honesty. Many of the songs are great, not really my kind of music, but there's no denying this is a musical that rocks, made by people who really know rock music. The occasional flashback to Hedwig's Berlin youth have a surprisingly touching and emotional touch, but the narrative arc to put all this into a more broader political context didn't quite do it for me. It's the kind of grand, somewhat simplified gesture, like comparing Hedwig's own longing for his 'other half' to the history of the Berlin Wall, that can be hard to swallow. However, the filming is great, a real colourful visual palet and the writing offers enough sardonic wit to keeps things sharp and edgy and - most importantly - Mitchell's presence is so commanding, he practically forces you to pay full attention throughout the film's running time. <br/><br/>Camera Obscura --- 7/10"
"RiffRaffMcKinley","10","4","6","25 January 2008"," Thinking Outside the Wig Box
","""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" is not a musical. The only argument to the contrary is the musical sequence ""Wig in a Box,"" which still morphs into a music video.<br/><br/>But I digress. John Cameron Mitchell's film adaptation of the gender-bending rock play actually makes drag interesting, with Mitchell himself as Hedwig Robinson, an East German rock star with a dream to rock America and find her other half (a concept fully explained in the beautiful mythology of ""The Origin of Love""). Other classic performances come from such talents as Miriam Shor, Andrea Martin, and Michael Pitt. All are terrific.<br/><br/>Emily Hubley's exquisite animations enhance the film with their occasional entrance. And as a ""classic-rock loving, Dungeons & Dragons obsessed Jesus freak with a fish on his truck,"" Pitt delivers the film's worthiest (and most confusingly downplayed) performance. As Tommy Gnosis, his relationship-turned-rivalry with Hedwig is a key element in the film's satisfying buildup.<br/><br/>Essentially, ""Angry Inch"" is a series of outstanding rock songs laced together with genuine pathos that feels more natural than in any other movie in a long time. All things considered, it's a trip to a simpler place in the universe. And you can try and tear it down.<br/><br/>It just won't work. Hedwig rocks!"

It is now my favorite movie to date.<br/><br/>Although I don't agree with much of the philosophy in the film(primarily ""Origin of Love""), I admire how Hedwig truly does believe in what she sings. The imagery is often subtle, but every time I watch the movie, I catch something new or feel a newfound appreciation for something I've already noticed. There is a scene where two characters are sitting in a motor home on the floor, and one holds up a hand mirror so that half of one face is in the mirror and the other half-face is filmed directly. Wonderful imagery for the ""other half"" philosophy.<br/><br/>The costumes are flamboyant; the hair and make-up is loud and beautiful.<br/><br/>John Cameron-Mitchell and Stephen Trask made such a good team.

","I went to see ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" with high expectations considering the critical reception it has received from the press.  But of course, the press loved ""My Dinner With Andre"" and ""The Incredible Lightness of Being""...2 movies that were unmitigated disasters as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>Those two movies were boring. Hedwig is not. It is a glitzy, noisy, vacuous rock musical about an East Berlin kid castrated to gain entry to the United States as a sort of war bride and then abandoned by his/her husband in Kansas only to become a second rate rock star. All this might have made an interesting, charasmatic drama, but as a musical it is a disaster. The score of rock songs is unremittingly loud and monochromatic and except for the song ""Origin of Love"", there is not a memorable tune anywhere.  80% of the movie is outlandish, sometimes over the top performances of these awful songs.  You just sit there waiting...and hoping they'll be over soon. Some critics have compared ""Hedwig"" to the ""Rocky Picture Horror Show"". That movie/show had a great score.  This does not and a musical without a score isn't worth a damn.<br/><br/>The second unfortunate realization is that the entire project (and I presume the off broadway stage production on which it based) is a massive, self indulgent ego trip for its star, writer and director.  The kid's got a lot of talent with which he energetically assaults this dreadful material.  If there was a decent score, a great screenplay and a seasoned director, he'd be brilliant.<br/><br/>So it's not boring. The production values are fun as far as it goes. Yeah, the wigs are fun.  BIG DEAL! When the film is over you don't give a hoot for Hedwig or what he/she has been through.  There is little application of wit and a heavy dose of maudlin tripe.<br/><br/>Sorry folks. If you want a recent movie musical with some MUSIC, see Moulin Rouge."

","A pointed and serious rock musical with a bitter comedic edge. Hedwig is a half-man/half-woman singer in the Midwest who has quite a story to tell. She managed to get out of run-down East Berlin by marrying a gay American officer--but not before having a sex operation that ""got botched"". Now she's on a quest to face down the teen idol she discovered and groomed, a relationship that blew up in her face after the kid ran off with her songs. A vital and vivid depiction of sexual angst, one with excellent music written by Stephen Trask and performed by director-star John Cameron Mitchell (who really knows how to work the camera). Their film, adapted from the Off-Broadway cult smash, does have problems; it falters somewhere near the end and finishes limply. There's a streak of pretentiousness about the work that fails to bring the comedic elements and the drama together. Many sequences are amusing and bracing, however Mitchell's direction doesn't work out the balance of emotions we're feeling, and his conception leaves us behind. I didn't care for the surreal jumble that is the final fifteen minutes, but I loved the flashbacks to Hedwig's childhood (his flat was so small he had to play in the oven!) and all the players are game and forthright with Mitchell's take-no-prisoners approach. **1/2 from ****"

And for that, it will always be a part of me.<br/><br/>But the film also seems to grow older as I do. Each time I watch it, I catch some new layer, some previously unspoken nuance, that strikes me like lightning.

I will never grow tired of this film, this character, this story, this life.<br/><br/>All that being said, this was the first time I watched this movie with my parents. And they loved it as well.

","Not having seen the off-Broadway version of ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch,"" I can only judge it as a movie (and after hearing long, hagiographic interviews with star/director John Cameron Mitchell using his opposite whispery persona on radio shows).<br/><br/>It works as a rock musical through the cute conceit of the songs being part of ""Hedwig's"" cross-country stalking tour of her sweet-faced young protégé, though the raucous songs have too much similarity, relieved by the change-of-tempo ballads. <br/><br/>As another celebration of drag queens and/or transsexuals who use the exaggerated female image as minstrel shows use black-face caricatures, ""Hedwig"" doesn't reach the heights of ""The Adventures of Priscilla: Queen of the Desert"" in understanding a real person under the wigs, as the set-up here is intentionally more campy.<br/><br/>Just as I got tired of the gimmicks, the movie finally fulfilled itself as the self-realization of a gay man (and his reverse image partner) and became more human. Consequently I didn't buy the didactic we're all one sex theme, even as charmingly demonstrated through the interstitial back-story explanation animation by Emily Hubley.<br/><br/>""Hedwig"" uses similar editing techniques and tone as Ken Russell's ""Tommy,"" achieved with a lot smaller budget and less cinematography quality.<br/><br/>(originally written 7/27/2001)"
"bigspeegs","10","2","3","23 February 2002"," The musical that can beat the stuffing out of ""Moulin Rouge""
","RATING:  **** out of ****<br/><br/>Think about what rock musicals have been like. It's no surprise that when most people think about the rock musical, they think about midnight showings with tons of obsessed fans screaming as the movie plays out before them, decked in attire identical to that of the characters up on screen. One thinks of cultish style, no substance. In other words, when thinking about the rock musical, one immediately thinks ""Rocky Horror"", and there's a reason for that. Finally, someone has decided to take the rock musical seriously and it works better than one could've imagined. Ladies and gentlemen, whether you like it or not... ""HEDWIG!"" <br/><br/>Based on the off-Broadway hit of the same name, Hedwig and the Angry Inch is about Hedwig Robinson (John Cameron Mitchell), and his journey to find his ""other half"". While living in East Berlin, Hedwig (then Hansel) meets Sgt. Luther Robinson (Maurice Dean Wint), who over some gummi bears decides to marry him. The only problem is, he has to marry him in Berlin, which would require a physical examination. ""To get away, you've gotta leave something behind,"" Luther tells Hansel. So it is agreed that Hansel must have a sex change operation. Unfortunately for Hansel (who changes his name to Hedwig), the doctor botched the operation, leaving him with nothing but an ""angry inch"". Luther and Hedwig run off to America, where Luther's wandering eye gets the best of him. Left alone, Hedwig just puts on some makeup, pulls the wig down from the shelf and goes back to her first love of music. That too has its problems: Hedwig gets involved in a relationship with Tommy Speck (Michael Pitt), who steals her music and becomes pop icon Tommy Gnosis. When we meet Hedwig at the beginning of the film, her and her band The Angry Inch are following Gnosis world tour in hopes of landing a successful lawsuit.<br/><br/>
""Hedwig"" rocks like no other movie I have ever seen. The soundtrack is (in my humble opinion) full of classic songs, and the film is full of audacious numbers to match them. I could easily be convinced that this film was made for upwards of $25 million. But obviously, style isn't dictated by budget (the film was made for $6 million). Just look at ""Wig in a Box,"" where a trailer wall is kicked down to become a stage. Or ""Angry Inch"", where Hedwig's bold retelling of his past lashes out and causes the whole place to erupt. The music could've easily been tacky, but no. The songs, written by Stephen Trask, are punk rock masterpieces (some highlights including ""Origin of Love"", ""Midnight Radio"" and ""Wig in a Box"") that had me singing for days after. I am now convinced that the music industry would be on its way to redemption if more people could write with the gusto and originality of Stephen Trask's work. <br/><br/>The film's characters all have stunning emotional depth. Every character is developed, the relationships seem real, and they are all acted to perfection. That there is already more than you can say about most rock musicals. ""Hedwig"" is the brainchild of John Cameron Mitchell. He knows ""this punk rock star"" up and down and thus turns in a near flawless performance. Hedwig is bitter, stubborn and sarcastic, but never unpleasant for the audience to be with. Michael Pitt is impressive as the rip-off artist Tommy Gnosis, and Miriam Shor gives a wonderfully layered performance as Yitzak, Hedwig's husband/wife obviously unsure of her place in the world (just like Hedwig herself). <br/><br/>""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" has done what no other rock musical has done before. It refuses to give up the music for the story, or vice versa. Instead, the songs complement Hedwig's journey in such a way that we understand her position even more after each one. Now only one question remains: is ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" the greatest rock musical ever made? Hell, yeah."
"Cinema Buff","10","2","3","3 August 2001"," Ummm...wow!
","I am so happy to see a certain trend that is slowly evolving.  The movie musical...IS...REBORN!!!  The most popular genre since the beginning of sound in motion pictures gave a last, dying cough in 1972 with ""Cabaret"", and then died.  Since then, we were reduced to musical films that, although they were good at best, could not really be classified as ""a classic"". Then, when ""Evita"" came out in 1996, we started seeing the hand of the movie musical burst through its grave.  Now, the musical has stood up, brushed itself off, and is back!!!<br/><br/>""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" is the latest in a string of wonderfully new and inventive movie musicals that started with the aforementioned ""Evita"" and ""Everyone Says I Love You"", and have evolved into ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", ""Dancer in the Dark"", and ""Moulin Rouge"".  Now, we have Hedwig, an East Berlin transvestite rock singer.  Bold.  Defiant.  Yet very vulnerable. Hedwig (played with true gusto by the writer/director John Cameron Mitchell) is not only the most sympathetic character this year, but oddly enough, the character that audiences can most identify with.<br/><br/>Hedwig and her phallic symbol band will never reach the big time because all of the songs that she wrote were stolen by new rock idol Tommy Gnosis, who was a former lover.  Instead, she is forced to play at Bilgewater's all over the country.  Still, although she has been thrown away, she still rocks, rolls, and really knows how to please a crowd.<br/><br/>And so does this movie.  It is an interesting blend of musical numbers, flashbacks, animated sequences, and, just when you think the movie could not get any more interesting, a sing-along.  And although I hate to admit it, at the bottom of my breath, I was singing the words.  I could not help it. Stephen Trask's songs are infectious.  They get inside of you and bring you into the story.<br/><br/>In short, you should go see the movie just to hear the amazing songs...and see the wonderful performances from Mitchell and newcomers Miriam Shor and Michael Pitt...and the incredible style from Mitchell's directorial debut...and...well, you get the picture.  Just see the movie."

I was truly fascinated, the songs are marvelous. The audience resist her to a certain extent yet can't seem to stop listening to what she has to say, or better yet, sing. Her attitude towards her art is enviable; her life story flows effortlessly through her songwriting. And her rivalry with Tommy Gnosis tells us how much she's been hurt by him, and some flashback scenes tell us more about their true relationship, and how she changed him.<br/><br/>Apart from the character, John Cameron Mitchell crafted this amazing musical filled with songs from diverse genres. Standouts for me are Sugar Daddy, Origin of Love and the incendiary Angry Inch, which could be a punk anthem, it's an amazing song. What is great about Hedwig is that despite her diva antics, you are actually able to simpathize with her at a human level. She's flawed and you feel not only for her but also with her.
This sparks genuineness amongst the viewers who feel such an authentic piece of work unravel through music and fantastic performances. There is so much analysis one can go through by watching this film and listening to the songs, so it provokes deep thought as well.<br/><br/>All in all, John Cameron Mitchell created an extraordinary work of art that sadly doesn't get the recognition it deserves, but from the many reviews in here, you can tell it is something really special.

At the same time the pace of the movie almost slows down to a stand-still and the story goes absolutely nowhere. And what about that Yitzhak character? He/she was a complete bore from his/hers first scene to the last. Maybe the part is meant to be some sort of enigma, but I couldn't have cared less. And the cartoon interludes, which were fun at first, started to give me a headache after a while. What I expected was an adventurous and knock-em-dead' romp with no holds barred. What I got was something castrated, like the `angry inch' of the title. The final ten minutes could have been great, but Mitchell drops the ball by playing it safe and mouthing bad clichés instead of revealing some really interesting insights. I don't know how Mitchell managed to get awarded for best direction at Sundance. Sure, it has it's inventive moments (the trailer park number to name one thing), but often the direction is static. However, nothing bad can be said about the actor John Cameron Mitchell. His performance is pure energy from the moment go and considering that he is on the screen in almost every scene, it's a great achievement. I also enjoyed the performance from Andrea Martin (the manager) and Alberta Watson too brief scenes as Hedwig's no-nonsense mother. Actually, the flashbacks are fun and have a depth to them that the film as a whole is lacking. So, despite some very good thing, I think this movie was a disappointment.

","Hedwig, with no father and a malcontent mother, is a good kid who grows up being abused and deserted by friends and lovers. Even when the lad had a seemingly loving relationship there was still a veneer of ugly horror. Using odd photography and sets Mitchell explains via flashback, songs and monologues Hedwig's life from German childhood to traveling rocker for a chain of seedy nightclubs. Mitchell did a good job vocalizing the strange, demented, repulsive tunes full of pain and anger: he came across nicely as the cross dressing freak just a notch under ultra-freak Marilyn Manson. His anger and hurt over the betrayal of a close friend was the crux of the film, yet there wasn't really that much interplay between the 2 characters. Often as Hedwig segues back and forth through time I wondered how much was reality and what was simply his own fantasies. Perhaps he was merely a devil oriented, insane homosexual. Really excellent picture."
"knoxvillian","4","3","10","22 February 2004"," Is it really a movie?
","Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed the musical numbers.  I thought that the scenes were beautifully shot, and I thought that some interesting characters were introduced.  But introduced only, and that is the fault of this movie.  It only gives us surface, and no depth.  You learn a great deal of background on one character, but you don't see enough outside of what becomes a forced progression of events, and, as such, you don't get a lot of character depth.  This is compounded by the fact that you also really only see the one character, Hedwig.<br/><br/>I do not mean this to be an indictment of the talent of John Cameron Mitchell.  This must have been a vibrant and greatly entertaining musical as a stage show.  On screen, however, the entirety of the movie feels more like a series of music videos (well crafted music videos, mind you, but music videos nonetheless).  There is little depth, only gloss, and in the end you're left searching for a point.  It leaves you wanting something meaningful.  Great as a concept album (perhaps), great as a stage show, but ultimately unsatisfying as cinema."
"lee_eisenberg","5","2","6","19 January 2007"," What?
","When ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" came out, it received critical praise. When I saw it, I could barely understand it. True, it was about an East German man (John Cameron Mitchell) getting a sex change and forming a band, but what's it all supposed to mean? The whole thing just came across as a series of strange images strung together. I couldn't derive that the movie was really supposed to have a specific point.<br/><br/>I should identify that ""HATAI"" isn't terrible. There certainly are some interesting scenes. It's just that I couldn't figure out why so many people considered it a masterpiece. A really good movie dealing with the Berlin Wall in ""Das Versprechen/The Promise"". Maybe this one is worth seeing once.<br/><br/>Back when Dolly Parton (happy birthday, Dolly!) first started singing when she was very young, she probably never guessed that one of her songs would get used in a movie like this."

","I love music and I love movies but I very rarely enjoy any mixing of the two. I can count on one hand the amount of musicals I can tolerate, let alone enjoy, so you can take my reaction to this overrated  and tedious ""post-punk neo-glam rock musical"" with a pinch of salt if you like, I don't care. An obvious attempt to jump on the 'Rocky Horror' bandwagon (another movie that bores me stupid), 'Hedwig And The Angry Inch' gives lots of lip service to two of my favourite performers Iggy Pop and Lou Reed, but I honestly could hear very little of their influence on the mostly awful songs in this movie. One number which I can't recall the title of had a Richard Hell feel to it and that one was okay, but the rest of them stink. As this is a musical, and the songs also tell most of the story, if you don't like them then there's very little else to keep your attention. I'm sorry, but I got absolutely nothing out of watching this movie, and have no plans of ever sitting through it again. Life is too short and there are two many great movies out there to watch instead of wasting time with mediocrities like this. And if you want to hear some genuinely entertaining transsexual rock'n'roll dig up some old records by Wayne/Jayne County, at least they actually ROCK."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","2","12 June 2008"," A uniquely told rock musical that doesn't hold back and doesn't forgive
","Unlike it's title character, ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" knows exactly what it is. This is a no- questions-asked camp-filled biographical rock musical about a transvestite singer/songwriter. It delivers every bit of that description and anyone expecting something more mainstream from the film should have his/her head checked. But just because it isn't told in conventional fashion doesn't mean it doesn't have the same impact of conventional films--you just need an open mind about, well, a lot of things.<br/><br/>The story begins as Hedwig, a transvestite, and her band the Angry Inch tour the Midwest of the United States playing restaurants and other unlikely gigs, following in the tracks of famous recording artist Tommy Gnosis, Hedwig's former lover that appears to have stolen all her songs. In all her gigs, Hedwig tells the story of her childhood in East Germany and her journey to America that includes a botched sex change operation. <br/><br/>What is most impressive about the overall film is its ability--through song--to weave the narrative of both past and present. Star, writer and director John Cameron Mitchell gets a lot of credit for that. I never saw the stage production, so I don't really know how much credit that deserves, but it certainly takes a strong vision to create a film that adapts that simultaneously and successfully. His performance as Hedwig simply helps that vision along. Even if you're uncomfortable with trans-sexuality, you warm up to JCM as Hedwig quickly because there is nothing surface-only with his character in this film and he shows that the entire time. The catchy music (if you like punk rock) helps that along too. Most commendably, this film doesn't hold your hand through any discomfort. It's established from the start so there aren't any ""GLBT themes,"" just GLBT characters, though some of the issues they face manifest themselves in ways.<br/><br/>The filming in general is very artsy and out there, especially in the final half hour. Everything kind of becomes symbolic at that point and almost entirely unconventional. Some of those scenes are good, but the film leaves you a bit confused because the final half hour is largely dialogue-free and almost all music. It keeps the film from taking the next level, but it doesn't hurt it's overall quality. <br/><br/>The film is not something that JCM tries to cater to all film-goers--it definitely takes a person with certain world views and diverse tastes, but that doesn't stop it from being a great film for what it truly is."

I love me! I cried and laughed through the whole movie. Hedwig, I love you! You are special. You have more balls than anyone I know!!!!!!!!!!! :)) I love to watch people in their lives, and how they handle them. Hedwig/Hansel was so trusting and loving and only wanted to be accepted and loved. Don't we all want that? He made the most of him/herself. He was who he was. Who are we to judge? God does not make trash. He made us all different for a reason. So we could all love and cherish each other. I loved it when he and Tommy finally got drunk in the limo and Tommy sort-of, half-assed actually acknowledged Hedwig and the love he had in his beautiful heart and the sacrifices he made. Tommy was an asshole and he knew it, and he knew how much he hurt Hedwig. The guilt he felt must have been overwhelming."

","The main character gets all of life's junk thrown at her, and she never whines about it. That doesn't sound to articulate, but it feels as though most modern ""feelings"" movies have the main characters whine a whole lot which make them less likable. Nobody likes a cry-baby, and Hedwig is definitely not one. In addition to that, the music is incredible, the acting is great, and the dialogue creates enough interest and a good enough pace to propel the movie through over 10 years without leaving the audience feeling that anything important was left out. A good movie to watch but you have to be in the mood for something weird and with the right crowd (definitely not appropriate for children)."
"gallae","9","1","2","18 October 2006"," Unusually good
","I wasn't sure what to expect when i saw this film.<br/><br/>Some of my queer friends raved about it, but I often worry that that they get the ""wrong impression"" about transsexual/transgender folk by what they see in films. As a transsexual woman this is an obvious concern of mine. And yet, just like STONEWALL (which gives a fictional history of the event based on the life of a Drag Queen) I found that I could relate quite well to this.<br/><br/>The main character *isn't* transsexual (despite what it says in the summary above) but transgender. They undergo a crude form of reassignment surgery in order to leave Germany, not to change gender. And there in is the crux of the film, because ultimately Hedwig regrets that decision, as the outcome was less than perfect.<br/><br/>There is much reference to Plato's concept of ""seperated souls"" - Hedwig feels incomplete and ""between places"", and the denouement is really about the main character rejecting the constructed identity that we see them appear as for most of the film, and reclaim their soul in the process.<br/><br/>A powerful fun film, that requires a number of viewings to fully appreciate."
"siaraheck","10","1","2","5 October 2006"," This movie leaves you in a wake of rainbow carnage!
","When I first saw the preview for this film, I knew I needed to see it. Rock star drama, original songs by Stephen Trask, and a most unconventional love plot. What I didn't know was what a truly sincere story I was in for. Hedwig's story is one to which we all can relate, male or female, gay or hetero. While the inner-feelings of the story may be hidden under layers of glitter makeup and punk rock clothing, Hedwig is a character who represents finding yourself and then falling in love with that person. We all have our idiosyncrasies and hang-ups, some of which make us think we are unlovable, or perhaps not worthy of love. Hedwig's quest to find his/her other half takes the audience on a triumphant journey through time and place, searching desperately to find that which makes Hedwig whole. <br/><br/>The animation bits that accompany bits of plot and song are amazing, very raw and real. They evoke images of youth and playfulness that today's technology could not dream of aspiring to. The song ""Origin of Love"" perhaps sums up the sentiment of the film. When I first saw the film, I almost cried with joy when the ""music video"" unfolded on the screen before me as one of my very favorite Greek texts. Taken from Aristophanes' Theory on the Origin of Love from Plato's Symposium, the song describes how love was born on the planet. At the dawn of human existence, there were three sexes, each consisting of two people attached on their backsides. Think Siamese twins, but with faces on each side rather than side by side. The Children of the Sun were two men, the Children of the Earth were two women, and the Children of the Earth were one of each. The Gods became threatened by the peaceful and powerful existence that these beings enjoyed, so when they tried to scale Mount Olympus (think of them rolling around like cart wheeling bowling balls), the Gods smite them and take away the source of their power, their duality. They are split down the middle, separating the halves, thus creating this feeling of longing we have for one another. Ever since, people sometimes spend a lifetime looking for their other half. While the song is only a small portion of the film, one an only imagine that John Cameron Mitchell used it as the centerpiece to his masterpiece, breathing new, yet ancient, life into his charismatic, and hilarious, character, Hedwig. <br/><br/>The end result is comedic tragedy, sweet, innocent love wrapped in an androgynous body. Proving that it's what's inside that counts and f*ck the world if they don't love you, Hedwig and the Angry Inch is the 21st century's first hard-hitting musical that brings it all the way home."

","I so admire the mind of JCM. I recommend watching this movie with the subtitles turned on. Word for word, the lyrics are so densely woven into the plot and into the struggles of our hero. As an artist, ex punk singer, exotic dancer, writer, and aspiring actress, I derive inspiration from this movie on a regular basis. One by one, I insisted that all my friends watch it, inviting them over for screenings in my living room. Some of the guys had a hard time, psychologically, with the premise behind the ""angry inch"". I suppose that is the one element in the movie that I cannot truly relate to.

To come out and show the world, and say ""This is me world, this is what you're gonna get""; and to pass on the wig to someone else who really needed the opportunity to show what he was really feeling. Yitzhak just wanted to be glamorous, and finally got to be who he really felt at the end. John Cameron Mitchell did such a fantastic job portraying Hedwig, and her entire range of emotions were beyond brilliant. Stephan Trask, the songs he wrote couldn't have been better. His ability to write songs that don't tear the film down, they only uplifted it. I admire and respect John Cameron Mitchell for every risk he took. Hedwig Robinson, you are amazing.

"xredgarnetx","7","1","2","20 July 2006"," Interesting and entertaining, but with a bummer of an ending
","HEDWIG is a rock musical about a German boy who grows up to be a quasi-woman. He/she is constantly haunted by a botched genital operation (hence the film's bizarre title) and his/her failure to achieve stardom and connect with his/her fellow human beings in a meaningful way. His/her songs reflect the various passages he/she is going through in life, and the actor playing Hedwig (also the film's writer and director) can really belt out a tune. The songs sound like a cross between tunes by Jim Steinman, Meat Loaf's songwriter and one-time partner, and Bernie Taupin, Elton John's former songwriter and longtime partner. Anyone expecting another PRISCILLA OF THE DESERT will be sorely disappointed, however. This is not a comedy and goes way beyond PRISCILLA in depicting the life of a transvestite/would-be transsexual. The ending is odd and something of a letdown, and mainstream audiences are simply not going to understand it. But this is not a mainstream movie; it's strictly for the art-house and intellectual crowd, great music notwithstanding. For most of you reading this, heed my advice and buy the soundtrack instead. The rest of you are in for a disturbing 90 minutes. For those into movie trivia bar bets, keep a close eye on Hedwig's guitarist. A very close eye. Nuff said."

","Meet Hans, an East Berlin teenager desperate to escape the communist block who undergoes a botched sex change operation in order to marry an American military man and flee to the free world. Now meet Hedwig, the rock-em-shock-em punk band leader into which Hans transforms himself when his American husband abandons him in the midwest. Embittered when the Berlin wall falls and furious when a later teenage-lover steals her music and becomes an arena-filling rock star, Hedwig now dogs the teenager's steps by staging a tour with her own band and following him from town to town.<br/><br/>John Cameron Mitchell, who co-wrote and starred in the New York show and who appears in the film as both director and star, mutes the more savage tones of the stage original in favor of pathos and a broader sense of the character's humanity; consequently, the film isn't really as far-out or edgy as it might seem and it lacks the sharp bite you might expect. The film also seems a bit unfocused, a bit unstructured, and at times I felt a bit frustrated by what it leads you to expect but never actually delivers. Even so, Mitchell and company (especially Miriam Shor), give some extremely interesting and often drop-dead funny performances, and the music performed by the band as it tours is first rate throughout.<br/><br/>Sadly, some viewers will reject the film without seeing it on the basis of subject matter alone--which would be a mistake. Often funny, often touching, and certainly thought-provoking, HEDWIG packs a solid punch by appealing to the untapped creativity in all of us and leads us to question our own internal sense of unity. The characters and ideas it presents linger in mind afterward, and while Hedwig and her angry inch aren't quite as knock-out as you could wish they're still fascinating.<br/><br/>The DVD release contains lots of extras, most notably a documentary (almost as long as the movie itself) that describes the creation of both stage show and film. The footage of the New York show is particularly fascinating. Recommended.<br/><br/>Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"

","The Rocky Horror comparison is easy, I guess. Why? Well, it's a rock musical with transvestites in it, right? But it's much more than that. If you're a Rocky fan, and you watch Hedwig because you heard they're alike, expecting cult value, you'll probably be disappointed... even though Hedwig has more cult following than you'd expect, and in some places weekly screenings with costumes and audience participation a la Rocky are actually held. But Hedwig is much more than that. Aside from the truly great music (which I'll discuss in a minute) the story of Hedwig and the Angry Inch is a sad tale of surprising depth, encompassing loneliness, betrayal, sexual confusion and identity crises as well as a bit of simplistic but kindly treated Platonic philosophy, with a brilliant ending that leaves many question marks and is good for hours of debate and discussion.<br/><br/>Hedwig and the Angry Inch is certainly not, as some reviewers point out, a niche film to be enjoyed only by homosexuals - though I imagine you'd probably have some problems with it if you're particularly homophobic or conservative. As long as you're open-minded, Hedwig (meaning both the film and the character) has the power to appeal and to move everyone; I haven't seen the stage version - Many people say that other actors who played Hedwig were better than John Cameron Mitchell - but John is absolutely electrifying in this role, surprisingly appealing and charismatic, as well as recognizable (which is quite surprising when you're talking about a transvestite glam-rocker from East Germany), and he acts and sings with all his guts. The fact that he is also the writer and the director, I think, really shows and it's for the best; the film is very personal, and you can tell from his acting that the character is all his own. Miriam Shor and Michael Pitt are both amazing in the supporting roles.<br/><br/>Even if all of that doesn't work for you, the music is where the film really stands out, and it's also the biggest point of difference between it and Rocky. While Rocky was created and inspired by the glam rock scene, the music - with maybe a couple of exceptions, like the wonderful and biting 'Sweet Transvestite' - is the stuff of Broadway, or at least Off-Broadway. That's not putting it down; it was intentional. The music on the Rocky Horror Picture Show is for the most part musical parody, pop tunes of sarcasm and wonderful dark humor. The songs on Hedwig are much more serious business, and much more complex, too, and most of them sound like they might have been recorded by David Bowie at the very height of his career. The rockier, harder songs like 'Angry Inch', 'Exquisite Corpse' and the spectacular, show-stopping opener 'Tear Me Down' sound like Ziggy Stardust mixed with Iggy Pop and tossed twenty five years into the future, with heavenly power chords and thundering bass and drums; 'The Origin Of Love' is an amazingly beautiful epic rock ballad with gorgeous lyrics; 'Wig In A Box' is a spectacular pop song which is so catchy it would have made a mega-hit were it released in the 70s; and the closing song 'Midnight Radio' is so classic a power ballad that you'll find your hand immediately reaching for the lighter. The band is fantastic, they have a terrific sound and are all great musicians, but they let Mitchell have all the attention he deserves. By the way, the music used in the shooting is playback as is usually the case in such movies, but John's vocals were recorded live, and it shows in his very emotional and powerful performances that have the feel of a live concert. Also, each song - especially 'The Origin Of Love' and 'Wig In A Box' - is shot as a perfect video clip. The band members, though they are not actors, and hardly talk at all, all look great on film and are pretty funny guys, too.<br/><br/>In conclusion, let's just say it's a great film and get it over with. It's not a trash film, or a cult film, or a gay film. Just a great musical and a great film overall. I dare you not to run and buy the soundtrack after you watch it."
"WordtwisterMN","10","1","2","4 March 2005"," A movie with something to say!
","Hedwig and the Angry Inch may be the most visually stunning movie I have yet to see. It's difficult to speak justice of how great to the eye the movie is. It's one part Amelie, one part Tool, and one part of a Radiohead video. The story which focuses on the lead singer and the lover somehow seemed to leave me viewing the movie from the eye of the backup vocalist. Hedwig offers much of a too real look inside of what life has been since the Reagan years. The wall crumbles, but even after the fact, life seems to be the same for the western person! Satisfaction can only be gained by questioning anything established. Any answer of common reasoning is thrown out. Hedwig and the Angry Inch's sarcasm reaches beyond levels of understanding among its actors. They are placed around the world, in different social climates, always after the one thing, acceptance. With that said, each actor has a difficult time even accepting their own self. Each character tries to justify their existence and at the same time offer and almost push their ""gift"" to the world. It is a very unique movie, and may leave the viewer a bit bitter upon our world's social climate. At the same time, it's a movie that needed to be done! A movie through its myriad of characters helps one to fit in to what seems to be a world being molded from oppressive thoughts, hands, and acts from the elitist establishment."

","I first saw Hedwig exactly 2 years ago in the theater. I had heard early Sundance Buzz on it and knew it was my kind of movie. I have not taken the CD out of my car since I bought it the day after seeing the movie. I am not going to tell you what the movie is about, because everyone else has. I AM going to tell you that you need to watch this movie if: you've ever felt like an orange in a basket of apples or if you've ever been in love or if you've ever had your heart broken or if you've ever had the notion to dream out of your bounds. This movie is about those things. It's not about being gay. The CD is one that will become a part of your classic collection, like so many Beatle, or Who or Stones records from other generations. I am just a suburban soccer mom who appreciates good music, good scripts and good acting. This movie provides all these things. John Cameron Mitchell is one of the most talented artists of our time. I only hope he uses those talents to further open doors and knock down barricades. And Stephen Trask is a musical genius. To make a person cry as hard on the 50th time listening to a song as on the 1st time is truly the sign of amazing songwriting. I am changed forever."

First and foremost, Hedwig is simply one of the most original, complex, and sympathetic characters ever put on<br/><br/>screen ... even with her rather extraordinary personal story. Second, the songs are great, and staged with a great sense of fun and visual flair. Third, it is hilarious. (One quote: ""Tommy, can you hear me?

","The performance by John Cameron Mitchell in this film is incredible. I'm amazed he was overlooked, at least for a nomination, by the Academy. JCM does a wonderful job of portraying a character that's both incredibly strong and willful while also obviously vulnerable and fumbling. He does a solid job of making this character funny too.<br/><br/>It may be difficult for some people to look past the drag and outlandish character of Hedwig, but the story told of personal growth and how we define ourselves and find our identities is just plain amazing. What would you sacrifice for freedom? How would you go on living when you find your sacrifice is rendered unnecessary? Great stuff in a highly underrated film.<br/><br/>Additionally, the music of Stephen Trask is rather good and works great in the context of the story. He writes catchy pop rock songs that will stick in your head after seeing this movie. As a recreational guitar player, I found myself playing these songs for weeks. He ranges the songwriting from basic hard rock with good hooks and chunky riffs (Tear Me Down, Angry Inch), to gentle touching introspective songs maybe you could even hear Phil Collins singing (Wicked Little Town, Origin of Love). JCM's vocals are top notch, and his similarity in style to Bowie fits right in with the character.<br/><br/>Anyway, get over the fact its about a semi-transsexual unknown eastern block rocker, and give it a try."

","Ever since I saw ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" I had a strong craving for scantily clad transvestites singing really awesome rock music.  Hedwig is by far a much softer character than Frankenfurter, who was unrulely robbed of his identity by his former protegé Tommy Gnosis.  Settling a lawsuit is hard for Hedwig, it is not the first time he was betrayed and vegenence is what he seeks, desperately.  You get to hear the beautifully unconvientional version of Hedwig's life story.  With his anti-American mother, his GI father and Hedwig's love for American Rock Music.  If you liked Rocky Horror you probably will like this, it definitely is a cult classic.  (Sorry if I spoil it but I loved the part where Hansel follows the trail of candy to his big surprise)."

","Hedwig (John Cameron Mitchell) is in a transsexual singer and through the songs he sings in his American tour, he tells the story of his life.<br/><br/>He was a German boy called Hansel and raised by his mother in East Berlin. When he is twenty six years old, he is gay and meets Sgt. Luther Robinson (Maurice Dean Wint), an American officer, close to the wall and they fall in love with each other. In order to get married, Hedwig is submitted to a unsuccessful surgery for changing his sex. The doctor leaves one inch of penis in his body, instead of a vagina. His 'husband' leaves him, and he starts working as babysitter. When he meets the teenager Tommy Gnosis (Michael Pitt), he teaches him how to play guitar and to sing and the guy becomes a successful singer and steals Hedwig's best song. Since then, Hedwig and his band are following Tommy's tour, trying to retrieve their participation in the hit. <br/><br/>""Hedwig"" is a very unconventional, weird, bizarre but funny film. It is a great homage to the glitter rock of David Bowie, Lou Reed and Iggy Pop. It is also a story of love and betrayal. John Cameron Mitchell deserved an Oscar for his role and performance as a transsexual rock singer. The songs are wonderful. Indeed this film may recall 'Rocky Horror Show' due to the bizarre and androgynous environment and the potentiality of cult- movie. However, it is indicated for a specific audience.

Watching the movie with the fabulous outfits, beautiful John Cameron Mitchell (I wish I looked that good in a dress!), deep emotions, hilarious one-liners AND the wonderful music made it a completely draining but fulfilling experience in the best way possible.

"hereticeye","9","1","2","25 July 2001"," TRANSsendent!
","I have been a big fan of ""Hedwig"" ever since I saw the David Bowie produced stage version when it played in L.A. I was blown away by the ferocious, infectious rock score and the vulgar wit of the text and its creative blending of genres, it's a wonderful amalgamation of camp comedy, punk rock show, and Greek tragedy.<br/><br/>When I heard they were doing a film version, I was foaming at the mouth. But I was apprehensive about a few things.<br/><br/>John Cameron Mitchell, who also wrote the musical's book, had never directed anything before, I wondered how they were going to structure the screenplay as the stage show is essentially a one-(wo)man(?) show, I had heard that they were given a paltry budget to work with, someting like $3 Million, and I wondered, would the adaptation still retain the power of the stage work?<br/><br/>Well, when I saw the finished film last week, all my worries about my beloved rock opera were obliterated, ladies and gentlemen, ""Hedwig"" is some kind of masterpiece, it's bold, virtuosic and possesses a vitality that's missing in today's crowded film scene, independent or otherwise.<br/><br/>John Cameron Mitchell is a prodigy, a born filmmaker, the movie is aggressively visual, the editing is smooth, has a great rhythm to it, and the perfomances are uniformly excellent.  I suspect that he did have some help, both Tom Kalin (director of ""Swoon"") and Todd Haynes (""Safe, ""Poison"", ""Velvet Goldmine"") are in the Special Thanks credits at the end of the film. The film's style is somewhat imitative of Haynes' ""Velvet Goldmine"", which I also consider a great film, but ""Hedwig"" is more more accessible.<br/><br/>The movie's script expands on the stage show and retain's the book's energy and wit, but the character of Yitzak is gravely undedeveloped and his relationship to Hedwig in the film is unclear.<br/><br/>For those not familiar with the stage show, Yitzak is Hedwig's husband and back up singer.  Hedwig met him while touring Eastern Europe.  Yitzak was his backwater country's most famous and fabulous drag queen performer and like Hedwig years before, longed for a better life in America.  So, Hedwig agrees to marry Yitzak, but with one condition, he must never do drag ever again.  (""To be free, one must give a little part of oneself"")  Yitzak agrees and becomes Hedwig's sidekick, the butt of humiliating jokes, forced to live in the shadow of his wife.  Yitzak is a bitter man and I think that comes through in the movie.<br/><br/>As for the small budget, they made great use of it, every penny is on screen, unlike most bloated unimaginative Hollywood fare in which more money and attention is spent on catering and lenses than the script and the performances.  The film is gorgeously shot and Hedwig looks fabulous in the orginal costumes.<br/><br/>So, run to see this movie!  Ignore all the comparisons to ""Rocky Horror"". Unlike that film, ""Hedwig' trascends the camp trappings and achieves a real epiphany and has palpable humanity and it has all the great qualities of punk rock, it's fast, loud, possesses unabashed angst and rage, a tinge of dread, helplessness and finally, the feeling that you can liberate yourself from injustice and helplessness through the power of song.<br/><br/>The only thing I can even think of comparing this unique gem to is Almadovar's ""Todo Sobre mi Madre"", with its delicate balance of camp, humor, tragedy, high drama, humanity, and at last, hope.<br/><br/>""Hedwig"" is unlike anything before it, an instant classic that rises above this new genre of postmodern musical, in which von Trier's flawed, but bold ""Dancer in the Dark"", Woody Allen's reverent ""Everyone Says I Love You"", and the horrible, soulless commercial that is ""Moulin Rouge"" are included.<br/><br/>It's unlikely that this film will be nominated for any Oscars, I think it's a little much for the Academy's Jurassic-aged members, but if I were voting: Best Actor for Mitchell, Supporting Actress for Miriam Shor as Yitzak, best costumes, and Make Up (of course). Well, you never know, trannies and other gender bending roles have been popular, last year, Hillary Swank did win for her turn as a female to male trannie in ""Boys Don't Cry"", Jaye Davidson was nominated for ""The Crying Game"", and don't forget about Linda Hunt's win for playing a man in ""Year of Living Dangerously"", sadly, though, the film's songs are ineligible for any tropihes becuase they were not made"

It is amazing that such an over the top, glam-rocker, transgender/drag queen character can be anything more than a shallow stereotype in the movie industry. She is not only anti-stereotypical, but is one of the most profoundly genuine characters ever put to celluloid. John Cameron Mitchell perfectly executed the trifecta of writing, directing, acting, and singing (wait, that's a quadfecta???).<br/><br/>I can't recommend this film enough."

","Good lord, I've had this movie recommended to me by many different people, but I still didn't expect for it to be this good! The reason I held it off was due to expectations--I figured it was a mock-rock flick that had Rocky Horror aspirations. I couldn't have been more wrong!<br/><br/>I've never been a fan of glam rock, but this movie does it right and does it well. John Cameron Mitchell shows himself to not only be a stunning visual storyteller but an amazingly poignant narrator. Between interesting and well-written songs that actually really help develop the psychology of the character are expository anecdotes that range from tragic to poetic. Mitchell is not only comfortable playing a transsexual but stunningly plays a transsexual that only thinks she's completely comfortable playing a transsexual. Hedwig is a fascinating character, and ""Hedwig & the Angry Itch"" is a well-made character study. What makes it all the more remarkable is its uniqueness.<br/><br/>Michael Pitt makes an interesting costar as Johnny Gnosis, the glam rock superstar who stole his music from Hedwig. It's a hilarious and ironic statement, considering that Hedwig's music is very much about things that Johnny Gnosis is very, VERY obviously not: coming from East Berlin, being a transsexual, involving onesself with music from a very early age. Yet as the denouement reveals, there's a surprising amount of Johnny Gnosis within Hedwig, making a very bizarre doppelganger story with too many associations for me to get into right now. Whatever the case, the ending to this movie is just as haunting as the rest of this movie is entertaining.<br/><br/>""Hedwig and the Angry Itch"" is not a movie to be missed, though it does seem to recognize its own confrontational nature. It's a movie about someone unlike anybody you've ever met but who you relate entirely to like a mirror image or a sister. It's a glam-rock fest of color and kitsch. And it's a haunting commentary on stardom and dreams.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","Remarkable musical of German transvestite star telling her life star while on an unsuccessful US tour.  Director/writer/star Mitchell is terrific as Hedwig, managing to emote real feeling through about five pounds of makeup. Also quite a good singer, with excellent songs.<br/><br/>Sometimes a movie comes out that is described as being one long MTV video, and this is justifiably portrayed as a bad thing, but Hedwig proves that an MTV video movie can be a very good thing indeed.  Songs are filmed in a variety of ways, some animated, some straightforward, but all are entertaining.  Like the musicals of yore, the songs progress the plot, or at least the back story that makes up the bulk of the plot, so unlike in most rock songs the lyrics are even more important than the music.  Funny and fascinating, this is something you shouldn't miss."

When the music is also not my style, I found this film really rather tedious and a complete headache - just like many of the US diners who unexpectedly stumbled on Hedwig's roadshow and decided to get out quickly.<br/><br/>I think the storyline has some strong points, and would be willing to follow it if it cut out the music stage scenes.  I was interested in the theme of confused genders against an East German background.  I also thought the Jonny Gnosis as a nemesis theme was psychologically strong.

While the acting was better then many indie films, it still left something to be desired. In particular, the casting of Miriam Shor to play the male Yitzhak was distracting, though the he/she situation was understandably present for more range in the singing.  The whole film had the feel of a broadway musical (for good reason) so if you like theatre translated onto the screen, you may want to check it out.  Furthermore, and maybe I'm one of the few, I thought the story itself was a little lacking in depth...an average (yet wildly colorful and unique) story hidden behind edgy musical numbers (most of which I liked, though I only REALLY enjoyed one of them), exotic costumes, and silliness (which I sadly could never remove from my mind).

Chances are roseate.<br/><br/>On the surface the film is comprised of a concatenation of Hedwig (Mitchell) and his bands' live performances in different places, intersected with flashbacks of Hedwig's past from Eastern Germany to Junction City, Kansas, the most startling one is his botched sex-change operation which left her the angry inch, a glaring aide-memoire of her bio-nature and the hell she has been undergone, also a testing ground to sift out those who cannot completely accept who she is, including Tom Speck (Pitt), a scare-easy greenhorn, whom Hedwig gets intimate with, but soon he would rip off her music for his own benefit.<br/><br/>Among all the raucous numbers in their repertoire, TEAR ME DOWN is a stunning gambit, SUGAR DADDY goes deliciously risqué and provocative, ANGRY INCH is self-revealing and poignant, but, the true knockout is no doubt THE ORIGIN OF LOVE, sagacious for its philosophical kernel inspired from Plato's SYMPOSIUM, enthralling for the befitting animation sequences and maximally manifests Hedwig and the Angry Inch's Glam Rock appeal and their full-fledged glitz. The following internecine schism between Hedwig and her band members, namely, with Yitzhak (Shor, audaciously disguising herself as a man), is the typical eruption of her prima donna vagaries, discloses a more sinister side of Hedwig's personae.<br/><br/>The film sends viewers a mixed message in the final curtain call, where Hedwig performs in her male form, without those gaudy headgear and fake boobs, leaves his mantle to Yitzhak, then in a dreamlike scenery, he reunites with Tom, both naked above the waist, teary-eyed. Be a woman if you want Hedwig, don't cringe, you are finally getting your toehold in the freedom land where one can be whoever he or she wants to be! Nevertheless, the coda seems to telegraph Hedwig's acquiescence of her biological identity, is she finally giving up the fight and finding peace with herself? Hardly so, in reality, it is a lifelong crusade ahead, that's rather in the wrong side of lane if the film and the story aim to be an affirming piece of art to endorse diversity and equality.<br/><br/>Last but not the least, a salvo of shout-outs to John Cameron Mitchell, a daredevil triple-threat who endeavours to bring his labour-of-love into fruition and leaves a glamorous mark in the soil of US queer cinema."

","Plot: Hedwig, an kid from the RFA with some gender issues, finds only one way to escape from his country. Sex-change surgery, marry an American soldier and then grab his mother passport to get the hell out of there. Now in the USA, we will witness her story: girl meets boy, boy steals her songs to become a rock star...all of it through a great musical, or better said a ""musiglam"". Ludicrous, is it not? John Cameron Mitchell adapts his own Off-Broadway play into the big screen, directs and stars as Hedwig, in a movie full of colors, light and music. A film that became an instant classic, a cult low budget movie, and a reference in indie filmmaking at the beginning of this century. Stephen Trask plays the role of guitar player in Hedwig's band, and he is responsible for the whole soundtrack, a track list as solid as touching; what a perfect music for such a story.<br/><br/>I remember watching this film around 2002 or 2003 in a nearby cinema, a ""Glam Night"", films like ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" (Jim Sharman, 1975), ""Velvet Goldmine"" (Todd Haynes, 1998) or this very film. I am not a fan of musicals, they seem to me a bit absurd, but when I watched this, I thought: ""well, if it's excessive, it better be ridiculously excessive"". And so it was, but not only that, it is a great film, a touching story and a wonderful soundtrack. Meet Hedwig, it is impossible not to enjoy her story."

","I thought the music in this film was not bad-maybe a bit 'draggy' at times (pardon the pun)- but as the film draws to an end the true nature-the true not Transgender nature of the person playing the lead comes out. Ooops. I was hoping it would actually have been a Transgender person-but rather it was an actor playing a Transgender person-albeit effectively-but in this day an age if you want to represent an Asian person in a movie for example you don't use facial prosthetics on a Caucasian actor's eyes-you hire an Asian actor. David Bowie's involvement in the play this movie was based on makes it noteworthy in the minds of fans of David Bowie. There is Bowiesque music in it but I am hearing more Lou Reed aka CBGB's NYC punk circa 1970-which isn't bad-but again-it isn't actually rock tunes written by a Transgender musician. In a way I think this film defines the worst kind of scam-in another way its just good harmless fun. A drag queen called Jinx Monsoon or something close to that seemed to have been the only person with an 'alternate sexuality' involved with this play at any level at any venue & it has played at a few. One of the musicians in the band appeared to be a 'drag king' but other than that there was nobody else 'different.' I wondered if it was based on someone real but if it was that was never mentioned-or I missed it. Cute film-but it was what it was, so I just gave it a five. Some of the dialogue was...thoughtful-but it didn't come from a ...you get the picture."
"JayDee87","Null","0","1","21 May 2012"," A true, unexpected gem of a film
","9.2/10<br/><br/>This film plays like the love child of This is Spinal Tap and The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Telling the incredible, fantastical tale of Hedwig it sort of feels like a surreal, sex-fuelled Forrest Gump (even linking the story to a historic event). Going by its plot, those thoughts and its unique genre placing as a camp punk-rock musical/opera on the surface you would expect this to be nothing more than just loud, brash and superficial. And while there may be an element of that there is also so much more here than just that. It's a film that is full of heart and sincerity. A film that toes the line between humour and poignancy. A film that is both joyous and heartbreakingly tragic. I may even go as far to say that it's a film that is rather oddly beautiful.<br/><br/>For an outsider looking in you may think the film and the character will not have much to say to you, much for you to identify with. After all who is going to be able to relate to the story of an East German transsexual punk rock singer? Except that it's so much more than that, it's about themes and emotions that are almost universal. It's about feeling lost and like an outsider, trying to find a place to belong. And it's about dealing with love both lost and found. As a result we can probably all relate to Hedwig in some way.<br/><br/>This is just a stunning effort from John Cameron Mithcell. As the film's writer, director and star its a truly immense accomplishment for him. His direction is raw, but so effective at imbuing the film with such a voracious energy and life. His script is a terrifically witty and fun affair, teeming with acerbic humour. And as the self described ""internationally ignored song stylist"" Hedwig, Mitchell's performance is just a revelation, absolutely mesmerising. It's probably the most I've enjoyed any performance in quite a while. Hedwig is like a cross between Lady Gaga and....and....no actually just comparing her to Lady Gaga just about does it! Well perhaps with a dose of 70s era David Bowie thrown in. The character is outlandish and very funny, but is also a fragile and rather sad creation. Mitchell brings so much depth and emotion to the role, grasping both the caustic humour but also the melancholy of Hedwig. And the fact that he has a stunning voice doesn't hurt either.<br/><br/>Of course this movie would not work in any capacity whatsoever without the songs. And what an amazing success they are. Written by Stephen Trask they seem to channel a bit of a Ramones vibe and are just absolutely infectious. It may have been only my first viewing but before long I already found myself singing along to them. What is most impressive about them is that they are not just purely throwaway efforts only for entertainment. Each song plays a part in moving the story along, detailing Hedwig's journey to this point and adding layers to the character and his emotions. I don't think there's a dud song in the bunch, and my personal favourites would have to be the bonkers but brilliant ""Origin of Love"", the fun and sweet ""Wig in a Box"" and the lovely ""Midnight Radio"". Though the one I've been singing most since then is actually ""Angry Inch."" <br/><br/>While Mitchell is tremendous there is someone who comes damn close to matching him – Michael Pitt as Tommy Gnosis. As the lost, troubled soul he is great but it's his scenes alongside Mitchell that are truly remarkable, the two sharing a terrific chemistry. Of special note has to be their final scene near the end of the film. With both men exposing their flesh and their souls it is a very powerful and beautiful moment. They don't actually say a single word, telling the whole story with their facial expressions and it is just wonderful.<br/><br/>The film also looks tremendous. The clothes, make-up and sets all have a tremendously flamboyant and extravagant feel to them. Hedwig's preposterous hair, full-on makeup and series of sensational, garish costumes make it a lush, glam rock style picture to behold. Oh and there is also some lovely use of crude but delightful animation, which is just insanely charming. This is especially true whilst accompanying Origin of Love.<br/><br/>Conclusion – Just a delight. A terrific find for me. Yes it's surreal. Yes it's bizarre and weird. As a result it's refreshingly original, whilst also being somehow believable, very moving and terrifically feel good. I was just expecting something silly and fun. Instead I was rewarded with something much more. Wonderful"
"ladymidath","10","0","1","29 February 2012"," A Brilliant Film
","I have to say that out of all the musicals and rock opera, Hedwig and The Angry Inch is one of the best. First of all, the performances from all the cast is superb, the story is poignant and the music is just great. Hedwig him/herself is a fascinating figure, strong and confident, yet vulnerable and hurting. Yet she always has dignity. The story of how she escaped East Germany by becoming trans gendered and marrying an American Soldier only to have the operation botched and being dumped by her husband in favour of a young man is a sad one. The expression on Hedwig's face as she watches her husband leave then discovers that the Berlin Wall is being torn down, is almost heartbreaking. Yet Hedwig rallies around with what is probably the best song in the film, Wig In A Box. Hedwig's one hope is that she will find her other and that she will finally be whole and perhaps by the end of the film, she has. One final note, the character of Hedwig was actually inspired by a woman who used to babysit for the Mitchell family. She was a German divorced U.S. Army wife who was also a babysitter and moonlighted as a prostitute at her Junction City, Kansas trailer park home. This is a film for people that loved Tommy, The Rocky Horror Picture Show And Repo The Genetic Opera."

After the second – or is this the third or more? – recommendation to see 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch' (4/5 Stars) I finally gave in. I was so unfamiliar with what this was about, aside from the main character being a drag performer and it was a musical, I thought the title ended with: ""and the angry ITCH"" and thought that made sense.<br/><br/>I admitthis one is hard for me to review. It's certainly not mainstream. It's also not black & white. In fact, I hate reviewing movies like these because my mind's going around in circles. (This is certainly above my pay rangebut since I don't get paidthank God, right?)<br/><br/>I did like the movie, very much. I loved the music, the songs, the story. The acting of director/writer/star John Cameron Mitchell, aka ""Hedwig"" was phenomenal. The movie's wildly original and for the most part I could follow it. But<br/><br/>Fine. I admit, I was a bit lost, especially in the absolute finale This MUST stem from my lack of interest in musicals because I guess I'm supposed to ""get"" the finale and see where this incredibly interesting character headed when naked down an alley<br/><br/>So, I will be watching this again. It sincerely helps that I loved the music and (pretty tragic) story of a lost boy. And then, perhaps I can answer some questions of mine<br/><br/>(Spoiler alert) Such as: Who did he end up with? How did he end up with that band? Was his co-lead singer a woman in drag? And finally, why the hell did they select places that went against his/her grain?<br/><br/>Hopefully, one – or more – of my friends will answer these questionsbut I still want to see it again. With further understanding, perhaps my rating will increase. Either way, I'm definitely ordering the soundtrack soonokayordered.

"galensaysyes","8","0","1","17 November 2008"," Original, sincere, and melancholy
","This has to be one of the most original musicals ever, if not the one most original. It has something to say, and a new way of saying it. For once in a rock movie, content exceeds style, so that there's something to see in every shot, but you have to pay attention to catch it. Since it is a musical, I wish that it had had some dancing in it, apart from the little the band does in its performances. But I can see that the story didn't allow for this.<br/><br/>Hedwig isn't totally realized. It's a stage show that has only been half converted into a movie. I recognize that if it had been opened up and broken up any further, it would no longer have been the same piece, and probably would have lost more than it gained. But it has acclimated itself so little to film that the style of the musical numbers, and the charge they must have packed on stage, aren't carried over. The numbers are photographed straight, without resort to crazy angles and flash editing. Perhaps the director saw these as clichés and deliberately avoided them.<br/><br/>And perhaps this movie isn't as innovative as I think. I'm not young and hip, I'm old and stodgy; and what I see as new may be old. Anyhow, by the time any piece of culture has found its way into a play, it's at least six months past its heyday (if not its expiration date) and, by the time the play becomes a film, a year farther on towards decrepitude. But within the boundaries of my old and stodgy perspective, I can aver without doubt that I've never seen a movie quite like this one.<br/><br/>I happened onto it by looking for something on the order of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, but better done. That's a pretty exact description of it. The superiority to the earlier movie is all-encompassing: the music more original, the lyrics more literate, and replete with references to everything under the sun, the book more in touch with cultural and political realities. To be fair, there would never have been a Hedwig without a Rocky Horror to have paved the way. But something like that could be said of virtually all art.<br/><br/>Hedwig's most obvious resemblance to Rocky Horror is in its special pleading for an alternative, unrestrictive sexuality. Rocky Horror, in its one half-serious scene, argued on behalf of pan-sexuality (even thirty years later, the sermonish quality of the speech still comes across as a little offensive); the character of Hedwig occupies a borderland state in between male and female, a result of a bizarre surgical accident. This fantastic, or at best extreme, condition serves as a sort of distorting lens through which the movie is able to focus on his dual sexual nature. That takes it beyond camp (which I dislike) into an exploration of his sex, or sexes, which is purposely skewed but, allowing for that, essentially sincere and truthful.<br/><br/>The best illustration of the approach is a love-sex scene between Hedwig and his friend-enemy. Hedwig's sexuality, as noted, is ambiguous, but the scene of course is, and is played as, between two males. As such, it's the first male-male love scene I've seen in a mainstream movie (if Hedwig can be called a mainstream movie) that hasn't made me uncomfortable. I always figured my discomfort arose from an old-fashioned preference that movies remain chaste and bourgeois; now I think it wasn't that. This scene has little regard for the proprieties, but it's inoffensive regardless, because for once the people in it are really attracted to each other, want each other, need each other. In other words, it's a love scene that happens to be between men; not a GAY LOVE SCENE without love or sexual feeling, as such scenes formerly have been. (Note: Straight love scenes are the same. But they've been around so long that one accepts them as a convention without examining them closely.) <br/><br/>Apart from the sexual reorientation, the most striking quality of the movie is its melancholy. That isn't at all what one expects in a rock musical. It's a Swiftian melancholy, comic in the extremity of its satire, and bitter almost to the point of despair: ""My guardian angel fell asleep on the watch,"" Hedwig sings. To the wanderers in the desert, rock music is pictured as an oasis (""Hold on to each other,...all the misfits and the losers""), and from this perspective all the attributes of the form, from its chord progressions to its musicians' convulsions during performance, fall into place. What looks from the outside like simple rejection is a process of working through life's impositions (like the ""angry inch""). In the end, with luck, it leads the sufferer such as Hedwig to an affirmation of himself, his needs of the moment giving way to the deeper need. Behind its graffitied exterior, this movie has a lot of understanding, I think, for the loser, the untouchable, the odd man out. <br/><br/>I liked it a lot."

","Maybe this movie is not for every one, yet maybe it is. On the surface it may seem to have a gay theme but really could apply to any one. In essence it's about finding true love. The music is the real star of this movie. Some of the best music and art direction to be filmed in years. I saw this movie after reading about it here on the internet, and was glad I gave it a chance. An East German transvestite that comes to America by way of batched sex change and false married to America GI. Then starts a Rock-N-Roll band. Along the way he/she has her songs stolen by a young protégé and by strange luck she gets them back. The costume's are as outrageous as the plot. Once again, the music is the driving force. A Rock opera for the 21-century. Like Spinal tap, and Tommy taken to the next level. Out standing job by first time director Cameron Mitchell. Give this movie a look-see. I think you'll be very surprised. Its just great."
"Christopher_Reid","Null","0","1","25 April 2007"," Quite enjoyable, especially the songs.
","Hedwig and the Angry Inch wasn't quite like anything I've ever seen before. Other than the regular songs, which are very enjoyable, the movie doesn't seem to follow any particular formula (or at least not one I'm familiar with). This is to some degree both good and bad in this case. It was engaging all the way through although the fact that it was unpredictable more often than not resulted in it being bizarre and somewhat confusing rather than original or complex.<br/><br/>Still, this was a very likable movie with likable characters (primarily Hedwig; the other characters are given very little depth except for perhaps Tommy Gnosis). I think the movie's strength is its songs and light-hearted tone. I think the rest of the movie is comparatively weak though still worth watching simply for John Cameron Mitchell's performance as Hedwig.<br/><br/>Somehow, Hedwig and the Angry Inch appears to end up being more than the sum of its parts. It is very funny at times but not consistently funny enough to be considered a great comedy, it has some fun songs but none that stood out as great, it has a weird story which is interesting but ultimately not very rewarding, and yet it's enjoyable and memorable. I think much of this comes down to Hedwig who is just a surprisingly likable and interesting character. Without Hedwig, this movie would most likely end up being forgettable and mediocre at best."

","Hedwig Robinson (John Cameron Mitchell) is a rocker. And she's got The Angry Inch beside her (and in her pants). As a young man, Hansel/Hedwig lived in East Berlin, right before The Wall came tumbling down. His sexual identity was always in question and when a cute, black, American soldier gives him a way out of the Eastern Bloc, Hedwig jumps on him (literally and figuratively). But he can't get to the other side of The Wall as a man, so an operation takes place to remove his vital functions below the waist ...if you get my meaning. Needless to say (if you pay attention to the title of the film), the surgery gets botched and leaves Hedwig with his ""Angry Inch."" The anger is twofold. First is the failed operation; second is Hedwig's fury over stolen musical material by someone named Tommy Gnosis (Michael Pitt). Tommy is a rock-n-roll sensation, but it's all because of what Hedwig taught him in his early days. So Hedwig, in true bitchy fashion, follows Tommy's rock tour around the world. But instead of playing in theaters and high end places, Hedwig and his Angry Inch band play at lowbrow restaurants, often to the dismay of its patrons who've simply come in to eat.<br/><br/>Hedwig's decline into obscurity is well played by director/actor John Cameron Mitchell. The musical soundtrack is very well done and the catchy tunes will have most movie watchers tapping their toes along to the rockin' beats. That he also remains angry at some of his band members is quite funny, actually holding them hostage by keeping their passports hidden away.<br/><br/>Revenge is the meal of the day as Hedwig finally meets up with Tommy again, eventually leading to Tommy's career demise and launching Hedwig into the spotlight. But is this what Hedwig really wanted? Not realizing the sacrifices she'd have to make, Hedwig decides to re-open her/his closet and show the world his/her true identity. He also sets free one of his band members who turns out to be a woman masquerading as a man, too.<br/><br/>Those willing to watch a film without sitting in judgement of the material will most likely eat this story up. It's quite funny, well acted, and has a rippingly good soundtrack. But if you're a staunch conservative or  god forbid  homophobic, you might want to pass on this one."

No other movie tells a story the same way this one did. Beautifully written, and wonderfully portrayed. The dialog is packed full of sarcastic humor that criticizes most of the things Americans typically value. They do this by telling the story purely through a man who spent his entire life being ""touched"" by so many people.<br/><br/>This is an excellent film, but I would only recommend it to experienced film watchers.

After the first 5 minutes, I rushed through the last dishes to sit down and better hear the dialogue. This film was very well scripted, not to mention the catchy and equally heart wrenching lyrics. As soon as the credits rolled around, I wrote down the information where I could find the soundtrack.

"Jumping_Elephant","8","0","2","22 June 2006"," Great movie, although Hedwig's actions may bother some
","The first time I watched this movie I gave it a three out of five stars. The reason for this was because of Hedwig's actions. Hedwig openly admits to saying he did some ""jobs some called blow"". This, to me, indicates that he was giving guys ""blowjos"" and not letting them know he was really a man. That grosses me out, as I'm sure it would a lot of viewers. I have nothing against transsexuals or hermaphrodites or whatever, but to do that to someone and have them not know what you really are is deceptive and personally, makes me want to punch them in the friggin' face, if not something more violent.<br/><br/>The other unacceptable action of Hedwig's was ""jerking off"" Tommy Gnosis when he didn't know Hedwig's true nature, either. Hedwig angers me for that reason alone, that he doesn't seem to care about other people, but at the same time, you have to sympathize with him.<br/><br/>The only thing that prevents me from giving this movie a ten is Hedwig's unforgivable actions and unforgivable taste in music. (Velvet Underground... No. DON'T take a walk on the wild side, let the person decide for themselves instead of you're brainwashing, Lou Reed... and Heroin sucks.) Also, the Rolling Stones are horrible. They're like dinosaurs. The only good artist Hedwig listens to is David Bowie. My personal opinion here, of course.<br/><br/>My only point here is that Hedwig may anger some, so if you are easily angered by the selfish actions of others, so will you be at this movie at first glance. I recommend going out and watching ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" first to soften the blow, so to speak."

It won't replace the Rocky Horror Picture Show but I can guarantee it will gather a large following as more and more people discover this quaint movie. John Cameron Mitchell is brilliant in the lead role as Hedwig, an East German Transvesite living in a trailer park in Kansas. His/her tale is told in a series of flashbacks often accompanied by song.

The ""I may be down, but screw you I'm not out!"" spirit of punk resounds throughout the plot accompanied by one of the best original soundtracks I've ever heard.<br/><br/>When you hear the song ""Angry Inch"" with it's hard riffs, angry vocals and uncomfortably In-Your-Face subject matter, you'll dare anyone to tell you punk is dead. It may not be heard every day, but the spirit of punk lives in Hedwig!<br/><br/>I would have given this film a 9.5, had IMDb allowed it, as my reason for not giving it a ten is a minor annoyance with the soundtrack. Since this was originally adapted from a stage production, the actors could have taken the cheap way out and simply moved their lips to the songs from the original production. This didn't happen here. The actors in the movie re-recorded their vocals for this movie, even though most of the actors are the same ones from the stage production. This gives the soundtrack an amazing live feel throughout the movie. However, one of the actors from the stage production, a woman, was not in the movie. They replaced her with a man....but this was the one actor they did not re-record the vocals for. Oops! However, this is so rarely noticeable that I did not see it until I was looking for it, so it's really not a big deal."

","A true rock love story, Hedwig and the Angry inch follows the tour of a glamorous underground rocker across the country in various ""venues"" including family eateries and special interest festivals that mirror that touring route of her former lover/ rock sensation Tommy Gnosis (voice of Stephan Trask, who wrote the music.) This, though non-traditional, is a sensitive picture of love, lust, angst, and sexuality, set to music about the rocker's life. Written directed and starring John Cameron Mitchell, this movie is one of the best nontraditional musicals I've ever seen, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys the rocky horror picture show , or who loves rock and roll, or just plain modern musicals. Everyone I've shared this movie with, gay/straight/conservative/liberal/man/woman has, even if they didn't LOVE it, found some kind of application to their life in the plot."
"juanita-dark","10","0","1","17 February 2005"," A must-see.
","This wonderful movie has become my all-time favourite. Not that you need to know this, but when I rented it a while ago and I sat down to watch it, I ended up spending over six hours straight just watching everything on the DVD (the movie four times, once with the commentary on). The first time I watched it I had a very open mind and I just went into it not expecting anything. I just kind of sat there watching and watching it, with this amused look on my face, bursting out laughing a only couple of times. After I saw the whole thing for the first time, I actually didn't find it brilliant or genius, I only thought it weird, but good. However, something from the movie pulled me in and I kept watching it over and over again. I think I watched it six or seven times once I'd returned the seven-day rental.<br/><br/>Anyway, it has become sacred in my mind. I personally really connected to the movie on an emotional level because of the beautiful story of this lost creature, just looking to be complete and to feel absolutely comfortable in her own skin. And on top of that, you have great, just amazingly great tunes, and you have a very large element of humour in it as well. It has a bit of an odd sense of humour, though, but I personally am into that kind of thing. I think it's a very well-rounded movie, as it has so many moods and ups and downs. That is to say, it doesn't snap from extreme to extreme, it flows very well.<br/><br/>The movie is also very colourful and pleasing to the eye to watch. The costumes are wonderful, extravagant outfits, the make-up and hair is always great. The shifting of colour tints (or whatever you call it...saturation, etc.) in the film itself as Hedwig tells the story through flashbacks, and as the story tells itself in the 'present', also really helps bring the story to life on screen.<br/><br/>All in all, a really, really awesome movie."

","I'm sorry to see that several of you found it boring and ridiculous, but this is definitely not a movie to review if you don't like musicals. I loved it; I bought the DVD and I bought the soundtrack. Actually both my husband and I loved it. I don't think it can be compared to Rocky Horror Picture Show as they are completely different types of musicals. There is a great sense of humor and subtlety about Hedwig and, c'mon, the entire premise is rather unique. It's so nice to see something out there that's different than the usual mass-market, blockbuster stuff. And if I could, I'd have an outfit just like Hedwig wore at the end of Wig in a Box (with the long, blond Cher hair). My husband and I even played this movie for our neighbors, rather conservative types (he's ex-Navy), and they found a lot of humor in it. <br/><br/>But that's just me. Thanks."

","First, I liked the use of flashback; cartoon; & the hyper-real, as in the inclusion of babies, the tour meetings, the pseudo documentary scenes. It might be criticism that the plot premise is established in the first 15 mins, and where do you go from there? But, 'Story of Love' cements the plot as a quest for the other 1/2, and that held my interest thereafter. I liked the knowing humour, like: - You Kant always get what you want, wrt to German philosophy I liked the way, in the scenes depicting the first expressions of overt homoeroticicsm {not sure if this is the term}, sarcastic use was made of homoerotic symbolism, so obvious, so symbolic, so obvious it was laughable, it made fun of those who want to find deep symbolism in movies like this (the gummi bears scene). I liked the Country music parody scene, though I wondered about suspension of disbelief when the music carried on while the musicians were fighting?! To those who have compared this movie to 'Rocky Horror', I would say forget it, that movie had transsexualism, but this movie is far more about it I thought it slowed a bit in the middle, but on the whole was pretty good. A lesson to all those securely heterosexual people who think they are common, but forget there are rarer birds; and an inspiration to all those rarities."

","I myself having a strong passion for music, related on so many different levels to this musical. I thought every song had something i could relate to in some way shape or form. The Origin of Love being one of my favorites had a lot of meaning to me, i thought it told a very valid story about the how us as humans relate to the emotion we call love. I could go into great detail about every song but I would like to save myself from carpal tunnel if at all possible. So in closing i think everyone should experience Hedwig, is is a wonderful story about love, heartbreak, and finding ones true self. I think anyone can relate to a story like that.

","The story of a talented rock-star shunned due to the unfortunate status of gender politics of the age. Hedwig's lover co-ops his music and becomes a huge teen-heartbeat star removing all meaning and quality from the music and makes it socially and mainstream consumable, discarding Hedwig left to meander in the underworld of broken dreams. Think Elvis, if he had heisted his gig from a glam star...<br/><br/>An odd mix of theater drama, dark tragedy and sharp political gender comedy, this film easily entertains the open minded and interests even the closed minded. Some parts are a bit over the top but it retains a freewheeling vibe that doesn't allow the sad facts of Hedwig's life to bog it down. Certain scenes of the film seem like unneeded filler and even at times are bordering on agitating but they combine to give more depth to the character as a whole which in turn allows you to care about what happens next in the story and life of Hedwig. <br/><br/>It respectfully (and thankfully) avoids gay cliche' and stereotypes with an intelligent story while retaining the wild and very human charisma that makes it engaging. Steven Trask's score is beyond stellar and even if you can't get into the subject matter of movie, the soundtrack would still be recommended as a solid rock opera piece. The story COULD have easily been used as a bridge device to different musical numbers, however it avoids that horrid musical cliché' with good acting, engaging dialog and bright but sparse directing, making this a great dark comedy. I cannot remember the last time I saw a musical that ran the length of emotion that this one did. Dark comedy, sad introspection, longing, lust and most importantly love.<br/><br/>Hedwig and the Angry Inch is successful in being a great dark comedy about love and hope as well as being a great musical achievement. 9/10"

","This movie was so freaking awesome. Mind blowing almost. Great songs, very catchy. The whole idea is great - a young boy from East Germany grows up and his sexuality gets all blurred and then he undergoes a failed operation. All of this is told backwards and mostly through song. Hedwig (taking his mother's name) travels to the US and meets a lover. It's a great romance story, except for the lover kind of being a jerk sometimes. Hedwig is such an interesting character and the flashback parts to his time in Germany are very well done. Really though, the review above this doesn't do it justice. This movie is great and thought provoking and really worth your while."

","'Hedwig and the Angry Inch' is a rock musical about a transsexual from East Germany. Although this does not sound like something I would like to see, I was pleasantly surprised. The story is about Hedwig (writer director John Cameron Mitchell) who comes to the United States. To leave East Germany a sex change was necessary, although it wasn't completely successful, hands the ""Angry Inch"". We see how (s)he falls in love with Tommy (Michael Pitt), how they sing and play together and how eventually Tommy steals all of Hedwig's songs and becomes a rock star. Hedwig is a little mad and with her band she now follows Tommy everywhere he goes on his tour.<br/><br/>I am not sure why I liked this movie. Mitchell's performance is perfect and of course that helps. Hedwig's emotions are very clear to us and you feel sorry for her. I also liked the songs, something I thought I would not do. Of course this is just a matter of taste, but I think it helps a lot for people to like or hate the movie. It should not do that actually, since the story itself is interesting enough.

Before I knew it, I was totally engrossed in this unknown flick from some East German I never heard of. The music--written by Stephen Trask, another unknown to me--contained incredible ballads and rock and roll (if you have any appreciation for rock and roll, you'll feel like dancing and get lost in these songs, particularly the title song, ""I Got An Angry Inch"") , the plot was wonderfully different, interesting with an inspiring underlying message, the acting was great and the directing and editing were masterful, and if that weren't enough, it was very funny, even though inspired from tragedy (""Our apartment was very small, so I had to listen to my radio with my head in the oven."" -- his mother punished him.) The movie was written, directed and had starred John Cameron Mitchell. There were no weaknesses. I believe the acting was so good, in part, because the director was great. It's obvious to me that this man is a creative genius and I've never heard of him. Where did he come from (East Germany, but I was talking metaphorically!)? It's wonderful when you catch a film that you never heard of because it hasn't gone through the Hollywood marketing machine--nor is it like anything Hollywood puts out. Will there be an encore, Mr. Mitchell? Or are you a one-hit wonder? Or maybe you already had an encore, but just couldn't get that huge Hollywood marketing budget. I'll be looking."

","In the world of film, it is possible for a director, writer, and lead actor to be on a very close wavelength, but when those three roles are performed by the same person, the gap is closed shut, and the magic of one's dream is brought to screen in full power.<br/><br/>Such is the case with John Cameron Mitchell's Hedwig and the Angry Inch, a delightful journey into the world of a glam-rock showstopper who has suffered his share of confusion.  Hedwig was written, directed, and portrayed all by John Cameron Mitchell, an easy answer to the reason who such an off-scale film can be pulled off so well.  <br/><br/>This is where spoilers begin.  <br/><br/>Hedwig Robinson, born as a boy named Hansel in East Berlin, and flees to the United States to be with his beloved American GI boyfriend, Sgt. Luther Robinson (Maurice Dean Wint).  To go through with the flee, Hansel becomes Hedwig in a botched sex change leaving him with the latter part of the film title, an ""angry inch"", which he is quick to point out during a performance with his rock band of the same name.<br/><br/>Hedwig's band is started to rival new Alterna-rock megastar Tommy Gnosis (Michael Pitt), Hedwig's past love interest [after the Luther-marriage fell through, of course].  Gnosis was Hedwig's protege of sorts: an awkward young boy with no real appeal.  The self-proclaimed ""slip of a girly boy"" turns Tommy Gnosis into a powerful rock-star, and of course sets himself up for abandonment.<br/><br/>The two units tour ""together"", as Hedwig and his delightful backup band follow Gnosis around, playing in venues near Tommy's, and telling Hedwig's intriguing story all the way home.  Eventually, Hedwig ends up in Tommy Gnosis's limousine by chance, and the two share a moment of friendship before everything falls apart again.<br/><br/>The film is a sheer entertainment pleasure, filled with plenty of colour and wit, and never a moment of fake hinges.  Hedwig shines throughout, but the rest of the cast isn't far behind, always vamping up the screen, and thrilling the audience with mega-catchy musical numbers [""I put on some make-up / and turn up the eight-track / I'm pulling the wig down from the shelf""].  The costumes, wigs, and sets for this film are all brilliantly elaborate, proving that sometimes ""less is more"" is not true, especially when an ""over the top"" scenario backs up the plot line as well as the characters.  Though the subject matter may be a little risque for prudish minds, the film always seems to redeem itself in some sense, and send everyone home on a high note... both literally, and figuratively."

It is a sentimental story that combines glam-rock antics, beautiful art direction, and a kick ass performances to create the wildest musical to hit the screen in years.

The title character's flamboyance will also erk many straight-laced (no pun intended) viewers not used to this sort of thing.

","John Cameron Mitchell as Hedwig/Hansel is as tragic a figure as they come. But what a beautiful figure.  Though Moulin Rouge will no doubt have stolen the thunder for best musical, Hedwig is where the heart of the musical is at. The songs do more than accompany the story - they propel the action. Story and song are so intertwined that one could not conceivably do without the other. It is a seemless magical blend that defies convention. This is one of top ten films that I have seen in the last 5 years in terms of originality, intelligence and having a heartbeat. The characters are fully formed and bursting with life. (Lowpoints in taking a big comic star like Andrea Martin and puting her in the non existant role of manager for the sake of ""star power"" - she was wasted in My Big Fat Greek Wedding the same way as well. It is confusing for the audience when these characters do not pan out into something more fully formed.)How much prettier can a boy get than Michael Pitt?<br/><br/>The songs and performance numbers are what really take this film to another level. It works on screen because it worked on stage. You can see the hours of blood, sweat and tears that were put into this film - it all shows up on the screen. The Cinematography is gorgeous - just the right balance between dramatic and reality - never going over the top. The costumes, hair and make up and production design are second to none and where done on what I imagine to be a shoe string budget. ""Truly the best I've ever seen"", to paraphrase the film. The heads of these departments all deserve huge kudos. The animated segments have a naivete that belies their crudeness. This is a window to Hansel's heart.This movie is fresh from start to finish. The viewer is taken on a journey that is only enriched with repeated viewings.<br/><br/>John Cameron Mitchell is a star to be watched. Hopefully he did not blow his load with Hedwig and we will see more films and plays that are as fearless and original as Hedwig and the Angry Inch."

When you hear folks go around saying, ""It's the same old thing in movies today"", they haven't seen this film. I was entertained and in turn felt for the characters, especially the lead, Hedwig. There was alot of information I wasn't aware of which made this even more interesting to me, and it was presented in a way that didn't turn me away but made me want to know more about these characters and their plight.<br/><br/>Here you have the age old story of someone very talented trying to make it in rock music but is condemned to playing the more seeder places because someone stole their music/act. What makes this story different is that the talent that had his music taken is an immigrant from Berlin who had a horribly botched sex change operation. The botched sex change operation was due, in part, to escape communist Berlin to come to America and be ""free and creative"" and well, everything doesn't go the way Hedwig imagined.  The music Hedwig performs reflects those struggles and inner turmoil. You do feel for this character, you begin to understand this character and you'll want things to be better for this character considering all the crap Hedwig has gone through. Events in recent history pepper Hedwig's story and makes for that greater conflict within Hedwig.

","I didn't find Hedwig as hysterically funny as most of the reviews I'd read had led me to believe it was, but it is bitingly funny none the less. It's gritty, emotional (in a real rather than sentimental sense) and peppered with moments of wicked humour courtesy of the ongoing narration by the central character, a virtual one-man tour de force by John Cameron Mitchell. Although the music is essential to the story I did find that there was perhaps too much of it  but this could be because much of it is (presumably intentionally) awful.<br/><br/>Destined to be a late-night favourite at cult screenings, partly because of the singalong nature of the songs, with lyrics appearing on screen at one point.

","Hedwig and the Angry Inch is a film so well written/acted and with so much style and class that even those of you out there who do not normally like musicals and/or dislike gay cinema can enjoy it along with the rest of us. Fantastic catchy songs are perfectly mixed into an involving and well paced storyline. John Cameron Mitchell's directing talent can clearly be seen by looking at the performance of newcomer Michael Pitt in this wonderful film versus his performance in the unbelievably lame Bully. I think it's best not to discuss the story line at all. The songs tell the story and I'm not going to give any of them away. Mitchell should have been nominated (although I have no respect for the Academy Awards farce that takes place each year) for an award for best screenplay and best director. ""The Origin of Love"" should also have been nominated for best original song. The idiots at the Academy are too busy slapping themselves on the back for giving actors ""make up awards"" for past work (defeating the whole purpose) to acknowledge this masterpiece of cinema. See it (if you can find it) at all costs!"

","Saw this movie sometime ago and immediately bought both the soundtrack (all the better to play in the car) as well as the DVD. Nether have left their respective player components since.<br/><br/>As has been described ad nauseum here - this is the story of a girly slip of a boy's journey from communist eastern block Berlin to Kansas City and notoriety as he enters into a law suit for the shared credits and reciepts to the songs that are generating fame and fortune for the countries most famous rock and roll icon who refuses to aknowledge him.<br/><br/>We start the movie with Hedwig bursting angrily onto stage delivering the raw, powerful song ""Enemies and adversaries"" Every torch singer joke is pulled thrown at the audience and its easy at this point to write Hedwig off as simply another painted man on stage, with the novel twist that this one can actually sing his own songs .. but very little more depth is presented - much as one might write off any transexual or stripper on stage.<br/><br/>But behind the heavy make up brash lyrics and pat one liners the movie begins to slowly flesh out the man behind the make-up. We are shown snippets of Hedwigs journey to the States from his life in the Eastern block, his childhood, his mother . I liked this technique - First we are presented the finished product - a man in makeup screaming out anger on a tired stage - not the kinda person too many of the audience would relate to. As soon as your ready to write all this off we are shown Hedwig as a boy - Hansel - in Eastern block Berlin - we are shown snippits of his life and allowed to develop the character into a real person - we are then let into the real motive behind the man in an amazing song ""The origin of love"" .<br/><br/>From this point in the movie onwards the story is told both in Songs and snippets flashing back to the past as well as current day - metaphor is used heavily but not confusingly - every image presented works to provide a richer context for the reason behind why Hedwig is the way he is. We end up with a portrayal of a person most people wouldn't have a hard time recognising in themselves - even if the exterior presentation is packaged somewhat differently.<br/><br/>This is one of my favorite movies of all time - a classic that I predict will gain in popularity as time marches on. 9/10."

A lot more people should watch this than ever will, for fairly obvious reasons. To be honest, it's something that I usually wouldn't bothered with.  But once you get past it being a movie about a transexual rock star you realize that ""Hedwig"" is about as touching a movie as they make.  Besides featuring great songs, the movie features an EXTREMELY impressive acting job on the part of John Cameron Mitchell.  He gives Hedwig (near) universal appeal and allows the audience to identify with her in a way that I wouldn't have thought possible.

My god, my head is about to explode cuz this movie is soÂ…  [SPLAT!  my head explodes].<br/><br/>Just had to get that out.  Hedwig is mighty in every respect.  The whole movie revolves around a hero staggering from denial to knowledge, joy to pain, and pretty much every extreme you can name.  Mitchell is utterly convincing as Hedwig.  The art direction is often stunning - with things like a glam stage exploding out of the side of a trailer home and quivering cartoons that are very touching.  The music is perfect soundtrack to pour forth from a character that worshipped Bowie, Lou Reed and Ann Margaret. The only complaint I have is that the end went on about one song too long. I like this movie way too much to claim it's a classic of any sort.<br/><br/>The DVD documentary is one of the best DVD extras I've ever seen.

","I don't know much of the back story on this film, except that it was an off-Broadway success before it was made into a movie, and that the star of the film (John Cameron Mitchell) is also the director and writer, and that one of the other actors in the movie (Stephen Trask) also did the music.<br/><br/>Having said all of that, I have to say that I LOVE IT when a low budget movie comes along from (seemingly) nowhere and just kicks a##. ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" is not a perfect movie, but its weaknesses are easily overlooked, because this movie rocks.<br/><br/>First, the music . . . this is one of the most satisfying soundtracks I've heard in along time.  Almost all of the songs here are well done and catchy. But this isn't just pop fluff, there's some talent at work here.  I was amazed at the number of good songs (crafted by Trask) in the film.  In addition Mitchell's voice, evidently stage-proven, makes a great transition to that of a punk rocker.  I found myself wondering if these guys ought not to really start a rock band, and really make music.  I'd buy the albums.<br/><br/>Next, the creativity . . . wow . . . you've never seen a movie like this . .. it is wholly original . . . just take a glimpse at the premise: a partial transexual punk rocker from Berlin tries to make it in the U.S . . . and along the way . . teaches us some things about love and life.  Also, the animation was clever, and was integrated nicely with the rest of the film.<br/><br/>And lastly, Hedwig him/herself . . . the movie presents us with the unlikeliest of heroes, and Mitchell gives (truthfully) an Oscar-worthy performance.  As far as I am concerned, Hedwig has clearly established himself as a cult figure now, on the fringe perhaps, but this is one of the most memorable characters and performances that I've seen in a while. The wigs were also fabulous.<br/><br/>The script and writing is generally good, with just a few holes and weaknesses. I felt that some of the supporting characters (i.e. the Stephen Trask character) needed a little more light shed on them, and in some ways the ""meaning"" of the movie was blurred a little by the drama of it all. Just as point of reference . . . I feel that ""Pricilla, Queen of the Desert"" from Australia is a better drag queen movie.  But ""Hedwig"" and ""Pricilla"" are very different movies, both equally great in their own genres. And the music for ""Hedwig"" is far superior to that of almost any movie out there.<br/><br/>But mainly, this movie is great fun.  You'll be laughing at Hedwig's camp, singing along with ""Wig in a Box"" or with ""Wicked Little Town"", feeling Hedwig's pain as he does, and maybe even learn a couple of things about life along the way.  I am left with a few indelible images from the film . . . like Hedwig shimmying his underside over the head of a senior citizen at one of his live performances, shouting, ""It's a car wash, ladies and gentlemen"". . . or Hedwig as a child dancing on the bed or harmonizing with his head in the oven . . . or Hedwig's mobile home park rock concert where the trailer wall itself acts as his fantasy stage . . . or Hedwig's desperation as he pleads with his lover to ""Love the front of me, honey""  . . . or Hedwig's description of meeting his first husband and the gummy bears. (I won't elaborate further on this one . . . make of it what you choose.)<br/><br/>So see Hedwig with an open mind--you'll have the best time that you've had in a movie in a while."

The music is as angry, emotional, and telling as the plot is, and it is very easy to become attached to all of the characters in Hedwig for this reason.  Most musicals spend more time entertaining, and not enough time developing the characters, but Hedwig is an exception.  The characters are all three dimensional, and you can't help but feel incredibly sympathetic towards them.  Hedwig can be viewed as eye candy due to the vibrant, colorful imagery and energetic performances, but it also maintains a deep, heart-warming plot that feels more realistic than I could have ever imagined.

The performance Mitchell puts together is so believeable that I completely forgot he was under that wig and astounding make-up job. Mitchell's ability to sing, perform, write and direct this film is an amazing feat, I could relate to the character of Hedwig in ways I never thought imaginable. The isolation, the fear, the wonder of rock music while in your youth. Mitchell manages to pull all that together in just one look at the screen. The animated sequences were also a very nice touch. The animation is very simple but works better in bringing the emotion to the surface than alot of bigger and more popular animated feature films. I think the music is phenomenonal, some of the best music I have ever heard in a film period. I really feel sort of ashamed for avoiding this film for as long as I have, I actually saw Mitchell in Dude, Where's My Car? before viewing this film. I can't believe I saw Dude, Where's My Car? before watching the brillance that is Hedwig. I consider myself the ultimate film buff. All film buffs should view this film if you haven't already. If you have, view it again. Hedwig and the Angry Inch will be talked about for many years to come."

","This movie kicks so much butt I can't believe it didn't even get nominated for Best Musical at the Golden Globes. Hell, unlike MOULON ROUGE, it at least had original songs, so it should have gotten some attention. Speaking of those songs, they are all fantastic, from the lovely and lyrically brilliant ""Origin of Love,"" to the raunchy ""Angry Inch,"" the exhillerating and uplifting ""Midnight Radio"" and the side-splittingly funny ""Wig In A Box"". Of course, John Cameron Mitchell has much to do with this: his performance and vocals are amazing, and while I liked Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman's performances, Mitchell and Miriam Shor win my vote for singing on-screen couple of the year. Stephen Trask (whose career as a composer/lyricist is hopefully going to rocket to stardom after this), Andrea Martin and Alberta Watson all provide strong and memorable supporting performances, while Michael Pitt manages to be both vaguely annoying, in a Vincent Gallo/Trent Reznor way, while still being oddly endearing and vulnerable- exactly what he needs to be. I've never seen the stage play so I have no idea how it compares, but the script moves beautiful from one stage of Hansel/Hedwig's life to the next and the friendly, amiable manner in which it is shot and directed makes the film's strange characters totally relateable, their personal desires and agony very real and close to home. This movie is ultimatelty, in addition to being fun and full of good music, extremely powerful, both as a story of one man's long journey to finally accepting his own masculinity, and as an exploration of how music allows an individual to experiment with both self-concealment and self-revelation. The characters are beautifully 3 dimensional, and it ultimately provides that musical theater catharsis that MOULON ROUGE dropped in exchange for a schmaltzy, weepy ending too corny to be acceptable. It's a shame that the subject matter and lack of big stars will probably keep this movie in the cult and art house circuit, because it's some of the best and most exciting film making- and rock and roll- I've encountered in years."

","Wow! What an amazing film!  It was so far superior than what I expected. Not knowing much about the history of Hedwig, so I went into the movie-watching experience with a near-perfectly clean slate, and was dazzled!<br/><br/>The boiled-down-to-near-nothing plot is about a transsexual (thanks to a botched sex change operation) from communist East Berlin comes to America, having married a GI, who is then dumped by her husband, returns to an old love of rock and roll, becoming a glam-rock singer, whose dreams of fame and fortune are thwarted by a song and fame-stealing ex-boyfriend.  But that's not even near the half of it.<br/><br/>Headlining a positively amazing soundtrack, the movie roared from start to finish, never letting the ball drop!  Stephen Trask's music and John Cameron Mitchell's delivery are an outstanding pair!<br/><br/>A++ for first-time director, John Cameron Mitchell!  The movie positively blew me away, and it seemed to do so effortlessly.<br/><br/>The mix of humor was great, and surprisingly enough, in a movie where glam is key, subtlety was not lost, and the wit remained razor-sharp.  As for the more serious side of the story, the sadness and heartache are presented beautifully without being melodramatic and soggy, in fact, quite the opposite.<br/><br/>This is best movie I've seen in ages!!  What a refreshing change from the overdone, mega-production budget films.  ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" proves that the art of film-making is not lost.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie, and will watch it again and again."

","... for a wonderful adaptation of the stage show. I was a bit nervous when I heard Hedwig was going to be a film, though I felt better when I heard John Cameron Mitchell was going to direct as well as star. I can understand why: this is far too original a vision to trust to others, especially when it comes to film.<br/><br/>Suffice to say, Mitchell (and Stephen Trask and Miriam Shor and everyone else involved) didn't let us down. Where the stage show was stripped-down and raw the film is a visual feast, which makes me think Mitchell has an innate understanding of how to use his mediums. The story is a better harder to follow in the film, but the pay-off is equal to the show. They kept all of Trask's remarkable music (the variety of styles is mostly amazing for how well it all works) from the show, with the exception of ""The Long Grift.""<br/><br/>
Don't be scared off by the off-beat subject matter. This is a brilliant, funny, sad, and ultimately transcendent story; for all her seeming oddity, Hedwig is one the most essentially human characters you will ever see in a film. As Mitchell himself once said, ""Hedwig is for everybody.""<br/><br/>
Look for the ""Wig in a Box"" and ""Wicked Little Town (Tommy)/Midnight Radio"" sequences. Beautiful.<br/><br/>Oh, and Emily Hubley did a great job on the animations.<br/><br/>10/10, of course."

","""Hedwig"" kicks ass!  Plain and simple as that.  ""Rocky Horror"" may be considered a classic, but this movie is far more superior.<br/><br/>
Now, sure, one will obviously compare this to ""Rocky Horror"", but other than being about transexuals and being a musical, that is where the comparisons end.  While ""Rocky Horror"" is more a campy musical made with overt silliness, ""Hedwig"" is more intelligent, especially because the songs echo the story line(similar to ""Cabaret"") but more obviously.  And what can be said about the main star, John Cameron Mitchell, who not only directed and adapted this movie to the screen, but magnificently plays Hedwig.  And let me me completely honest:  the music rocks.  It not only acknowledges its glam rock roots (which Rocky horror did not), but does a bang up job in its performance (just listen to ""The Angry Inch"" song and don't tell me you want to rock!).  And while I will not go into the depth of the story (I think most of the reviews here will tell you enough), I will say that Hedwig has more class, style and integrity than David Bowie anyday (and I admire Bowie, though I'm NOT a fan).<br/><br/>Just watch the movie!  It rocks!<br/><br/>P.S.  If you are easily offended by talk of transexual operations (no scenes, thankfully), homosexual foreplay (although it isn't really homosexual if you think about it), and dressing in drag, I suggest you don't watch this film."

"FeverDog","10","0","2","30 December 2001"," My latest obsession.
","I'm not about to spoil the pleasures of this magnificent experience by reciting the plot, so all I'll say is that Hedwig and the Angry Inch explores themes of retribution, gender identity, and finding love within oneself.<br/><br/>Some have compared it to The Rocky Horror Picture Show - unfairly, since when that cult musical is seen outside the craziness surrounding it, it's a pretty mediocre movie.  HATAI does share RHPS's flair for rock excess and roots in cult theatre, so if you've ever gotten a kick out of RHPS, prepare yourself for treat.  (If not, please seek therapy, or Rush Hour 2 at your local Blockbuster.)<br/><br/>HATAI is based on the Off-Broadway musical by John Cameron Mitchell, who triumphs here in his lead cinematic debut (for which he's been deservingly nominated for a Golden Globe) while also directing and co-scripting.  The movie, simply, is a knockout, filled with fabulous eye candy and kickass musical numbers; it bursts with a visual and aural splendor that mainstream Hollywood rarely attempts.  Its structure is a marvelous blend of live rock performances, flashbacks, singalongs, animation, humor and drama. Seamlessly edited, it's easy (and delightful!) to follow the storyline despite all the changes in timeframe, style, tempo and emotion.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about Hedwig and the Angry Inch without revealing one bit of plot, but I think you get the picture.  It's nothing like Almost Famous (my favorite film of 2000), but what they do have in common is what neither feature:  Violence, explosions, guns, hatred, immorality, heartlessness, nihilism, apathy.  While I don't believe it's appropriate for children, bright teenagers will find nothing objectionable; its R rating is due to its mature themes, (infrequent) profanity, and brief nudity.<br/><br/>Go rent it.  (Better yet, purchase the DVD for its abundant special features, one of which clarifies the relationship between two of the characters.)

","A couple of nights ago I saw John Cameron Mitchell's screen version of his off-Broadway hit ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"". It is one of the great movie experiences in this lackluster year of film. This year... it seems like nothing but sequels. Likewise, there are very few independent and foreign films I have happened to be satisfied with as well. HATAI is the first film to come out this year that I've been completely satisfied with. Interestingly, I came into the theater expecting some kind of rock music parody a la Spinal Tap. What I got was much, much more. Not only is HATAI a fun movie to watch, I think is does a great job dealing with themes like self discovery and finding wholeness within oneself. That's why the Berlin Wall plays such an important role throughout this film. The music is incredibly effective and well done. In fact, at the screening I attended, many people were singing along with the songs during the film. I really think that the music will leave just as big of a lasting impression on some audiences as the movie itself. Nevertheless, a lot of people will be scratching their heads when they see the ending. Personally, I was quite satisfied with it because it doesn't reduce Hedwig's arch-rival (Tommy Gnosis) to some kind of nemesis. Rather, in one stunning sequence in the film we see how both are similar to each other. I hope everyone on the IMDB gets at a chance to see this smart, innovative film. I appreciated it greatly."

","I was talking with my mother last night, trying to explain to her the film I had just seen; the conversation went something like this:<br/><br/>Me:  `So I saw this great film last night about an East German drag queen who had a botched sex change operation who's touring the U.S. by way of chains of Old Time Country Buffet-like restaurants with her rock band.'<br/><br/>Mother:  (loooooong pause) an East German what?<br/><br/>Me: `Drag Queenwell not exactly a drag queen since there's been surgery involvedsoan East German transsexual, or transgenderwaitwhat's' the difference between a transsexual and a transgender?'<br/><br/>Mother: `is that the beginning of a joke?'<br/><br/>Me: `Nojust hard keeping all those `trans' people straightha hastraightI made a joke'<br/><br/>Mother: ` (nervous laughter)welllet me get your father he wants to say hi.'<br/><br/>And so it goes with trying to explain this film. Adapted from Mitchell's Off-Broadway hit glam musical, Hedwig (if you stop trying to figure out which trans type Hedwig is) is a rocking, hysterical and touching film. John Cameron Mitchell is an absolute riot and the viewer gets to see the history of Hedwig through song, through flashback and through very creative uses of animation. What other film this summer encourages viewers to sing `I put on my make-up, turn on the 8 Track, I'm taking the wig down off the shelf' along with a Chanel laden Drag Queen? The scenes of Hedwig (in full Farrah Fawcett mode) rockin' out angrily about her `Angry Inch' (which is what was left of you know what after the ill-fated sex change attempt) amongst the blue hairs, blue collars and sneeze guards at the Eat-n-Park are priceless. But this drag queen isn't all just Estée Lauder powder and glitter red lipstick; she's got heart and so does the film, which is, at its core, a love story.  A majority of the film is singing, but unlike the Phil Collinsesque-Disney-musical-coma-inducing-sappy-assed-generic-soundtracks, the music in Hedwig is gritty, emotional and highly charged. So, in a summer of flat movies, with no plots and the most insipid bunch of over paid morons sleeping thought their parts, Hedwig and her band rock the end of summer back to life. Not one for the kiddies (go ahead, try to explain it to them), that's for certain. But also for certain, Hedwig is bigger than the velociraptors, prettier than Ben Affleck and badder than the apes."

Dancer in the Dark was the first modern musical that captivated me, but that had a non-musical plot. Hedwig and the Angry Inch is a full blown rock opera adapted from a NYC play for the screen, the movie is a mixture of fantastic animation, catchy music, bordering-on-genius lyrics, and a diverse cast that maintains your attention without apparent effort.  The story of a german asexual transvestite and his cast of unique bandmates, their lives, their music (and the famous rock star that stole it to become famous), and their personal growth in coming to terms with their personal desires.  Hedwig has a voice in both speaking and singing that is mesmerizing.  The movie is very colorful, unique, fresh and all around amazing.  My only dislikes about this film were at some points, it was a little too artsy -- leaving the audience to understand what it meant rather than helping them to understand (the main reason I don't like a lot of performance art) which in and of itself is not bad (art is interpretive, I know) but some of these items seemed essential to following the plot.  You don't get lost, but you aren't quite at the finish line either.  This, however, does not make the movie unwatchable by any means.

Hedwig's lifestory unfolds in just the right measure, stringing the captive audience along till he bares all in the film's fadeout.<br/><br/>If there's an inch of regret about HEDWIG it is that the storyline is somewhat thin and the characters never really emotionally engage us to the point of joy or tears - it all adds up to a triumph of style over substance.

","It's incredible how many tough feats John Cameron Mitchell and crew have pulled off beautifully in this film! Firstly, it's never wreaks of being an ""adapted from stage"" movie;  ""Hedwig"" is a fully realized cinematic project told in ways that only a film could. Mitchell doesn't settle for traditional A-to-B-to-C storytelling.  Instead, he uses sometimes ingenious camerawork and styles to bring the story and characters to life. As a musical, ""Hedwig"" rocks. The songs are first-rate and critically important to the story and mood. Making it all come to life is John Cameron Mitchell's incredible performance.  In the club/restaurant scene, when Hedwig is performing live for an audience, Mitchell just about jumps off the screen.  Elvis never worked as hard in ALL of his movies combined as he does in one song.  And he SELLS the songs;  you can not take your eyes off of him.  In the non-singing scenes, he also shines.  Never do you feel you're watching an actor doing the usual drag queen impression. Hedwig is a totally real, convincing transgendered woman--free from the cliched sassy, finger-snapping behavior crossdressers usually have in films.  That's why we care about Hedwig, and that may be Mitchell's most important achievement.  He gives a break-out performance that must not be overlooked when the awards season comes around!"

Like tearing down the Berlin wall, the wall between male and female is torn down in this gender bender. And we actually are in Kansas now -- at least part of the time.<br/><br/>There is some interesting symbolism about finding your other half or true self and reaching the edge of self-awareness. If you deny yourself, you doom yourself. Yet, at the same time, you must be powerless in order to avoid the corruption which power brings. And, all the while, God is a micromanager of knowledge.

","So someone mentioned to me the other day that they adapted the play ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" into a film. I've seen both and I'm just here to say that every one should see this film for one person and one person only. Not just for the music, and not just for the laughs. Go see this film for Mary Krohnert.<br/><br/>In fact, look beyond the role that she plays in this film and discover the wonder and delight that is her. Then cast her in many more film roles. Find it in your heart that she deserves to be the next Franka Potente. Do it for the kids who will love her, and want to be her. Do it for the future Maxim photo shoots. Do it for the American dream. Make this Canadian gal the star she deserves to be.<br/><br/>If you don't...i will...<br/><br/>You have been warned."

","I have just come back from my third viewing of Hedwig, and I seriously dig this movie! I still got chills at the end and felt as moved as I did the first time I saw it. I think Hewdig gives validation to so many struggles, The Rock Band Struggle, the Drag Queen struggle, the Trannie Struggle, the struggle of love, the struggle of making it in a world that tells you to f**k off all the time. Hedwig is (to me) about not giving up. Believing when nobody else does, and accepting what is and moving on. John Cameron Mitchell is a hero, a magnificent writer and a 'Diva' to behold."
"nibbly","Null","0","1","20 August 2001"," Hedwig ROCKS!!!
","Exuberant, hypnotic film adaptation of John Cameron Mitchell's off-Broadway rock musical.  This movie dazzles and rocks the audience with vivid production design and pumpin' songs by John Cameron Mitchell and collaborator Stephen Trask.<br/><br/>Mitchell gives an absolutely powerhouse performance in the role he originated, as Hedwig, the transsexual would be rock star.  Through beautifully staged musical numbers and flashbacks, the film tells the story of Hedwig's origins in East Berlin as Hansel.  As a young man, Hansel meets Luther, an American G.I. (I think!).  Before Luther and Hansel can leave E. Berlin and move to America, Hansel must undergo a sex change procedure, with the encouragement of  his mother, ensuring safe passage to America as a military wife.  Problems arise when the doctor selected to perform the operation f***s it up royally, leaving Hansel with a one-inch nub of flesh in place of what is supposed to be there!  Now Hedwig, she and Luther relocate to Kansas, whereupon Luther leaves Hedwig for a younger, cuter boy toy.  Heartbroken, Hedwig resuscitates her dormant singing passion and forms an amateur rock band.  Hedwig and the band begin performing in seedy restaurants and pubs, where Hedwig soon meets her muse, Tommy, a troubled adolescent and wannabe rock star himself.  Taking the young man under her wing, Hedwig and Tommy begin to compose music and develop their act (and, ultimately, more than their act).  Unfortunately, more problems arise for Hedwig when Tommy steals the songs and establishes himself as a major teen-idol-like rock star, leaving Hedwig's career to rot in the shitter. Now, tailing Tommy on his US tour, Hedwig resumes the divey restaurant-pub circuit and relays her tragic story to divey patrons, whilst Tommy plays huge arenas.<br/><br/>Mitchell directs his story with remarkable skill and obvious passion, even more surprising still considering he's a first-time director.  The performance sequences are staged much like an MTV music-video, only better. Scenes pop out at the captivated viewer with color, sound and imagination. Special notice should go to the animated sequences which are an inspired touch and really illustrate the emotional fault line Hedwig teeters on.  At some points, this film was reminiscent of ""Pink Floyd: The Wall"" in that it utilizes music to tell its story, employs the would-be rock star as a protagonist, and brilliantly uses animation to further convey thoughts and feelings to the audience.<br/><br/>As a performer, Mitchell is magnetic.  He doesn't so much play Hedwig as INHABITS her.  His passion for the character and the material is plainly apparent, and his devotion to his creation is clear and admirable.  One of those performances from an actor where I've never seen him in anything before, but right now I feel like going to the video store and renting everything he's ever been in!  Truly astonishing!!  Every emotion, every feeling registers clearly with the viewer through Mitchell's expressions and gut-wrenching vocals.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast acts with style and energy, especially Miriam Shor as Yitzhak, Hedwig's bandmate/lover.  But the movie, as well as the play , belongs to Mitchell.  One should definitely expect more great things to come from this exceptionally talented and forceful performer."

","Let down by mediocre film adaptations of Theater Musicals? Well, then Hedwig will surely change your mind about the genre. From the costumes and makeup to it's overly-dramatized portrayal of dreams gone bad, this film delivers entertainment at it's best. A stylish production entrenched in Glam Rock roots, this film obviously pays tribute and homage to David Bowie, and all gender-bending pioneers so closely linked to early punk and rock. The cinematographic artwork, animation, and direction flawlessly accentuate Hedwig's wit, music and melodrama.<br/><br/>Cameron's performance is stellar and I must admit that they make him look quite attractive as a woman. This is not your ""run of the mill"" drag queen flick: Priscilla, Queen of the Desert...move over!"

","I must admit, when I first started to hear buzz about Hedwig, I had no desire to see it. O how wrong can one person be. This movie has taught me so much, especialy about friendships. I can not say enough good things about this movie, It is a must see for everyone. John C. Mitchell has taken his place along side the few others on my short list of heros. If you have a friend who has been your mentor in any way, you have to see this movie; it will make you realize how lucky you are to have that person."
"lsimenson","9","0","1","16 August 2001"," Hedwig Transcends...
","As many of you may have, I heard my first bit of Hedwig buzz out of Sundance where the film was honored multiple times including the Audience Choice award for best film.  I had the opportunity to view the Sundance awards show aired live from the Eccles Center in Park City on the Sundance Channel.  In receiving the award for best director for the film ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"", John Cameron Mitchell didn't appear outwardly to have a very powerful presence.  This may have been due to shock or discomfort with the praise, but Mitchell wasn't striking or thoughtful in his acceptance.  I went into the local art film house with this impression of the writer/director/lead actor of ""Hedwig"" on my mind.<br/><br/>To say Hedwig was funny would be an understatement.  To say the script was insightful, delivered what appeared to be somewhat independently of its off-Broadway birth, would be grossly misrepresentative.  To say the performance of Hedwig by Mitchell was strong, would be like saying ""Schindler's List"" was moving.  My first impression of John Cameron Mitchell was intensely wrong, as first impressions tend to be, and my premeditated intent on seeing ""Hedwig"" to smash the generally over-hyped Sundance film reputation was in vain.<br/><br/>Mitchell delivers a genuinely deep character from the opening lines.  One who is openly cynical about, but indebted to, his past.  One who's wisdom comes from the very parts of her psychological past and geographical history.  Born from the belly of East Berlin in pre-unified Germany, Hedwig leaves her unwitting country after a botched sex change operation that was conceived from her will to find the Americana that so enraptured her youth as a boy.  Married to an American soldier in Germany, she leaves to settle in the center of the United States to be a trailer-wife to, and soon to be abandoned by, her new American husband just before the wall fell in Berlin. Her life is sent into a haze as she forces herself to make her way with ""babysitting gigs"" and various other recreation.  Her life is only perpetuated by her talent in music, where she excels as both performer and writer.  And soon this German's strangely American life meets its center when she finds true love in a young man who becomes her greatest enemy in the movie's present.<br/><br/>In this insightful, truthful, painful look at humanity, we jump between American-past and German-past, Present and future, success and struggle, and even live-action and animation.  The themes are not so buried in what some might consider a ""homosexual film"", and in fact, Hedwig's true identity as either a male or female, gay or straight, doesn't resonate as a theme at all but merely plot.  The themes and values of the film are in its understanding of the human condition and how even at the extremes of that condition, the drama of our lives does not differ so greatly as we may think.  Love, friendship, loyalty, betrayal, self-discovery, self-hatred, excess, comedy, drama, laughter and tears are Hedwig's life; they are our life.  And in the center of the film's focus, Hedwig cries to her love interest, Tommy Gnosis, ""Love the front of me!""  Perhaps the transcendence of that desire is the heart of the human comedy.<br/><br/>As I said, most of what can be told of this film will be an understatement. But in my attempt to shed light on the brilliance of this film, I can bid you one sentence.  Mitchell's performance of his screenplay so thoughtful and innovative in its direction is what Webster's dictionary defines as ""perfect""."

","When I first heard of ""Hedwig,"" I thought nothing of it, discounting it as yet another flash-in-the-pan way-too-politically-correct flick that would be so neo-liberalist-fascist that afterwards I would feel dirty for being a heterosexual.<br/><br/>Then I saw the trailers, and realized (at the time) the movie was merely a joke, a parody, if you will, of the likes of a Millenial ""Rocky Horror Picture Show."" Then, I really just gave up and began renting movies like I've been doing for the past few months.<br/><br/>A pal of mine saw the film, thankfully, and informed me that in fact the movie was terrific and nothing like what the previews would make you think. So, I gave it a try, and it was AMAZING. Definitely one of the best movies of the year (which isn't saying much these days, but it really was something special).<br/><br/>Mitchell's performance was humorous, depressing, saddening, frightening, and simply marvelous. He played the entire spectrum, and to think he did all that whilst directing and writing? Wow. And I was incredibly impressed how well the cinematic tendencies in the film worked out, seeing as it was based on a simple Off-Broadway show. Every scene was precise and effecient with some of the most clever bridges between scenes I've witnessed in some time.<br/><br/>It's abundantly clear that Mitchell and his ragtag band of crew members are sure to be forerunners in the revolution to bringing cinema and art in America back to the experimental and innovative stylings of the Golden Era in film (the late 1960's-early 1970's, of course).<br/><br/>The rest of the cast was terrific, especially newcomer Michael Pitt who I also thought was fantastic in Larry Clark's ""Bully."" <br/><br/>As said by some of the other commenters, I don't even particullarly enjoy musicals, but this was just... well, nothing really could describe it.<br/><br/>
See it."

","An Oscar worthy indie film, one of the greatest alternative musicals in film history. Based on the stage play of the same title, the story follows the life of Hansel; who adopts his mothers' name Hedwig following a botched sex-change operation in order to escape the musically and sexually repressed East German state. Hedwig follows his/her life in search of love, finding only disappointment and betrayal, from an American GI to her protege Tommy Gnosis.<br/><br/>In the search for love, Hedwig finds not only its' origin, but its' destination as well. Steven Trask gives the film its' soul in his musical compositions as well as lending his voice to the character of Tommy Gnosis. John Cameron Mitchell directed and stars as Hedwig showing a range of talent that it is hoped will be displayed in future stage and film work. Miriam Shor shines as backup vocalist Yitzhak. Finally, Andrea Martin gives a performance that backs up her standing as one of the great comedians of our time.<br/><br/>All four of these performers deserve Oscar consideration one of the truly innovative film musicals of recent memory. Certainly the songs ""Wicked Little Town"" and ""The Origin of Love"" should be considered for Best Song. This film isn't for everyone, and does have its uneven moments. The ending may leave you scratching your head, but is ultimately satisfying with reflection. See it twice and add it to your video library when it's available. You won't soon forget this film!"

Not much point giving details of the movie. I knew almost  nothing about it before seeing it, and I'm glad for that. I will say that it's a rock-and-roll movie and except for _Help_ I've never really liked any of them but in this case the music was incredible, the lyrics were perfect and it all supported the themes under the story. You can't miss this one, and though this film may not absolutely require it, try to see it in a good theater."

And I didn't expect to enjoy this film. But half way through found my self cheering as the lead character angrily sang about his botched sex change operation to an angry and violent crowd.

","San Francisco got it's premiere of this smashing film last April at the 44th SF International Film Festival, sell out at the Castro with an appearance by John Cameron Mitchell, on his birthday yet. A month later, at the Gay & Lesbian Film Fest, yet another screening. So opening night of Hedwig and the Angry Inch, last Friday, should have been no big whoop, Except someone had the bright idea to make it a party. <br/><br/>Calling upon local Glam Rock band (and SF Weekly Wammie Winner) Blue Period to bring a bit of their own Club Glitz to the Landmark Embarcadero Theaters for two live sets of the real thing. Nicely covering signature song from the film, `Angry Inch,' lead singer Adrian Roberts could have passed for John Cameron Mitchell's evil twin wearing a blond wig. <br/><br/>For the glitter and the glamour the other regular feature of Club Glitz was the Instant Glamour Booth set up in the theater lobby providing hair and make up to the needy. This was all part of the costume contest, graciously judged by the band. Costume? What costume? We dress like this everyday! Guests also received Gift bags stuffed with Hedwig Postcards, a sing-along book of lyrics, a candy necklace with matching bracelet, but sadly no MAC glitter lipstick as rumored.<br/><br/>The party was fabulicious.

"Mr Pants","10","0","1","23 July 2001"," The musical is not dead after all
","This film (and its stage predecessor) do what few musicals have been able to accomplish: make itself hip without being smarmy or oversentimental. When you think about people you know who openly express their love of 'musical theatre', these are usually not your hippest friends. Most musicals come from the same well that brought us Rosie O'Donnel's brand of entertainment (it is not wholly ironic that Ms. O'Donnel makes an appearance in the film). Most recently, Baz Luhrmann brought us ""Moulin Rouge"" which tries so hard to be a hip musical it decides to distance itself from its own musical aspects. The inclusion of pop songs in 1900 french backdrop comes off as an attempt to capture the earnestness of musicals with none of the responsibility that should be attendant. The effect is not so much hipness as it is questions to whole notion of why Luhrmann bothered to make a musical at all, if he could not commit to its basic aspects.<br/><br/>Enter this version of ""Hedwig"", and the hollowness of ""Moulin Rouge"" becomes apparent. In this film, we have great songs with smart lyrics that unfold the narrative on several levels at once. They act as exposition, foreshadowing, transitions between segments, exclamation, etc. And they, of course, rock. Compare this to the fleeting novelty of having Ewan Macgregor in period costume sing Elton John's ""Your Song"" to Nicole Kidman. Sure it was cute for a minute, but who could be so cynical as to assume an audience would put up with that for an entire film? Well, maybe they did put up with it, but they shouldn't have. <br/><br/>I only hope more people see ""Hedwig"" to see what a movie musical can be. My only fear is that John Cameron Mitchell and Steven Trask won't continue to produce at this level for stage and screen."
