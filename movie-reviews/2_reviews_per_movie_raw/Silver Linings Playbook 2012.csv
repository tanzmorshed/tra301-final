"AdultAudienceMember","9","931","1094","29 December 2012"," Stunningly accurate look at the bipolar life.
","I am bi-polar. I have been that way since I was a young man. I am approaching 60. I have been in treatment for many years. There have been relapses and time spent in hospitals. There have been good times. Before I received good treated, I left a trail of emotional, professional, and relational disaster behind me. It broke apart the lives of others as much as it did my own.<br/><br/>I did not know what to expect from this movie. It is a stunningly accurate trip into the mind of a BP sufferer. It shows the disease from the outside, too. It is amazing in its accuracy. The mood swings, the detachment from reality, the failure to learn from past errors are there. Here is a guy who has so messed up he is in the hospital. He is released into the custody of his parents. He improves himself physically yet cannot see what he has done, what he is now, and what the future portends with any sort of reality.<br/><br/>There are other situations in the film which mirror the BP life. There are job losses, broken relationships, unlimited optimism, anger, and a feeling that no one understands you. But he doesn't even understand himself. He thinks he is the only sane person around. He is in complete denial yet goes along with treatment just to get along with others.<br/><br/>The obsession with his estranged wife drives him. Everything he does is to make himself look desirable to her.<br/><br/>Then there is the hair trigger and the propensity toward violence which ultimately put him into the hospital. He has the belief that he sees with much more clarity than anyone else. There is also the hatred of medications and the belief that he doesn't need them.<br/><br/>Yet, there is hope. There is no miraculous cure. There is a negotiated peace between his illness and the way he must be to survive in the world.<br/><br/>The only thing I felt was missing was the crushing depression. But I understand that. Depression makes for lousy movies. The film is strictly about a manic life that wants to be better but cannot accept that he is badly off dead center normal.<br/><br/>If you are bi-polar and under control, see this film! If you live with or deal with a BP, see this movie. If you are untreated, you won't get it because BP clouds the mind.<br/><br/>My new wife and I went to see it. Up front I told her that I had this mental illness. She still married me. She is a health care worker with an understanding of illness and of treatment. After the film she asked me what I thought.<br/><br/>I told her that I was a bit frightened to tell her that the portrayal is spot on and that I had seen all of it before.<br/><br/>But like all bipolar sufferers, I wanted her to know that ""I was never that bad."" The truth is, I was....but we BP people don't handle reality all that well."

","Greetings again from the darkness. The film is exactly what you would expect from a screwball romantic comedy steeped in drama based on bipolar disorder, depression, OCD, Philadelphia Eagles fanatics, a ballroom dancing contest, adultery, Hemingway, and a lead character who jogs while wearing a trash bag. Maybe not exactly what you would expect, but more likely much more.<br/><br/>If you were told instead that the story is based on two damaged souls who help heal each other through dancing, you would have every reason to skip this one. However, as written and directed by David O Russell (The Fighter) and based on Matthew Quick's novel, this story is a frenetic, emotional roller coaster ride that provides a glimmer of hope for the two damaged lead characters, while reminding that each of us may be a bit off-center in some way. Now add in the best young actress working today (Jennifer Lawrence just turned 22), a rare performance from Robert DeNiro where he seems fully engaged, a pulling back the curtain on Bradley Cooper as much more than a pretty face, and one of the best and most precise soundtracks in recent history ... now you have one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>What you notice very early on is that what could be considered a trite story line, is instead pounding you with sharp, witty dialogue that pulls no punches in directness. The many aspects of family and emotional support are given time thanks to Pat (Bradley Cooper) being released after 8 months in a mental institution. He was sent there when he snapped after finding his wife in a compromising position with another man. Perfectly understandable if you ask me, but clearly he is the explosive one despite his claims to the contrary. An uncomfortable dinner party introduces him to Tiffany (Ms. Lawrence) whose husband has recently died and her coping skills have been shared with most of those in her workplace. This odd couple spark immediately and the wild ride begins.<br/><br/>Pat's wife Nikki (Brea Bee) has issued a restraining order and Pat's strategy to win her back involves a positive attitude and maintaining control of his emotions. His supporters include his mother (Jacki Weaver, who was so great in Animal Kingdom), his OCD father (DeNiro) who so wants to re-connect with his son, his friend (John Ortiz) whose own marriage (to icy Julia Stiles) is a messy mess, his buddy from the asylum (a funny and not over the top Chris Tucker), and of course, Tiffany. The only real problem is that each of these supporters are teetering in their own way just like Pat.<br/><br/>The brilliance of this movie is the balance struck between the near violent emotional outbursts and the sharp, exacting words spouted by each of the characters. Director Russell once again shows his flair for working class northeasterners. He understands these tough as nails people who wear their emotions on their sleeves. These people are as likely to punch you as hug you ... and both are acts of love.<br/><br/>The soundtrack deserves special mention. It is very unique and varied, with each song serving an exact purpose. Especially keen are Stevie Wonder's ""My Cherie Amour"", Led Zeppelin's ""What is and What Should Be"", and ""The Girl from the North Country"" a Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash duet. When the music strikes a harmony with the scene, the movie is all the stronger. Rarely do we get the perfect storm of script, direction, acting, music and relevance."
"cummingsjosh7","8","218","316","1 November 2012"," Silver Linings Playbook is a refreshing addition to the rom com genre
","While most romantic comedies usually contain bad acting, sappiness, and a large amount of predictable moments; Silver Linings Playbook is the exact opposite. There may be a little amount sappiness in this movie but there is bound to be some in any romantic situations. In reality though, all of the sap in Silver Linings Playbook can be overlooked due to the fact that the film is completely original, extremely funny, and contains outstanding acting from the two lead roles.<br/><br/>Written and directed by David O. Russell (The Fighter), Silver Linings Playbook is about a man, played by Bradley Cooper (Limitless, The Hangover), who was just released from an eight month stint in a psychiatric hospital. He wants to get his life back on track but is being held back by his parents and his unstable condition. After a little while, he strikes up an interesting friendship with a female played by Jennifer Lawrence (Winter's Bone, The Hunger Games). Both of these characters are going through somewhat of the same type of problems which makes their friendship even more quirky and thought-provoking.<br/><br/>Because a large amount of romantic comedies are stale and overdone, Silver Linings Playbook is a breath of fresh air. Usually movies in this genre follow a very particular road map that entails: man is at rock bottom but then finds the perfect girl. After a while, man loses girl and must win girl back in a very cliché and unrealistic fashion. What's original about Silver Linings Playbook is that it doesn't follow that mediocre story line in the slightest making it unpredictable but at the same time, more relateable. Chris Tucker is in this movie and even he isn't predictable. Chris Tucker, the loud-mouthed actor who hasn't been in a film without the words 'Rush Hour' in the title for almost 15 years, was surprisingly mellow. Even though he was mellow, he was still very comedic and played a great role in the film.<br/><br/>The most surprising aspect of Silver Linings Playbook, however, was the performance of Bradley Cooper. Even though this is a comedy, Cooper plays what is maybe one of the most serious roles he's ever performed. After audience members witness his work in this film, there shouldn't be any more doubt if the man can act or not. Silver Linings Playbook is without a doubt Cooper's best work thus far in his career. Jennifer Lawrence has a performance of equal caliber but that is expected from the young Academy Award nominated actress. What was surprising about Lawrence's role in the movie, was how adult it was. Fans of Lawrence's work may have been worried that she would be stuck in teenage roles after playing the character Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games, but she should silence those doubts after this film with a very adult, yet professional, performance.<br/><br/>Silver Linings Playbook is full of creativity and minimal on romance clichés. It is hands down one of the best romantic comedies to be made within the last couple of years. This film contains many laugh out loud moments and a number of scenes that will warm your heart to the point where you can't help but leave the theater smiling. Silver Linings Playbook is the perfect date movie that both men and women can easily enjoy. A-"
"Nuss","10","261","388","18 November 2012"," So very much more than meets the eye
","At first glance, you would think this movie would be just another generic Katherine Heiglesque rom-com that dominates the box office and empties your soul. But classifying it as such is like saying Jaws was a nice little fishing movie. It's so very much more and what makes it all the more wonderful is that it comes as such a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>I mean, seriously, who would have thought that Bradley Cooper could convey such angst and heartache? Or that De Niro still had a great performance in him after a decade of caricaturing his old self? And Jennifer Lawrence - just wow. There's so much more to say but best to just let you experience it for yourself.<br/><br/>Watch - this movie's rep will build through terrific word-of-mouth and it'll end up as a modern day classic. This is why you go see movies in the first place."
"meggz3","10","314","489","23 October 2012"," Most Enjoyable Film of 2012 So Far
","I don't even know where to begin when it comes to this film. First of all, I think it's about time I profess my love for David O'Russell because he keeps making movies that I simply can't get enough of. If there's one thing I've learned this year when it comes to movies, it's find a director you love and follow him or her blindly. There's styles you'll love, and styles you'll hate, find the ones you click with and never let go.<br/><br/>Silver Linings Playbook has generated a lot of hype since its worldwide premiere at TIFF, and frankly, as far as I'm concerned, it deserves all the praise its received. It is by far the best film I saw at the festival, and is easily one of the most memorable films of 2012. Based on the novel by Matthew Quick, Silver Linings follows the life of Pat (Bradley Cooper) as he moves back into his parents' house after spending months in a mental institution because of a violent outburst that occurred after he found his wife with another man. The movie follows Pat as he attempts to get back his life back, but he meets a new challenge as Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence, who is completely girl crush worthy) finds his way into his life.<br/><br/>I honestly can't remember the last time I enjoyed a movie more from beginning to end. O'Russell brilliantly tells a heartwarming, yet complicated and hilarious tale, that leaves you on the edge of the seat. The cast is wonderful, and all deserving of nominations in the 2012 award season. If people didn't know of Jennifer Lawrence before, they will now. She's quirky, complicated, hilarious, and you really just can't get enough of her. DeNiro also delivers a strong performance as Cooper's Philadelphia Eagle's loving, somewhat OCD father.<br/><br/>If there is one movie worth seeing this year, it's Silver Linings Playbook. The story may follow a family in a very serious situation, but we can all identity with the truth and emotions that comes with struggling through times. It's a story that's easy to connect with, and it's a film that will make you smile from beginning to end. Catch this movie when it comes out in November, and I promise you, you won't regret it.<br/><br/>For more Reviews Check out."
"brighteyes53085","10","343","546","9 October 2012"," Incredible, incredible, incredible!
","I saw this at the Hamptons International Film Festival as the Spotlight film and it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is so relatable, even if you don't suffer from the same afflictions as the main characters, and its implications are so far-reaching that everyone, I believe, can learn a little something from Pat and Tiffany. The story sends such wonderful messages about finding the ""silver lining"" and is uplifting, even in the seemingly most dire circumstances. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are phenomenal, and I found myself really attached to their characters. This is a must see for everyone! And I will be seeing it again when it hits theaters in November."
"jdesando","Null","135","213","16 November 2012"," It's a platinum lining, not just silver.
","""I'm remaking myself."" Pat (Bradley Cooper)<br/><br/>Silver Linings Playbook doesn't play by the current romantic comedy book—No scatology, nudity, f-bombing, or feminist and gay bashing. It's simply a smart playbook about the mental institution's recently-released Pat Solitano (Cooper, shedding his Hangover boy-man shtick), who may be saner than his dad, an OCD gambler (Robert De Niro), and Bradley's new friend, Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence).<br/><br/>But that comparison is all relative because director David O. Russell (remember his funky family in Flirting with Disaster?) allows each character in this dramedy to become whole and interesting without becoming marginalized. <br/><br/>After some serious outbursts of anger, Pat starts training for a dance competition with Tiffany in order to make contact with and eventually impress his estranged wife, Nikki (Brea Bee).<br/><br/>The eventualities of the story are not half as stimulating as the plot along the way, some of the best scenes centered around the family squabbling about the Philadelphia Eagles or Pat's relationship with that ""slut,"" Tiffany. When Pat confronts his parents at 4 AM about the deficiency of Hemingway's ending to A Farewell to Arms and when Russell places under another scene Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash singing Girl from the North Country, you know you're in a film that follows no particular playbook.<br/><br/>The dynamics as fostered by these superior actors are some of the best ensemble work this year. In fact, this is so far the best of the romantic comedies in recent memory. Pat and Tiffany may be bi-polar, but they can dance the stars into your eyes. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence plays so different a character from those in Winter's Bone and Hunger Games that it may take you a scene or two to recognize her. But when she dances, you'll confirm she's one of the best young actresses in Hollywood, and this film one of the best of the year."
"gerngoestocollege","3","113","182","21 December 2012"," Where was the playbook?
","I wanted to like this movie, I really did. I had read about the plot and its depiction of mental health issues and I was hoping to see a wonderfully nuanced movie with people fighting to get well. Instead, this movie was clichéd and clumsy. It was a movie without direction, it had no playbook.<br/><br/>I'm going to assume that the book has more depth than the director cared to give the characters and that this is just a really poor adaptation to film. The characters are so incredibly flat and one dimensional and not at all a good representation of people with mental health issues. In fact, I think some damage was done here as not all depressed people get manic and destroy things at the drop of a hat or run out and sleep with a bunch of people. They're not all at odds with their doctors. There were just so many bad generalizations in this movie about the mentally ill I can't even list them all. The entire premise makes no sense. Why would you even set two people up who are at those points in their lives? It would be reckless to set up a woman still binging on sex with a man who was obsessed with his wife. I could go on and on. The entire story just didn't work. At all.<br/><br/>Aside from the script the film craft was one of the worst I've seen this year! I counted about 5 gaffs in the movie before it was even halfway through. These were not small gaffs but obvious things you'll notice and I'm not sure how the editor missed. In addition to that, the movie just didn't flow well either. The running scenes looking staged and lifeless. He wears a trash bag to work up sweat...but never seems to sweat. He was supposed to be out of shape, but is definitely not out of shape when they show flashbacks. So many gaffs.<br/><br/>I'm guessing people were just voting this movie highly because of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are attractive together. Their performances are OK, but the movie falls apart so thoroughly around them that it's unimaginable why anyone would enjoy this film."
"pjamok-692-397387","1","440","757","18 January 2013"," I have NO Idea why this movie is getting such hype....
","So, the acting in this film is excellent and that's why the one star. Other than that, this is a hot mess of a movie in terms of any sense of reality, common sense, and human behavior.<br/><br/>It makes is appear that bipolar is pretty much curable if a person meets the right hot girl and takes meds for a short time. And don't worry if the other crazy guy from the mental institution comes to visit as he's not really all that crazy, and the audience never figures out why he's there or what happens to him in the end.<br/><br/>Apparently anyone can enter a professional dance competition, regardless of ability or training, and book making is a viable job option for the unemployed. When a person gets out of the institution, he or she is apparently assigned their own personal police officer who just happens to show up day or night, kind of like a personal on-call bodyguard. Oh, and having a cra-cra dad who obviously passed his mental issues on to his son but isn't called on it at all is just part of the insanity that makes up this ridiculous movie. But, hey, if a person dances long enough their mental issues go away and all is well.<br/><br/>I'll be shaking my head for a long time as I cannot believe how this movie is getting the press and reviews I've seen. Excellent actors in a beyond stupid screenplay. Complete waste of time and money."
"woinaroschy_1979","5","60","94","15 January 2013"," After a great beginning, the silver lining gets lost in Hollywood happy ending
","After a great beginning, describing pretty realistically the condition of a person with a mental disorder (in this case bipolar), the movie fails completely in the last 30 minutes, where the main character suddenly gets over his obsessions and finds true love, his family wins a lot of money and his friends manage to solve their emotional and mental problems in order to celebrate the happy-ever-after couple.<br/><br/>Personally I felt downright cheated and insulted by the cheesy ending. But the worst part is that many viewers will really believe that it is that simple to overcome a serious psychological illness (not only bipolar, but also like anxiety, depression, burn-out, OCD etc), and hence the movie is actually doing a disservice to anyone in this condition.In order to arrive at the happy ending described in the movie (which of course I wish to anyone going through such an ordeal), a huge effort, courage, support, treatment, discipline and time is needed in real life and I am sorry to say it does not happen by taking a bit of dancing lessons and reading a letter. <br/><br/>Conclusion: good start, after which they throw a bucket of pink confetti over the two broken (now mended) main characters to make the audience feel good."
"orangeisthenewawesome","2","148","247","10 December 2012"," Maybe I am missing something?
","I really wanted to LOVE this movie, as I rarely get out to watch movies so I am very selective about the ones I will go watch. I love both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence and the reviews have been so overwhelmingly positive I was sure I couldn't lose!<br/><br/>To me, this film is a typical clichéd rom com with some mental illness and character twists thrown in. Boy meets girl, boy and girl pretend to just be friends for a while, boy and girl get thrown into a situation where they have intense prolonged contact, boy and girl fall in love and end up together. YAWN. THIS is what is getting so much hype? <br/><br/>I found Bradley Cooper to be magnetic and intense. Great work. I have enjoyed him since his small role in Wedding Crashers and thought he was just superb in Limitless. He is the best part of this movie. The guy is super talented! <br/><br/>I really was not that impressed with the other performances despite the fact I thought I should be. To be fair, no one stunk it up or ruined the movie. But I thought anyone could have played the other roles. I like Jennifer Lawrence but I didn't think she was that great in this. I thought the parents were played well but again, I didn't think De Niro was that special in this. <br/><br/>I'm not really sure I'd recommend this. I'd probably either wait for DVD or even cable. It's OK."
"f_mino12","6","104","171","16 January 2013"," So confused as to what about this movie is so amazing
","This is my 1st review because I had to say something about this movie just to warn others about it since there are so many 10 star reviews. I sincerely do not understand what it is the academy saw in this movie to nominate it for 8... EIGHT Oscars! Are they paying them to nominate the movie?? 1. Bradley Cooper is not convincing as a bipolar patient. When I look at him all I can think of is his character from The Hangover or that he was voted Sexiest Man Alive. 2. Jennifer Lawrence is becoming one of my favorite ladies in Hollywood but she definitely was cast wrong for this part also. She is mean and unlikable and overacts the entire time. Just a lot of yelling and stomping around. 3. The entire movie they just bicker and huff and puff. They aren't cute until the very end and then the movie just ends. 4. There were so many football references and talking over one another that my ears started to hurt. The scenes would drag on with just arguing. 5. The plot was very bland so you aren't really rooting for anyone or excited about what is going to happen next. The script must have been a piece of cake to write because there really isn't anything groundbreaking here. There are hundreds of mental patient movies."
"pcleary99","3","96","158","12 January 2013"," OMG, This was bad
","Just got back from theater with my wife and had to write.. My top genre is rom coms and i can enjoy the lamest and most predictable, but this is a real stinker. I can't believe people clapped at the end, morons. Other negative posts are right on editing, poor story line with weak motivations, but the killer for me was ZERO chemistry between Lawrence and Cooper. This movie never figured out what it wanted to be: comedy, quirky love story, family healing story, concern for the mentally or emotionally ill, Benny and Joon? I think they never figured it out or planned well so they threw it all in. <br/><br/>All the actors did a good enough job but the support really let the movie down. I connected with the movie on 3 scenes only, the best being when the parlay deal is cut. Shame on Danny Elfman for the music, Led Zeppelin's ""What Is and What Should Never Be"" for that scene? Really? All in all I was ready to leave after about 40 minutes, but my wife lukewarmly enjoyed it so I had to stay. The word ""Oscar"" should not appear in the same sentence with the title of this movie as I see no one associated with it doing that level of quality work. Pathetic."
"bigmystery23","10","203","349","21 October 2012"," Sooooooooooo good
","I was fortunate enough to make it into the Austin Film Festival screening of this film, and my god it was worth the wait. David O. Russel has outdone himself with this beautiful portrayal of a dysfunctional family searching for a way to come together. Bradley Cooper has won me finally with his odd and hilarious character. Jennifer Lawrence is dashing as ever with the hysterical role of Tiffany, a depressed woman trying to find a way out of her issues. This whole film has powerhouse performances, a laugh-out-loud script with heart, and a way to get the audience attached to its likable characters. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, and you are sure to see this as Osacr buzz."
"Erik-Dahlin","5","82","134","12 January 2013"," Life doesn't work like that!
","First of all I want to say I really wanted to like this movie. I know it's a romantic comedy and it's not my favorite thing to watch but it has its moments. The trailer of this movie made me really want to watch it, a story about two depressed people whom meet up. As a person who has been depressed and suicidal for a large part my life this movie seemed like something that could bring up the frustration of being depressed and mentally ill. But was it? No, not at all. It made it a silly and meaningless plot point and it dumbed down feeling mentally ill to a small thing that doesn't matter and everyone can get over it in easy if they just want to. <br/><br/>The movie begins great, the main character is being released from the mental institution. He wants nothing else than to get back together with his wife. He isn't sick he is functioning on a good level and hasn't realised that it is over. No one tries to have a sit down with him and tell him straight out that it's over. If they had done that this whole movie would have been done. They treat him like a five year old that no one wants to correct! And then there is the female main character, she is weird in fun way so it makes people laugh, but is it? No, her character is stupid. No one talks like this in the real world! Who wrote this dialogue? It's horrible, it's written by someone that have watched too many romantic movies and seriously believe just having a small thing in common makes them the best damn couple ever!<br/><br/>The main character's sickness is like a funny joke. I wanted some emotions, I could just think how much I hated him. He has one small breakdown and nothing else. 5 minutes is what sets up his whole character. If they hadn't said that in the beginning of the movie I would have never noticed. I would just think he was heart broken and wanted to get back together with his wife. No emotions at all! That is suppose to be the movie, struggling with emotions and mental sickness! Not having a god damn dance contest and at the end he declares his love for the girl! It was obvious it would happen that was not the problem, it's a romantic movie what did I expect? But they are not building up to it. ""Oh, I have been obsessed with my wife this whole time but when I saw her I realised I didn't care about her, I care about you that I haven't shown any emotions to before!"" Give me some emotions for god's sake, who the wrote this piece of garbage!? And the stupid plot point of having a big ass bet that the whole family relied on being a big deal and they are trying to push it like it's a big risk and no one knows what is going to happen, but we all know! This movie is so obvious with everything! I understand it's obvious, it's a romantic comedy. But give me a great journey and story of how/why they end up together! Give me some emotions between the choice of choosing between the wife and the new girl. It just happens in this movie it just does, whit no explanation to why/how he made the decision. The whole movie end with that if you get a girlfriend ALL of your troubles will go away and EVERYTHING will be perfect, LIFE DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT! This movie was made by people who has never had any emotional illness at all and that shows.<br/><br/>The movie is either average or horrible. The acting is average nothing really bad and nothing good. The dialogue is horrible, no person in real life would talk like this! The plot is interesting but the execution is horrible, they butchered the plot, no tension or struggle at all and it just flows in a bad way with a absolutely breath taking dumb ending. It had so much potential. The reason some romantic movies are good is because they the character needs to go through something emotional or make a hard decision in their lives. But nothing like that happens, the plot points just happens. I am maybe repeating myself here a lot but it really REALLY bothers me. How could this movie get Oscars nominated? When movies like Cloud Atlas or the great Joss Whedon gets left out completely. <br/><br/>My final thoughts are: it could have been something great, a movie to be seen as the great romantic movie of this decade but it failed so hard in the writing and directing it is just horrible to watch."
"plinko2004","1","140","237","1 February 2013"," Overrated, offensive, disturbing. Does not deserve to be in the same sentence as ""Oscar.""
","Over the past week I believed I had seen the most overrated film currently frontrunning the Oscars this year after viewing ""Zero Dark Thirty."" And then I discovered this abomination.<br/><br/>There is little to nothing to comment on regarding this film's script or story because when it is boiled down to its roots, it is a trite, cliché bore that has been done many, many times before and far better.<br/><br/>So what makes this movie not a complete copy of many films before it? This film contains a horrific depiction of mental illness that objectifies human beings as caricatures. Cooper's character, who is supposedly the film's primary protagonist, is portrayed in such a disturbing way that an uninformed viewer could not be blamed for thinking that those who are bipolar - a very real illness with very real, good people who suffer from it - are all miserable, violent people who obsess over others to the point of stalking them. His 'character' is then propped up and 'fleshed out' through a collection of tired tropes typically seen in Hollywood's voyeuristic, disrespectful portrayals of those with mental illness.<br/><br/>Avoid this sickening film at all costs, especially if you are someone who suffers from mental illness or are related to someone who does. It handles its subject matter in a way that will disturb you to the point of tears before the movie is even over."

The sheer chaos of the dialog and filming was enough to make me physically ill to watch (my wife couldn't even sit through the entire film).<br/><br/>There was a thin story line with Cooper being obsessed with getting back together with his wife after leaving mental health care, but this story was both unbelievable and uncomfortable! She has taken out a restraining order on Cooper (Pat) and yet the police officer who comes to each scene seems to do nothing and leave with no real purpose in the story. <br/><br/>If you are looking to see a movie with lighthearted humor and great acting (as we are led to believe by the trailer and reviews) the AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! 1 out of 10 for the dancing."

","One star because zero stars isn't an option, nor is a black hole icon. I should know better than to dis this film, as most films I hate only draw comments from idiots. But for the sheer pleasure of it, I'll say this: I hated the writing, the acting (especially deNiro, who has been doing this same role for at least ten years and has apparently abandoned the use of his talent, and his wife-character), the characters themselves, the directing, the cinematography, the casting, the scenic design and the overall conception - where a ""silver lining"" is imposed on the story rather than grows out of it. I didn't find a single scene emotionally believable, felt the script demeaned mental illness, thought the film pandered to blacks, sports, dancing-with-the-stars fans, Philly itself, endorsed gambling, rewarded incredible stupidity and risk-taking (deNiro's character is willing to throw away his entire family's future based on nothing other than an idiotic hunch by a sexpot) while the film pretends to endorse other ""moral"" life choices, thought the entire film depended on ""cute"" writing and cliché (where plot is a substitute for canned laughter), and that it was predictable after the first ten minutes. By the way, the audience I was with, maybe 50 people, didn't laugh that much. What's not to hate? Over many years I've learned that many people often think something is funny if someone else tells them it's supposed to be. I'm not one. Now go ahead and trash me if you like. But if I can keep one person from seeing it I'll have done my duty. And if one other IMDb reader has the guts to agree with me: brother, (or sister) - welcome to the real world!"

","Based on a novel by Matthew Quick, David O Russell has both written and directed this variation on the romantic comedy in which both main characters are deeply damaged and variably medicated.<br/><br/>Patrick used to be a teacher before he beat up a fellow teacher (he deserved it) and was diagnosed as bi-polar and confined to a mental institution for eight months. Tiffany used to be married to a cop who died in circumstances for which she feels blame and she has not been behaving as quietly and demurely as is expected of the newly bereaved. Both lead roles are played by attractive and talented young actors: Bradley Cooper (""The Hangover"") and Jennifer Lawrence (""The Hunger Games"") and, by the time I caught up with the movie on DVD, Lawrence had been awarded a deserved Academy Award for Best Actress for this quirky performance.<br/><br/>One of the distinctive features of this wonderful film is that most of the characters are obsessive to one extent and in one form or another, most notably Pat's father who is charmingly portrayed by veteran Robert de Niro. At turns funny and poignant, this is at heart a plea for us to be tolerant of others because - let's face it - we're all a little crazy."
"nolandalla","2","69","115","23 January 2013"," Absurd, Troubling, Grossly Overrated Movie
","How do I find a bookie like the idiot played by Robert De Niro, who co- stars in the surprise hit movie Silver Linings Playbook?<br/><br/>Seriously, he's got to be the dumbest bookmaker on the planet. Any real bookie who followed his habits would soon be at an intersection holding up a cardboard sign.<br/><br/>Silver Linings Playbook is unquestionably the most overrated film of the year. How this two-hour bore garnered a whopping eight Oscar nominations isn't so much a testament to this movie's excellence, but rather what a terrible past year this has been for cinema.<br/><br/>The Bradley Cooper character meets the Jennifer Lawrence character at a dinner party and the rest of the movie is pretty much the story of the interplay between the two leads. They spend most of the time fighting and insulting each other, sometimes viciously. But none of this seems to matter. We all know what's going to happen just before the final credits roll.<br/><br/>But predictability is the least of this mess of a movie's numerous problems. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the story is Cooper's obsession with reuniting with his estranged wife. Remember, this man spent eight months locked up behind bars in a mental ward for committing a violent crime. Now, he's free on probation and his sole mission in life to to get back with the ex.<br/><br/>Trouble is, his wife has issued a restraining order against Cooper. That means he's not allowed to visit or call or contact her in any way. Despite this, Cooper ignores the law and goes to great lengths to go after what he wants. Sure. Nothing proves a man's true love like acting the part of a stalker.<br/><br/>For some reason I found baffling, many people seemed to find this endless pursuit to be an endearing quality -- including women. There were plenty of laughs as Cooper tries to establish some sort of contact with his ex, including visiting her place of employment. How charming! I guess being a wacko stalker is okay if you look like Bradley Cooper and were voted 2011's Sexist Man Alive.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in South Philadelphia. Accordingly, we're subjected to all the typical stereotypes you'd expect. The only thing missing was Burt Young as the uncle walking in the door with a sack of sausages.<br/><br/>There are a few nice moments, which were usually tied to the catchy soundtrack. And it's okay to dream and believe in fairly tales. But that doesn't mask the reality that relationships take work. They require sacrifice and commitment from both sides. Yet, we're led to believe that once the boy gets the girl, they'll leave happily ever after. Never mind that they've been screaming at each other for 90 minutes during the entire movie, and haven't agreed on anything. They have virtually nothing in common. Neither has a job or it would seem, much of a future. So, what's going to happen the first time Mrs. Lawrence tells Mr. Cooper to take out the trash? Or, leave the toilet seat down? Is Cooper going to go ballistic again like he did with his first wife?<br/><br/>So, let's get back to that idiot bookie. Remember -- Robert De Niro plays the dad. He lost his job some time ago, so he turned to bookmaking to support his family. Fair enough.<br/><br/>Trouble is, there's not one thing in this movie the least bit convincing he actually works as a bookmaker. On Sundays, the phone never rings. He never has a notebook at his side. Where are all his customers? He never once discusses games or point spreads, other than those involving his beloved Philadelphia Eagles when he's in action. In fact, De Niro is so sickly obsessed with the Eagles, he watches them religiously -- completely oblivious to games one which his livelihood depends. One might think that a bookie based in Philadelphia might have a rooting interest in Eagles' games, and if so -- he's likely want the other side to win (and cover) since most amateur locals tend to bet on their favorite team. But there's De Niro, the ultimate sap.<br/><br/>That said, the most laughable part of the movie comes near the end. I won't give away the final outcome. But De Niro essentially gambles his entire life savings on a single football game. Who does he bet on? You guessed it -- the Philadelphia Eagles.<br/><br/>A few scenes later, De Niro is back at it again. This time, he wants to bet a parlay. He learns that the line on the upcoming Philadelphia- Dallas game is ""Eagles -1."" De Niro wants to bet on his beloved Eagles so badly, that he offers his business partner and fellow bookie a preposterous wager. He says ""I'll give you Dallas plus ten points! The Eagles must win by ten!""<br/><br/>On a game lined at ""-1?""<br/><br/>This clown is a bookie?<br/><br/>How can I get in touch with this joker?<br/><br/>To be fair, I saw this movie in Las Vegas -- where sports gambling in commonplace. But the De Niro segment of the movie was so absurd and annoying, that I heard a few catcalls and even some uncontrolled laughter. Not good.<br/><br/>It's a bad sign when the most memorable thing about a movie are its flaws. But alas, those are pretty much the only parts of the film that kept me interested in what was an instantly forgettable and utterly disappointing film.<br/><br/>Silver Linings Playbook has about as much entertainment value as a losing sports book ticket."

","Thought I would enjoy this film, unfortunately I didn't. You could see from a mile away that the main character was going to end up with the other women(yawn, seen this in other films). It was too long, well it felt like it for a 2 hr film, it kind of dragged on and on, and was hoping for the end to arrive. Deniro has done better work than this, Jacki weaver was good, and deserves the Oscar nom for her role, as for Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, there was NO chemistry between the 2 leads, I thought His character was going to end up with his wife(ex-wife in the film), would of been interesting if they had of gone this way instead of the predictable outcome.

","Dancing with PTSD<br/><br/>The Hollywood solution to mental problems. And WOW about everybody in this movie has mental problems. And that is probably the only thing I found realistic in this film.<br/><br/>The rest is so filled with clichés. First of all the two lead characters are super good looking. What else do you expect? We cannot have average looking people afflicted with bipolar or depressive disorders, can we?<br/><br/>And while in the real world people who have been diagnosed with bipolar and have been committed to a mental institution have a hard time to keep friends, the guy in this movie still has the support from everybody,but his ex-wife and her lover. Another astounding thing is that a lot of the main characters are out of work and seem to exist without problems. The answer may be that the father (De Niro) has turned bookie after losing his job. And I have to admit that I know so little about betting that the whole segment about the bet eluded me. I also have never been to a football stadium or watched a game (I guess, it was football) and after seeing the scenes at the stadium I certainly never will. <br/><br/>Now we get to the part where dancing becomes the therapy. While I completely agree that physical activity is very important in coping with mental challenges, I seriously doubt that somebody without any dance experience can enter a competition, again, I am not familiar with these kind of competitions, but after what they showed it was not a segment of ""So you think you can dance"", where anybody gets a go. The dance scenes reminded me of that unfortunately also Oscar nominated movie ""Black Swan"" where the camera only showed the dancer waving her arms because she obviously was not a trained ballet dancer, and in this movie the dance scenes are so chopped that you get no idea what the girl wanted to achieve with her choreography. And then of course we have the typical Hollywood ending . Everybody is happy and boy gets girl, and daddy wins his bet and gets his diner and they live happily ever after screaming at each other. Because as Dr. Phil always likes to point out , you can always judge a person by his past behavior. I have no idea why this movie got all the nominations, but that is not the first time, that I am clueless."

","Sorry to bring the joy down people, but I've been wasting my time for the last 2 hours... When you watch the trailer, you do know what to except of the basic story, the funny/weird romance, etc... what you don't know is how slow & weak the action & dialogs take place. It is so painful to see good actors led to play in such a disastrous direction. Main characters seem to play a caricature of a mentally ill person like ""cuckoo's nest"" basic redux, poor deniro seems to be stuck in the role of the good old grumpy/lovely dad/step dad for the last decade now. Actors are plainly hysterical, going in circle for the whole movie. I couldn't relate, not one bit. When you go to tragi-comedy genre, you expect to get emotionally involved, I was clinging to my seat after an hour trying to figure out if i had to laugh cry or just get out of the room... The staging & editing is extremely weird but not in the good sense. I wont mention about the American sport community thing, though it made them look all the more pathetic (ok i just mentioned it).

"rebeccal-espinosa","5","45","75","31 December 2012"," Story too close to home!
","I hesitated seeing this movie because it dealt with mental illness, particularly bi-polar disorder. We have an adult son with this disorder. Unfortunately, our son doesn't work and can't afford any treatment so I don't see a happy ending for him. Other than one explosive scene (something we see daily at our home), the movie treated this mental illness with kid gloves. The two main characters were portrayed as refreshingly quirky. In real life, outsiders do not even want to be around a person who is bi-polar. Perhaps medication would make people like our son ""manageable,"" but as is often the case, people with this disorder can't hold down a job and don't have a safety net to fall back on. Medication is unattainable and don't even think about a residential treatment program. I came out of this movie feeling very sad that our son, whom we love very much, can't have a chance at normalcy. The movie just wrapped up the situation in a pretty bow and the couple headed off to their happily ever after. The movie wasn't funny enough to be a comedy and wasn't deep or realistic enough to be a drama. It just put a glossy surface over a very real, very challenging illness."
"MartinHafer","9","34","55","26 January 2013"," Although the ending was awfully formulaic, the overall package is just terrific.
","The Oscars are still a few weeks away, so at this point I have no idea which awards, if any, this film will receive. I also cannot really say which ones it SHOULD receive, as I still have quite a few movies to see that were also nominated for the big awards. But I can say that the two leads were just terrific and I loved how unconventional most of the film was. I seem to have heard a lot more about how great Jennifer Lawrence was in the film--and she was AMAZING. However, I can't understand why I haven't heard at least as much about Bradley Cooper--his performance as a really screwy guy was quite convincing.<br/><br/>The movie starts off in a mental hospital. It seems that Cooper's character was forced to go there because of SOMETHING he did--and eventually you learn that he nearly killed his wife and the man with who she was having an affair. And, based on what happened to him, you really COULD understand the man snapping like this. But, he also is mentally ill and desperately in need of professional help. His behaviors are consistent with a Bipolar Disorder with LOTS of Obsessive-Compulsive traits...LOTS. Despite it begin very clear that his marriage is over (the wife not only cheated on him but has a restraining order out on him), he lives in a delusional world where if he only gives it time, everything will work out perfectly. It obviously won't but he's too sick and stubborn to admit it.<br/><br/>Into this screwed up little world comes a woman almost as screwy as him. Jennifer Lawrence plays a young lady whose husband was killed tragically--and her coping skills totally suck. She uses sex to deaden her pain and she is also mentally ill. Together, these two screwed up people will somehow work through these issues. I liked this. But what made the movie lose a point was the ending. The subplot involving the bet and the magical way everything worked out at the end seemed to give way to formula--which is a shame, as up until then, the film was great because it was NOT formulaic. Still, the film is terrific from start to finish and I wouldn't be surprised if at least one of the leads wins the award as well as the film taking home top honors. Well worth seeing. And, well worth seeing for Robert De Niro's exciting supporting performance--it showed some depth that you don't normally see from him."

This scene really went wrong and there seemed nothing to do about it, but close my eyes and look away. The movie really collapsed there. The remaining of the movie was exceptionally predictable. I even got the jury-score right. Afterwards I couldn't think of any reason for this movie to be made except making money. The 8 here/92% (!) on rotten must be on a scale from 0 to 100/1000.

"gavin6942","7","13","19","21 January 2013"," A Glorified Romantic Comedy
","After a stint in a mental institution, former teacher Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) moves back in with his parents and tries to reconcile with his ex-wife. Things get more challenging when Pat meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a mysterious girl with problems of her own.<br/><br/>I hate to be the guy who comes along and talks bad about a film that is sitting in the IMDb Top 250 and is drowning in Oscar nominations, but I simply cannot understand the buzz around this picture. Is it funny? Yes, it is. Is it romantic? I suppose it could be. Is it enjoyable? Sure. But what does it offer for anyone who wants substance in their films? Not much.<br/><br/>The big problem is that the film starts off having you think it will be about mental illness, or a man coping with mental illness. And for the first third of the film, that is more or less what we get. Unfortunately, by the time we are a third of the way in, Pat is mysteriously ""cured"". While he still has an obsession with reuniting with his wife, he no longer has outbursts or does erratic things and if he is bi-polar there is no way we as the audience could know.<br/><br/>This cover story of mental illness (which would have made a good film), poorly disguises the actual plot: a romantic comedy that follows the tired, well-worn story of a man who is attracted to one woman while unknowingly falling for the woman he is with, who he foolishly thinks is only his friend. If the audience thinks, after meeting Tiffany, that Pat is going to end up with his wife rather than Tiffany, they are naive. (Heck, even that would have made a good twist, albeit a small one.) <br/><br/>Somehow Cooper is nominated, despite not really acting after the mental illness part. He is no Michael Shannon. For most of the film, he is simply Bradley Cooper playing Bradley Cooper. Jennifer Lawrence is more deserving (she already took the Golden Globe), as she actually tries to appear unstable. And despite being a mess and with a bad sexual history, she still manages to be somewhat likable... somewhat like Holly Golightly (but not at all like Julia Roberts) perhaps? The trend of casting a female lead 16 years the male lead's junior persists, but Lawrence can play older than she is, and while this is not on the level of her performance in ""Winter's Bone"", she definitely is on a winning streak.<br/><br/>The subplot with Pat Senior (Robert DeNiro) is pretty awful. We have an old Italian-American falling into the stereotypical role of bookmaker. And who do they cast? DeNiro, who has already been typecast as the mobster. How he was nominated is beyond me, as this is even further down his slide into irrelevancy. This was more the DeNiro of ""Meet the Fockers"" than ""Raging Bull"", and he has to be aware that any nomination is done out of respect more than from actually earning it. When Pat Senior winds in a parlay situation where he needs to win both a football game and dance contest, we know exactly how that is going to play out... this is, after all, a fantasy world where nothing bad can happen to our protagonists, no matter how tarnished their lives may be.<br/><br/>I know I am in the minority for opposing this film. But seriously, despite being fun and cute, what does it have going for it? It made every attempt it could to avoid any real conflict, never seriously trying to tackle family issues, mental illness, gambling addiction or anything else... an opportunity squandered."
"tpolakov-2","6","8","11","22 March 2015"," Arbitrary behaviours
","I got hooked by the good reviews on IMDb. When the credits started rolling, my first thought was - is that it ? During the whole movie I was waiting for a clue, for some twist that would explain the nonsensical behaviours of most characters. Like - he killed his wife, or there was no wife at all... But all we got was an inaudible whisper into Nikki's ear, who shows no emotion during her whole appearance on the screen. OK, I get the mood swings from a supposedly bipolar Pat. I sort of get the obsessions of the father as well. But it seems everyone else is suffering from some kind of a disorder that in itself may be credible, but the in this limited space and time just seems completely arbitrary and forced. So my basic problem is believing in what poses as realistic portrayal."
"reev0","2","144","295","18 November 2012"," Disappointing and irritating
","Critical reaction and user reviews seem to be hugely positive. Let me offer up one dissenting voice. I thought this was virtually unwatchable and would have walked out if I had been seeing it alone. The theme of the film is that most of its characters are mentally ill, or at least damaged, to one extent or another. Unfortunately, this manifests in the form of characters angrily shouting at each other. This extends to about 75% of scenes in the film, at far too great a length, without any wit or craft. None of the major characters is remotely likable. This would be fine if the film was a serious depiction of mental illness. It sits very uncomfortably with a contrived, implausible romcom plot, largely free of originality or surprises. But sadly the romcom element does not extend to more than the occasional funny moment. Jennifer Lawrence is fairly good and the other performances are OK, but the film has nothing else to recommend it. By far the worst film I've seen for over a year."
"hsteddom-580-533187","2","74","147","12 January 2013"," Poor representation of bipolar disorder
","As soon as I heard the characters pronounce the drug Trazodone incorrectly twice near the beginning of the film, I knew this wasn't going to be an accurate portrayal of someone with bipolar disorder.<br/><br/>The two supposed ""mental cases"" didn't exhibit any unique traits that would pin them as bipolar or unipolar or psychotic or...anything. Also, was this supposed to be a romantic-comedy or a drama or a film about ballroom dancing and overcoming odds? What the hell was it? While I thought the acting was fine I was shocked that some consider it Oscar worthy! DeNiro was excellent but everyone else - just average.<br/><br/>Lastly, I would think the producers/directors would do some background research on mental illness before releasing a film like this. For one, find out how psychotropic medications are pronounced and what they are used for and find out the behaviors of a person suffering from bipolar disorder. I realize this wasn't a documentary on the subject but with a hefty production budget, can't you get the basics right?"
"ms_otis_regrets","2","24","42","16 February 2013"," Storytelling on lithium; flat and foggy
","(Warning: review contains Australian spelling as well as spoilers.)<br/><br/>Hyped as a story about mental illness, this movie somehow turns into a predictable tale about quirky, two-dimensional characters whose good looks, deployed to make ordinary people sympathetic to their struggles, instead make them easy to watch but difficult to relate to. In spite of the good intentions of the film-makers, the delusions and dilemmas of the leads remain picturesque rather than compelling, and the irrational behaviour of the supporting characters robs their struggles of any urgency. If Pat Sr. (De Niro) is willing to risk everything for no discernible reason, why should the audience care if he loses it? Instead, the increasingly high stakes, with dad literally betting his livelihood, come across as an attempt by the film-makers, anticipating the boredom of viewers, to increase emotional intensity at the expense of sense or understanding. <br/><br/>As you'll know from seeing the film or every other review, the film starts with Pat (Cooper) leaving a locked mental health facility to return to his parent's home. After he violently assaulted his wife's lover, his marriage has broken down and his wife, who he also works with, has taken out a restraining order against him, so he is jobless as well as single and homeless. He fixes on getting his wife back as the solution to all his problems. Pat is offered help in the form of a dinner party invitation, where he is set-up with Tiffany (Lawrence) the sister of his friend's wife, who shares with him a history of taking mood stabilisers and also happens to be a friend of his ex. Recently widowed, Tiffany takes a shine to Pat, and after he initially rebuffs her advances, she manipulates him into becoming her partner for a dance competition in order to win him over. Meanwhile, Pat Sr. is convinced Pat is the good luck charm for the football team they support, and on which he's placed a large wager that, as mentioned before, expands to include his savings for his dream business. Quel surprise! The big game and the dance competition are scheduled at the same time. <br/><br/>As the film proceeds, complications like the ever-expanding wager are stacked on top of one another in a way that betrays the failure of the film to express the real difficulties, and the dreams, of people dealing with depression, bi-polar disorder, or other mental illnesses. Somehow, in all this mess, Pat Sr and mom Dolores manage to link dad's gambling to his belief in his son and family solidarity. I'm all for making happy endings and providing good role models, but where in this story is the reality of diagnosis being followed by desertion? It stretches credibility for a family who has, apparently, contributed to the mental illness of a son by failing to support him to suddenly risk everything just to give the same son a bit of a confidence boost. <br/><br/>The dance scene provides the one moment of real emotion in the film, a genuine laugh based on the risk we all take in exposing our vulnerabilities to one another, but it's quickly lost in the fast-paced but unsurprising conclusion. I AM surprised, however, at the acting nominations this film received; in the absence of a clear sense of real emotional investment, many of the key scenes in the film depend on shouting to create an illusion of strong feeling; this is especially true of De Niro's performance, which is a disappointment for viewers who expect more from an actor of his experience. Lawrence and Kher, who plays the doctor, offset this trend with some nice dead-pan deliveries, and Cooper is at his best when he follows their lead. There are also some rare instances in his performance where Cooper's confusion allows viewers to momentarily share a flash of insight into the times when all of us realise our behaviour and perceptions are harming us or those we love. These moments, like the humour and pathos in the dancing scene, are unfortunately lost in the avalanche of plot movements, along with the message of the film. It's as if director Russell, in a laudable but misguided attempt to reach the broadest audience with his message, has tried to please everyone by packing in a bit of everything. Afraid women won't watch? Put in a hunky male lead and some dancing. Afraid men won't watch? Put in some football and revealing dance costumes. Oh, and wait, it's all a bit white -- add a black friend and a Hindu doctor. The leads have to be white, of course, and straight and middle-class, so we don't confuse their mental health problems with political ones. Then again, Tiffany (Lawrence) is being medicated for being widowed and promiscuous, but the medicalisation of gender and grief can be left to another discussion.<br/><br/>I'm not big on providing film reviews, but was moved to write this one for two reasons. First, both the film-makers and audience should expect more, especially from films purporting to address big issues, and the host of nominations and rave reviews received by this film need to be balanced by a little honest criticism. Second, the particular big issue addressed in this film, mental illness, deserves to be brought into real discussion rather than minimised by a neat, nice, feel-good movie sedative. <br/><br/>I gave this movie one star because it's not actually evil, and a second star because there are some things -- the good-looking cast, the afore-mentioned dance scene -- that work, it's just that they end up working against rather than for the film's message. Confusing and ultimately boring in spite, or because, of the artificially elevated stakes, this movie fails to provide any effective treatment for the mental, and social, ills it attempts to address."

","even if I'm not a football fan. This movie almost convinced me that I would've had a whole lot more fun on my couch with some stove-top popcorn watching some live action touchdowns than I had at the theatre gobsmacked by this menagerie of looney tunes fumbling towards a Hollywood happy ending at any and all cost. Try as I might, felt zero affinity for most of these characters. Though you couldn't find two better looking actors than Bradley Cooper as Pat and Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany, their characters were either too aggravatingly loud and/or lame to keep me interested or root for them. In short, I found the characterization of Pat's bipolar disorder and his family's (not to mention his analyst and the policemen's) response to be so benign and simplistic to the point of absurdity and as crafty as she is, I also couldn't bring myself to care for the underdog lovestruck (sex-starved?) Tiffany. I found her character a self-serving desperate ding-a-ling and worse, a predator in pursuit of somebody more vulnerable to fix. While I can appreciate that birds of a feather might flock together, these two do not a happy & balanced love match make, unless you have high hopes for sustainable joy between a codependent manipulator and and an emasculated romantic. Hmmm, on second thought... Anyway, such a shame the movie focused so heavily on these two sad sacks because the rest of the head cases were much more likable. Chris Tucker was a hoot and so were Pat's friends, Veronica and Ronnie. I wish, too, that I could've chuckled a little more because believe that some scenes were meant to really have us rolling in the aisles or smiling subversively... but alas, not so much. (Some of the more funny moments are featured in the trailer and even those weren't gut-busters, right?) Found myself checking my watch, time and again. (And this from someone who applauds many performances by the remarkable cast and does enjoy unconventional romcoms. I'd sooner recommend three other films which didn't garner half the hype but are far and away sharper, funnier, and more original: ""Eagle vs. Shark"", ""Happy Accidents"" and ""The Science of Sleep"".) Now, if this film does manage to make it to the Oscar playbook, it would be deplorable and affirmation anew that in Hollywood - as in life - all that's silver doesn't glitter."

","How this film has got such high reviews I do not know! This is a laughable attempt at depicting mental illness, Bradley coopers role as a person suffering from bipolar disorder is probably one of the worst representations of someone suffering from a mental health issue that I have ever seen. The film is so predictable that i didn't even finish watching it as i was so bored, but willing to bet that i can guess how it ended. Do not waste you time or money watching this film. This film actually makes me want to sue David o Russell for wasting 1.30 hrs of my life that I will never get back. (Notice it is only an hour and a half, this is because I gave up giving this film a chance to redeem itself after this period of time). I have seen some bad films in my life, and this one is now one of the top 10."

","I had high hopes for this movie but was very disappointed. If the issue of mental illness is supposed to be one of the central themes of the film, why couldn't the production staff figure out something simple such as the pronunciation of the drug Trazadone? The drug is not pronounced TRAY-ZO-DONE but TRAAZ-A-DONE. I would expect a large budget film to have some fact-checking in place.<br/><br/>Secondly, the mental illness theme was never fleshed out. The Bradley Cooper character appeared to have a temper but no real mental illness. Jennifer Lawrence was slightly quirky but no more unusual than a typical young adult.<br/><br/>Comning from a family with bipolar and unipolar depression and borderline personalities, I have an idea of what mental illness looks like and this was not it.<br/><br/>Lastly, the film was trying too hard to be too many things. Was it a romantic comedy or a drama or something else? Disappointing movie."
"bob the moo","Null","21","37","23 February 2013"," Solid performances but obvious direction and writing rob it of wit, intelligence and depth
","Beyond the nominations for Oscars, I hadn't really heard much about this film so I didn't have any preconceptions to speak of and came into it blind more or less. The film focuses on two characters who are each struggling with mental and/or emotional issues that manifest themselves in acting out violently or sexually. The two get together to work on a dance project which appears to help them deal with their issues to a point, however family pressures, emotional pressure, sports pressure and just generally life doesn't just go away.<br/><br/>Given the cast involved and the awards it is up for, the one thing I did expect was for the film to be better than it ultimately turned out to be. It has a certain charm to it but mostly the film disappoints by being so very straightforward and never going really going anywhere dark or deep. Considering the backgrounds (and presents) of the two lead characters, this film is roundly safe and accessible. The mental and emotional struggles of the characters don't seem so bad – just bad enough to justify them as plot devices but never bad enough or real enough to really be an issue that would challenge the viewer or even make them uncomfortable. It isn't that it is comic so much, just that it hasn't got much meat on it. This continues throughout the film before finally it gives up any pretence of being more than just romantic fluff with an ending which does at least represent honesty from the makers – this is the film they were making all along. This is not to say that it is without value – because it is a big film with a lot of talent that is aiming to be accessible entertainment, and it doesn't miss that mark – it is just disappointing that it was aiming for the target generally, not the bullseye.<br/><br/>The cast certainly deserve better than they got, although of course they are generally good enough to make the most of what they have. Cooper isn't someone who appeals to me much but he was solid here. Lawrence will probably get the Oscar here and, whether she deserves it or not, she is pretty good – everything asked of her she delivers which is why it is a shame that the film didn't ask for more. De Niro is enjoyable in his turn while there is decent support from others such as Tucker, Mihok, Stiles and a few others – nothing amazing, but solid. Nobody really shines though – but this is down to the material, not them. Russell as writer and director doesn't seem to have any spark, nothing really going on that stood out for me – it is professional, has some charm but mostly it was workmanlike.<br/><br/>This is how the whole film turns out in fact; it is good in specific moments but it really plays a nice safe line throughout – ignore the subject matter, it may sound dark and interesting but it is nothing of the sort. A safe film that is consistently accessible and easy on its way to a conclusion that is at least honest about the type of film it is – it will charm many with the ending but the majority of the film doesn't charm or challenge, it just ""is"", and I found that to be disappointing."

","Yes, the movie is well acted; certain scenes work very well; and the movie moves along at a nice clip...however - the film IS naive about bipolar disorder and mental illness; the film has strange things to say about women (does Tiffany need to be a ""slut""? Why? And Jennifer Lawrence is too young, the age difference glares between her and Bradley Cooper). Also, the ""feel goody"" aspects of the film don't work for me: it feeds the fantasies of fans (fanatics) around ""luck"". I personally was offended at the laughter in the theatre at unfunny situations that were sad and hurtful.<br/><br/>A big problem I have with this movie: re-imagine this movie with an ugly actor in the lead role. Let that sink in. We often feel differently towards people based on their looks, so casting a hunk becomes an issue.<br/><br/>The film has really good performances, and I would single out Jacki Weaver's mother - a woman who has put up with too much from the men in her life and has accepted the life that she has with these difficult men. It's De Niro's best performance in too many years to count. And Bradley Cooper has some nicely played scenes. I'm less happy with Ms. Lawrence's role, but that has to do with the writing and also the age difference (she's too young for this role).<br/><br/>This film is a decent solid film but it is being over-praised."

Walking out was out of the question because my wife would have been impossible to live with for days.

DeNiro is OK, I really liked Jacki Weavers performance but I believe Bradley Cooper was a bad casting choice. He is OK for parts like Hangover or the pretty boy in others. I also liked him in Limitless but he could not persuade me at the role of the crazy person.

"Playbahnosh","4","41","81","20 January 2013"," This is NOT how mental disorders work...
","I was so curious what makes this movie the most awesome rom-com in the entire world that re-defined the genre and whatnot, because this hype avalanche came rushing at me wherever I looked. So I caved and I decided to see it for myself. It wasn't the best idea...<br/><br/>I've dealt with mental disorders in the family and amongst friends, and even myself. I know that doesn't make me an expert and I don't claim to be one. I can only draw from my personal experience with this stuff, and according to that, this is NOT how it works. Not even close. This movie is just using all the correct narrative tools to FOOL you into believing this is how it supposed to work. No, mental disorders, bi-polars, schizophrenia, obsessions, psychotic episodes are NOT quirky or slapstick, and people screaming nonsensical BS at each other is NOT drama. Also, no, you cannot magically cure mental illness by dancing with an equally mentally screwed up girl. That's not how things in life work.<br/><br/>I have to say the acting is first class across the board. No complaints there, it's excellent. That's all the 4 stars up there. I believe the actors did the best they could with the screenplay they've been given. But sadly the screenplay is so far torn from all things realistic, that's what makes it hollow. It has some genuinely good moments, at some places I really saw something shining through, but then it immediately does something so stupid, so predictable, so clichéd, so movie-esque that destroyed all the immersion that's been built up.<br/><br/>I know that's not fair to criticize a movie for not being realistic, because it's a movie, it's not supposed to be, but in this case all the praise I see unleashed on Silver Linings Playbook is about how realistic it is with real emotions and a realistic depiction of mental disorders. No, it isn't! If you want to see a realistic depiction of mental illness, visit a mental ward at a hospital. Don't worry, it's free, you can visit any time you want. Getting in is not the hard part, but getting out...<br/><br/>Long story short, this is an average rom-com movie, with great acting and a good story layout that's been ultimately destroyed by Hollywood clichés. It's certainly not the bestest, awesomest, genre-defining, Oscar hogging masterpiece some people make it out to be. Also, if you haven't dealt with mental disorders in your life, don't believe this is how it looks like, because it doesn't. Thanks for reading."
"faterson","1","16","28","1 March 2013"," Extremely Boring and Trite No-Drama, No-Comedy Starring ""Married Creeps""
","There is one adjective that describes this movie sufficiently: immature. After I finished watching this failure of a movie (inexplicably nominated for, and winning, lots of awards, including an Oscar), I started exploring where the immaturity comes from. Yeah, Jennifer Lawrence was very young when filming this, only 21, but she's just an actress -- you can't blame her for the screenplay she had to adhere to. The director and screenwriter is a 50-ish guy, too. So, what's the answer? Ah yes, there it is: the original novel was a debut novel by Matthew Quick, released when the writer was just 32 years old. Oh Lord, but it shows. (An interesting tidbit is how old-fashioned the 2012-released movie seems in extolling the ""iPod"": right, only a few years later after the original story takes place in 2008, iPods seem rather behind-the-times compared to iPhones and iPads.) <br/><br/>The movie is not just immature, but chock-full with every Hollywood cliché you can think of. Some of the scenes and dialogues are so predictable they're likely to force tears out of your eyes -- but not those of laughter or of being moved by the story. And then you learn that the Hollywood studio had bought the rights to film the novel even before the novel was *released* -- does more need to be said? This is ""made-to-order"" Hollywood fare -- and as a result, it's just as trashy as one might expect it to be. You can almost see the story's creator ""listining"" to an imagined audience: ""What is it that the audience wants, what does it expect from me? Let's give it to the audience, then!"" This is the exact reversal of the approach chosen by truly great works of art, where the paramount intention is not to give the audience what *they* want, but to express, as faithfully as possible, the artist's vision: what the artist feels needs to be said or shown about life, in his or her particular story.<br/><br/>I failed to get interested in any of the main characters in the movie. One is a mentally unhinged, alleged substitute high-school history teacher -- yet as such, he does not hesitate to recite an urban legend on the origin of the acronym ""OK"". Any *real* history teacher -- tenured or not -- would be unlikely to do that. It rather seemed as if this was the story's author trying to establish the character's professional credentials, but committing a guffaw instead, because an urban legend, in fact, devalues the alleged credentials, instead of confirming them.<br/><br/>There are many sex addicts in the world, recovering or not. Sorry, but although Jennifer Lawrence is undoubtedly an attractive actress, I did not find the character played by her one bit interesting. She's messed up, but so are millions of other people around the world -- why should we be interested in *this particular* messed-up sex addict? The same goes for her male counterpart. OK, so his wife cheated on him, and he beat her lover up to a bloody pulp, which probably isn't what a totally sane person would do. But, so what? It's happened before around the world, countless times. Why should the audience be interested in *this particular* cuckolded husband? Only because Bradley Cooper happens to be a handsome actor? The movie provides no answer, and because the two main characters are so uninteresting, the movie revolving around them is just as boring as they are.<br/><br/>I was also disturbed by the needless profanity pervading the movie. I don't mind profanity if it's justified by a movie's action or story, but here it seemed as if it was today's ""expected standard"" by the (youngish) audience, and *that's why* all the profanity was put in, just to appear ""hip enough"" -- not because the story or the dialogues truly demanded it.<br/><br/>I love movies transcending the boundaries of genres: there's nothing more sublime than a movie that is *both* a great comedy *and* a great drama at the same time, in one package. *That's* true art of movie-making. Yet this does not apply to _Silver Linings Playbook_: in fact, it suffers from the exact opposite flaw, in that it's neither a comedy, nor a drama, but rather a failure in both of those departments. It seems to vacillate on the border between comedy and drama, undecided where to go -- but it's too shallow to be a good drama, and too trite and predictable to be really funny. There's really very little to laugh or even smile about in _Silver Linings Playbook_. Instead, we're treated to some painfully extended scenes *meant* to be funny, which however are not: see all the betting hysteria going on in Pat's household, led by an over-the-top Robert De Niro.<br/><br/>What's worse, the movie presumes to close with the same sort of grand finale featured in many classic romantic comedies: with the heroine running away, and (ideally) the hero catching up with her. Think of _Bridget Jones's Diary_, or _The Apartment_, or _Gone with the Wind_. Now I feel guilty to mention all those phenomenally successful romantic movies in the same paragraph with _Silver Linings Playbook_ -- because the classic, romantic ending just doesn't work in _Silver Linings Playbook_, and rings hollow.<br/><br/>If you're looking for the top tell-tale sign of the movie's immature, juvenile nature, just watch the scene with the main character, Pat, ranting about one of the finest novels ever written, Hemingway's _A Farewell to Arms_. Erm, sorry, I still don't understand the meaning or intention of that scene. Was it meant to be funny, in showing how nonsensical Pat's objections to Hemingway's plot (and ending) were? Well, it *wasn't* funny. Or -- which is even worse -- was the scene meant to be serious, reflecting that that's what the author of _Silver Linings Playbook_ really thought about _A Farewell to Arms_? If so, you can't get any more immature than that."

Not okay, not good, not even close to great.<br/><br/>SLP is alright.<br/><br/>And I find this extremely disappointing. The plot holes, the oddly dull characters, and the plodding narrative add up to a unsatisfying movie.<br/><br/>It gets nominated for Best Picture, I read about how touching and spectacular it is. Yet it's neither smart, nor enjoyable enough to be a nominee.<br/><br/>First of all, Bradley Cooper is terrific, and J-Law is even better...but that is where the goodness ends.<br/><br/>De Niro's acting isn't bad, but it's by no means exceptional.<br/><br/>It's a Dromantic Quirkedy (dramatic and romantic quirky comedy); not a recipe for success for this writer's tastes.<br/><br/>There are quite a few moments that are written to be cringe-worthy: dark comedic scenes that ask a lot of the viewer in exchange for a half-hearted chuckle. That being said, on to a more in depth look at the film.<br/><br/>Now if you haven't seen SLP, beware the spoilers, and long-winded complaints below. But if you also haven't seen American Hustle, I'd suggest you watch that instead.<br/><br/>Here's my big thing: The reference to Ernest Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms is inaccurate. B. Cooper's character talks about how he likes the part in which the characters are dancing but doesn't like the ending.<br/><br/>There is zero dancing between Henry and Catherine in A Farewell to Arms. I know because I read the novel immediately after seeing the film.<br/><br/>Perhaps Cooper's incorrect use of the word dancing or his false reading of the story is intentional. In fact, it better be intentional.<br/><br/>If we are to accept the reality we're being shown on screen, Bradley Cooper's character misinterprets the book, or he's lying about reading it. Either way, this seems wildly incongruent with the rest of the film.<br/><br/>If it's not that, we can only assume it's a mistake in the screenplay, yes?<br/><br/>It upsets me that a movie gets nominated for Best Motion Picture with such a glaring error in the writing.<br/><br/>A lot of strange stuff is going on when Jennifer Lawrence's character is introduced to Cooper's family near the end of the film. She helps herself to a beer from the fridge, when she's never been to his house, nor met his family. This scene seems crazed, hazy and diluted, like we're interpreting some sort of illusion through the veil of BC's consciousness.<br/><br/>During that same scene, his father's best friend invests in a nonsensical parley with De Niro. Why would he force such a thing on an old friend? Seems astonishingly cruel. Why would the bookie just go on her word about the scoring system for the dance competition? They haven't been introduced, yet he's already disrespecting and adding pressure on the romantic interest of his best friend's son? (BC was never any concern to the bookie in the first place!)<br/><br/>Do these people have nothing more important in their lives than to invest all of their time and energy into this semi-serious attempt to place in a professional dance competition?<br/><br/>Why would the ex-wife show up? If anybody in this movie were in their right mind, they'd recognize the lingering potential for problems between BC and his ex-wife. This would not be the appropriate time for him to approach her.<br/><br/>Another major issue is with the psychiatrist. Even if I saw my psychiatrist at a football game, I wouldn't go bother him for more than a hello and a handshake. And I would expect the same from him.<br/><br/>There would be no tailgating and hanging out for the game. And he would most certainly not walk into my living room (where he is familiar with nobody) without a shirt on, and sit down on the couch. My best friends who walk into the house without knocking wouldn't dream of sitting shirtless on the sofa. (Even if they were in the highly unlikely situation to walk in the house without one on.) This is one of the dumbest scenes I have ever seen in a movie that's supposed to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>Best Picture? Really?<br/><br/>Also, the shrink would never play the song to purposely upset Cooper. In retrospect, it's rather cruel (and dangerous apparently, to the other people in the waiting room.) A psychiatrist doesn't play mind games with their patient. And getting such a strong reaction, I truly doubt Bradley's actions would be taken lightly.<br/><br/>I don't appreciate the letter; it's a misleading central plot element. It's dissatisfying to build mystery around what's going to be inside the envelope, when the answer is nothing. J-Law wrote it, as we expect all along.<br/><br/>There is some strange stuff going on with Chris Tucker's character. The mother doesn't acknowledge his presence in a way. She never looks at him, or engages him in a conversational manner. This recurs with Tucker's character throughout the movie. He is never really acknowledged by another individual, except J-Law. Even then, their interaction is odd. It's incredibly misleading. I thought Tucker was potentially an extension of BC's personality, a figment of his character's imagination.<br/><br/>But this doesn't jive with certain portions of the plot. So all I'm left with is a confusing mess.<br/><br/>Finally, the ending is painfully nonsensical. The last judge is portrayed as tough beforehand. You expect a harsh rating from him. Yet, he's the one who equalizes the score to just barely win it. If he is passionate about his job as a critical judge, he'd be consistent. He would not have much patience for such a terribly executed final move.<br/><br/>David O. Russell, I know you devour all of my reviews, so I'm sorry for crapping on your film.<br/><br/>But American Hustle is much better."

With this I mean that to anyone with film knowledge, it's a PRODUCT. A product crafted with the Oscars in view, like everything the Weinsteins do.

This is kind of midway.<br/><br/>Why do I say the strings show? Well, for anyone that has read a couple of basic screen writing manuals, it shows. It definitely shows.

I won't get much into it for spoilers reason, but if you've seen the film you know what I'm talking about. Not to speak about the whole dance nonsense or even the possibility itself that such a bet could ever take place with at least one non-retarded adult witness involved. And the ending with all the characters gathered in the same physical place for no other reason than to fulfill one of the more hackneyed writer's Bible Commands??<br/><br/>In the good side (the silver linings side?) the idea of displaying a drama involving characters with mental disorders we don't know much about helps us to care more about the real cases outside the movie. Only that I read somewhere among the users reviews that such illnesses are not faithfully displayed. And that's bad. Makes me wonder if the bipolar disorder wasn't really what interested the director- screenwriter, but only the possible awards (we know very well by now that Academy voters love mental illness in a drama).<br/><br/>Which leads me to David O. Russell. Like Paul Thomas Anderson, his work starts to show the egotistic perversion of a self-acclaimed ""artist"". I've commented how flawed the script is. The direction is worse. It's mediocre.

","So I just watched Silver Linings Playbook and thought ""So what?"" I had heard great things about this movie, namely that it had received 8 Oscar nominations. So, I thought, this has to be a great film? Great cast, great director, a recipe for perfection, right? Well, if this movie was a cake, someone forgot to add the yeast, because this sucker did not rise. We start with a very likable Bradley Cooper, who just seemed to be 'acting' too much in this movie. I know that sounds strange, but actors are supposed to draw you in to their performances, make you feel like you could know them on a personal level, like they could live next door. But this just felt like I was watching a performance; albeit a decent performance, by Bradley Cooper. Jennifer Lawrence stars as his love interest and also gives an adequate performance, but that being said, I expected so much more. Without giving too much away, Bradley stars as a man who has got some problems, tries to rectify them, and find himself and love along the way. The feel-good movie of the year? Probably! But not for me. The movie seemed clichéd and derivative. Robert DeNiro is a wonderful actor and a legend in his own right, but a Best Supporting Actor nomination? I just don't get it. What I think makes me dislike the movie even more is knowing the other films it beat out for nominations. Movie like Django Unchained and Argo for Best Director. These 2 films were wonderfully directed and the movies themselves are accomplishments in directing! Big casts, different locations, etc. I felt like I could have directed Silver Linings. For some reason, I got a whiff of Jerry Maguire from this movie: a man trying to rebuild himself, and finding love along the way in the most unlikely (yet most likely) of places. Only, Jerry Maguire was a wonderful film. It had depth and sincerity and still stands as Tom Cruise's finest performance. To say that this felt ""phoned in"" is an understatement.

It is too busy; mental illness, sports, book making, dancing, positivity,...etc. Every thing you can imagine is found here, but you will come out with nothing.

At each scene I waited for the next hopping to enjoy the fun, but I was hugely disappointed.<br/><br/>Even for the soundtracks, I think Danny Elfman has done better before. <br/><br/>I am always moved by movies about dysfunctionality-mentally or physically- but this time I really disliked the characters; a man who hit his parents, a sex addict, a gambler father. What is more laughable is that these characters are supposed to be inspirational!<br/><br/>I can't explain till now why all that hype around it, perhaps for Bradely Cooper who was the only savior out of all that mess, and Jennifer Lawrence who's already loved by the audience.

Goofy parents get involved, the shrink becomes a drinking buddy, and all sense of seriousness vanishes. The scene in Cooper's living room stretches on endlessly as subplot after subplot play out, and drama and comedy are mixed so you don't know how you're supposed to feel about any of it. Is this Rain Man or Abbott and Costello?<br/><br/>The old saw in movies used to be, Boy Gets Girl, Boy Loses Girl, Boy Gets Girl Back. Nowadays, it's Boy Gets Girl But Is Too Stupid to Realize It Until She Knocks Some Sense Into His Head. Of course, this rarely happens in real life. Silver Linings has The Girl for a while and then loses her, but neither the writers nor the director were able to get her back."

","When you fall asleep listening to Bradley Cooper ramble on with  Jennifer Lawrence about absolutely NOTHING in the middle of this film,  wake up 22 minutes later and notice that you missed absolutely NOTHING,  it's time to give this piece of junk the review it deserves. I feel  this way mostly since we entered into the on-demand contract to watch  this drivel on the advice of the Academy and hundreds of delusional  viewers who somehow feel this film has something to offer.   Silver Linings Playbook is a poorly scripted and marginally acted film.  It fails to deliver ANY semblance of anything. The script is horrible,  the story is beyond boring, the ""chemistry"" between any of the actors  is invisible, if not completely absent, and frankly, I couldn't have  cared less how it ended. I think I laughed twice in two hours, that is,  when I wasn't snoring.   Jennifer Lawrence's apparently Oscar-worthy performance was completely  overshadowed by the fact that she said NOTHING for nearly two hours. I  mean NOTHING. Between her and Cooper, it was incomprehensible  gibberish, and it went on and on like Ahmedinejad at the UN. Just two  plus hours of rambling. The mindless, worthless script overshadowed  Cooper's apparently reasonable performance as well. DeNiro was the only  bright spot, but his performance was forced and he wasn't believable as  Cooper's father - not even a resemblance. Bad casting. Wait, Cooper's  character might have been adopted - I'm not sure. I might have missed  that during my 22 minute snooze. Eh, didn't matter anyways if it were  the case. The chemistry there was horrible as well.   I can't even give away anything about the film in a spoiler because  there's frankly NOTHING TO SPOIL here. I could tell you the ending and  it wouldn't mean a thing - you could go ahead and watch away with  nothing to look forward to except wishing you'd spent the $6 on a latte  at Starbucks or a couple of discount rentals of decent films.   Stay away from this film unless you really need some sleep."

","Following The Fighter, David O. Russell takes another familiar story and reinvigorates it with a spirit of ensemble chaos. Scenes are stagey and dialogue crackles, and gestures flail and faces grimace, as if everyone's aware the camera is there and they all want to play to it. It's an uncanny dramatic style, one that drags you along for the ride, even when it sits incongruously with the naturalistic aesthetic.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper plays Pat, a bipolar sufferer snatched from the asylum by his nervous mother, and brought home to recover in a real madhouse. Pat is obsessed with the idea of rekindling his marriage, the violent break- up of which was the cause of his original breakdown. (We needn't worry about any scary unpredictable outbursts - Pat's much-referred-to anger is strictly regulated by the code of Hollywood morality and comedy.) To do so he enlists the help of Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a dirty babe who needs a partner for a Dirty Dancing competition.<br/><br/>Silver Linings Playbook is ostensibly about mental illness, but really it's selling the age-old myth that any emotional dysfunction can be overcome with a Positive Mental Attitude. It does peddle it with vigour: there's real chemistry between Lawrence (more animated than usual) and Cooper (unsubtle but effective); the dialogue has an enjoyable runaway mine-cart quality; and the relationship between Pat Jr and Pat Snr (Robert De Niro, in his best role since Stone) is sometimes affecting.<br/><br/>But however Russell garnishes it, this is a predictable film which betrays its interesting setup by descending into a boring fairy tale. By the time the climactic dance-off comes around, rather than rooting for the meetcute triumph, I was desperate for Russell to claw back some anger or oddness or edginess, rather than following the Nicholas Sparks routefinder to easy soft-focus satisfaction.<br/><br/>It has the look and feel of an Oscar contender (in itself that's neither praise nor condemnation), but it's not clear for what it might win. The performances are decent, without plumbing the depths of those in The Master, while the script is zippy but thematically all over the shop. We'll just have to wait and see what's left after Lincoln sweeps the board."

It is original in its storytelling though; sad, dark, fresh.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper gives a great performance as a man just released from a mental institution after 8 months, trying to rebuild his life and win his wife back, or at least get the restraining order removed. Jennifer Lawrence is good too but again I think I was expecting more from her due to the academy award she received.<br/><br/>The ending was kind of meh, that's it? and I'll admit to being bored in sections as well as catching a couple of errors (duct tape appearing and disappearing on shoes).

"oscar-montanez","2","8","13","16 March 2013"," Terrible adaptation of an otherwise great book
","I enjoyed the book so very much and I was looking forward to the movie, but what a disappointment it was. <br/><br/>The following three basic and story building facts from the book, were just blown in the first ten minutes of the movie: <br/><br/><ul><li>The silent father who doesn't want to talk to his son Pat, - The really mentally sick Pat who has lost his memory and can't remember he was 4 years in the hospital and only wants to meet Nikki and put and end to what he calls ""apart time"" - The crazy Tiffany who, due to a terrible performance by the otherwise lovely Jennifer Lawrence, was not crazy at all</li></ul><br/><br/>Cooper's performance was horrible, he didn't act like the mentally ill person that is presented in the book. He just did the same flat acting he did in the hangover. A thirty something guy, funny, and cool but far from the Pat that is shown in the book. Cooper doesn't have the faintest idea how to play a mentally ill person, with the horrible trauma that Pat had when he found his wife in the tube with another guy. <br/><br/>When pat and tiffany go to dinner they are not supposed to talk (both are traumatized people under the treatment of psychiatric drugs) but in the movie they talk a lot, like a normal couple do. <br/><br/>Not even the eagles chant, that is mentioned so many times in the book and that works for Pat to exteriorize his feelings and to break the ice between him and his therapist and between him and his Father, is done properly in the movie. <br/><br/>The Victoria secret story, for which Tiffany blames herself for the death of her husband, was twisted and made sound simple, and it was not told at the end but somewhere in the middle of the movie.<br/><br/>The dancing part also lost all the magic presented in the book, because the touching between Pat and Tiffany while dancing helps both of them to recover. Laurence just can't dance. She is so bad at it that they had to include Danny in the dancing bit to give it some sense. <br/><br/>The part about the stadium is important in the book because it being demolished means that Pat has been in hospital for 4 years and when he doesn't see the stadium he knows is when he realizes he wasn't in the hospital a few months but 4 years <br/><br/>How come Tiffany involves everyone in the lie about the letters sent to Nikki? This was supposed to be a secret between her and Pat, it was her way of helping him. This twisted the whole story. <br/><br/>And what about Nikki being in the dance room? The whole point of the book was that Nikki was an obsession of Pat and it was clear she had a new life and never wanted to see pat again. <br/><br/>Off course the ending couldn't be worse than the rest of the movie, and the writer or director had to end it with an ""I love you"". When or how did Pat fall in love with Tiffany?? he was too busy obsessing about Nikki to pay any attention to Tiffany. <br/><br/>The books ending is so much better. Much better because NOTHING happens between Pat and Tiffany and that is OK for both of them, they need each other like friends do! not like lovers. <br/><br/>Sorry If i haven't already spoiled the book and the movie too much, read the book but don't waste your time with the movie. <br/><br/>Oscar"

","I had to watch this film twice in a row to try and understand (and I'm still lost) as to where the hype, and the endless award nominations came from. Maybe without all the hype I would have been less disappointed, but it's still, to me, a film not worth watching. I was expecting it to be different from other typical American rom coms, but I was wrong. I haven't got anything against American rom coms, I just never really rate them highly. What made silver linings especially disappointing for me is that the portrayal of mental illness (which was the part of the story that made me want to see it) was awful. Whether it be bad acting or a poor narrative, but without the talk of mental illness, I wouldn't have even been aware that mental illness existed in the movie. You'd honestly just think the characters had poor social skills or maybe some milder form of a learning disability, such as asbergers, but certainly not bi-polar or any other serious mental health conditions. And this makes me really wonder where the Oscar nominations came from? I've never been more puzzled? Don't get lost in the hype, the film was extremely average, along with the acting."

As if they enjoyed the attention of them being the most annoying family in the neighbourhood. I am not convinced whether the movie is accurate in portraying the realm of clinical psychology, and it made even worse with a cliché and even more unrealistic ending. Maybe I am off-the-mark of what the film is trying to show here, but seems to me everyone (including the dancers which made a remark that I felt was really silly) and even the film itself is kind of dysfunctional and the only person that made realistic sense to me, despite her aggressive behaviour, is Jennifer Lawrence's character."

When you look at these wonderfully endearing yet disturbed people trying to find their way - the way they maybe see it: back to who they were; even though it's more about dealing with who you are, where you're at, and how you relate to life, love, and the people around you - it's about as accurate a portrayal as I've ever seen about people in these circumstances.<br/><br/>It isn't just them, it's also the doctors that really haven't found a solution to any of their problems and the fact that the people that cure these patients quite frequently are the patients themselves, if they actually do manage to pull through and be cured. I'm not saying that the main characters come out cured, but they at least come out with a sense of now and how and who they want to be, but what that means, I think I'll leave up for you to enjoy.<br/><br/>I hope some people will come out with the basic understanding that patients aren't crazy. You need to treat them friendly and adequately. My understanding through experience is that when you sit down with them and do provide proper argument without forcing it onto them, they can clearly discern what's real and what isn't. You don't have to jump them. You don't have to force feed them anything. You just sit down and talk. See what moves them and be honest with them. Most of them will get it."

"tomgillespie2002","6","2","2","26 December 2013"," Beautifully acted, but difficult to believe
","This is the kind of film that the Academy love and regularly shower with awards come Oscar season. Silver Linings Playbook is a story of love triumphing over mental illness that sees excellent performances across the board, but, as is the norm with these types of films, the 'serious' subject matter glosses over the cracks in the story's believability, and the happy ending rather waters down the seriousness of bipolar disorder, resulting in a somewhat insulting message that love can somehow cure mental illness. But David O. Russell, the former indie pioneer who's now a regular Oscar-botherer, is a good director, and with it's many flaws aside, Silver Linings is a funny, quite moving picture.<br/><br/>After being released early from a mental institution, Pat (Bradley Cooper), a man brimming with anger and who has bipolar disorder, tries to win back the wife that has taken a restraining order out on him. He has a new positive outlook on life, but is still quick to anger, throwing a book through a window because he doesn't like the ending. His parents (Jacki Weaver and Robert De Niro) try to support him but find it difficult to cope. He meets the equally unstable Tiffany (the beautiful Jennifer Lawrence), and the two make a deal. She will get a letter to his wife as long as he becomes her dance partner in an upcoming contest. <br/><br/>Russell's back catalogue shows his unique eye for comedy. I Heart Huckabees (2004) was a bizarre existential comedy full of oddball characters that really worked, and Three Kings (1999), his breakthrough, managed to squeeze many laughs out of a war-torn setting. Silver Linings Playbook is more comedy than drama, but the laughs are few and far between. De Niro is the real comic relief in the movie, but his OCD, Philadelphia Eagles-obsessed father isn't believable. In fact, the whole family setting asks a lot of the audience. For a film so seemingly grounded in reality (it takes the washed-out, shaky camera approach), the supporting characters just aren't real.<br/><br/>It works best when its two leads are together. The movie really depends on the chemistry between Pat and Tiffany, and they do sparkle in their scenes. It's rare that a movie makes me want characters to get together, but in the moments when they dance, you can feel the connection, and you want Pat to forget his estranged wife and open his eyes to what's in front of him. Cooper brings a likability to a occasionally despicable character, but Lawrence steals the film. Tiffany is a force of nature, damaged by the death of her husband and now finds herself labelled a slut after many a one-night stand. With Lawrence at the helm, it's impossible not to fall in love with her.<br/><br/>The rom-com clichés are followed very much to the T, with eccentric minor characters that somehow all end up in the same place at the end, the will-they-or-won't-they climax, but it does them well. It also avoids any real upsets in Pat and Tiffany's journey, instead opting for a much more light-hearted, easy-going approach. But, like Pat says, isn't their enough f*****g misery in the world already? Maybe he's right, but I feel the movie took an easy path opposed to a more serious study of the effects of mental illness.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

Russell<br/><br/>Plot: After spending time in a mental institution, Pat Solitano moves back into his parent's house while he tries to get back together with his wife. He meets Tiffany, a girl with problems of her own, agrees to help him if he enters a dance competition with her.<br/><br/>JJ's Verdict: This would be your average rom-com where it not for brilliant performances from the entire cast. 'Silver Linings Playbook' tells the story of two troublesome adults, Pat who was in a mental institute with bipolar after nearly killing his wife's lover, and Tiffany who, since her husband died, slept with everyone she could.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence who have never really played people who have any major problems, fit into their roles superbly. From Cooper's constant positivity and mood swings to Lawrence's trickery and vulnerability, you don't see two actors on the screen; you see Pat and Tiffany. The supporting cast is equally brilliant with Robert De Niro's OCD and football mad Pat Sr. and Jacki Weaver playing the Pats' mother/wife Dolores. The chemistry between the parents is nothing short of brilliant as they try to keep their son from getting too ambitious. Chris Tucker is also very good as Pat's friend whom he met at the institution as is Anupam Kher, Pat's therapist. <br/><br/>Although the film itself feels formulaic, it is amazingly feel-good. To label the film a comedy is a little inappropriate. Despite having funny moments, with the subjects at hand this film is more a drama. But comedy or drama, 'Silver Linings Playbook' leaves you feeling ridiculously happy and satisfied."

","I totally adore Jennifer Lawrence, which is why I went to see this movie, but really I found it very hard to take. Every element thrown into the story looks like it was tested by a Hollywood focus group. The peons love dirty jokes? Check, everyone talks dirty. Everyone loves romance? Check, love blossoms even when the two main characters are obviously insane. The underdogs enter the big contest -- my God, it's a stunning surprise -- and then, well, they come out on top! All those big clichés were bad enough, but I found a lot of minor things annoying too. The condescending view of working class America -- yes, we're all foul-mouthed morons and we all love football, but do we have to paint ourselves green? The condescending portrait of the Hindu psychiatrist -- he's an okay guy once he starts watching football.<br/><br/>It was all so depressing to watch, yet, once Jennifer Lawrence takes hold you become like a mindless slave, unable to stop watching.<br/><br/>Oh, and one word about Bradley Cooper. He's not that bad when he shuts up and the camera just captures something mean and deadly in his eyes. When he's talking, and acting, doing his twitchy little man-boy Adam Sandler impersonation, he's vile beyond words. But when he sits still, you see something harder in his face. Something truer. Suddenly this isn't PUNCH DRUNK LOVE. It's THE English PATIENT. And he's Ralph Fiennes! So really, I give this movie four stars. Two stars for Jennifer Lawrence, and two stars for Bradley Cooper. But the rest of this mess, you can keep.<br/><br/>Oh, and thanks Liberal Hollywood. Thanks for letting the black man play the fool again!"

I hate it, i didn't hate it before, but people were appreciating it way too much which I think this movie doesn't deserve, so I hate it now.

","David O. Russell has always appeared to me to be the fourth member of a quartet of directors, roughly contemporaneous, who include Paul T. Anderson, Wes Anderson, and Alexander Payne. I would say that, of the four, he has always been the weakest. The only one of his films I truly enjoyed was ""Three Kings"". With this effort, I think he may have slid a little bit farther down in my estimation. He did manage to get good performances out of his cast, but when that cast includes Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver, and Jennifer Lawrence, that should be a given. As for the film itself, it was kind of a mess, really. It just seemed interminable, with a whole cast of irritating people acting in dramatically implausible ways. The most sympathetic character, for me, was Tiffany, but I suspect that had more to do with Jennifer Lawrence's performance than anything that was written into the part. I hope she gets the Oscar that she earned for ""Winter's Bone"", and I hope a worthier role comes her way in the near future."
"fawn_jane","4","6","10","25 January 2015"," I want my two hours back...
","First we have a boring, unlikable main character, and his uncompelling problems. In the first 52 minutes of the movie which I managed to pay full attention to, I was left unsatisfied with this feeling like nothing was really at stake, there was no conflict that I was interested in seeing the outcome of. The life-shattering trauma in his life is finding his wife sexing in the shower with another man, an uninteresting premise IMHO.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence's manic pixie dream girl, borderline PD act, and how she manipulates the main character is so contrived and unpleasant to watch. The way she and the main character push and pull at each other is so irrational and just... drama for the sake of drama. I assume they'll get together in the end, and that would just be too painful to watch.<br/><br/>So basically the movie seems to come down to boring upper-middle-class people bickering and acting crazy and irritating while trying to ""find themselves"" while wrapped up in the cozy blandness of tree-lined suburbia. There's no real danger in the movie, just a soap-opera-ish, romanticized version of mental illness that serves as a zany backdrop for an adolescent, angsty romance."

","This movie left me wondering if, toward the end, all the characters would sit Bradley down and reveal some elaborate scheme they had ingeniously devised so that, ultimately, they would set him on the path towards sanity--AND to explain to the viewer why reality had seemed so warped in the movie up to that point...or SOMETHING that could demystify how every character acts like they need to be heavily medicated. <br/><br/>I have a few minor issues with this movie:<br/><br/>~The story line has little coherency. ~Each character is incredibly-emotionally invested in the most trivial of matters. ~In every scenario each character behaves as if this is how people regularly interact and communicate with each other...well, minus Bradley and Jennifer...and Chris Tucker...and Bradley's Dad...and Bradley's friend Pat... <br/><br/>Okay, so I guess this movie says crazy people tend to cluster together, even outside of an institution. That's all I could come up with.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I give this a 6 out of 10 because, aside from the plot that leaves the sane baffled, the actors' performances are hugely entertaining. It's like a piece of modern art you see in a museum that catches your eye enough that you stop and stare for awhile; however, if you were asked to evaluate the artist, you couldn't bring yourself to regard it too highly because you know it's just a painting of random splotches and gravity at work (no paintbrush required)."

What about the time problem, where Pat thinks he's been gone for a couple of months though t had been 4 years? That was a huge part of the story just left out! Also Nikki's not supposed to be part of the plan. And why does Danny keep getting out of the ""bad place"" . Also there dance is supposed to be amazing and be against kids without scoring.

"cherold","6","5","8","5 January 2014"," Overrated but fairly typical indie drama
","Over the years, indie films have become, in many ways, as formulaic as the Hollywood blockbusters that are their supposed opposites. Silver Linings Playbook is such a film. It is a standard misfit romance that tries to combine quirk with pathos(as is often the case, its fence straddling between the two means it does neither well), and the ending is pat even by Hollywood standards.<br/><br/>It's also a movie that rings false throughout. This is not mental illness, this is movie-mental illness, in which a set of symptoms are chosen based on what the director wants the characters to do and feel. My social-worker girlfriend said the guy really struck her as more developmentally disabled than mentally ill, and while that would never have occurred to me, I can see her point. He's really more badly behaved than anything else, and it's hard to tell if his main problem is mental illness or just a streak of stupidity. His emotional evolution makes no sense as well; the change is too fast, radical and complete to be considered remotely real, and we don't really see it happening.<br/><br/>Even the dance contest in the end doesn't seem real; it is as though two separate contests are overlapped.<br/><br/>There are good moments in the movie. Jennifer Lawrence, while probably not really deserving of her Oscar, does a nice job of creating someone both tough and emotionally fragile. There are also bad moments, like a surprisingly off-key ""emotional"" scene with De Niro. <br/><br/>There was a time, back in the 1990s, when an indie movie promised something that was in some way different. I miss those days."
"hellraiser7","10","5","8","27 February 2013"," Game Plan
","As a saying goes when the door is shut, god opens a window. Yeah we all had out down points in life, however the truth about life is it's most of the time a matter of how you get back up from troubled circumstances is what counts. This is one of those romance stories I really like because like any plan in football that works it runs toward the goal line.<br/><br/>With any good romance stories and dramas this film has characters that I actually care about and really like. But also really love the quarky, bizarre yet down to earth nature of the film.<br/><br/>The dialog in this film is great, it is at times a little strange and humorous but I feel that's what makes the characters seem more human. It really felt like I was hearing people talking and not just fictional characters.<br/><br/>Pat is played well by Bradley Cooper this is probably my favorite role from him for now. Pat is a broken guy you really feel pathos for. The legal and psychological troubles he's been though, sure what it did isn't completely right, but the guy he beat up wasn't innocent; along with a painful divorce. I like how his aggressive attitude toward things which is not just a psychological problem but a quark. One really funny scene is when he does a rant on a Ernest Heminway book which he literally throws out the window, it's funny because he kinda makes a point. He wants to rejoin life again but the problem is he's calling the wrong play.<br/><br/>I really like how the film at times has some really intense scenes. Like one where Pat was acting out a bit from the fact he couldn't find the wedding video, you can't help but feel for the guy as he has both anger and sadness combined, the fact that the wedding video is gone reflects the life he can't get back because to him that was the only times of happiness. But I really like the humanity of his character, whenever he feels he letting people down whether it's his mom, dad, or Tiffany he feels awful about it and himself; I feel it shows he's not a selfish person he really does care about other people and letting them down is the last thing he wants.<br/><br/>However my favorite character in the film is Tiffany, played brilliantly by Jennifer Laurence whom I think is kinda hot and a more than capable actress. Her character reminds me a little of April Ludgate from ""Parks and Recreation"" whom is also a little similar. I really love how fiery, feisty, energetic, a little bizarre, dark, she has charisma which is black, quarky, or clever. However the best thing about her to me is the fact that she accepts that she's not perfect she has her psychological troubles but she accepts them. She also a character you feel pathos for since like with Pat had to endure a loss, with her though it was the loss of her husband. I like that she's is ambitious in a way, she loves dancing and wants to be a champion but also doesn't want to be alone wants someone in her life again.<br/><br/>You already know in the film both really are a good match for one another. Both are somewhat the same, like with Pat she's also has aggression in an intense scene in the restaurant just seeing her exercise it makes me feel she might be more aggressive than Pat. Both are broken and are trying to get their lives back together as well have more in their life that they haven't had. And the chemistry between them is great I really love the banter between them, there are sparks whether they know it or not, and they support one another in a way; heck both of them dance well together so that ought to say something.<br/><br/>And you want both of them together but not just yet because like with any good romance story I feel one or both have to earn it first. And both do, in a way the film is a bit like a Howard Hawks film, as the film goes on both characters grow, Pat becomes more of a man and Tiffany more of a woman. And as that happens both start connecting, say things they probably never said to anyone else.<br/><br/>However this I don't think is just a romance about two people but it's also about love for family.<br/><br/>The supporting characters are also really good each with quarks and trouble of their own. Robert De Nero as Pat Sr I thought was great, just like his son he's psychologically troubled. And just like his son has a humanity, really like this one touching moment when he has a talk down with Pat and admits he hasn't been the best father. And we see in the film both of them also start growing closer becoming in touch with one another again.<br/><br/>I've said enough, Silver Linings Playbook is a touchdown.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"
"HelenMary","7","3","4","31 December 2013"," eye-opening and entertaining expose of mental illness
","Generally, this film is a romantic drama, confronting mental issues sympathetically and with some humour but keeping the poignancy of the subject. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are the stars and rule the screen together with great chemistry and physicality. Robert de Niro was also (unsurprisingly) brilliant, depicting Pat (Cooper's) father - suffering with some mental issues himself and creating an unstable environment for a young man with vulnerability having just come out of a mental hospital. Jennifer Lawrence, also amazed by her acting skill; great range, as did Cooper. Portraying someone with bipolar or erratic behaviours is difficult to change posture and expression on the drop of a coin and these two actors did very well.<br/><br/>The story is complex, gripping, nerve-wracking and quite complex. The story isn't spelled out and is revealed in the narrative and through the occasional flash backs. The scenes are a little choppy, certainly at first, but this probably is a technique to speed up the opening part of the film. The cinematography is plainly shot, with no surprises, and I think that it could have used some more artistic styles or variation. The language in the film was quite bad, given that I was watching with someone who was sensitive to that, but it wasn't entirely unnecessary in that it fit with the characters and the narrative. The story itself took in mental illness, love, disappointment, familial dysfunction, gambling issues, bereavement and is wonderful, uplifting and very interesting but sometimes worrying and uncomfortable to watch.<br/><br/>I can see why this got lots of awards, including Jennifer Lawrence's Oscar, given the range of the actors and the complexity of their characters. Whilst it was brilliant, I wouldn't recommend it to everyone but will certainly vouch for how good it is! A fantastic character led drama with a touching love theme."

He tries to handle his bi-polar condition with the help of his parents Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver as he moves back in with them and attempts to put his life back on track. His success is hit-and-miss at best and then another potential monkey-wrench is thrown into his life when he meets a young sex-addicted widow (dynamite role by the always impressive Jennifer Lawrence). Together these two very similar, yet very different individuals go on an emotional journey to reclaim normalcy and self-reliance in their lives. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is brilliant in most every way. The performances reach near epic heights with Lawrence leading the talented cast. The film's screenplay is deeper than it appears as it shows subtleties in its characters where you have trouble understanding who has mental deficiencies and who does not. In the end the movie is about humans doing their best, with the help of those around them, to find happiness and success against sometimes grim and seemingly insurmountable odds. In a crazy world, doing one's best in a dance competition and making that little extra money betting on the hometown Philadelphia Eagles of the NFL can become the most unexpected roads to individual happiness and group camaraderie. A definite winner. Kudos to director David O. Russell in keeping what could have been a schizophrenic screenplay (no pun intended) on the straight and narrow path to cinematic success. 4.5 out of 5 stars."

Acts of the main characters were realistic and movie touched the exact points in this illness. Having a long relationship with a bipolar sufferer, I know the meaning of obsession and ""rising"". even the intense effort for being fit was such familiar to me. With this movie, I realized that we all experience the very same feeling and problems when we have the same disorders. It is normal that there were too much shouting at the beginning and especially midnight conversations.

"secondtake","7","3","4","20 June 2013"," Some great new twists on a familiar against-the-odds romantic comedy
","Silver Linings Playbook (2012)<br/><br/>A great drama/comedy, both funny and moving, with terrific acting from a terrific cast. What more do you want? Ah, maybe a little more originality, an ending (and a dysfunctional family) that wasn't a twist on ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" something a little less sentimental?<br/><br/>All of these things. And yet, with misgivings intact, the movie is still great in its own way. Part of the reason is some hard, true acting. Both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are spot on believable, funny, and fleshed out beyond stereotypes. The rest of the cast, including De Niro as the Cooper's father, are simpler characters and yet the types they play don't quite become stereotypes. In fact, the three men (the dad and the two friends) are superb within their roles. <br/><br/>It might be Lawrence who sets the movie on fire most, even above Coopers volatile, yet tightly bound, performance. Lawrence is a kind of freed version of what Cooper must play, and she's more fun, less troubled perhaps, and utterly optimistic. Which brings up the point of the movie.<br/><br/>Beyond the plot of a pair of young people struggling with common forms of mental illness that require medication but allow for fairly normal lives, there is the larger point of rising up, of being positive, or making things happen by wanting to and following through. This is the moving part, the part that makes you love and identify and even envy the main characters as they show how to succeed within their malaise. It really is a common thing to face a mental flaw that brings your life down, or someone you love. And here is how to deal, how to try to deal.<br/><br/>Yes, this is pure Hollywood, without suggesting its happy ending in any detail. It lacks what someone like, say, Cassavetes would attempt in this situation (and the result would fail to reach a larger audience). But it has some brave aspects, making real a situation that needs some understanding without turning it into unmitigated nightmare.<br/><br/>Director and co-writer David O. Russell has a leaning to films that mix high drama and real human and interpersonal concerns. This might be his best film (""Three Kings"" is worth seeing for its mix of serious and comic aspects to war, and ""The Fighter"" has qualities of sadness and persistence that echo here), and it is one that sets his direction as a more serious, interesting Hollywood director. See this."

","Among the new releases over this holiday season was quirky comedy/drama Silver Linings Playbook. Starring Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Robert DiNero, the offbeat comedy has swept this year's awards with major nominations for Oscars and Golden Globes; it even managed to snag a best lead actress globe for Jennifer Lawrence at last week's ceremony. The story centers on Pat (Cooper), a teacher who has to move back in with his parents after a stint in a mental institution, Pat suffers from bipolar disorder and is trying to get his life back on track by getting fit and reconciling with his wife, but like any good comedy, this does not go to plan. Pat's football obsessed family want to help him get his life together, but once he meets young widow Tiffany (Lawrence), things start to go awry. Tiffany offers to help Pat reconnect with his wife, but in return she asks him to be her partner in a local dancing competition.<br/><br/>Silver Linings Playbook had the potential to be your regular romcom, but thanks to its somewhat controversial theme and excellent casting, it effortlessly avoids this. Instead, viewers are treated to character driven plot that is filled out with a mix of tense and hilariously awkward scenes that make the film incredibly enjoyable. The ending is the only predictable aspect of the film, but it's a satisfying one as the characters you were rooting for get what they deserve.<br/><br/>From the get go, Silver Linings Playbook is clever, engaging and heart- warming, both Cooper and Lawrence give outstanding performances that make their characters not just likable, but believable too, and an all- star supporting cast including Robert DiNero, Jacki Weaver and Chris Tucker give the story more layers. A film about mental illness, dancing and American football might sound slightly strange, but it's the strangeness of this film that makes it so good, and a shoe in for at least one Oscar this year."

"dario_malic","9","3","4","25 January 2013"," Hey, let's be positive
","It's hard to make a good romantic comedy. There are dozens of them every year and they (almost) all recycle the same formula: guy meets girl, they fall in love but won't admit it, encounter some obstacles, and overcome them all to live happily ever after. There's often a little drama too, added to make for some serious moments, but rarely it bares any real weight. Seeing the trailer it was obvious to me that the same is the case with director David O. Russell's new film ""Silver Linings Playbook"" so I wondered how can it be that the film was nominated for an Oscar in all important categories, counting the nominations to eight. I've recently watched it and stopped wondering. Sure, it has the same formula, but Russell (who also wrote the screenplay) and his cast make all the difference in the world.<br/><br/>It's a story of Pat, a history teacher who found his wife with another man and went a little crazy. They put him in a mental institution and diagnosed him with a bipolar disorder but eight months later his mother takes him back home. He meets Tiffany, a good-looking young widow with similar problems to his, but in spite of his impulses decides to only make friends with her as the means to get his wife back. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are simply fantastic in the roles of Tiffany and Pat. After a great turn in the ""Winter's Bone"" a couple of years ago, Lawrence here does completely different but equally great work showing her admirable range, and Cooper finally proves he is a serious actor after a series of comedic works of dubious quality. No less appealing are those in supporting roles. Robert De Niro (his best role in a long time) and Jacki Weaver as Pat's parents and a special treat, as Pat's friend from mental institution, Chris Tucker in his first non-Carter role in 15 years. All of them did an excellent job and it's no surprise that the film is an Oscar contender in all four acting categories.<br/><br/>Of course, the actors needed a good material to work with as well as a guiding hand and that's were Russell strongly delivered. I didn't read the novel by Matthew Quick which the film was based on so I don't know how much of the credit goes to him but the script is great. It is rare enough seeing most of the characters in the film having some kind of mental disorder, but to see them presented so emphatically, keeping in sight that they are human beings just like the rest, but also realistically, with all their good and bad sides, was almost impossible until now. The reason for that approach is probably in the fact that Russell's son has bipolar disorder as well as OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) so he has understanding both of and for the mental disorders. His familiarity with the subject can also be felt by how he handles family relations within the film. The relations between Pat, his father and his mother are at the same time simple and complicated due to the problems they have, and they are portrayed in a way so natural and sincere you can easily imagine something like that happening just around the corner.<br/><br/>That still leaves the clichéd love story, but in a much better position than initially. Although we've seen it a thousand times and know how it ends, it keeps us invested and make us feel the emotions of its characters. That's because, due to sincere performances by Lawrence and Cooper, it doesn't feel contrived, and the ending we've gotten used to this time feels truly deserved.<br/><br/>""Silver Linings Playbook"" also has one more universal theme. Through showing us how those with some kind of disability deserve to be happy, it actually shows us that we all deserve it. And if we try real hard to be our best selves we have a chance at it. It's optimistic attitude is reinvigorating just as is Russell's take on the genre. After initially being surprised by its Oscar nominations, now I'll be surprised if it doesn't make at least some of them into an award. It's one of the best films of the year and I look forward to watching it again. Oh, and did I mention that Chris Tucker is in it?<br/><br/>More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/"

His father Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro), is so rabidly obsessed with The Philadelphia Eagles that he has been banned from attending the games because he got into fights with other fans. He is also out of work and has taking up a bookmaking operation to make money. That means that he is also obsessed with good luck omens and charms. There's an oddity to the father-son relationship here. Both are suffering from mental instabilities. The marker of sanity in this odd pairing is Dolores (Jacki Weaver), the mother who stands in the middle and tries to land both of them at a measure of reason.<br/><br/>Pat, the son, is determined to get back together with his wife. She has a restraining order against him that he seems to regard without interest. Those who love Pat want him to move on and it seems a possibility when he meets his friend's sister-in-law, a widow named Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence). She's beautiful, sexy, but unpredictable. Once a sex addict, we can still see the mournful crisis in her eyes as she makes a strange and often very funny courtship with Pat. She suggests sex, he says no. He can't be unfaithful to his wife even though she has a restraining order against him. It just wouldn't be right, yet looking at Tiffany in her tight black outfit, few would object.<br/><br/>What comes of this story (and I haven't given anything away) is that it is about a handful of characters who want desperately to get over the pains that ail them and get on to something better. That's a relief, most characters in movies wallow in their problems until the antagonist is dead. Not here, this is a smart human drama that looks its characters square in the eye and doesn't ask us to pity them, only to look into their souls and see that despite the eccentricities, they aren't that different from the rest of us.<br/><br/>What David O. Russell, the writer/director manages to do with this story is something short of miraculous. He takes a father and some relationship and manages to mend it by means of a football bet and a dance contest. How these two elements come together in the mending of their ways, is best left for you to discover. What lies underneath the relationship is the suggestion that a man who has just been released from an institution is just as certifiable as some of your more rabid football fans. Like the obsessed fan of the little-seen movie ""Big Fan"", Pat's father is a man who has cleaned out large portions of his life to make room for his beloved Eagles He also takes the case of mental illness and manages to avoid making it fluffy and cute. There is no attempt to make fun of his condition. He makes a very approachable and sometimes very funny comedy that does always work but never bores you or insults your intelligence. That comes from the casting of smart actors. Here is Bradley Cooper, an actor that we've come to know since ""The Hangover"" and puts him in the role of a man that never asks us to like him or to pity him. He isn't afraid to look like a jerk. Also, the wonderful Jennifer Lawrence, the star of ""The Hunger Games"" who looks and acts differently than we've seen her before. She is more open, sexier, and somewhat sadder. This is her best performance. Yet, the best in the movie is Robert De Niro as Pat Sr. Here is an actor we've watched with such familiarity that he could be a member of our own family and he fits this role so perfectly that he seems to have been there for years. As human comedies go, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" gets the job done. It doesn't always work. There are some slow patches, and the movie takes its time getting off the ground, but once it does it becomes the kind of winning comedy that you are glad you spent time with."

","I've been a great fan of Jennifer Lawrence. I've watched all her movies and always rated her highly. With the exception of The House At The End Of The Street. I think a poor script was more to blame. She is a beautiful and very hot Actress. I first saw a review of her on bustybusts.com and have been hooked ever since. So about the movie....I like movies with a strong story line, this delivers on that score. Bradley Cooper plays a guy who is released from a mental institution and goes to live with his parents. He meets up with Miss Lawrence (Tiffany) and it's kind of a relationship that build only 2 crazy people can develop. I can't say much more than in fear of spoiling it. Just do yourself a favour and watch it. You won't regret it."

What better 'silver lining'in a movie can you ask for, and isn't this the best thing a movie could hope to achieve? I couldn't fault any part of it. The only thing it was missing was the full sense of depression and despair that bi polar sufferers experience, put to be honest that would make too uncomfortable viewing for me. fantastic acting from everyone, especially the lead roles. should have received more Oscars."
"katybrit","10","4","6","16 February 2013"," This is why we go to movies.
","This is why we go to movies. Silver Linings Playbook is that rare breed of movie where all the moving parts got put together in exactly the right way. The dialogue is sharp, witty, insightful, funny, and often brutally honest. It respects and holds true affection for its characters and the wonderful ensemble cast makes it look easy. The direction, editing and soundtrack are spot on. It is a future classic and the best movie of the year.<br/><br/>Pat is an underachieving substitute high school history teacher who has just been released from the Karel Psychiatric Facility after spending an eight month court-ordered stint for nearly beating the history teacher to death when he finds him in the shower with his wife. His doting, eternally optimistic mother brings him home hoping that the worst of his previously undiagnosed bipolar symptoms are under control. But his refusal to take his meds and an unfortunate incident concerning Earnest Hemingway and a window quickly dispels that optimism. Pat is in fact clueless, living inside a self-delusion bubble in which he reunites with the truly unattainable object of his obsession, his wife Nikki. Two more mismatched souls the world has never seen but he is the only one who doesn't realize it. He plods doggedly on in pursuit, oblivious to everything and everyone else around him. His illness has removed the normal barriers that prevent him from expressing the unfiltered truth as he sees it, making for some awkward, cringe-worthy, often humorous exchanges. Pat is hardly ready for the real world.<br/><br/>And he certainly is not ready for Tiffany. Pat's best friend invites him over for a homecoming dinner which turns out to be a blind date with his wife's recently widowed sister, Tiffany. Tiffany suffers from severe depression and her mood swings run the gamut - volatile, bitter, vulnerable, stubborn, sexy, and sweet - all thrown randomly into a mixer and blended at high speed. Everyone is a little afraid of her. Her depression results from her guilt over her husband's death which she attributes to her loss of sexual interest in him. She sleeps with everyone in her office in an attempt to anesthetize herself from her emotional pain. She is dead inside, just breathing air. And into this web steps the unsuspecting Pat.<br/><br/>From the moment they meet sparks and barbs fly indiscriminately between them, much to the horror of their hosts who believe they are witnessing a train wreck in the making. But these two lost and damaged souls immediately connect, kindred spirits seeking respite from the storm. Pat is overwhelmed, unable to come to grips with guilt over the intensity of his attraction to Tiffany and the incident sends him into an uncontrolled manic episode. Tiffany feels the same connection and it jolts her far enough out of her stupor for her to see the possibilities. When Pat turns down her offer to sleep with her the flame sparks higher, her curiosity is piqued, and her pursuit begins in earnest. As she starts to nurture and guide Pat, she develops such a flaming torch for him that it would blister the skin off any ordinary guy. But Pat is oblivious, content just to follow her around like the lost puppy he is. She grabs the opportunity full throttle, dragging the perplexed, not-quite-ready-for-reality Pat along for the ride.<br/><br/>The cast is simply brilliant. Bradley Cooper is a revelation as the bipolar misfit whose philosophy consists of working hard and staying positive to find the silver lining in everything. He and Jennifer Lawrence have such electrifying chemistry together that you find yourself rooting for them to find a way to be together from the moment they meet. Robert DeNiro comes alive in his Oscar-nominated role as Pat's Eagles-obsessed, superstitious, OCD bookie father. Chris Tucker deserves special mention as Pat's equally optimistic fellow psychiatric inmate and friend Danny (""Black it up Pat!"").<br/><br/>But make no doubt about it - this is Jennifer Lawrence's movie. At twenty two she is the real thing. Her performance here is transcendental. Even with the marvelous supporting cast holding the bar so high the movie would not work without her. She is visceral - caustic and vulnerable in the same breath. Her facial expressions hide nothing - she is fearless, willing to expose Tiffany's raw emotional core to everyone around her, warts and all as she juggles staying one step ahead of both Pats obsession as well as her own. The transformational changes that occur are put into motion and propelled forward by her. She bets everything with no guarantee that he is capable of giving her what she so desperately needs, willing to run the risk of diving off the emotional cliff for a chance at the real thing. Her character is the lynchpin of the story. And Jennifer Lawrence is nowhere to be found here. The success of the movie rides on her shoulders and she is brilliantly up to the task. Her talent is embarrassing.<br/><br/>The film is unapologetically romantic but dismissing it as a simple romance is missing the point. It deals with family, friendship, truth, sacrifice, and love as imperfect ideals worth fighting for regardless of your place in the world. It is a brave film. Do yourself a favor, go see it. It is ultimately a joyous affirmation of life's possibilities. And who doesn't need a little of that?"

","Silver Linings Playbook is one of the best preformed films of the year. Bradley Cooper plays against his usual ""man whore, with a heart of gold"" routine and gives his best performance ever as Patrick, a man recently diagnosed as bi-polar. Cooper is effortlessly captures moments of humor and only to turn to anger or sorrow in the next minute. Jennifer Lawrence in the perfect compliment to Cooper playing a recent widow turned sex addict. Lawrence took what could have been a flat character and was able to make a dramatic and moving performance that shows her acting skills; being able to transform from totalitarian fighting teen in the Hunger Games franchise. Cooper and Lawrence drive the film through their chemistry, every moment they share on screen is magnetic. <br/><br/>The supporting cast is also fantastic. De Niro gives his best performance in years as Patrick's football fanatic father. Much like Lawrence, De Niro is able to make his character grow, even with limited screen time. He also draws a surprising sympathy from the audience despite his unlikeability. Jacki Weaver should not go unmentioned. Her sociopathic character in Animal Kingdom was the black horse of the Oscar's in 2010. Weaver makes due with a small role that would go unnoticed with any other actress. <br/><br/>Overall O'Russel makes has the perfect balance of comedy and uneasiness that should be in a drama. He adds romance without making it the main focus, a triumph for a genre usually clouded with clichés. The script should be in the runnings for award shows this season, as it deftly handles the reality of mental illness without losing it's heart along the way. <br/><br/>Silver linings is in my top ten this year, check it out while its still in theatres."

Maybe they were depicting a clinical condition accurately or brilliantly, but that ain't entertainment to me. I just feel offended and roughed up.

"scottb-143-356137","10","6","11","28 July 2013"," Not only a great Rom-Com but a Fantastic Movie
","Whenever i think of the genre of romantic comedy what springs to mind is a cheesy film with a load of same old same old actors that are there for the pay packet, and after the film is finished you don't even remember the characters names. This Movie is a cut above the rest, i was worried that the big names would kill the films soul but it only fueled it. I did not remember i was watching a film the whole way through i thought i was just observing the fascinating lives of Tiffany and Pat, the characters were built and portrayed so perfectly that they were almost like these weren't actors these were real people.<br/><br/>Where the story makes itself for me is in the style it is created with great emphasis on emotion and portrayed the mental illness of the characters perfectly. there was no lack of depth in the film and it felt like 2hours of breathtaking because the film was astounding.<br/><br/>Many people criticise the Oscars for some of the awards it has given out, but in my opinion anyone who criticises them for awarding best actress to Jennifer Lawrence is clearly blind. I have to say that Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany was an absolute perfect casting decision because she is arguably right now one of the greatest actresses on the planet and if anyone disagrees then maybe they should watch this film and Winter's Bone because for a girl that had no acting classes she is phenomenal. The way she blends between sanity and mental illness in this film is impeccable you will not even notices it because from the first moment you meet her you have already forgot that its Jennifer Lawrence from the hunger games and engrossed yourself in the world of silver linings playbook, only great actors can pull that off and i have to say that this performance puts her down as a great.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper was also stunning in the film i was worried that his humorous side would make him lose track of his character but boy was i wrong. honestly if it wasn't for Daniel Day-Lewis performance in Lincoln then i believe Bradley Cooper would have an Oscar right now too. Humor is seen at sometimes but only when necessary this is a very serious performance from Cooper and it is probably his best performance to date.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about the great characters and the astounding directing but i will simply end with the statement that this is the best Romantic Comedy i have ever seen. 10/10"

","In spite of all the good reviews and high IMDb score, I did not have very high expectations of this movie. However, I did expect a good quality romcom. Well, it turned out to be a mind-blowing bad movie. In fact, I can't think of one good thing to say about it. The writing, the acting, the directing, etc. - it was all bad. There was no chemistry between the main characters. Not funny, not touching, very pretentious and stupid. The story was unoriginal, predictable and boring. The only mystery about this movie is its Oscar nominations and an Oscar Win! I guess, Oscars can now be bought in Hollywood if you have the well-paid campaign behind it. A true disappointment."
"Felix-28","5","7","14","23 February 2013"," A mess
","I really cannot understand all the glowing comments about this film. I thought it was a complete shambles.<br/><br/>I think the basic problem is that no-one seems to have subjected the script to critical analysis. If they had, they might have found lurking in there a nice little film about mentally ill people finding ways to help one another to cope with themselves and with society. What we have instead is a mess of silly plot contrivances, incomprehensible characters and a ridiculously confected happy ending.<br/><br/>Just consider the principal characters one by one.<br/><br/>Pat. For most of the film he's an out-of-control manic depressive whose mood swings and violent outbursts bring him into constant conflict, often violent, with almost everyone he comes in contact with. Then suddenly, with absolutely no reason given, he becomes at the end of the film a support for Tiffany, a reasonable ex-husband of his wife Nicki, and generally an admirable citizen. A theme for the first half of the movie is his refusal to take his medication because it makes him ""fuzzy""; then there's a single scene where he takes his pills; and from then on the pills don't get a single mention. Does he take them consistently or not? Do they make him fuzzy or not? What's the point of introducing the theme and not concluding it?<br/><br/>Tiffany. I'm afraid that the constant switches from in control to out of control were just too much for me. <br/><br/>The father. I have to confess that I've never been a fan of Robert de Niro: as an actor, he seems to me to be great at playing Italian gangsters but not much else. Here however the problem is with the part. Is he an obsessive/compulsive or not? Half the time he's rational; half the time he's not. He's a bookmaker, and apparently a successful one, but he backs his sentimental favourites. Real bookmakers don't do that, and if they do, they don't survive in business for very long. <br/><br/>The black friend, Eddie. Again, he goes, without explanation, from a nutter obsessed with his hair to a normal, rational human being.<br/><br/>And I can't resist a word about the doctor. He was good, even outstanding, as a doctor. I could even believe him when he revealed at his consulting room door that he was an Eagles fan. But when he turned up at a game IN FACE PAINT, I'm afraid it was the point at which I decided, once and for all, that the film had no hope of redemption.<br/><br/>I read somewhere that Sydney Pollack had agreed to make this film but died before he could get started; and that he had said that it would be a very difficult film because if its mixture of styles. Pollack was a master and he could have done it, I think, but it would have been a shorter film and one from which many ingredients had been deleted. The film ended up being made by the person who wrote the screenplay, and one can't help thinking that he lacked the objectivity to see the glaring faults in the screen play and jettison or fix them.<br/><br/>The one person I except from criticism is Jackie Weaver. Her part was very small and her character had the huge virtue of being consistent throughout. I thought she did a very good job as the loving mother at the end of her tether."

I mean, I know that every screenwriter has his own vision of the book, but come on people, this is just too much. I couldn't wait to see the movie after I read the book and when I did...I couldn't believe that he completely change it. I loved the book, it was much more intense than the movie. He only finds out in the end the reason why he was in the mental institution (in the book), which kept me so interested, and whether it was really Nikki writing him the letters or Tiffany, and if it were Nikki, would she have met him for closure? Even his name is changed, from Pat Peoples...to Pat whatever. Oh, so many things... too many things to be said about this great book. I would have loved to see this movie with (more) excitement if it would have respected the story more.<br/><br/>Such a big disappointment..."

","The climax of the film, SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK, is a dance. Fitting—that's how I saw the entire film. As a dance. It's a beautiful dance in which immensely talented actors go toe-to-toe in a fiery tango and a director at the top of his game twirls his camera around effortlessly. <br/><br/>The chemistry between Bradley Cooper's Pat and Jennifer Lawrence's Tiffany is heaven-brewed. For that matter, even the supporting roles and minor roles all blend perfectly. As Pat's father, Robert DeNiro hasn't had material this good in a long time and he notably relishes in it. Watching him and Lawrence go at it is enthralling—she has no fear. Jacki Weaver, playing Pat's mom, deserves a shout-out. Juxtaposing her character with David O. Russell's most recent film-mother in THE FIGHTER, played by Melissa Leo, Weaver works with a subtle ferocity, as opposed to Leo's garish ferocity. The subtlety does more for me.<br/><br/>Speaking of Russell—it appears he's getting better and better with each subsequent film. I enjoyed THE FIGHTER but I wasn't head over heels for it. With SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK, I can safely say that my heels are high over my head. I'm in love with this movie and what Russell has crafted from Matthew Quick's novel. The film is pure emotion—hilarious and heartbreaking. It's a helluva dance.<br/><br/>The finale that is the dance scene featuring Pat and Tiffany echoes the mood swings of the characters (DeNiro's Pat, Sr. included) as well as the offbeat quirks of human nature and life, which are on display, without filter, throughout the film. This movie gets it. It's one of the best of the year. But you don't have to take my word for it—perhaps my head is in the clouds. Perhaps, like Pat, I believe in silver linings. Perhaps I'm just a sucker for an occasional happy ending. I don't know. Like I said, you don't have to take my word for it. You should see for yourself."

","One of the best films I've seen this year. The fact that both Pat and Tiffany are equally as damaged and have experienced similar tragic events prior to meeting makes for some very hilarious, yet compelling scenes. Two people who are seen as clinically insane by many people around them and have strong sexual tension between each other proved to be very entertaining! This movie was the perfect balance of funny, sweet and sad.

"estebangonzalez10","9","5","9","23 January 2013"," Neurotic, crazy, funny, screwball romantic comedy
","¨The only way to beat my crazy was by doing something even crazier. Thank you. I love you. I knew it from the moment I saw you. I'm sorry it took me so long to catch up. ¨<br/><br/>Silver Linings Playbook is director David O. Russell's second straight Oscar nominated film for Best Picture after the his critically acclaimed The Fighter. This film is very different from his previous work although it also has to do with family relationships in some sort of way. It is based on Matthew Quick's novel of the same name and the screenplay was adapted by Russell himself which resulted in a really quirky but sharp script. There are plenty of hilarious moments in the movie and Russell has really raised the bar for rom-coms by mixing it with some realistic drama. These romantic comedies are very hard to come across these days, but Russell manages to deliver a nearly perfect one thanks to his sensitive direction. He did take a huge risk with this film considering its thematic was a bit tricky since the main character does require some patience and forgiveness from the viewer. He is not a very likable character at the beginning, but if you stick with him and give him a second chance he will win you over. It is not easy to make a romantic film when you have two main characters suffering from bipolar and OCD disorders, and on top of that mix it with comedy, but Russell was very sensitive about the subject. I really love Russell's style of direction, and you either love his movies or hate them. I really found this movie to be easy to connect with as it is a heartwarming and funny story despite the complications and tricky subject matter. Critics are calling this film crazy good, and I agree with them because it is deeply romantic despite being strange and neurotic. Besides we are all a little crazy, and I think Russell was pointing that out through every character in this film. <br/><br/>We are introduced to Pat (Bradley Cooper) in the very first scene of the movie, who is being discharged from a mental institution by his mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver) against medical advice. Apparently Pat was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after finding his wife, Nikki (Brea Bee), having an affair with a fellow co-worker and nearly beating him to death. He was sentenced to be institutionalized for eight months, and after doing so his mother was free to take him back to Philadelphia as long as he live with his parents and stayed away from his wife who had placed a restraining order on him. Pat is received with some surprise by his father, Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro), who had no idea he was coming home, but Is happy to have his son back who he considers a lucky charm for the Eagles' games. Pat Sr. is a very superstitious guy and after losing his job he's been making a living through sports gambling. Pat's life changes when he meets another troubled woman named Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who has recently become a widow and a sex addict. Pat desperately wants to get back with Nikki and will do what it takes to win her back despite not being able to get near her. Tiffany offers to give Nikki a letter from him if he agrees to enter a dance competition with her for which they will have to rehearse extensively. Both characters suffer several meltdowns and seem to have some sort of shared neuroses, but in some odd way they end up helping one another and struggle together to rebuild their lives.<br/><br/>This film really deserves all the buzz that it received first from TIFF way back in September, and then from its recent eight Oscar nominations, including the big five (Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay) which hadn't happened since 2004 (Million Dollar Baby), and it also received Oscar nominations in all four acting categories, which hadn't happened since 1981 (Reds). The cast is truly wonderful in this film, everyone gives such great performances. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence both expanded their range in this film and went way out of their usual comfort zone creating some unique characters. Lawrence especially surprised me with her quirky performance, and her entrance in the film truly shifts the momentum of the movie. I was really not sold with Silver Lining Playbook until she appeared giving Cooper's character a lot more likability. I loved her in two scenes; the first being the one she has a meltdown in the restaurant and goes off on Cooper and the second being the confrontation she had with Pat Sr. For those two scenes alone, Lawrence could win the Oscar. Cooper, De Niro, and Weaver were all outstanding as well. These characters were all well drawn and the actors took advantage of that delivering solid performances. The film has such a great pacing building the momentum up to the very climactic ballroom dance routine. It was something special. The message had a pretty positive outlook as Russell seemed to be reminding us that we should all look for a partner that can coexist with our craziness and not try to find one that will lead us out of it as we usually do. This was a great and optimistic film that deserves all the buzz it has been receiving.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","I was getting tired of re-watching my favorite movies so I decided to try this one out, as it got good reviews and won some awards. And I'm baffled why. Maybe because it tried to be different? I definitely could see an attempt at it. But different is not necessarily good. It appeared that it was trying to be different for different's sake, not trying to be a good original story.<br/><br/>The essence of a good rom-com is the chemistry between the two protagonists. Everything else is just filler. In very good rom-com's, the filler is interesting as well. But in this one, the filler was uninteresting and contrived. And there was a lot of it. It took a good half hour or so before we got to see Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence together. And when we finally got to see that, it was disappointing. They are fine actors on their own but do not have much chemistry together. No chemistry between the romantic couple and an uninteresting story in this movie. So what's it got? Not much."

","Watched the film with my other half as thought this would be a good rom com with a different theme, however by half way through I wasn't sure if my wife wanted to continue or switch it off. I agree with some of the other reviews on here that the film doesn't dealt with mental illness very we'll, however I'm not sure that was the point of the film in the fist place. The first half was just a bit boring, some slightly amusing parts but not much else in the comedy department. The romance never feels like a romance as the connection between the two leads just doesn't fit properly. The performances from Mr Cooper and Miss Lawrence are very good and it has to be said I think they save this entire movie from being a total turkey. The last 20 minutes has some good tension as they approach the competition, it's just all a bit too much like hard work getting there and staying with it. Worth a watch but not worth much else."
"sayloroct","1","6","12","2 September 2013"," Proof That Ratings Are Meaningless
","You instantly know that you are in trouble when the lead characters bond during discussion of psychotropic meds that they've been taking for their various mental disturbances. This is a new low in cute-meet, rom-coms. Since the main characters don't supply enough psychosis, there is the father with OCD for good measure. Maybe other people find mentally disturbed, erratic and violent characters a cute, but I don't. <br/><br/>It is hard to pinpoint whether Bradley Cooper's dreadful acting excesses were due to his lack of talent or, heaven-forbid, were exactly what the director wanted. In either case, I wanted to reach through the screen, grab him by the neck and tell him to shut up. As if this wasn't annoying enough, there was Robert De Niro's as his father to add two more forms of mental disturbance. He is an Eagle's fan and has OCD. Which is the worse mental illness is debatable, but enough is enough. There is hardly a quiet sane moment in the film. De Niro, by far the most overrated actor of the last 40 years, is his usual grumbling self. Since he said ""This is this"" in the Deer Hunter in 1978, he has been said every single line exactly the same. Jennifer Lawrence was the least annoying character, but she had her moments.<br/><br/>You can't help wonder why such a movie as bad as this gets such positive reviews. There is a apparently a large, devoted audience for maudlin, feel-good romances involving annoying people. As long as the couple ends up together, that seems to be all that matters. Steal a subplot from ""Shall We Dance"" for good measure and, voilà la, we have a winner. <br/><br/>There must be a strong self selection process in who goes to see such movies. The people who chose to see them are the kind of people to whom such sentimental trash appeals, so they are naturally likely to give it a good review. I saw it on an airplane for free because there nothing else but ""blow em up"" action and scifi movies and kid's stuff. Next time, I'll take a good book."
"lossowitz","5","6","12","24 March 2013"," Without a strategy you get nowhere
","'You need a strategy!' is the advice that Pat's therapist gives him to master his bipolar disorder and the violent outbursts that come with it. This is good advice, and something that the writer/director should have taken himself, as it seems to be the thing this movie lacks.<br/><br/>First, this is not a comedy. There are no jokes,no humorous situations, and the witty quips are seldom spot on. The movie unfolds as a dramatic story of a psychiatric patient's reintegration in society after his treatment. A valuable cause that is played out pleasurably understated, and confronts the audience with the tension between theory and practice, and how families and patients cope. It helps that Pat is played by the hunky Bradley Cooper who oozes good will, for some decisions Pat makes border on dangerous ground.<br/><br/>Enter Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany, a fellow patient, struggling with the loss of her husband; okay, two people in their craziness against the world, that is a theme. But just as the movie lingers on, seemingly about the daily life of these people and their families, we are confronted with some sidelines, and without a warning we are just a few plot twists away from a dance therapy center for troubled youth, and could the movie be renamed Step Up 5 or Dirty Dancing 3.<br/><br/>Then we get the relapse (on a very sunny and warm day for December), and a crazy bet that is such an obvious plot device to 'wrap it all up' that the rest of the movie is as predictable as it gets, abandoning the theme, changing from perspective (to Tiffany's) and all secondary characters join in the victory and the get together of the two leads, when suddenly it is suggested that Tiffany wasn't crazy at all and just played crazy to gain Pat's trust to get closer to him. Oh what? <br/><br/>It unnerves me that Jennifer Lawrence has received an Academy Award for this role of a crazy, non-crazy, lying, non-lying woman, so very unsympathetic and so badly written. Robert de Niro displays all the laziness he gets away with, culminating in an atrociously acted angry scene, exemplary for first year drama students. Cooper forgets in the last quarter of the film that he is a psychiatric patient, becoming the sensible, down to earth, perfect specimen of a man as by magic.<br/><br/>Not a comedy, not a drama and certainly not a dance movie (with such an important dancing scene one would hope they hired actors who could actually dance a little bit and not strut around like vegetables on sleeping meds). A very mediocre effort on all accounts."
"non-thomas","4","6","12","24 March 2013"," boring and oh so predictable
","The story takes a long and circuitous path to get to the predictable ending. Wished I had watched it on DVD so that I could have fast forwarded to shorten by at least 50%. Why Jennifer Lawrence got her Oscar on the strength of this film/performance above other contenders is a total mystery. If this is a story about someone recovering from a mental condition then that seems to take second place to the predictable story line about boy meets girl/ they both have issues/they sort out the issues and live happy ever after (as does every one else in the movie) The secondary story line about father's (Robert de Niro) gambling only serves to add to the predictability of the ending. If this is supposed to be a 'feel good movie' it certainly did not work for me"
"kosmasp","8","4","7","13 August 2013"," De Niro is back
","While the big headlines might be taken by the Oscar nominated lead actors (and also Oscar winner, regarding Jennifer Lawrence), the other good news is that De Niro finally had a role he could relish in again. And a role we as viewers would actually like to see him in too. There have been a few lesser roles he played over the past couple of years. And while he is never able to completely disappoint, you won't remember him for a movie called ""Freelancers"" and others in that vain.<br/><br/>But back to the leading couple. A couple that is really so far apart, that you know what that ultimately means for them. But Bradley Coopers character has a lot more going on than that. There are relationships that went wrong and it's really tough sometimes to watch him destroying himself or at least attempting to. A very good movie, with great dialog"
"Sergeant_Tibbs","8","4","7","26 June 2013"," Genuinely witty, genuinely emotional and very compassionate with a great sense of how far to escalate a scene.
","I was quite excited for Silver Linings Playbook earlier in the year when it seemed to be the big hit comedy drama like Sideways, Little Miss Sunshine and Beginners that I find myself adoring. Then the trailers came and made it look like a messy chick flick shot by an amateur and my expectations plummeted. I had no intentions of even seeing it in the cinema but I'm really glad I did because it fulfilled the big hit comedy and more. What's so special about this simplistic film is that it comes straight from the heart. I've never been too much of a fan of David O. Russell. I Heart Huckabees seemed like a surefire winner for me but it missed the mark. The Fighter and Three Kings were good, but cold. Silver Linings is the film to prove Russell's worth. It's a very special experience that I already want to see again. It's very entertaining and easy to relate to so it cuts straight to the core. Although it is rough around the edges and the third act is a little cluttered, the second act is absolutely wonderful and is enough to make it great.<br/><br/>The most impressive aspect about the film is the intricate production design, with a very delicate and seemingly deliberate use of colour coding for each scene in subtle hues, it's one of its most consistent and interesting aspects as well as cinematic push ins on characters in dramatic moments. The script is what makes the film, fast paced, genuinely witty, genuinely emotional and very compassionate with a great sense of how far to escalate a scene. It's so great to see Robert De Niro great again after so long. His part is small and to the side and focused on two particular aspects, but it's classic De Niro that has been sorely missed with a few emotional scenes. Bradley Cooper is the real revelation here. I enjoyed him in The Hangover even though I didn't enjoy that film, but here he really emotes and his comedic side is put to best use. He really is deserving of all the acclaim. Jennifer Lawrence is certainly great, but if she were to win the Oscar for this it would probably draw far too much negative attention to being overrated as she was better in Winter's Bone. Easily one of my favourites of the year.<br/><br/>8/10"
"williamhume","9","4","7","20 June 2013"," A Feel Good Romantic Comedy
","I went into Silver Linings Playbook with a sense of optimism. I had gotten free tickets to this through a promotional deal so I had no personal investment going in. Being advertised as the feel good movie of the year I must say that this movie totally delivers, it wasn't even until I left the theatre that I realized I was watching a romantic comedy. The movie walks a thin line between adult-oriented family drama, and romantic comedy. It is a tricky tone to establish if any major department comes up short. Fortunately, the writing clicks, the direction is solid, and the actors have enough chemistry to make you forget your watching a movie; at least until the curtains come up.<br/><br/>I usually don't like Bradley Cooper (38) as he often plays too much of a jerk in his movies; typecast as a cocky womanizer in most of his other roles, but I was surprised he was able to put together a performance where he was just crazy enough for the audience to relate to, but not too far gone to be alienating.<br/><br/>Having just seen ""The Hunger Games"", I initially figured Jennifer Lawrence (22) was far too young to play a widow, but she is often able to bring a certain amount of maturity to the roles she takes on. This is vital to a film that casts to lead actors with 15 years between them to carry on a chemistry that is believable and it mostly works.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the acting Robert De Niro seems to have more life in him in this role than we've seen in years. I particularly loved the scene where he is speaking to Bradley Cooper's character asking him to spend some quality father and son time watching a football game with him. The emotions of disappointment wash over his face in one of the films standout moments.<br/><br/>The remaining cast acts as filler serving the main performances. You get fills Jacki Weaver acting as a stereotypical old age mother, and have Chris Tucker also pops in for a few funny scenes to sport extra comic- relief. Overall the ensemble works just as it should with performances that slightly elevate standard rom-com material.<br/><br/>In a crowded holiday season, I like to look for a real gem and this movie stands out as one of the better films of 2012, and will most likely get Oscar attention from the academy come awards season.<br/><br/>Overall Grade: +2/ B+"
"Jakealope","3","5","10","18 May 2013"," A trainload of corn syrup and chicken schmaltz derailed
","I just don't see what was so great about this film, except it was A list budget so it could hire good actors & other stuff to make it a polished work. Don't get me wrong, I like romantic comedies, chick flicks and predictable happy endings. Not every movie has to be some apocalyptic epic full of extreme violence, gore, the undead and mass explosions. But this movie was so full of sugar, it could rot your teeth out. Don't get me wrong, mental illness doesn't have to be treated reverently in some melodramatic fashion, but this movie had about as much relation to real mental illness and sufferers as ""Hogan's Heroes"" had to WW 2 POWs.<br/><br/>Apparently everyone around Pat Jr, the Bradley Cooper character, seemed to be pulling for him, ready to bend over backwards to help him out. The whole upper working class neighborhood milieu, were Philadelphia Eagles football fans. His father, Pat Sr. my fave De Niro, was the only saving grace in the movie. Dad was an uber superstitious football fan & bookie too. The Sunday game was the center of family life. Even the local cop, who showed up every time he was almost going to violate the restraining order of his ex wife or the frequent heated arguments he got into with parents and locals, was on his side, pulling for him. The multicultural crew included his Indian shrink, who was also a Philly Eagle fan like everyone else, and Chris Tucker, a black fellow inmate from the mental institute who was around for PC comic relief as a semi permanent guest at the Solitano residence. No racism here. The only one who wasn't a foot ball van was Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence, the widowed bipolar nympho. I like her a lot too, but I simply don't see her work as Oscar material just because the movie sucked so bad.<br/><br/>The whole plot seemed to be, if you fall in love with the other mentally disturbed woman who wants you, and give up trying to win back your cheating ex wife. all will be well. There was no sense that the two were working on their mental health issues at all. No breakthroughs, no growing up, no revealing group therapy scenes. Compare that to dated-due-to-the-breakdown of the family ""Ordinary People"" I watched recently. While that was a drama, it won an Oscar by having some realism and recovery, not by pretending that romantic love is the mental health panacea. Here, the families will all love you and dad will win his bet and get enough money to buy the restaurant and the two losers will live happily ever after at their parent's house, doing an occasional dance contest. The two beautiful mental patients will finally declare their love for each other on a Holiday Season decorated city street at night right out of an old MGM musical.<br/><br/>Even the whole dance contest, the crux of the budding Pat & Tiffany relationship, was given short shrift. The DVD had tons of deleted scenes of the two practicing but that was all cut out in the theatrical version. There was simply too much schmaltz for me to take seriously! And what were the plays in that lined play book anyways?"
"tanjac25","5","5","10","11 March 2013"," Not so good....
","I watched this film last night, and I can say, I expected more from the movie nominated for Oscar award,and the movie with high marks. It is in a way different from other romantic comedies but, I think the director lost himself somewhere between drama and comedy. Neither of them was successful. It reminds me of some other movies in some scenes, like Hangover, or similar movies. The actors are also nothing special, De Niro, already seen in Analyze This....The atmosphere of the film is all the time funny but the theme is pretty serious. It doesn't deserve the marks it has. We don't see why the protagonist has so many problems with rage and violence. His wife and her behavior is the cause but not the reason for all the trouble."
"dfranzen70","9","5","10","5 January 2013"," A book with plenty of tricks up its sleeve
","Silver Linings Playbook, by David O. Russell, is one of those movies with a protagonist whom you fervently wish can overcome his demons but whose methods and goals you cannot easily reconcile. The movie is witty, foul-mouthed, very poignant, elegant, and, of course, odd.<br/><br/>Pat (Bradley Cooper, playing way against type) has just been released from an eight-month mental-health-facility. His doctors are reluctant, but his mother (Jacki Weaver) insists he's better and that the place is, well, no place for him. She brings Pat back home to live with her and Pat's father Pat Sr. (Robert DeNiro), hoping that after eight months Pat will be able to get his life back in order once again.<br/><br/>Pat, though, has other plans. He had been committed to the hospital because he violently beat a fellow teacher whom he had caught in the shower with his wife. Okay, so he snapped - he was lucky that hospital care was all he got. In any event, what he wants to do now is reconcile with his wife and resume his life. Sure, there's a restraining order, which is why he goes to the trouble of reading the books she teaches in her English class, anything to prove he's more mentally fit. Oh, during his stay he loses a lot of weight (apparently), something his then-wife had harped on. (Note: She sounds like a winner to me.)<br/><br/>Things do not go as planned. For one thing, Pat never takes his medication (he's bipolar), which leads to the occasional angry outburst; the song that had been played at his wedding and was played while his wife took her infamous shower is now a trigger for more violent behavior, even when he doesn't hear it. He wants badly to make amends, but he's aiming in the wrong direction, as his ex shows no signs of wishing to see him again.<br/><br/>To help him along, friends Ronnie and Veronica ask Pat over to dinner, and they invite Veronica's iconoclastic sister Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), who has social skills that are below even Pat's. The dinner isn't exactly a disaster, but Tiffany leaves abruptly and has Pat walk her home. A kindred friendship is born.<br/><br/>Although the reason for Tiffany's behavior is somewhat important to the plot, I won't mention it here, but somehow she sees something in Pat, something honest, someone she can relate to. Meanwhile, Pat Sr., a huge Philadelphia Eagles fan, considers his son to be a lucky charm and practically begs Pat to stay and watch the game with him on Sundays. Pat Sr. desperately wishes to reconnect with his son (there's a recurring theme), but Pat is ambivalent. To cope with his own emotions, he jogs. A lot.<br/><br/>The emotional tug of war, punctuated by the Pat's own inability to control himself (still no meds for him) begins to ebb a little when Tiffany makes him a deal: she'll do something for him (not spoiling) and in exchange he will be her dance partner. You see, Tiffany studies dance as a way to cope with her demons, and there's a gala competition coming up - but one cannot compete without a partner, and she has nobody. Even her parents are wary of her. So that's the deal.<br/><br/>So on the one hand you have Pat Sr. believing his son is a lucky charm and wanting to spend more time with him anyway, and on the other hand you have Tiffany, who offers to help Pat achieve his overall goal if he'll help her. There's a lot of bickering back and forth among everyone; that is, when there's no jogging involved (note: there's plenty).<br/><br/>Okay, enough about the plot; I'll stop before I do give something away. Let's look at the performances. Cooper is exceptional. We've seen him be kind of a jerk in The Hangover and a ladies' man in The A Team, and here he is as a completely conflicted man who desperately wishes to reach a goal for which he's striven for eight months. His is a raw, laid-bare performance. <br/><br/>Lawrence is truly stunning as the somewhat-unstable Tiffany. She's passionate, angry, caring, bitter, sweet, and she possesses even more charisma than she did in The Hunger Games or Winter's Bone. Her jaw- dropping work here is very much deserving of award recognition; Tiffany can be brutal and brittle and still completely endearing. It's the best work Lawrence has done in her short but strong career.<br/><br/>Surprisingly to me, though, the standout in this cast is DeNiro. Now, DeNiro has been sort of phoning it in for a few years now, with the exception (perhaps) of movies like Limitless and Stardust. But here he really shines; it's possibly his best work since at least the 1990s. I've seen tough guys on camera get emotional, and often it just doesn't work. They can't sell it. There's a rare breed of actor who can do the macho angle and the sensitive angle and do it justice, and DeNiro, particularly here, pulls it off. Pat Sr., himself an emotional fellow, is a man full of love and passion and a man who is not without some regrets on how he's raised his kids. DeNiro brings all of that out flawlessly.<br/><br/>Silver Linings Playbook is not a lighthearted movie. It's compelling drama led by a cast composed of relative neophytes and grizzled veterans. It's quirky, just like its director, and it is a clear-cut winner. Here's the best thing I can say about the movie: It feels authentic. When someone is hurt, I feel bad for them; I don't feel that they're staging it. The script is original and idiosyncratic, and every morsel of every scene is one to cherish."

","I go to movies for A) a good story,B) to watch transformational actors and C) being hopelessly drawn in to a world that is both none of my own making, but resonating and breathing with universal emotional connection and humanity. And this film was like having all of my own emotions placed in a Cuisinart and processed on ""high."" And I mean that in the best possible way. Bradley Cooper, whose other films I'd never seen was a strong pivotal character who never had a break. Even when focused on others like Mr. DeNiro, Brad was always in the background. DeNiro and Jennifer Lawrence were superb, as were all the supporting cast members. The only time the film lost its grip for me was when Jennifer's character, Tiffany, who had previously proclaimed no interest football, gave a performance not unlike Marisa Tomei in ""My Cousin Vinny,"" when she suddenly became an unstoppable informed witness on Pontiac tires. Tiffany had a similar moment where she took over the living room with a huge and informed monologue about football. That said, it was integral to the plot and the remainder of the story. I loved the visuals of the Halloween revelers, the diner scene (which I anticipated with both anxiousness and child-like glee) and of course the ever-present Christmas theme (almost can't make a movie without-certainly not a romantic one.) Pretend we are talking about wine. This film had tones of the 1970's with its sloppy and scrappy humanity, Bradley Cooper could have been Woody Allen in some scenes, and the therapy scenes recalled ""Ordinary People."" A great movie about life, love, family and crazy people which is never maudlin, nor preachy. The acting, directing, and cinematography was all perfectly meshed. I suspect there will be awards."

","Silver Linings Playbook (2012) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>Excellent performances highlight writer-director David O Russell's story of Pat (Bradley Cooper), a mentally unstable man who moves back in with his parents (Robert DeNiro, Jacki Weaver) after being released from a stint in an asylum. Once out he plans on trying to get back with his ex-wife but the restraining orders keeps him from doing so until he meets an equally disturbed young woman named Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence). SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK contains some of the best performances you're going to see this year and it's great to see a film that's main focus is acting, writing, story and direction. It seems these things are awful overlooked in today's time but Russell does a very good job building up some extremely likable and believable characters and we got a terrific cast that really brings everything together. I think the main thing that makes this movie so memorable are the performances from Cooper and Lawrence who are simply wonderful. I thought the two of them did a terrific job playing disturbed without falling into any sort of stereotype. Both of them are so believable in their parts but what really caps it is the chemistry they have together. Whether it's romantic, fighting, annoying or just being calm, the two of them really deliver. DeNiro is also very memorable in his supporting bit as the father. I thought this role gave the actor a chance to do both comedy and drama and it's certainly one of his more memorable roles as of late. Weaver, Chris Tucker and Julia Stiles are also good in their supporting parts. Russell offers up a terrific atmosphere of working class Philadelphia just like he did with the setting of Massacusettes in THE FIGHTER. The only thing I'd say working against the film is that it's a tad bit too predictable and it takes a long time getting to where it's going but this here isn't all that bad since we enjoy spending time with the characters."

And the story was a little interesting, even though it lacked of depth that for me it was needed as the subject is one that raises many opinions. The camera and the scenes were all over the place though. It seemed like they were using the camera by hand as they were filming and the image kept trembling and going back and forth.

","A bit disappointing, but not entirely unexpected. Ever since this film was released, I had heard a lot of raving comments, but I was uneager to watch it as I had a feeling it was going to be a bit too much feel-good, clichéd and 'by-the-numbers'. Having seen it, I saw some 'silver linings', but it was a little too much by the 'playbook' <br/><br/>The story focuses on Pat and Tiffany with Pat being bipolar and Tiffany a grieving, sex-addicted widow. Pat just got out of a mental health facility and tries to better himself so that he may win his ex-wife, Nikki, back. He has dinner with a friend and meets Tiffany. Having taken an interest, she keeps bumping into Pat while jogging and soon enough, they start seeing each other more often. This results in Tiffany persuading Pat to participate in a dance contest to show Nikki he's changed for the better, while Tiffany sees it a chance to win him over.<br/><br/>I occasionally liked the rapid-fire dialogue and Pat's uncensored remarks (like cursing frustratedly after finishing Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms and flinging it out of a closed window), because of his lack of a social 'filter'. The film is at its best in trigger-happy moments like these, since the characters feel fun, real and engaging. This makes it all the more dreadful, when it becomes painfully obvious the film is mired in clichés. Nowhere is this more apparent than the second half of the film. Take for instance the scene where Pat is unable to resist his urge to fight when confronted with a group of violent football supporters. This is a classic example of a scene which feels unnatural. It doesn't feel like the story is evolving naturally, but more like an obligatory plot device. Another painfully obvious example is the ending which reminds me of those countless romantic comedies where the heroine runs away upon which the hero has to run after her in hopes of restoring their relationship, because (of course) they're 'meant to be'.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, this film is pretty solid, although I think Bradley Cooper deserves more credit than Jennifer Lawrence who, for me, grew tiresome towards the end. De Niro plays his best role in many years (and a bit against type as well), though unfortunately that's not saying much Overall, it's a decent feel-good film that attempts to win audiences over with an (appropriately) 'bipolar' filmic style, quick-fire dialogue and good acting, but is mired by its incredibly clichéd storyline."

","I was really excited to watch this film. Why? - The last film I had seen by David O. Russell, The Fighter, was simply amazing, - Bradley en Jennifer are good actors (although I don't adore them like a lot of people do these days), and Lawrence got an Oscar for this - The big amount of awards this film received. - The trailer looked appealing - A lot of friends recommended this film. <br/><br/>But for some reason SLP just didn't really work out for me. The main reasons: I thought it would be more funny and I never really grew to like the main characters. It has absolutely nothing to do with the acting, but I often found myself annoyed by them. I really tried to like it, and kept on thinking that the best part still had to come, but by the end of the film I felt like I had missed something. This is an okay film, but I personally don't understand why this was considered one of the best films of 2012."
"paul2001sw-1","5","3","5","25 February 2015"," Insincere
","David O. Russell's 'Silver Linings Playbook' is ultimately a disappointing film: an unconvincing portrayal of mental illness and family dysfunction, with a weak romantic comedy subplot and an utterly meaningless second subplot featuring a dance competition. The central characters are not particularly sympathetic either: if they don't convince as mentally ill, they do convince as utterly self-obsessed - the attraction that the two leads supposedly feel for each other is asserted but in no way demonstrated. It's unclear what Russell was trying to do in this movie; but it's not funny, and nothing in it feels like it comes from the heart."
"ret0005","5","3","5","13 July 2014"," Half Way There on Their Portrayal of Mental Illness
","The film 'Silver Linings Playbook' undoubtedly had flaws in its depiction of mental illness, though there were portions of the various illnesses that the creator set out to depict that were very well done.<br/><br/>While I am no expert, the manic phases that Pat went through were quite accurate and upon speaking to people with more personal experience with bipolar than myself, they said that those parts felt very familiar. On the other hand, there was no substantial mention of depressive phases, Pat instead went between Angry (a form of mania) and Energetic (another form of mania). Also, while the depression that Tiffany went through in the past sounded very typical, during the time frame of the film there was nothing to suggest that she was any more than a moody young person. Danny, in the short snippets of the film that he featured, did a fairly good job of portraying OCD and given more time on screen he could perhaps have been the most accurate representation of someone who was going through a mental illness. It seemed that Silver Linings Playbook was half way there in their portrayal of mental illness, simultaneously displaying and completely avoiding aspects of life with a mental illness so for that it deserves a 5 out of 10."
"pas0011","5","3","5","25 June 2014"," Silver Linings Playbook's representation of mental illnesses
","In the ""Silver Linings Playbook"" I believe that mental illness is portrayed incorrectly. Even though the movie is set over a longer period of time than what I first thought, I felt as though the recovery of the main characters and the problems they were experiencing were resolved all too quickly. I understand this is a movie and there is a lot to cover over a short 2 hour period, however I think they could have made this movie more accurate. Pat's character was apparently suffering from bipolar disease, yet in my opinion, the spectrum and expressions of this disease were not fully shown. The symptom of Bipolar addressed in this film consisted of Pat's occasional manic episodes and breakdowns, I felt as though the director could have shown the depressive side also, perhaps when reading the books and letters or thinking about his ex wife; Nikki. Tiffany was illustrated to have been suffering from grief and I thought this role was played nicely. Tiffany's vast emotions put forward in each scene were quite accurate and she held up the disease throughout the movie as opposed to Pat who seemed to have gotten over his disease with what seemed to be four counseling sessions, two periods of taking his medication and some physical exercise; slightly unrealistic. Pat's Father obviously suffered from a mental illness also, perhaps OCD, although this characteristic was not explored at all and I believe it would have been a key in the heredity of Pat's illness and therefore definitely should have been explained and not kept in the back of the viewers mind as an unanswered question. Overall this movie was a good attempt at portraying mental illnesses to the viewing audience, however it wasn't as realistic as it could have been and there were improvements that could have been made to this film to accurately represent mental illness in society."
"MLDinTN","5","3","5","22 January 2014"," who thinks this was good? Not me
","After finally watching this over hyped film, I don't get why people think it is really good. I thought it was barely watchable because it was so boring. I don't get all the award nomination nor how Jennifer Lawerence could win an Oscar for this role. There was nothing outstanding about her character, Tiffany, to warrant a stand out role. And the worst part was the lack of chemistry between Bradly Cooper and Jennifer Lawerence. First he looks 20 years older than her, and why would a depressed widow want to hook up with a bipolar manic who has melt downs. Simple, it wouldn't happen.<br/><br/>The movie is about released mental patient, Pat, goes home and is obsessed with his estranged wife. He has mental break downs and meats Tiffany whom knows his wife. He agrees to be in a dance contest with her if she will give the wife a letter. And that's the story. Nothing much happens.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: A big waste of time and it certainly wasn't one of the best films of the year. Skip it."
"dorada_19","4","3","5","7 September 2013"," What Silver Lining? Are These People ""Crazy"" To Begin With?
","I just watched this film and the one pressing question that I had was were these characters really mentally ill to begin with? They described behaviors that are undesirable yet ambiguous. In our family's culture, Pat Jr. (Bradley Cooper) and Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) are not ""crazy"". This would be normal considering the traumatic events of both parties. <br/><br/>Pat walked in on his wife having sex with the school principal and beat him bloody. Pat was mandated to stay eight months at a mental institution instead of being sent to jail. Pat comes from a comfortable enough family for them to pay an attorney to ""facilitate"" this as opposed to serving jail time. Pat Sr. (Robert DeNiro) is a restaurant owner. Given Pat Jr's. predicament it is easy to see why the poor old man's broke.<br/><br/>Pat Sr. appears to be OCD, but he's harmless. Yes, he does appear to have a gambling problem and the film made light of that which is troubling. Gambling addiction is just as bad as drugs just because there's no illicit substance in the middle. Robert DeNiro's performance is very humane; I felt empathy for Pat Sr.<br/><br/>Dolores (Jacki Weaver) breaks my heart because I can see the pain in her eyes when dealing with the two most important men in her life with ""mental health issues"". Her voice is ignored and the men do whatever they want. She's the one who should be listened to. <br/><br/>Tiffany's nightmare began when her police officer husband had just purchased her lingerie and was killed in a car accident on his way home. Tiffany's way or mourning was to sleep with every person that she could as a means to forget. While this may be objectionable to some, this alone does not make her ""nuts"". I have a social science background and this script and direction only portrays depressed people with some anxiety features (e.g. OCD) at best. Considering the circumstances, this could be temporary for some of them. Across other cultures, these people are relatively normal considering what's happened to them. So perhaps this is white American suburbia's take on what ""mental illness"" really is.<br/><br/>The film suggests that the mental health system seeks to stigmatize and institutionalize people who don't tow the line. Perhaps the reason why the cops came over to the Solitano residence regularly and did nothing was because they may have felt that Pat Jr. was just going through a ""rough time"" after his wife Nikki (Brea Bee) left him for the school principal. This, in my opinion, is a reflection on the sad reality on the way some law enforcement handle matters of domestic violence. To this end I will not criticize the film makers.<br/><br/>I do not like the way that Tiffany's character was treated. There were so many closeups of her breasts, hips and rear end. She's supposed to be seen as a grieving widow, even if she describes herself as a little loose. She was objectified through the lens of men as if she's asking for ""it"" for being so sexual and having a hot body. Even Pat objectified her from time to time. In their final dance scene Pat practically simulates oral sex on Tiffany in front of the audience with his soon to be ex-wife, ex-sister-in-law, friends and family. Is the director trying to say that mentally ill people are so not with it that they would do something ""crazy"" like recreate sex in public, that is exhibitionism? By the way exhibitionism is a paraphilia and not a mood disorder.<br/><br/>The annoying kid who always came to the Solitano residence with his video phone to ""conduct"" mock interviews and ridicule Pat Jr., Ricky D'Angelo (Matthew Russell), disturbed me. What a lack of manners. Even when I was that age I knew better than to bother others, especially people with ""issues"". This obviously shows that this kid has no culture whatsoever and who is responsible for that? That's alone to make anybody crazy.<br/><br/>I could not understand why Nikki showed up the Pat's dance competition if she had a restraining order against him. Isn't she supposed to be scared? Also, would her new man approve of this considered that he received a bad beat down? Then, she even had an intimate conversation with her ex afterwards. Nothing in her looked like a domestic violence victim. This portrayal totally undermines the women who may be going through this for real. <br/><br/>It was refreshing to see the director use racism as a parallel against the discrimination and that the mentally ill experience in the Asian Invasion scene. That was actually touching because Dr. Patel was one of the people assaulted, and he was a good source of support to Pat Jr.<br/><br/>Although I am not from Philly, I spent time in Massachusetts and New Jersey, and there are things that I could definitely relate to. One of them were the bushy deciduous trees, traditional styled homes, Pat dunking a biscotti into his coffee, the passion for hometown football, late night diners, narrow streets lined with parked cars and antique looking schools. <br/><br/>David O. Russell captured the nuances of these details perfectly. I just wish the rest of the film would have been more cohesive and compelling. I will say that the all of the actors are great in their own right, and each add their grain of sand to the whole plot."

I felt a certain tension and it held on until the very end.I also was very impressed with the acting of both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. I knew Bradley Cooper from Limitless and I had to adapt to the role he played here, but after a short while I was fully adapted. Jennifer Lawrence was also a familiar face. I met her in the Hunger Games. At first I missed Katniss a little bit, but it turned out there was an awesome character replacing her: Tiffany."

","Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) lives with his father Patrizio (Robert De Niro) and mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver) after a stay at a mental hospital. His friend Danny McDaniels (Chris Tucker) is also a patient. He is introduced to depressed widower Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence) who is dealing by having casual sex. He reluctantly agrees to join her in a dance competition.<br/><br/>As a rom-com, it's fun and functional. Cooper and Lawrence are two performers overflowing with charm. As a family drama dealing with mental illness, it doesn't hurt to have De Niro. As a comedy, it's got a few good laughs. What puts it over the top is Jennifer Lawrence. She's electric as soon as she shows up in the movie. She has some great exchanges with Bradley Cooper.<br/><br/>If there is any complaint, it's that there seems to be some missing scenes that's usually needed in rom-com. The movie is already 2hrs long, so I can understand some scenes were trimmed. The deleted scenes section has the necessary bits. Check it out. This is definitely worthy of recommendation."
"thisglimpse-1","8","3","5","17 July 2013"," Turning romcom conventions on their heads
","David O. Russell is making a name for himself by taking terribly conventional scripts/plots and turning out remarkably original movies full of life and energy. He did it first with ""Three Kings,"" but then again, and with more accolades with ""The Fighter,"" which on paper was just another movie about an underdog boxer, but on screen was fascinating, funny, and one of the best sports films to come along in years. And now he's back with ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" and he's doing the same thing for the romantic-comedy-amongst-kooks genre.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper plays a guy fresh out of a mental hospital after nearly beating his wife's lover to death. He's trying hard to be better, and even harder to convince everyone else that he's better. His friends hook him up with Jennifer Lawrence, who, since her cop husband died in a freak accident, has slept with nearly everyone in town. The motives of his friends are questionable. Are they trying to get him laid so that he'll forget about his ex-wife? That's super sketchy, since Lawrence is clearly dealing with her own craziness and needs people around her who will protect her, not enable her.<br/><br/>But then it becomes clear that just about everyone in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is some kind of crazy. It's sort of the mirror image of ""Arrested Development."" In that show, Jason Bateman thinks he's the only sane one surrounded by a bunch of lunatics, but really, he's just as nuts as everyone else. Here, Bradley Cooper thinks he's the one with mental issues surrounded by normal people, but everyone else is just as insane as he is.<br/><br/>Take, for instance, his father, played by Robert De Niro. He's a bookie and a passionate, superstitious Eagles fan. He honestly seems to think that the way he holds a certain handkerchief has an effect on the outcome of the game. De Niro believes that Cooper watching the game with him makes a difference. That's insane. Betting on it is even more insane. That's a weird pressure to put on somebody - I'm betting heavy because I believe you're good luck and the Eagles are going to win because you're at the game. Not playing IN the game, AT the game. You can't do anything REAL to help the team win the game, you can't take the field and catch a touchdown pass, so if they lose and you were there being good luck, what then? You didn't do enough? Didn't do what enough? If my dad bet all he had on a football game because he believed that my good luck presence was going to determine the game - me one out of 50,000 fans attending, 150,000 watching -- I would have a nervous breakdown right then and there.<br/><br/>Lawrence is the hero of the film because instead of resisting everyone's craziness, she just meets them in it. In the best sequence of the movies (and one of the best sequences in movies, period,) instead of telling De Niro that he's insane to think that his son's relationship with her is detrimental to the Eagles, she just goes with it. And she's done her research. I love the way this whole sequence is filmed, directed and acted. There are so many characters involved, really involved in this scene; there's so much energy to it. The plot mechanics are pretty straight forward; you need to film a confrontation scene that ends with this crazy bet upon which the rest of the film will be predicated. But the way it's handled is so loose -- and frenetic -- that it really feels like a situation that just evolves into what it becomes. Nothing feels forced. And so a really implausible plot point -- the calling card of nearly all romantic comedies -- feels honestly believable. <br/><br/>All of ""Silver Linings Playbo0k"" feels messy, loose and thrown together. At first glance, you'd think the director is hardly in control of what's going on here. But on closer look, it becomes clear that this madness is by design. For instance. Russell uses the editing, and the score, to create a sense of things happening too fast, which I think is supposed to be how Cooper feels about the world - there are just too many things happening, too fast, both inside and outside of his head, for him to deal with them all. If everything would just slow down a little, he might be all right. But everything escalates. On top of that, Russell gets great, fully invested performances from everyone involved. That's no easy task, and I wonder what his secret is. Some of these actors, I've never seen them working this hard. Others, De Niro in particular, look like he just woke up from a long nap of acting in silly and stupid movies. I've stopped watching movies just because Robert De Niro is in them, but I'll hazard a guess - he hasn't been this invested since he directed himself in ""The Good Shepherd.""<br/><br/>This is a heck of a movie, and David O. Russell is a heck of a director, someone I'll definitely be watching in years to come. His movies are alive in a way a lot of movies aren't, and they're really fun and intriguing to watch."
"jxcampbell","5","3","5","20 May 2013"," clever, manipulative, formulaic
","The characters in this film barely had time to develop before the plot ruthlessly buried them in an avalanche of predictability. I was suspicious because of the title and in fact, its clever summation perfectly described what was to come: how football and dancing and romance and family are what life is all about. Blech. This was a romantic comedy with mental illness but both the leads were gorgeous and full of hidden talents.<br/><br/>I saw this at the cheap theater and my friend and I discussed leaving three quarters of the way through, but we decided to stay because we were minimally curious about how it would turn out. The story was good but maddeningly predictable, and clearly careering towards huge amounts of syrupy happiness...but they kept taking pointless twists and turns to get there. The acting was fantastic: the lead played a bipolar man exceptionally well, especially considering his good looks - he was able to come across as sweet, troubled, infuriating and vulnerable. The female lead also gave a spectacular performance but again, she was supposed to be mentally ill and yet was composed, poised and displayed great insight in several scenes - effectively undermining the character's integrity and credibility. The dad (another great piece of acting by Robert DeNiro) seemed to vacillate between unrealistic/angry & wise and supportive....but of course despite all their considerable problems, everything works out wonderfully in the end and there is a big cast of kooky but lovable friends and family who show up in the final scenes. This movie worked hard to be something special but it's formulaic underbelly kept interrupting the flow and believability of the characters' actions (and therefore the story itself). I do wonder about the book, however, because the character development had a few flashes of brilliance (although this may have had less to do with the writing and more to do with the fine acting). I got the impression the movie left a lot out...there were a couple of minor characters who showed up but then were forgotten. Maybe it was bad editing but it smelled a lot like some Hollywood committee hijacked the writing or directing. Either way, someone sold out."
"billygoat1071","9","3","5","2 March 2013"," Magic In Silver Lining
","Silver Linings Playbook might be beyond than just a romantic comedy. It is probably also a verisimilitude about people with bipolar disorders and families falling apart. It may offer more to the story, but despite all, it still centers to the romance than anything else. It's not groundbreaking to the genre, though it doesn't have to. For some reason, it sort of feels quite refreshing. The film is compellingly and genuinely charming. It has a lot of memorable performances. It can be predictable at times but it's easy to ignore those by the film's merits. Silver Linings Playbook is easily one of the best recent romcoms we get.<br/><br/>It did not start out as a romantic comedy, though. The film begins as a drama about a guy struggling with his condition and longs to win back his ex-wife. The whole romcom formula only appears when it introduces the connections between the two leads. Some points can be typical, but they are thankfully not noticeable because of its clever storytelling and writing. The film's humor, like any romantic comedies, aims to be awkward, but their delivery is pretty natural instead of hamming up. In most romcoms, the screen couple aren't usually appealing. The biggest reason is because their romance always ends up being empty, unlike here their love leads to something. They rather express their honest mistakes, but when they don't, they just share their sweet side to each other.<br/><br/>Apart from the romantic comedy is a drama comedy that deals with Pat's complicated life and family by his serious condition. It is suppose to be both funny and affecting but it never ignores the darkness of their problems. Just like David O. Russell's recent films, he manages to keep it heartfelt and utterly entertaining. The performances also carries the film. Bradley Cooper has always been charming in his romantic roles but here gets to do more like bursting his character's expressions by his mental illness and he's quite convincing at doing it. Same thing goes to Jennifer Lawrence. Well they are both amazing, leading a remarkable chemistry. Robert De Niro is, without a doubt, terrific that this could be one of his memorable recent performances.<br/><br/>It's a simple fun love story about two people sharing their same life problems, or maybe not simple. It is both light and dark but in a less serious way. They go crazy, fall in love, and talk about ridiculous ""superstitions"", but that's what makes it so likable. We could forgive its minor flaws. This is a rare romantic comedy that isn't exasperating, artificial, and hollow. It is awkwardly hilarious, and has genuine love and charm that we needed in the genre. It finds something wonderful in the end. This film is a silver lining to this becoming stale genre."

","When I saw 'Silver Linings Playbook' I thought great films like this make up for all the bad films ever made. I was amazed by the talent that the actors/actresses had shown in this film by bringing these characters alive. Jennifer Lawrence in particular showed incredible acting ability revealing the psychology of a grieving young widow who doesn't take the loss off her husband well. One scene is extremely insightful and that is where Jennifer Lawrence is in a diner with Bradley Cooper and she suddenly pretends to act completely crazy to spite Bradley, This is definitely Jennifer Lawrence at her best. As for the main character Bradley Cooper made his character special by illustrating his flaws so perfectly and thinking that he doesn't need to take his therapist's advice or take his medication. And finally Bradley and Jennifer's dance routine at the end was incredible, their routine perfectly portrayed the characters mood swings and wasn't unrealistic as they ruined their big finish. In conclusion I would recommend everyone to see this film."

Russell decided to film this movie, but as the story got a shape and I became familiar with the characters I found myself appreciating this way of filming. It was chaotic, but it was beautiful. A perfect nod to the state of mind Pat and Tiffany must have been. <br/><br/>This movie is one that deals with mental disorder, which are no laughing feat, but Pat's inability to be sensitive with his words and Tiffany's bluntness when talking about her past make you laugh out loud on many occasions. Soon enough you find yourself caring for these characters. For Pat, because he tries so hard, but is facing a family and a community that at first does not really believe in his recovery. And for Tiffany, because she is the kind of girl to do something for others without expecting anything in return. The movie throws memorable lines at you early on and you will be pleasantly surprised to see that events or comments from the beginning come back in the end. <br/><br/>This is not a movie you should go see if you wish to sit back and not think for a good two hours. Though it will surely be enjoyable and a good watch, I believe you cannot truly appreciate the beauty of Silver Linings Playbook if you do not take the time to analyze the characters and their actions. From Pat Junior to Pat Senior and even to Jake: Pat's brother, whose life is the complete opposite of Pat's. <br/><br/>Despite the nature of the film, dealing with mental disorders and all, it is a feel good movie that will have you looking for the silver linings in your own life."

With an apparently simple yet contextually deep screenplay, it touches your heart at many levels.<br/><br/>Aided by some incisive performances from its cast, the film is an emotional treat.<br/><br/>Pat Solatano (Bradley Cooper) has lost everything - his house, his job, and his wife. He now lives with his mother (Jacki Weaver) and father (Robert DeNiro) after spending eight months in a state institution on a plea bargain. Pat is determined to rebuild his life, remain positive and reunite with his wife, despite the challenging circumstances of their separation. When Pat meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a mysterious girl with problems of her own, things get complicated. Tiffany offers to help Pat reconnect with his wife, butonly if he'll do something very important for her in return. As their deal plays out, an unexpected bond begins to form between them, and silver linings appear in both of their lives.<br/><br/>The film is adapted from a novel by the same name, by Matthew Quick. The film never attempts to reach those heights of a deeply meaningful cinema or social satires and that'exactly why it succeeds. It provides you with naturalistic experience of a rom-com with grit and emotion of a realist drama. The characters are believable and skilfully sketched. These two hours at the theater infuse positivism and contentment within you. It's a perfectly suitable drama for these anxious times that we live in. There's love and warmth, there's emptiness and heartbreaks, there's optimism and competitiveness , and yet there's contentment in all of this and so much more that life gives. The director gives you a lot to like over here especially the breeziness that he brings to a tale of two misfits trying to make it work. Essentially a comedy, he balances this film perfectly by giving some serious heart to it. It's modern, delightful and absorbs you completely. And in the end you leave with a smile on your face.<br/><br/>Performances are basically the life of this film. A subject like this could've easily got derailed if the performances fell any short of what they are right now. The lead actors give it depth and deliver two of the most moving performances you'll ever see. Bradley Cooper surprises you with his acting prowess. Usuallyconsidered as merely a good looking charmer, he surfaces a totally unforeseen side of his talent. He proves how underrated an 'actor' he has been. Jennifer Lawrence is superb too. Her character has multiple complex shades that she portrays amazingly well. The support cast is terrific, bringing completeness to this fulfilling drama.<br/><br/>All-in-all, 'Silver Linings Playbook' can be perfectly defined as a ""serious romantic comedy"" which is intelligent and edgy, with romance at its core. Go for it!"

","There was so much hype about this movie- it was all about being PC in my opinion and trying to bring light and warm fuzzies to BPD. There were some really great moments, and I think the actress who played the mother was outstanding. Chris Tucker was hilarious and very likable- and Robert D. was just another version of himself as usual but still a good performance. Jennifer Lawrence was nothing special and I am just disgusted that she won an Oscar for thaat? She was fine, but no real stretch or challenge to playing her role- sorry. This awarding of non challenging mediocre performances makes Oscar lose its credit worthiness. Movie was OK- would not pay to see it other than a Netflix."

This was poorly done."
"sddavis63","3","4","8","12 May 2013"," Great Performances In A Story Of No Great Note
","Bradley Cooper is wonderful. About that there can be no argument. He captured the character and the essence of Pat Solitano perfectly. Solitano is recently released from a psychiatric hospital, suffering bipolar disorder and after having beaten up the man he found in the shower with his wife. Released at the insistence of his mother (Jackie Weaver) and against the advice of doctors, Pat has to try to rebuild his life, coping with a none too normal family of his own (including a mildly OCD Philadelphia Eagles fanatic father, played by Robert De Niro.) His fantasy upon release is to win back his wife, who's taken out a restraining order against him. Attempting to reconnect, he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) - a somewhat promiscuous widow who agrees to carry letters between Pat and his wife, who is an acquaintance of hers. Meanwhile, Pat and Tiffany discover a shared love of dance. Pat thinks that doing well in a dance competition will show his wife that he's back to normal. That's the movie is a nutshell. And I have to say that I don't get the hype. It did very little for me.<br/><br/>Yes. It features good performances. Cooper, Weaver, De Niro and Lawrence are all quite good. But they really can't turn the basic story into anything more than what it is - a completely predictable couple of hours that features absolutely no surprise in the end, and that seems far too easily to solve all of Pat and Tiffany's personal challenges. Sure it's mildly humorous at times. Pat going jogging while wearing a garbage bag as a vest made me smile - the first time I saw it. By the 35th time (or whatever) it was just a part of the movie and drew no response.<br/><br/>My biggest beef with this I think was the way it started. There was no real exploration of the character or his past. Yes, that gets revealed as the movie goes on, but somehow I would have liked just a little more of an introduction. Instead, all we got was Pat's mom showing up at the psych hospital and demanding that he be released. I wanted to know a little more about this guy before getting into the rest of the story.<br/><br/>Sure, it has good performances from pretty much everyone. but the basic story disappoints."
"ObservationBlogger","5","4","8","13 February 2013"," I was so underwhelmed. Be wary of the hype!
","I saw it tonight and I was very disappointed. SPOILERS AHEAD! The first 40 - 50 minutes was good, perhaps even very good (it had a similar feel and authenticity to 'Good Will Hunting'), but after that it just lost the plot both literally and metaphorically. For me there is nothing worse than viewing a movie which begins to take itself seriously and then turns about and disengages from it's 'modus operandi' to impress certain Hollywood production sticklers and comply with a target market audience. Moreover it didn't represent bi - polar disorder accurately nor any major mental illness for that matter. Actions have consequences, the movie seemed to skip that major truth about life which detracted from its overall authenticity. The movie began feeling 'soul driven' and genuine, but gradually, and at times 'jaw droppingly' that feeling dissipated and by the end it was a gross misrepresentation of what it set out to be.<br/><br/>It was too predictable. It was frequently corny and in particular the house betting fiasco scene which was entirely off kilter with the rest of the film and so was the night of the dance (dirty dancing in reverse role scenario and rehash of 'strictly ballroom' for the egocentrics) and the penultimate scene rung too much of 'When Harry met Sally' and most other clichéd Hollywood romantic comedy endings.<br/><br/>From about 50 minutes onwards very little of the script was original nor was it even a smidgeon thought provoking. A lot of the writing involved character's telling their theories on popular books, superstition about football teams, the necessity to own an ipod and which music is best. One thing it did highlight well is how materialistic and basically obsessed our society is with consumerism and modern fads, but I am unsure if that was the intention of the director. Robert De Niro and Jacky Weaver were miscast and totally unbelievable in their respective roles. Particularly how Jacky Weaver was nominated is one of the greatest mysteries of Oscar acting nomination history. I did however like the music and think the soundtrack was excellent. Other than that I am giving it a 5/10.<br/><br/>I cannot remember seeing such a poor Oscar nominated film especially one which started off with such promise only to turn into a Hollywood satire of itself by the end. Go see something highly original and genuine throughout like 'The Master', which unfortunately hasn't been nominated as best picture probably because it's way ahead of it's time (my review http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1560747/reviews-208) or 'Life of Pi' (my review at http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0454876/reviews-335)"
"Hellmant","10","4","8","12 January 2013"," The best movie about mental illness I've ever seen! Jennifer Lawrence has never been hotter!
","'SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>This critical darling and Oscar hopeful just picked up eight Oscar nominations including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Film Editing and nominations in all four acting categories (which is the first time this feat has been accomplished since 1981's 'RED')! Being a huge fan of Jennifer Lawrence (she's my favorite actress and top celebrity crush), as well as the writer/director David O. Russell, I had been very eager to see this film since it went into limited release in mid-November (and even before that after watching the amazing trailers) but it still hasn't come to any cities near me and I had to drive 40 miles to the closest one playing it just to finally see it. I know the studio has been waiting to fully release it so it could build bigger business off of word of mouth and Oscar nominations but the buzz is already here! So I finally saw it in Salem, OR and it was totally worth it. It lived up to my expectations in every way and is my favorite film of 2012! <br/><br/>In the film Oscar nominee Bradley Cooper plays a former teacher, named Pat Solitano, who suffered a mental breakdown after catching his wife Nikki (Brea Bee) cheating on him with a fellow teacher. He spent eight months in a mental institution as part of a plea bargain for beating the man nearly to death. While there he learned that he's bipolar and has been suffering from the disease all of his life. His father, Pat Sr. (Oscar nominee Robert De. Niro), has suffered from violent mental breakdowns and OCD his whole life as well, he's also a sports nut who believes in superstitions that will help his team, The Eagles, win their games. Pat's mom, Dolores (Oscar nominee Jacki Weaver), takes Pat out of the institution when his committed time is done and brings him home to live with her and his father. Pat learns that Nikki left him, sold their house and filed a restraining order against him (out of physical fear) but he's so obsessed with getting her back that he begins stalking her (which is played off as kind of harmless in the film due to Cooper's good looks I think; looks prejudice once again). Then he meets a girl named Tiffany (Oscar nominee Jennifer Lawrence, who's never been hotter or more stunning) who's just as down on her luck (her husband recently died) and is almost as crazy as he is. She, like Pat, just lost her job as well due to a recent sex obsession and the fact that she slept with all her co-workers. The two immediately take a liking to each other but Pat fears what this may mean to him and his love for Nikki. Tiffany has been wanting to compete in a dance competition and needs a partner so they both use each other (in a way) as Tiffany agrees to get a message to Nikki for Pat. Things only get more complicated from there. Chris Tucker also co-stars as Pat's buddy from the psychiatric ward. It's his first film appearance since 2007's 'RUSH HOUR 3' and his first non 'RUSH HOUR' film since 1997's 'JACKIE BROWN' (which also co-starred Robert De Niro)! His part is minimal but funny. <br/><br/>The movie is a brilliant character study and the best movie about mental illness I've ever seen! I've had multiple family members suffer from depression and I've experienced it a little myself, as well as other mental issues, so the film was really relatable to me. I also love movies about outsiders and unique individuals who are brave enough to be themselves. Both Pat and Tiffany are brutally honest and not afraid to say what they really feel and like the Pat character says in the movie 'maybe they see things that other people don't'. I was just blown away by the characters and totally involved in what happened to them. All of the performances were outstanding; of course my favorite being Jennifer Lawrence but deservingly so. She's totally beautiful and sexy and maybe too much of a guy's ideal woman in this movie but she's also very confident and self dependent (like almost every character she plays). Her character also has the perfect touch of vulnerability, insecurity and mental instability that really make you feel for her as well. A lot of the biggest A list actresses in Hollywood wanted this role (most notably Angelina Jolie) but Lawrence nabbed it. Partially because she's so popular right now, probably the biggest star in Hollywood (like Julia Roberts in her prime after 'PRETTY WOMAN', and the same age, but about five times as talented) but also because she was the only actress that could play this part that well. Jacki Weaver is amazing too; she says very little but at the same time says so much with just her emotions and facial expressions. You can't not love a mom like the one she plays in this movie. Robet De Niro gives one of his best performances in years and is so complex and interesting that I would have loved to have seen a movie just about his character alone. Bradley Cooper gives by far the best performance of his career (as well as one of the best performances of the year) and is the perfect match for Jennifer Lawrence. Despite their more than fifteen years age difference the two have beautiful chemistry together and that's the driving force behind the whole movie. Of course the film would be nothing without David O. Russell's amazing directing and brilliant script. The man is a genius filmmaker and the movie deserves all the award recognition it's been getting. I'm so passionate about film and the characters depicted in them that when one really moves me it's almost like a religious experience. This is one of those films!<br/><br/>Watch our show at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcoZRlVFMzA"

","This is a great little story with many layers and such good acting. The characters are people you don't necessarily like but somehow you really begin to care about them. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are just so good together. Supporting cast is quirky and flawed and equally excellent. The mental illness side of the story is told with an open and honest approach. It ultimately comes down to doing the right thing.The self absorbed life style of being mentally challenged (behavior disorders not personality) is pushed aside in order to put oneself in a place to be happy and loved. You need a ""strategy"" in life is so true and happiness is out there if you fight for it. That's the message I got from this fine film. Love the Philly angle!

It is funny and nicely paced, neatly scripted and beautifully acted by the brilliant performances from everyone involved, fantastic casting from David O. Russell again. I thought that Bradley Coopers portrayal of a bi-polar guy was pretty damn good, really felt the intensity in the scenes where he loses it in the middle of the night and wakes his parents, but it's not his fault, but he will apologise on behalf of Ernest Hemingway. Also with the best performance I've seen De Niro give for years. Just a fantastic work from David O. Russell."
"howard.schumann","9","4","8","9 December 2012"," Look for the silver lining
","Author James Redfield said, ""The challenge is to find the silver lining in every event, no matter how negative,"" but, as French author George Bernanos has pointed out, ""one can encounter optimism everywhere – even at the bottom of a bottle."" He said, however, that ""hope is a risk that must be run. It is the risk of all risks"" David O. Russell invites us to take that risk in his offbeat comedy Silver Linings Playbook and it pays off. Based on the 2008 novel by Matthew Quick, the film tells the story of two people who struggle to help each other out of the emotional hole they have dug for themselves and, like David and Lisa and the recent Rust and Bone, demonstrates that the affection people have for each other can begin to break through the limitations caused by their distress.<br/><br/>Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper), a former substitute teacher, is an optimist who looks for the silver linings in life, believing that things happen for a reason. His motto ""excelsior"" does not, however, lead him ""ever upward,"" (except when he takes too many meds) but he believes that it helps him to maintain an even keel. Having just been released from a Baltimore psychiatric facility where he was diagnosed as bipolar, partially as a result of a violent incident involving his wife Nikki (Brea Bee), Pat tells his family, mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver) and father Pat Sr. (Robert de Niro) that he is ""solid,"" but as Bernanos has stated, ""a health bulletin is only worth something if it is signed by a doctor, not by the patient."" Pat's tendency to emotional outbursts surfaces again in the office of his therapist Dr. Patel (Anupam Kher) when he hears the song that was played at his wedding, a so-called test by his doctor to gauge the limits of his control which, as the incident reveals is low to non-existent. Not that there is any connection, of course, but his father is no stranger to inappropriate displays of emotion, having been banned from attending home games of the pro-football Philadelphia Eagles because of his violence at the stadium in support of his team. Dad, who is now a bookie, (generally illegal in the United States), has the idea that father-son bonding involves having his son watch football games with him at home every Sunday, but it never seems to work out quite as planned.<br/><br/>When Pat bursts into his parent's room at 4:00 a.m. ranting about the failure of Ernest Hemingway's novel, A Farewell to Arms, to provide the reader with a happy ending, flinging the book through a bedroom window, it tends to reinforce the idea in his parent's mind that he is not as solid as he thinks. Pat wants very much to reunite with his wife Nikki, but there is only one problem – she has taken out a restraining order against him which kind of mucks up his plans. He remains unyielding about this, however, even after he is introduced to and establishes a connection with the much younger Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence in an Oscar-worthy performance.<br/><br/>Though Pat maintains his distance, it is apparent that Tiffany is looking for more than friendship in the relationship. A comrade-in-arms in the mental health department, she has been depressed since her husband was killed in an auto accident and has attempted to compensate by engaging in gratuitous sex in her place of work. Reaching out in friendship, Tiffany agrees to deliver Pat's letter to Nikki in exchange for his agreeing to be her partner in a dance contest, an agreement she does everything in her power to enforce, leading to unforeseen consequences. Backed by a terrific soundtrack that includes music by Alabama Shakes, alt-J, Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash, Rare Earth, and Stevie Wonder, Silver Linings Playbook works because it is funny, genuine, and emotionally satisfying. Though there may be some clichéd moments, it's relatively easy to find the silver lining."
"jamaalrgreen","9","4","8","6 December 2012"," A Rom Com that guys can love
","I must admit that I was a bit wary at first of whether or not I would see Silver Linings Playbook. Being a New Yorker and a member of NYGiants nation my first take on seeing the trailer for this film was that it would be a fantasy tale for Eagledelphia in which the Eagles would finally win something and everything in the Phillyverse would be right for 90 minutes. I could not have been more wrong as what unfolded before my eyes was a gem of a film that has something for everyone. Silver Linings Playbook is a rocky love story about mental illness that stays close to our hearts with funny and frank dialogue. The film brings home a point that we are all imperfect by showing the ups and downs of our imperfections in a real way. Using sports as a backdrop the story centers on a working class Philadelphia family that you'd swear live at the end of your street. If there were awards for Casting Director this film would get it. (Maybe there is an award for Casting Director??)The group of actors chosen for this film all complement each other so well it's as if they've know each other their whole lives. You would actually expect to see these folks together at a bar or a BBQ. It was great to see Chris Tucker in a role where he was not running through Hong Kong or yelling at Jackie Chan and oh Julia Stiles where have you been? She is one of the underrated talents of her era. Bradley Cooper is stellar in his portrayal of the lead character Pat. I cant believe this is the hangover guy. He has arrived and is taking names. Hope they spell it right on that gold statue he'll be getting ; } It was also great to see Robert Deniro in a role that he was able to sink his teeth into as he was in classic form. There are some gut-busting laughs in this film and moments that make you squirm and say ""did he just say/do that?"" There are many strong performances all around from just an awesome and talented cast. The director let this story unfold for you and delicately nudged the story along through several ups and down always keeping you on your toes and afraid to take your eyes off the screen for fear of missing a moment good or bad. Jennifer Lawrence is fantastic in her range easily holding her own as the feisty ""Tiffany"". I expect we'll be seeing quite a bit of this beautiful and talented young actress in the immediate future. This is not your classic ""When Harry met Sally"" but will no doubt leave you with that same feeling at the end having you saying to yourself ""I just witnessed something! This film is going to do well collecting a few golden statuettes<br/><br/>JG"
"james-t-sheridan","10","4","8","1 December 2012"," I Heart Silver Lining Playbook!
","Bradley Cooper proves that he can act, David O. Russell proves that he is a preeminent director of A-list talent, and ""Silver Linings Playbook"" proves to be an emotional, visceral film of strange power and grace. It is one of the best films of the year. <br/><br/>""Three Kings"" was a story of a community of soldiers during Desert Storm with Ice Cube, Spike Jonze, Mark Wahlberg, and George Clooney. ""The Fighter"" is nothing if not a family story with Mark Wahlberg's drug-addicted brother, smattering of sisters, domineering mother, and equally tough girlfriend. ""The Silver Lining Playbook"" features multiple scenes that layer in family members, neighbors, friends, police officers, and extended family. Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver play Pat Senior and Dolores. Jennifer Lawrence and Julia Stiles play sisters Tiffany and Veronica; Cooper and Shea Whigham play brothers Pat and Jake. Danny (Chris Tucker, welcome back!) plays a friend Pat meets in a Baltimore institution, and Pat's best friend Ronnie (John Ortiz) who is married to Veronica. There's Pat's psychiatrist Dr. Patel (Anupam Kher) and Pat's local Officer Keogh and a Pat's dad's best friend, a Cowboy fan and a bookie who I don't think is ever named or introduced, but his name is Randy in the credits (Paul Herman). Russell doesn't necessarily introduce anyone in this film; he just layers them in, one on top of the other. A character that begins the film as possibly being imaginary ends up being incredibly real. A character that I thought was dead magically shows up halfway into the film without explanation. It is a magical, transporting film.<br/><br/>Without giving anything away (since deferred information is one of the strengths of Russell's screenplay of Matthew Quick's novel), Pat is recovering from a violent episode, hopes to reconcile with his wife, and checks out of the hospital with his mom. The film begins with his return to his parents' home, and then it centers the concentric circles surrounding Pat. He literally runs in circles around his neighborhood, trapped in his head and his past, triggered by the world around him, struggling with his mental illness. He meets Tiffany, a recent widow, and they forge an unusual, unconventional connection.<br/><br/>Everyone in this film is interesting. Everyone. Even bit parts. I wanted to see an entire movie with Chris Tucker's character Danny. And Ronnie. And Randy. And the mom. <br/><br/>Russell's use of setting is inspired. The film takes place in a community, a neighborhood where a screaming episode wakes up all the neighbors who stand out on their stoops. Most scenes take place inside homes. The film breathes Philadelphia in with a lived-in quality and few obvious references beyond one scene at Lincoln Financial Field. The film features Halloween trick or treating, eating at the Llanerch Diner, running around the winding roads around Pat and Tiffany's Philadelphia neighborhood, Christmas celebrations, outside of the Eagles game with the tailgaters, at a dance competition happening the same time as an Eagles-Cowboys game on television. Russell is uncovering some deep stuff here, exploring where mental illness ends and rabid fandom begins. <br/><br/>Put another way, isn't being a Philadelphia Eagles fan (or, insert your favorite sports team or television show or website or musician here) just another form of mental illness? Is Pat any different, worse, or exactly the same as the E-A-G-L-E-S-EAGLES! shouting fans outside Lincoln Financial Field eight Sundays a year?<br/><br/>The way sports can be used in lieu of communication in American culture is insightful. Pat Senior wants to spend time with Pat watching the game. Let's watch the game together. Let's have something to talk about. Russell is commenting on our national cultural practices in a way rarely depicted. He's not mocking them but questioning our habits. He's wrestling with the rituals of American life: wearing costumes, decorations, watching games, superstition, gambling, competitions, eating, recovery, rallying. <br/><br/>In short, family. <br/><br/>The performances are spectacular. I'm expecting multiple acting nominations, starting with Cooper and Lawrence who are both deserving. I loved seeing Chris Tucker again. The filmmaking layers in sound: the doorbell, Cooper's rapid-fire no-filter conversation, the spectacle of watching two, three, four characters speaking over each other. Russell's philosophy is to cram a scene full of as many people as possible and have it absolutely work, have it absolutely make sense. Because really, all these people are a part of the story, know each other, care about each, make sense to Pat, and for economy of storytelling, why not have them in the same room? <br/><br/>I think the filmmaking mirrors the feelings of mental illness, and I'm in awe of Russell's powers as a filmmaker with specific cinematography and editing choices. He avoids clichés and mawkishness, cutting deep into characters in pain. Yet, the film is ultimately one of hope and joy, earning its ending, and surprising me in the amount I was moved by it. <br/><br/>A must see film from one of our greatest living directors."

","Pat (Bradley Cooper) comes home to find his teacher wife having a shower with another teacher, who Pat promptly beats to a pulp. Eight months later, Pat is discharged from mental hospital - complete with restraining order - into the care of his mother, having been diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the meantime. All is clearly not well with him, however: there is clear evidence that his grip on reality and reason is not always all that it could be, because he remains tightly focused on being reunited with the wife who has the restraining order on him (we also see that Pat's OCD father (Robert De Niro) may well be the source of some of Pat's problems). Into his life comes Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young woman recently widowed and with obvious issues of her own in terms of dealing with the depression caused by her grief. A quid pro quo develops: Tiffany will act as a mailbox for letters between Pat and wife, and Pat will be a dancing partner for Tiffany for a contest she has entered as therapy.<br/><br/>This film does not tidily fit into a category: it is essentially a drama, though with romantic and comedic elements. And it has a couple of fairly severe flaws. The bet which fuels the third act is pretty obviously no more than a dramatic device to raise the stakes in the dance contest and has a distinct whiff of improbability about it, and the ending appears inconsistent with the attitudes of the protagonists. These are both fairly serious criticisms to level at a film which takes itself seriously, nowithstanding its comedic elements.<br/><br/>And I didn't care. I liked this film very much indeed. It plays fair with the mental problems suffered by Pat and Tiffany: while drawing humour from them, they are never the butt of insensitive jokes. Bradley Cooper makes Pat believable, and Jennifer Lawrence is heart-achingly poignant as Tiffany (she is also sizzlingly sexy, particularly in the final dance, but that's merely a bonus). You always want these two damaged people to find, in each other, the means to achieve a measure of happiness, and you are never 100% sure whether the film will take you there by the end or not.<br/><br/>And if the film leaves you pondering the relative merits of consistency versus satisfaction, well so what?"

The film was so bad, I just can not get over the story line. I know a few people who have bipolar (type 1 as well as type 2) and watched it with one of them. I read that my hero, the wonderful actor De Niro has a son who suffers with this illness, how did he think this story was plausible, I will never know. I so agree with some of the other reviewers who did not like it, it seems falling in love cures it, and they will live happily ever after. Also can not see why the best actress award went to Lawrence, it was a reasonable performance but really nothing special.

","I've just rewatched this film having seen it a few times but not in the last 3 years or so. Revisiting it I really do love it. It's a very sincere film with a difficult subject matter of a particualy mental illness. The three main actors, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro give tremendous performances. De Niro proves he can still give raw emotional meaning to a newly written character. The two leads have not given better performances than they have in this movie in my opinion. Bradley Coopers character Pat is put in a tough situation in this film which leads to really good character development and gives the audience insight on the mental illness while telling a compelling story. The cinematography was nice and would have meaning from time to time, it was shot on 35mm film wich I appreciated and fit right for the story. The score by Danny Elfman didn't really do anything for me personally. The editing was really well done, there were a lot of interesting uses of certain techniques used in the editing process that worked really well to help tell the story. The ensemble stood out in this film, it doesn't really seem apropriate to have an ensemble cast with so much screen time in a movie so personal to two main characters but it works here. David O'Russel does write ensembles very well in movies as seen in American Hustle and The Fighter. In the end, I really enjoyed this movie, it did a lot for me, I'm glad I rewatched it and if you haven't seen it or haven't watched it in a while I would definitely recommend doing so."

","Silver Linings Playbook is technically a romantic comedy, but I hesitate to lump it in with all of the other cookie-cutter rom-coms out there. It is one of the most unique romantic comedies I've ever seen. Plus, it doesn't have that pretentious ""quirky for quirky's sake"" feel that many independent films do. Bradley Cooper is surprisingly good in his role and Jennifer Lawrence is impressive as always. This is an intelligent movie with an entertaining story about broken people who are trying to help each other become whole."

","Pat Solantano Jr. (played by Academy Award nominee Bradley Cooper) is just getting out of the mental hospital; he was in there for beating the man that his wife was cheating on him with. He comes home to live with his parents, go to therapy and to find the silver lining in things. Eventually he meets Tiffany (played by Academy Award Winner Jennifer Lawrence), who has her own problems. He forms a connection with her and she even offers to help him get a letter to his wife, and in exchange he helps her with a dance competition. Pat Sr. (played by Academy Award Winner Robert De Niro) and Dolores (played by Academy Award Nominee Jacki Weaver) are Pat's parents and Pat's father is somewhat OCD; he likes his remotes a certain way, he doesn't want anybody in his study and he believes that his son is the positive juju that the Eagles need to win the Super Bowl. The question is: Can Pat Jr. find the signs? Or will life get him down?<br/><br/>This is a great movie, plain and simple. The editing and writing of this film is top notch. David O. Russell is at the top of his game with this film and he earned a well-deserved Oscar nomination for both writing and directing the film. Whether you agree with his directing style or not, it is clear that he loves these characters and, in spite of all their faults and differences, he makes them all likable in many ways. Kudos to Russell for pulling off such an amazing feat!<br/><br/>But let's face it: the real stars are the stars themselves in this movie. Let's start out with our main character. Cooper is a revelation in this role. This was the role that got him out of his comfort zone - the comedy zone - and into the world of versatile acting. He is now known for his supreme acting chops and he knows how to make it work in a drama. He knows how to create characters that can be crazy but in a good way. Definitely deserving of the Oscar Nomination. With Jennifer Lawrence, while I can't say that she deserved the Oscar (it should have went to Emmanuelle Riva for Amour), I can say that this is the best she's ever been. She is on the top of her game in this role and it is clearly a role that she loved to play. Her and Bradley Cooper went on to star in two more David O. Russell films - American Hustle and Joy - and it is very clear that they love working with each other; you can practically feel the chemistry that these two share. She definitely at least deserved the nomination.<br/><br/>But let's talk about the supporting characters. Robert De Niro is a prime example of ""when you grow older, you start getting the grandpa roles in crappy movies."" While the dude can act, it's no question that he is in a slump. It's this movie, however, that showed that he's still got it and that he is not going away anytime soon. This is the guy who won awards for being a younger version of Marlon Brando and for boxing other guys in a ring. It's good to see that guy again; definitely deserving of the nomination. But the person who I believe should have actually won in their category was Jacki Weaver for her performance in this movie. She is the Mom who is worried sick about her son because he was in a mental hospital and she just wants him to be a part of the family. She is amazing in this role and she also gives the best performance of her career!<br/><br/>Needless to say, a great movie! What more can I say?"
"Euporie","8","2","3","1 August 2018"," Bradley Cooper is brilliant and the film is quite entertaining
","Maybe this is a biased review and the film itself does not deserve 8 stars but what the heck, Bradley Cooper deserves all those stars for such a nuanced and wonderful performance! I always thought of him as this hot dude from that overrated Hangover movie or the cool guy who did a lot of fancy walking in American Hustle, but in this film he is simply amazing! He gives an incredibly believable and controlled performance as the guy suffering from bipolar disorder who is trying to get better. Added bonus-he can dance too! Wow!
Jennifer Lawrence is kinda refreshing. I usually hate De Niro in anything other than in mafia movies but he wasn't bad either. The only bad casting choice was the therapist who was not at all convincing. <br/><br/>Best part is they kept the story to the central characters and their motivations rather than making it about circumstances. The characters in this film never play the victim card and are constantly trying to improve their lives. The other good thing about the film is that it never got too sentimental or preachy. It stayed light and entertaining throughout."

"allykooz","9","2","3","1 June 2018"," Silver Linings Playbook
","Silver(Gold) Linings Playbook<br/><br/> Silver Lining Playbook should be called Gold Linings Playbook with the performance that David O. Russell puts up in this movie. Silver Lining Playbook opens up with Pat Solitano(Bradley Cooper) after 8 months in a mental hospital, realizing he's been separated from his wife after finding out he's an undiagnosed bipolar and realizes he needs to get his wife back, always keeping with him the idea that if you stay positive and work hard then a silver lining will happen; it just takes him the whole movie to figure out what that silver lining will be. Pat meets Tiffany(Jennifer Lawrence) who has just lost her husband and in her mourning also develops a mental illness, which creates a friendship that turns out to help both of them a lot more and in a way they never would've thought before.
 David O. Russell takes the problem of mental health/illness and shows what it's like to be in their heads, for the people around them, and put into this real issue into a romantic comedy; putting mental health into a movie like a romantic comedy is genius because it shows how normal or regular it is for people to have them.
Silver Linings Playbook opens in the mental hospital where Pat is staying and his moms strong drive to take him out which builds a strong sense of pathos between the audience and Pat, and makes them feel sadness and pity for him. In building this Pathos it allows the audience to feel what he's feeling and relate to him more, and always hope for the best for him. 
 Russell chooses 2 incredible actors, Cooper and Lawrence, who are able to take the complexity of these characters to the next level and let us really see what is going on in the heads of these two characters, not just portraying them as crazy and through the eyes of just the surrounding people, but what mental processing is going through their heads when it's happening and what drives them to get there. A big trigger for Pat is hearing his wedding song, because that's the song that he was hearing when he walked in on his wife cheating on him with another worker at the school they worked at. Everytime Pat hears this song it triggers him to go back to that place he was in when he caught his wife with that man, and allows us to see how just one song can affect someone in this state of mind.
Though there aren't a ton of movies that put an emphasis on mental health, Silver Linings Playbook does fail to show how people who haven't suffered traumatic events like getting cheated on by your wife, or losing your husband can also suffer from mental health issues like depression, and anxiety. The Perks Of Being A Wallflower includes the aspect that anyone can suffer from mental illness and it doesn't make it any less important that they didn't go through anything traumatic and still happens just as much if not more. This is what Silver Linings Playbook lacks because although it puts a very big importance on this issue and in a realistic approach it lacks to show how common it is like The Perks Of Being A Wallflower does.
 There has been so many movies done in the last couple of decades that Silver Lining Playbook gives us a breath of fresh air giving us a movie like nothing else made. Russell let's the audience draw their own conclusions about what they think of each character and whether or not Pat and Tiffany are actually crazy or it's actually that other people got them to that place. This movie makes the audience question society and how we treat people and to look at ourselves in the mirror and see the impact we have on one another, rather then bringing people down we need to focus on lifting them up . Silver Lining Playbook is a must see and you will not be disappointed in the performance by these two brilliant actors that make you fall in love and acquire more empathy and understanding for those who deal with mental illness everyday"

"scottgrote","9","2","3","26 April 2018"," Everyone's a little crazy.
","My first glance at The Silver Linings Playbook was during the 2013 Oscars when Jennifer Lawrence was nominated for best actress. The ceremony presented one of the most popular scenes from it, the scene that would compel me to watch it. She asks why Bradley Cooper ordered Raisin Brain, he says because he didn't want it to seem like a date. He says he hopes people don't associate his mental issues with her ""crazy."" She shows him crazy. <br/><br/>Part of me can't help but love this scene. This moment is so raw. Or Real? Perhaps neither. But it is so exhilarating. And many years after having first watched it, I think I may, now, know why. <br/><br/>It must her manic-pixie-dream-girl attitude. The politics of this movie already verge on the conservative but the introduction of a manic-pixie girl would perhaps seal the deal. Does she meet on the requirements of one? Perhaps not, but what are these requirements. I mean she seems manic, having sudden bursts of energy. And she does seems to share the spontaneous attitude Zooey Deschanel sports in 500 Days of Summer (an icon for the manic pixie dream girl trope). She also seems to enliven her lover the way one does. Her dancing seems to bring out new life in Bradley Cooper. It's no wonder my teenage self loved her. She brought out in Bradley Cooper that which a women would someday bring out in angsty-teen me. <br/><br/>My second glance into this movie was when my dad was watching it. After he finished up I asked how it was and he said ""Good."" Isn't it about someone who's crazy or something?"" and he said ""Everyone is a little crazy in this."" I liked that description. It was as if everyone was a little crazy in their own way. <br/><br/>Does this movie romanticize mental disorders? Perhaps. Is that wrong? Probably. But as a person with a mental disorder I liked it. It made me feel like someday I would find someone cute and ""crazy,"" and we could be ""crazy"" together. But my experience is a poor representation for all and I think it's a really a tricky sub genre to enter into, the romance between people with mental disorders. You will doubtless have to walk on thin ice to create a film that people won't find an issue. For how can one make a rom-com in this sub-genre without romanticizing the mental disorder. Isn't that what Romance does?<br/><br/>In any case, whether I like the politics or not, a part of me will always hold part of this film close to me. The acting is good, the script funny, the romance dysfunctioning(until the last few moments of film where Bradley Cooper takes her in his lap and steals a kiss, I'll ignore those moments) and cute. Lovely film."
"kateevans-31553","8","2","3","3 April 2018"," A Review of Mental Illness Representation in Silver Linings Playbook
","Let me begin by saying that I absolutely adore Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. I really do believe that everyone involved in the making of this film portrayed the characters of this story as likable, captivating, and clearly unique from the typical romantic comedy characters. However, as you are hopefully beginning to realize, this does not mean that Silver Linings Playbook is a flawless depiction of individuals with mental illness. It's got a lot of issues, some more problematic than others. The film begins when Bradley Cooper's character, Pat, is released from a mental health facility and brought to live in his childhood home with his parents. Soon after his return, he meets Tiffany, a young woman struggling with an unnamed mental illness of her own, exacerbated by the tragic death of her husband. After a few comedic encounters, Tiffany convinces Pat to compete with her in a couples dance competition in exchange for her delivering a letter to Pat's estranged wife, Nikki. (The whole reason Pat ended up in the mental health facility is because he nearly beat a man to death after coming home to find him in the shower with Nikki. Following this episode, Pat is diagnosed with bipolar disorder.)<br/><br/>I want to like the idea of these heavy subjects being dealt with in the context of a romantic comedy. However, the scenes in which Pat experiences manic episodes are disrespectfully comedic. The audience shouldn't feel the urge to laugh at a character's bipolar episode. So, there's problem number one. Then, there's the small fact that one of Pat's episodes is purposely caused by his own therapist! I was really rooting for Dr. Patel. He's a funny, Philadelphia Eagles-loving guy, but what kind of therapist purposely plays a song in the waiting room that is a trigger for his new patient?! While this leads to a breakdown that is very familiar to individuals who struggle with similar illnesses, it is a seriously concerning depiction of a mental health professional. (Later, he throws away any hope of regaining professionalism and gets drunk with Pat at a Philadelphia Eagles game...come on, Dr. Patel. Enough.)<br/><br/>Some critics have complained that Pat's bipolar disorder is only represented in the form of manic episodes, while depressive episodes are noticeably absent from the story. Considering that some individuals with bipolar disorder experience very few depressive episodes throughout their lifetime, I find no issue with this. The movie takes place over the span of only a few months; it is perfectly reasonable that Pat does not experience a depressive episode during this time. It would be unfair to expect a single film to portray every aspect of a complicated illness that manifests itself differently in every individual.<br/><br/>That said, this film sends a clear message that I find decidedly troubling. As Pat falls in love with Tiffany, many of the symptoms of his bipolar disorder magically disappear. She is able to remove the triggering effects of his wedding song by just whispering a few words of comfort. She somehow counteracts his obsession with Nikki to the extent that he doesn't even care that she lied about the whole letter-writing charade. The audience has no reason to believe that he suddenly started taking his medications, considering he even avoided taking them at the mental health facility. Yet somehow, his symptoms seem to disappear.
 
While there is certainly research to support the idea that being in love improves symptoms of some mental illnesses, this film takes it a bit too far. Love can not cure Pat's bipolar disorder or Tiffany's depression. In order to fit the typical mold of the romantic comedy, Pat's very serious mental illness is trivialized. The end of the film suggests that his struggles have magically disappeared purely because Tiffany loves him. It sounds too good to be true, and it is.<br/><br/>Perhaps unintentionally, this film supports the narrative that mental illness can be fixed by an improvement of external circumstances. While external factors absolutely play a role in the manifestation of mental illness, a single change in relationship status is not a mystical cure-all. We can celebrate all of the things that Silver Linings Playbook does well, but it's still far from ideal."

"schreiber-stephen","7","2","3","20 January 2014"," So much better than a 5!
","I've heard some harsh criticism of David O. Russell and his direction of several movies lately. This had me expecting this movie to be a 5 but it is so much more than that. The writing and the direction are both incredible. David O. Russell had his hands on both. The David O. Russell movies I have seen so far have all been very good and I am not sure I agree with some of the criticism I have heard lately. This movie is an example of how great he is at taking something written and adapting it into a well crafted, witty screenplay. Then he translates that onto the screen and achieves a movie that I will not soon forget.<br/><br/>I will get the few negatives out of the way first and create a review positive / negative / positive sandwich.<br/><br/>The major problem I had with this movie is John Ortiz and quite frankly that isn't even close to the next worst part. Ortiz plays the character of Ronnie. Ronnie is a man who is stressed out because his wife Veronica (Julia Stiles) demands that her life be perfect and that she gets whatever she desires or he is afraid that she will leave him. Veronica's harsh character fuels Ronnie's stress to the point of needing someone to vent to so that he will not freak out in front of her. This is why Ronnie ends up venting to Pat (Bradley Cooper). Ronnie is a clown. He is distracting and tries way too hard to be funny. Ortiz's delivery of every line is quite annoying and I am not sure why David O. Russell let this Jim Carrey-esk overacting performance pollute what could have been a near perfect presentation from just about every character on screen. It may have even been highlighted as a result of him being surrounded by a group of actors nailing it in every scene. Such a shame.<br/><br/>The only other issue I had with the movie was some plot holes and cheesy moments but those were easily overlooked due to the strength of the acting and the story as a whole. <br/><br/>You can tell a good script by how information is delivered to the viewer and Silver Linings Playbook was one of those movies that everyone should see just for that aspect of it. The way they deliver information about characters and who has certain relationships with others isn't by saying ""you're my dad"" or ""I'm your brother"" but it is cleverly disguised by psychiatric evaluation in therapy of Pat. As the movie progresses, you learn more and more information about these troubled characters. Each character has their own issues and development but each character needs the other characters to be able to grow, cope with tough situations and develop further. Lastly, the comedy in this movie is dark and at times subtle but it worked so well for me as I was laughing at many of the situations each character was involved in.<br/><br/>I loved this movie even with its few flaws. It was great to see Chris Tucker on the big screen again as he made his triumphant return. This is a great date movie as it has sports and cheesy moments all wrapped up in one package. Just don't watch this one with a new relationship as there are some aspects that are not first date friendly."

","Pat (Bradley Cooper) is Bipolar. It is evident in his constant manic state. I never see the deep depression that accompanies the diagnosis, so maybe he is just manic. Unfortunately, he is off his meds, and trying to solve the problem on his own. Really stupid. He is so deluded that it is not even funny. Is this supposed to be a comedy?<br/><br/>He attends sessions with a therapist (Anupam Kher), but it is a waste of time due to the fact that he is not taking his meds. So, how long is it going to be before he is back in the hospital or jail?<br/><br/>In comes Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), the best part about this movie. She may be a little crazy, but she is doing the best thing possible for Pat. She has him committed and focused. I think it is a little unrealistic, but there is a point where he does say he is back on his meds, so maybe it was just the script.<br/><br/>His parents, Pat Sr. and Dolores (Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver), show that the apple doesn't really fall far from the tree. They do support him in their crazy was, as does his friends.<br/><br/>Lawrence was fantastic, and Julia Stiles was like icing on the cake."

","Led by director David O Russell (The Fighter), and delivered by great performances from the Oscar Nominated leads (Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro), Silver Linings Playbook works brilliants.<br/><br/>The film skates over issues of mental illness, only starts to get going with the belated introduction of Jennifer Lawrence (about 25 minutes in), and ultimately follows a relatively conventional rom-com flightpath. But there are times when it does something new with the genre — and it does make you care about the protagonists. <br/><br/>As great as he is a writer, Russell's direction is as fantastic as always. If there's one thing that can be said, even in his weaker entries, he's always had a knack for extracting terrific performances out of all of his actors. The lead character on paper is only as good as his actor, and Bradley Cooper expresses every believable ache out of Pat Jr. Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver are typically strong as his parents, while Chris Tucker works with a nice little comic relief in his brief role.<br/><br/>Why the film works besides the directing is the story. It is fascinating seeing Cooper act as a mental patient wondering his way through his everyday life, as well as Jennifer Lawrence playing a mysterious browser. Silvers Lining Playbook is disguised as a rom- com but it is much more than your typical Hollywood fare. You are rooting for the characters in the end, as even though it may be somewhat predictable, the way it all unfolds is worth the watch. ==================================================================== ====== As for a rewatch (07/04/17') Silver Linings Playbook is more fun and entertaining on another viewer.

","""Silver Linings Playbook"" belongs to the category of good and sane American comedies, with some drama and romance, where all the necessary components are carefully and wisely rationed out to give rise to a pleasant and always enjoyable product. First, a well-constructed plot, that besides some conventions moves forward quickly and grippingly, and never concedes a single moment of boredom; then, an intelligent screenplay, that without sounding that original, is able to touch some emotional chords in a delicate way, with the addition of some funny lines. In addition, the intelligent use of a camera, to focus on the eyes of the protagonists to try to capture their inner distress to the utmost, and the emotional power of a varied and intense soundtrack, ranging from soul, to jazz to pop. Given all this, let's add a very strong cast, and the successful result is granted. The couple Cooper-Lawrence works perfectly, they are fully in sync, the former offers and unusually intense performance, and the latter gives a very promising adult-performance, considering her young age. But (and that goes without saying), the best performance goes to the always exhilarating Robert De Niro, who plays the obsessive-compulsive father with both strong and funny pathos and interacts with the loving mother Jackie Weaver in a very joyfully and heartfelt manner. To sum up, if you are looking for a feel-good comedy, just enjoy this comedy, which deserves the merit of facing the relation between mental disorder and love, with that amusing but respectful attitude, which is not so easy to find in movies."

It is a topic near and dear to him as his own son has bipolar disorder like the lead character. By balancing dramatic situations with comedic overtones, Russell has accomplished a rare feat, an excellent drama with a superior cast that treads the fine line of humor. By making such a delicate subject accessible to the masses, he has made a really entertaining, crowd pleaser.<br/><br/>Pat (Bradley Cooper) suffers from bipolar disorder and, following a breakdown over a failed marriage and confinement to a psychiatric facility in Baltimore, has just been released to his parents' care. Now back in Philadelphia and living with his parents, Dolores (Jacki Weaver), his doting mother, and Pat, Sr. (Robert DeNiro), a sports addict, Pat is determined to get his wife back despite a restraining order. He is so obsessed with getting back with his wife that he boils over on occasion with emotional outbursts which threaten to send him back to confinement. When he is not taking his meds or visiting his therapist, he runs in his neighborhood to get into shape in anticipation of repatriating with his wife, or so he thinks. One day he runs into Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), another troubled soul who not only has been widowed recently, but now sleeps with anyone. Their uneasy interactions lead to an unusual offer by Tiffany for him to partner with her in a dance contest in exchange for her being an intermediary and backdoor link to his wife. What follows are the revelations of emotional scars and the realities of finding happiness in the most unlikely places.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent, particularly the four lead actors. Lawrence portrays Tiffany as a seemingly naïve, young woman, but she turns out to be a bright, perceptive person who is not afraid to stand toe-to-toe with anyone. DeNiro has not had such a strong role in many years, and he shows just how good he still is. Even Chris Tucker, in an unusual supporting role, registers as Pat's buddy from his psych group.<br/><br/>The film is about how people, who are trapped in their own patterns of behavior, are afraid or unable to reach out and take a chance in life. The depictions of mental illness are portrayed with realism. When Pat undergoes mood swings, it can manifest itself as uncontrollable rage brought on by a simple trigger. He has no filter to his reactions and responses which can be quite awkward and downright offensive. Much as Jack Nicholson's character in As Good as It Gets laments if 'this really is as good as it gets', Cooper's Pat tries to find the 'silver lining' in his life.<br/><br/>It is interesting to note that virtually every major character in the story has emotional issues in varying degrees. At one point Pat actually thinks Tiffany is crazier than he is. Pat's father, a superstitious gambler and bookie, has his own issues with obsessive-compulsive disorder. His belief that having his son nearby to ensure the Eagles football team a victory, leads to an amusing confrontation with Tiffany.<br/><br/>When you have a cast that is this good, you have to look at the director, Russell, who orchestrates like a master conductor. Despite an uneven filmography in his early career, he is rapidly becoming the actors' go-to director. His attention to minor details like the simple act of tying a tie, a quick reaction shot, or hand gesture enriches the texture of a characterization. His recent films (The Fighter) have taken noteworthy, acting ensembles and elicited superior, Oscar worthy performances amid strong story lines. Somewhere, directing legends, George Cukor (The Philadelphia Story) and William Wyler (The Best Years of Our Lives), are smiling broadly."

","Watching Silver Linings Playbook tonight I got the feeling that the parts of the film good as they are did not add up to a perfect whole. Still the film has a lot to recommend it. After all it did get eight Oscar nominations from last year including one each in all the acting categories. And an Oscar for Jennifer Lawrence for Best Actress. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper, nominated for Best Actor plays a husband who just did a stint in a mental hospital for beating the living daylights out of his wife's lover. All three were teachers at the same high school in South Philadelphia and that must have had the faculty and students gossiping for a year.<br/><br/>Jacki Weaver and Robert DeNiro play Cooper's parents and both were nominated in the Supporting players category for both sexes. Weaver had her son released in her custody without telling DeNiro who accepts the situation for peace at home. He's got his own issues, he's a degenerate gambler who drives Weaver to wit's end.<br/><br/>Some friends try to fix up Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence on the theory that two volatile people could help heal each other. Lawrence's issues stem from the death of her husband a Philadelphia cop. Although there is an attraction for them, both their joint volatility and Cooper's refusal to give up trying to win back his wife are obstacles.<br/><br/>All those things plus DeNiro's gambling habit combine in one interesting climax where the growing relationship of Cooper and Lawrence plus DeNiro's finances are on the line. I dare not say more.<br/><br/>Some nice location cinematography also distinguishes Silver Linings Playbook. Having visited Philadelphia a few times I recognized quite a bit of it. We get to see quite a bit of South Philadelphia where it seems everyone knows everyone and everyone's business.<br/><br/>Both Cooper and Lawrence come across as decent and three dimensional people trying to cope as best they can with mental illness. Lawrence just lights up the screen with her performance. I didn't see the other nominated roles, but they would have had to go some to beat her out for the Oscar and apparently didn't.<br/><br/>My main criticism of an otherwise fine film is that I see no silver linings for either main character. They'll have to do a lot to make the relationship work if they can. <br/><br/>Still Silver Linings Playbook is a wonderful film deservedly honored with all those nominations and Jennifer Lawrence's Oscar."
"lars_hendrikx","10","2","3","3 March 2013"," My favorite Comedy
","After finding out about this movie months ago I had to wait for it to come out here in the Netherlands. Luckily this almost coincided with the Oscars. I've become a big fan of Jennifer Lawrence after seeing her good performances in Winter's Bone and the Hunger Games and was keen to see her in this movie. <br/><br/>In my humble opinion, this was a deserved win for Jennifer Lawrence in the category Actress in a Leading Role. She portrays the character Tiffany in a fun way. My only concern before seeing the movie was that she might made it too funny, in a way making fun of bipolar. While that was a small concern seeing the director David O. Russel has experienced Bipolar in his family and knows how to handle this subject. you do have to be subtle when basing a movie on a delicate matter. Fortunately, none of this happened and the movie turned out to be a delight. <br/><br/>First off, the acting. The acting in this movie is of good quality. It's not extremely good, but it's definitely viable. Robert de Niro plays a fun role playing the Football-addicted father of Bradley Coopers character. Bradley Coopers character is portrayed in a good way. His reactions to certain situations or sounds are fun to see. While I liked his acting in this movie it's not sublime and i'm happy to see he got nominated for an Oscar for this role. Jennifer Lawrence takes the lead for me though, with a very good performance in this movie. As I said before, a deserved Oscar winner. The dialogs between Pat and Tiffany(Bradley and Jennifer) are a lot of fun to watch. Their chemistry in this movie is exciting and you can tell they had a lot of fun making this movie. <br/><br/>The story is good. Comedies tend to be a tad predictable, what this movie is too at points but with a comedy it's about the quality of the humor. This movie made me laugh a lot, so it's definitely of good quality when it comes to the humor. <br/><br/>Definitely a recommendation from me if you want to see a fun movie that will make you laugh."
"EUyeshima","8","2","3","2 March 2013"," A Different Kind of a Romcom with Quirkily Effective, Seriocomic Touches
","Portraying mental illness on screen usually means you'll see bravura scenes set in an asylum like ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", but iconoclastic filmmaker David O. Russell (""The Fighter"") deals with the edges of emotional disequilibrium in this compellingly quirky 2012 dramedy. Based on the same-name 2008 novel by Matthew Quick, this film reminds me a bit of Russell's 1999 dysfunctional family comedy, ""Flirting with Disaster"", as the seriocomically volatile dynamics here are amplified by the central character's precarious psychological state. High school teacher Pat Solitano Jr. is a man with bipolar disorder who has spent eight months in a Baltimore psychiatric hospital for a violent episode caused by seeing his wife Nikki cheating with a fellow teacher. He's released into the care of his parents and determined to win back his estranged wife.<br/><br/>As he strives to improve himself, Pat meets Tiffany Maxwell facing her own level of mental instability since becoming widowed, turning to indiscriminate sex with her co-workers, and most recently losing her job. Eventually they strike a deal where she will help him win back his wife if he enters a dance competition with her, both coping with their disorders at the same time. At first, I really didn't buy Bradley Cooper (""The Hangover"") as Solitano since his idea of showing manically obsessive behavior is to speak loudly in a monotone without much nuance, but his performance grew on me as Russell's screenplay had him show more layers to a character that has a hard time eliciting sympathy from anyone much less the audience. At 21, Jennifer Lawrence (""Winter's Bone"") would appear too young to play a sex-addicted cop widow like Tiffany, but she excels with her preternatural ability to convey unforced maturity and conviction without losing touch with the character's deep-seeded vulnerability.<br/><br/>Perhaps the film's nicest surprise is Robert De Niro's sterling performance as Pat Sr., his best work in years after the silly shenanigans of the Fockers franchise. Exhibiting his character's obsessive-compulsive disorder in powerful, brief scenes, De Niro vividly shows how the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree. Completely submerging her Australian roots in favor of a convincing Mid-Atlantic accent, Jacki Weaver (""Animal Kingdom"") effectively plays the lone voice of sanity as Pat's mother constantly fretting over her son and preparing ""crabby snacks and homemades"" for home viewing of the family's beloved Philadelphia Eagles. As Pat's best friend Danny, a fellow patient constantly escaping from the hospital, motor-mouthed, high-pitched Chris Tucker (""Rush Hour"") is surprisingly good even if his soulful dance moves came across as a convenient plot device. Julia Stiles (""Mona Lisa Smile"") shows up in a smallish role as Tiffany's patronizing, status- conscious sister Veronica. The climax induces the right emotions even if it means the uncertainties in the plot get wrapped up all too neatly."
"Christian_Dimartino","9","2","3","3 February 2013"," Crazy brilliant love.
","David O'Russell's new movie Silver Linings Playbook could possibly become a classic some day. It's got the kind of mood, story, and performances that nobody will forget for a long time. It's a funny and charming romantic comedy that happens to be the best romantic comedy in recent years, thanks in part to the bizarre chemistry (does that make sense? It will) of the two leads.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper is better than ever as Pat, a bipolar guy who has just been released from the loony bin. He was sent there for beating the crap out of his wife's mister. But he stills loves her, and he is trying desperately to win her back. Then he meets Tiffany (the extraordinary Jennifer Lawrence), a bizarre widow who happens to be the solution to his problem.<br/><br/>Pat needs to communicate with his wife, but due to a restraining order that is difficult. Tiffany tells him that if he participates with her in a dancing competition, then she will deliver messages to his wife. In the meanwhile, Pat is having some family issues with his father Pat Sr. (Robert DeNiro in his best performance in years), and his father needs him in order to save his pension (I won't spoil why).<br/><br/>O'Russell's previous film The Fighter was about family, and at the heart of this one it is too. Apparently Robert DeNiro was in tears when he read this script. That sounds horrifying. Like that movie, Silver Linings Playbook is special because of its performances. The stand-out in that one, if I had to pick one, would be Christian Bale. The stand-out here (it's hard to pick) would be Jennifer Lawrence.<br/><br/>Lawrence, who is a front runner at the Oscars, is better than ever here. She's a knockout. She's wild, feisty, and incredibly sexy. Every scene with her and Cooper are the best. But the best moment in the movie (besides their sexy dance scene) is when her and Robert DeNiro have a hilarious confrontation.<br/><br/>SLP is the year's best comedy, and one of the years best movies. It's as if Cooper and O'Russell have completely changed their train of thought here and decided to bring us something special. It takes those romantic Katherine Heigl rom-coms and puts them in the corner of shame. Woody Allen wouldn't even write something like this, even though Vicky Cristina Barcelona was kind of wild. SLP is one of the year's most entertaining movies. See it before Oscar night.<br/><br/>A-"
"llahbob","10","2","3","2 February 2013"," I have experienced life with people like these.......
","and I found the movie to be straight forward and honest. I think Jennifer Lawrence was amazing. Of the three leading movies I have seen this year, Lincoln, Les Mis and Silver Linings Playbook, I enjoyed Silver Linings the most. And now because I have to fill in ten lines for this to be posted I will now just put in words. This requirement is stupid. It is like making you say more than necessary to get the point across. So I will say once again I really enjoyed the story, the characters, the acting was as good as I have seen in a long time. Of course this is not the same movie situation as others that are in the running. So you can see all you want and make your choice."
"heartinstone","9","2","3","16 January 2013"," Bradley Cooper is officially an actor.
","Bradley Cooper is officially one of my favorite actors after watching this film. No, seriously. I've liked his movies, like the Hangover and the A-team and The Words. But this movie- this movie brought out the best of his talent. The story centers around Pat, who was just released from a mental institution after a major breakdown when he found his wife cheating on him. He moves back in with his parents on the thought that he was destined to get back together with his wife, who - evidently has a restraining order against him. It's a challenge for him, dealing with his newly diagnosed bipolar disorder and his OCD father who will bet everything on the Eagles winning a football game. <br/><br/>But then he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), the sister of one of Pat's friend's wife. Tiffany is probably just as screwed up as he is. She's a broken, lost girl who doesn't care what anyone thinks of her but knows a lot about living. The two form an unlikely friendship, and though they each have problems of their own, you know instantly that they'll be perfect for each other. <br/><br/>There was something about this movie that stayed with me after I finished watching it. I'm still not quite sure what it was. Perhaps it was the strong performances of Lawrence and Cooper that made me realize how good of a movie it was. Perhaps it was the storyline and the characters that were so ridiculously troubled that you couldn't help but cheer for them the entire way through. Lawrence's performance was spectacular, and I have a feeling she will become quite an actress in the years to come. But it was Cooper's performance that took me by surprise. As he's known mostly for his comedic roles, Cooper's dramatic role was superb. He stole each scene, and you could tell he loved playing this character. <br/><br/>The pacing of this film was excellent, not a dull moment in the entire movie. The supporting characters were wonderful, especially Robert DeNiro, who played Pat's OCD father. The script was fantastic, perfectly written and the dialogue was genius. <br/><br/>This is one of those rare gems, where people have heard about but don't really know what it's about. After watching this movie, Cooper and Lawrence definitely have to take home the Oscar. If not both, than definitely Cooper. <br/><br/>I will probably own this movie when it comes out on DVD, I loved it that much."
"manuelra84","8","2","3","16 January 2013"," What a beautiful message for a heart broken person
","What a beautiful story. The best thing was the message ""Love really drives people crazy and spread them around once they got heart broken, so all you need is to find another crazy victim like you to find love again""- Pure poetry The director's hand was a bit heavy, but not distracting. The game bet issue was a bit heavy handed from the writers, it was clear they tried to emphasize the climax and ending. My only story wise critique The acting was very good. Bradley became Bradley in the end. Jennifer maintained her character during the whole thing, like Jacki, she made me miss my mom. Robert was OK. Very interesting cinematography options, especially for key moments. I'm glad this film was done."
"dibvallad","9","1","1","29 June 2020"," Excelsior!
","Funny, romantic (not cheesy) and accurate, a total change of the romance genre adding a philosophical and actually real side of mental illness, Bradley and Jennifer's chemistry is stunning and refreshing while Pat's parents are pure gold for the film.
It's nice to know there are movies like this."
"MeDaminiKumar","8","1","1","9 May 2020"," Wonderful script
","Disturbingly fast-paced, and as heart-warming as it is hilarious. Telling us a happily-ever-after story but with dysfunctional protagonists. This is the most heart-warming drama I have ever seen. It's all about love between families, friends and people. Yes, you can talk about the great performances or well-written script or amazing soundtrack, but no words are enough to describe how heart-warming the film is."
"thomasmitilis1995","7","1","1","19 April 2020"," YOU HAVE POOR SOCIAL SKILLS, YOU HAVE A PROBLEM...
","PROS:The film is a refreshing addition to the rom-com genre and focuses on mental illness and self-destruction. It's about a bipolar man who tries to reconcile with his ex-wife and get his life back after an assault on her lover and the committal to a phychiatric hospital. Bradley Cooper illustrates the insanity of his character exceptionally well and his mannerisms are impressive. On the other side, Jennfer Lawrence is a widowed woman who suffers from depression, something that pushes her to do mad things. Her portrayal is astounding as well and the chemistry between these two imperfect individuals is incredible. Apart from them, Robert de Niro shines as the supersticious and obsessive with the gamble father and his character is a reflection that everyone can have a fixation. Chris Tucker isn't unsurprisingly annoying and Jackie Weaver does a decent job as the supportive and patient mother. David O. Russell's direction and the sharp dialogue depicts fantastically the clumsiness of the characters and the humour comes across naturally.
CONS:In the last act, the movie forgets completely the issues about mental disorder. It's frustrating when the ''love cliche'' solves everything and makes every problem magically disappear. Moreover, the ''twist'' in the end is kind of predictable and is overplayed in the rom-com genre."
"aidanratesmovies","10","1","1","13 April 2020"," Fantastic
","A smart, impactful, and surprisingly entertaining narrative, Silver Linings Playbook does more than an impressive job of exploring the live of those with bipolar, and provides a fantastic story along the way. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence both give fabulous performances as the leads, Pat and Tiffany, as well as Robert De Niro as Pat's father. The film is really entertaining, engaging, and interesting to watch. It can be certainly tough to view at times, but as the world around these characters are broken down and break down in the process, the film does a masterful job of making us want to root for their sides. The film is incredibly clever and well written, and the work of the book can easily be seen upon the screen, and proves to be quite an impressive feat to match. The cinematography is interesting, and honestly provides plenty of shots that i'm sure in the future will be lead to be iconic. The pacing of the film starts off slower than the rest, but this justification, is by all means a great way to start it, and will be firmly enjoyed upon my future viewing. In the end, Silver Linings Playbook is a wonderfully romantic, emotional, and very clever film. It's approach on bipolar is a tour de force, and one of the many reasons that makes this such an important work of cinema. It's entertaining, captivating, and very impactful, and will easily not be an experience I forget anytime soon.
My Rating: 10/10"
"kiradykesky","9","1","1","10 April 2020"," Traditional comedy movie, recommended
","In fact, everyone has such small psychological problems, such as coercion, depression, and irritability. This is where the audience resonates with the film. The story is more common, and develops in the expected direction. The trouble of one relationship is healed by the other. This is a traditional family ethics love comedy film, the story is built quite traditionally, acting is naturally the biggest bright spot, the climax of the arrangement is one after another, the final emotions are bright and bright, and the infectious and atmosphere of the story Awesome."

","One of the greatest films made in recent years; smart, hilarious, sad and brilliantly romantic with lovely performances and written so well. Ultimately pretty feel-good too which always helps! Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are absolutely stunning in the central roles; they fully become the characters Pat and Tiffany, which we root for every step of the way. Pat's parents Pat Senior and Dolores are performed to absolute perfection by Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver, their support and want for their son to feel better is a thoroughly engaging, emotional and often times funny aspect. Very much like the film itself! Every performance is great in this film, from Chris Tucker's Danny to John Ortiz's Ronnie. It is based on a novel by Matthew Quick adapted for the screen by writer/director David O. Russell (Joy, I Heart Huckabees) who has crafted such a beautiful warm hug of a film that I really must go and buy the source material too! Everybody in the cast and crew should be so proud for having made this gem. Hell of a great soundtrack"

"khemanth-14988","8","1","1","29 January 2020"," Refreshing take on Rom coms
","Honestly i started to watch this movie just for the cast. The movie starts off with Pat being released from the mental institution and the first thirty minutes give u an impression of there is no where near a rom com. But as you get into the complexities of the characters of Tiffany and Pat, you just get involved. Thanks to terrific performance from Jennifer Lawrence who carried the multi dimensionality of Tiffany's character with atmost perfection. The movie donesnt have any cheesy lines or the leads holding hands and watching stars. It's just two up individuals who help each other to get better. Not to mention Robert deniro gave a stellar performance as Pat Sr. The movie is near perfect and a good watch for one time."

","First off I have not read the book that this movie is based on so I cannot comment on changes that were made and having said that this movie was both entertaining and educational to watch. The script was well written as it really showed how mental illness can effect people and there was a good mixture of comedic and dramatic scenes. However the profanity that was used seemed to be excessive but the actors all did a great job in their roles especially Robert DeNiro and Chris Tucker who proved that he could do dramatic roles without using a lot of profanity. The cinematography was mostly excellent but there were continuity errors along with other mistakes and the dance choreography was outstanding along with the soundtrack. Also on the DVD that I watched there were deleted scenes that I wish could have remained in the movie, a featurette about the movie and some behind the scenes footage all of which are worth watching."

It went from the depths of really low points of Pats life to the moment we were all praying for. I think this was drama more than comedy but the wonderful thing is you found yourself laughing when you didn't realise it, almost feeling embarrassed to finding things funny about difficult people with such serious problems. The jokes are subtle but I went through all sorts of emotions watching this, bravo to all that went into making this, they deserve all the credit they received.

","Silver Linings Playbook tries to mix humor and sadness and almost pulls it off. It is funny and it does have some powerful emotional moments but it is neither a great comedy, or a great drama about mental illness. And the typical Hollywood ending did not help matters. What is great about the movie is the performances. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence have great chemistry together and play two mentally unstable young adults with infectious zeal. But it is Lawrence who steals the show. She is reason enough to see this movie. Arguably, this may be the best performance of her career. Robert De Niro, in a supporting role is great as well. Even though Silver Linings Playbook has some narrative problems and a typical Hollywood feel-good ending, it can be overlooked, because the characters are so rich and the performances so good."

"tabuno","10","1","1","17 January 2019"," Finally An Emotionally Gripping Mental Health Drama
","2 December 2012. Certainly not a Hemingway movie. Finally a full feature film with mental health as its central core that captures the visceral and authentic impact of mental illness without the cliques, stereotypes. At it is for the fact that director/writer David O. Russell avoids these pitfalls that allows the real captivating and emotive vibrancy of the this family and relational drama come alive. Such movies don't need the extra baggage of sweeping epic dramatization as The Sound of Music (1965) and occult horror special effects Constantine (2005) or unusual circumstances as Fly Away Home (1996) or The Wrestler (2008) to create fascinating characters and situations from fantasy and instead can follow a well-written script to make its emotive impact as Where the Lilies Bloom (1974) or even the more unlikely intensity surrounding Elizabethtown (2005) or A History of Violence (2005) or the exotic foreign look into Slumdog Millionaire (2008). Helen (2009) opened the door to mental illness as a decent movie drama sub-genre by itself following up with the authentic human drama found in Margot at the Wedding (2007). Silver Lining Playbook is a penetrating look at the behind the close doors and sometimes not so closed doors of real life disputes, family conflict without resort to hyper-drama disconnected with most lives in America or around the world as A Beautiful Mind (2001), The Fisher King (1991), or He Was a Quiet Man (2007). Even a relatively common as unemployment and poverty might be as depicted in Seven Pounds (2008) or even more closely aligned in topical matter to The Soloist (2008) dealing with schizophrenia, Silver Lining Playbook focuses on our family or a family that we likely know.<br/><br/>Silver Lining Playbook stands out from even Girl, Interrupted (1999) for its more accessible look into a family that that most in America can relate to in the family room, bedroom, in public streets, a cafe instead of hidden away residential facilities. Unlike Lars and the Real Girl (2007), the humor in this movie is in part based on our own uncomfortable feelings that are touched so much closer to home, a laughter based on the intensity of mental illness and the embarrassment that we might feel if we actually acknowledged the tragedy that periodically occurs in this movie, like slapstick comedy of the silent movie era. Much like John Carpenter's The Thing (1982) made everyday things such a dog into a horror creature, Silver Lining Playbook allows its audience to take everyday life and begin to understand how any of our lives or those around us can be so easily touched by mental illness or the polite facades and idiosyncrasies we all surround ourselves with.<br/><br/>Silver Lining Playbook might be more closely compared to a more upbeat Little Miss Sunshine (2006)or the more artistic and polished American Beauty (2000) or the contemporary plight of economic recession on family man in Up In The Air (2009) or the more straight forward dance movie of Shall We Dance (1996 and 2004) or a raw dramatic look at family life of the 1950s of The Tree of Life (2011), the darker A Day of Wine and Rose (1962) which presented a stark and tragic look at alcoholism.<br/><br/>Except for the ending, Silver Lining Playbook represents a significant and daring family drama presentation of mental illness, though perhaps in the tone of Pat from the movie, this definitely isn't Hemingway and thus makes it the perfect movie, if wants to throw Hemingway out the window."

","David O Russell just makes immensely fun, watchable movies. Silver Linings Playbook is a realistic and empathetic consideration of living with mental illness, and Cooper and Lawrence make the movie a success with excellent performances. From the first scenes, we empathize with Pat's day-to-day struggles and root for him to succeed. Cooper does a phenomenal job in showing the emotional swings and challenges to control himself that Pat goes through as a bipolar person. The romance and plot may be a bit forced and predictable, but Lawrence brings necessary depth to Tiffany's character. It's nothing earth shattering, but the script and performances allow the audience to really connect with and root for these unusual, struggling characters, and as I've come to expect from Russell, you get a somewhat traditional movie executed well that's just enjoyable to watch."

","Excelsior! Having spent several months in a psychiatric hospital, a recently divorced man suffering from bi-polar disorder is released to live with his overbearing parents in a suburb of West Philadelphia-not exactly an ideal scenario given his unpredictable behavior and attempt to get his act together. While his mother tries to get him back on the right track and his father desires to make up for lost time by bonding through Eagles football, he meets and forms an uneasy friendship with an unorthodox young woman (recently widowed) who's just as messed up as he is. Like you'd expect the film has a foregone conclusion, but focusing on two lead characters who are totally screwed up creates more entertainment by sidestepping the typical elements of the genre. Moody, poignant, and unconventional, with colorful dialogue and important themes like family and friendship are all displayed by Russell's skillful direction that effectively captures the shifting moods of his mercurial characters. Cooper is appropriately brooding and neurotic, Lawrence perfectly feisty and acerbic, but the acting is superb all-around. ***"

","People are saying that it's ""offensive"" and ""too happy"" to be real, and that surprises me.
As someone who lives with mental illness (severe major depression with severe psychotic features), and was in psych ward for quite a while, I didn't find it offensive. I found it to be remarkably accurate in portraying some of my own struggles, with mind-dulling medications, unwanted outbursts, deep paranoia, odd tics, etc. that I have had for over ten years.
As for the ""overly happy"" stuff? Too many movies and TV shows focus on being ""dark"" and ""edgy"", so I found it refreshing to see someone going through struggles being positive about it. I won't pretend to have had the most difficult life, but it hasn't been easy. I saw this movie a few months after I was released from psych ward (2016), and I can honestly say it gave me a bit of hope to find my own silver lining.
The world needs more positivity."

","Good, but not great. Well-intentioned, but flawed. Starts off very interestingly and engagingly, with many amusing moments. However, the story becomes more trite and predictable the longer it goes on. Plus, the plot isn't water-tight.<br/><br/>I was expecting something darker and more character-based, rather than light and plot-based.<br/><br/>It's the great performances that lift this movie to above the average. Jennifer Lawrence deserved her Oscar, as did Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver their nominations.<br/><br/>Not as good as I was expecting it to be, but not bad either."
"freemantle_uk","6","1","1","5 December 2015"," Jennifer Lawrence excels in a decent romantic-drama
","Based on a novel by Matthew Quick David O. Russell's adaptation of The Silver Linings Playbook was one of the big awards contenders during the 2012/13 awards season, being the first film since Reds to be nominated for all four acting awards at the Academy Awards.<br/><br/>Patrizo ""Pat"" Solitano (Bradley Cooper) is a man who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and been sent to a mental health hospital for eight months after finding out his wife was cheating on him. Pat is released in the care of his parents (Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver), but he is still of the brief that he just needs to better himself and he will get back with wife, despite the fact she has a restraining order against him. Pat live soon changes when he meets a young woman who also has mental health issues, Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a woman that could be his route back his wife. But Tiffany is a damaged woman and wants something in return, a dance partner.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence won an Academy Award for her performance and it was deserved award. She totally convinces as Tiffany, a forthright personality who has a lot of demons. The role was clearly meant to be for a slightly older actress, but it goes to show how talented Lawrence is by selling the role. Both as a character and as an actress she dominates the screen, whether she has to take command or when she has an episode.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast also give excellent performances, something you expect considering the talent involved. Cooper and De Niro are both top actors and are excellent as the father and son, both with issues, Cooper managing with a condition while avoiding using drugs and De Niro having some OCD tendencies, hinting that Pat's condition may run in the family. One of the big scenes in the film was when the family argue after an incident and Tiffany coming and controlling the situation. This trio of Lawrence, Cooper and De Niro obviously enjoy working with Russell because they end up working together again in American Hustle and Joy. Even Chris Tucker is tolerable in his role as Pat's best friend.<br/><br/>Despite the praise the film has received Silver Lining Playbook has a very standard story arc, that Pat wants to get back with his wife, but want he needs is to move on. It is clear from the start she's not interested in getting back together and from what we find out about her Pat just idolises her. The screenplay is also very episodic, a series of challenges Pat has to face: accepting he needs to take his pill, taking Tiffany out on date, learning to dance, face a big dilemma and perform in a final competition. There was a slight sports movie template. There are subplots looking at the Pat's relationship with his father, how American Football is key to their relationship, yet has a poisonous effect on Pat, getting him banned from the stadium for fighting and his passion and superstitions lead to him foolhardy decisions.<br/><br/>Silver Linings Playbook has been described as a comedy and it does have some witty lines and comedy interactions, but it is really a drama. It is not humorous enough to be a full on comedy. Props does have to be given to Russell's direction, giving us little hints of the family's life through the set dressing. It gives us hints of the wider discord within the family. But the dialogue in the film does feel overwritten and unnatural, being more focused on being profound then grounded or realistic which would have been more appropriate.<br/><br/>Silver Linings Playbook is a showcase for it acting talent and Russell does an excellent job in the director's chair. But it's billing as a comedy-drama is a little misleading and its scripting is very standard affair."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","1","1","14 March 2015"," About what you'd expect
","Pat(Cooper, the barely repressed anger of other of his performances) with bipolar disorder is released from psychiatric care and moves back with his parents. He can't get along with anyone, until he meets Tiffany(Lawrence, confident, using sex to avoid her emotions, amazing as usual. Solid chemistry between the two. She alone is worth watching this for. It would be nice if the role wasn't still a manic pixie dream girl), and they can share about each other's issues, and examine their relationships with each other. She offers to help him get back with his ex-wife if he enters a dance competition with her. But will they develop feelings for each other?<br/><br/>I'm told there are differences from the novel, I have not read it. There are themes of dark and light, looking on the bright side. The ending really doesn't work, both as a sort of climax and the note it ends on. It became clear as this progressed that that's where it was going. Still, this does show, somewhat realistically, people who need help, and portray them as human beings. There are jokes about it, and there's drama with it, and they also get to be more than a diagnosis, have things going on that aren't about their issues. This is filmed in an interesting way.<br/><br/>There is a lot of strong language, violence including some bloody, and a bit of sexuality, as well as a little nudity, in this. I recommend this to fans of romantic comedies. 7/10"
"rodger30","Null","1","1","3 May 2014"," Controlling your own destiny
","The movie Silver Linings Playbook, starring Bradley Cooper (Pat Solatano) and Jennifer Lawrence (Tiffany Maxwell) is a dramatic look at one man who is trying to start his life over after a mental break down.<br/><br/>Pat tries desperately to put his life back together and get his wife back after spending some time in a mental institution for nearing beating his wife's lover to death. Despite the issues he's dealing with he has a surprisingly positive attitude about the changes he has made and wants to let his estranged wife know. Due to a restraining order she has placed on him, he is unable to talk with her or see her. Pat strikes up and unlikely friendship with Tiffany, who is also dealing with some drama due to her recently dead husband. They make a deal to get Pat's letter to his wife Nikki (Brea Bee) in exchange he will enter a local dance competition.<br/><br/>In this unconventional love story it's clear that regardless of your limitations you are in control of your own destiny. While Pat is trying to deal with his own mental illness he is being pulled by his father, Pat Sr. (Robert DeNiro) who has recently become a bookie and keeping his promise to dance with Tiffany. <br/><br/>Pat Sr. thinks that his son is his good luck charm along with the placing of the remote controls and who holds the handkerchief during the Eagles game. This leads Pat into making a decision to let down his father who bet everything he had on one game or let down Tiffany who he made a commitment to. <br/><br/>Although the plot and story lines are very different Silver Linings Playbook has a similar theme to the wildly famous Twilight Series. This movie series was also an unconventional love story where the main stars took control of their destiny despite their limitations.<br/><br/>The voice over narration at the beginning and the end of the movie gave us insight into Pat's mind and how he feels about his life. These instances were vital for the audience to understand the importance of Pat's recovery. The music soundtrack is one of the best and fits in perfectly for every step of the movie. <br/><br/>We all have limitations, financial, physical, social and even mental. This film shows how you can overcome these and find your own happiness when you decide what the important things in life are and what you're willing to give up to get them."
"raulfaust","7","1","1","19 February 2014"," The Life's Good Side
","Knowing that ""Silver Linings Playbook"" won an Oscar for the best performance by an actress in leading role, I decided to give it a chance and see what's going on. The story is basically about a mentally ill guy coming back to his house after spending eight months in the hospital. In this return, everyone is willing to help him dealing with life more calmly, but things don't always work like this. To make it harder for him-- in a first sight--, Pat meets a girl named Tiffany who isn't exactly a role model of mental stability. In fact, sometimes we wonder who has a bigger mental problem, given that both characters face these problems with a considerable frequency. The good thing about that explosive behavior is that it delivers some funny scenes, like the first dinner they have together, in which they explode with rudeness to everybody gathered in the table. I don't honestly know what I felt so funny about that scene, but people acting rude all of a sudden usually makes me laugh, for being so spontaneous. The plot makes it an entertaining movie, mainly because the pace is fast and we care about the main characters. There aren't many thrilling scenes, and the climax is well reached in the dancing scene-- and deliver another funny moment, since nobody could understand why they've felt so happy after receiving a five grade. It's also good to see Robert DeNiro portraying something different than a rough father/grandfather who in the end becomes sensitive and kind; in fact, his character is reasonable all the way through the story. By the way, for some moments Tiffany remembered me a lot the character Penny from the series ""The Big Bang Theory"", despite the fact Tiffany is really crazy hehe. All in all, it just doesn't deserve a better rating because it never accomplish to be too emotional, romantic or funny, but it's in no way a bad film. Also, I can understand why Jennifer Lawrence won the Oscar for having the best performance-- if I agree with that is another discussion."

","It's frustrating you know, watching a film where two people who are clearly meant for each other struggle to discover that conclusion for themselves. They argue, fight and do all they can to avoid the inevitable... to no avail. Of course it does help when the pair are likable enough for us to root for them, and here Hugh Jackman and Jennifer Lawrence have an instant rapport, and we love them as much as they eventually will one another. In another time-honoured movie tradition, both are borderline crazy, and yet seem to be so much wiser and perceptive than their other, supposedly sane family and friends. They might lose their temper for no reason and cause scenes in public places, but at least they're not afraid of speaking their minds and have firm plans in motion.<br/><br/>Oh yes, the 'plan'. This is what the movies boils down to... the ""Silver Linings Playbook"". Think positively about everything, and refuse to let doubt get in the way of your goal. Good luck with THAT. If this film proves anything, it's that the unexpected always get in your way... and if you think life is just a straight highway to your destination, you're in shock. And just like reality, the dialogue here is rich with emotion and humour... these characters jump off the page and become full functioning human beings we care about. During the final act when everything is at stake, if you're not on the edge of your seat cheering them on, check your pulse... you may be dead. A lovely movie. 7/10"
"lasttimeisaw","7","1","1","2 April 2013"," Silver Linings Playbook - A boy-meet-girl tale in modern age
","Finally a cinema-going to officially culminate all the Oscar BEST PICTURE nominee of last year, SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK treads upon a traditionally crowd-pleasing boy-meet-girl romantic genre while smartly embodying two main characters with distinguished personal mental foibles, which is a masterstroke to keep them refreshing and connected with the present quirk-emancipated modern generation. <br/><br/>After his ambitious brothers-boxers drama THE FIGHTER (2010, 8/10), David O. Russell has ascended to the top tier of Hollywood where he can harness marquee stars and meaty source materials, thus, SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK has all its edges to be winsome and lovable, but somewhat the final outcome doesn't live up much to the heated expectation, personally I am rather stolid from the American football fanaticism and the ""parley gamble"" bidding is by no means a recommendable action to be encouraged (but it is an intrinsic default in the source novel, O. Russell should not take the blame here I suppose), anyway, the scenario does make wonders to gyrate a captivating duo-dance between Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, both utterly committed to their characters, verbal ripostes are acetic and sharply accessible. The chemistry sparkles albeit of the age-gap of the actors (a inconceivable 15 years in real life). <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence's Oscar-crowning has sparked (understandably)<br/><br/>controversies (like most of the years), but it is like the film itself, acceptable (for me), the stretch of her character may be impeded by the condescending male-perspective of winning the right girl, why on earth it always ends with a stale ""it is the girl who lingers on the verge of being hurt"" plot even under the exception of the mighty confidence discharging from Lawrence's character. Her youth is the double-edged sword in this case, thanks to her mature countenance, audience may not detect it instantly, and the film also bypasses to specify her age. So it is a younger example of Helen Hunt's win and looks like a future Jodie Foster career orbit, plus her Kristen Stewart popularity (THE HUNGER GAME franchise will continue lighting her path), she is the ""it girl"" in Hollywood right now and a role model of the industry. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper, a later-bloomer in his leading man status, has seized an unexpected earlier harvest in Oscar-nomination than most of his contemporaries, although constantly in the danger of being overshadowed by his more sapient co-stars, performance-wise, it is his own victory. Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver, are not in my top 10 list of the year, since the script doesn't challenge them hard enough, but they do reflect the slice-of-life authenticity of the endearing parents (except that De Niro's weeping scene is too maudlin to endure). And forget about Chris Tucker, I don't know why he pops up here to interrupt his satisfactory (both to him and to me) holed-up.<br/><br/>So, it is a happily-ever-after fairytale full of mentally unstable people with various neuroses, the steady-cam cinematography looks hipster but also impairs one's concentration, the ultimate dance-routine is mesmerizingly shot, but the banal ending does causing a compulsive meh before the credits rolls, although the final speech is fine and (artificially) sincere."

","This is a very odd, unconventional movie. It's about a man, Pat (played by Bradley Cooper. Cooper seems familiar to me from somewhere...), who is released from a mental institution and who tries to win back the affections of his wife...but she has a restraining order on him! Pat had an undiagnosed mental condition which makes him violent, hence his wife's restraining order. We don't really see much of the wife in this movie. Pat is put into the path of Tiffany (played by Jennifer Lawrence), another damaged personality who also has had dealings with the medical fraternity over her mental health issues.<br/><br/>Here's why this movie is so odd and unconventional...Pat is a very unlikeable fellow. It's hard to root for him, hence my lower score. If Cooper was going for a very unlikeable portrayal of a damaged man, then I suppose Oscar recognition is not out of the question. Pat is clueless as far as his interactions with people is concerned and he also lacks self-awareness. Jennifer Lawrence is very sexy in her role (in a Meg Tilly kind of way...but more so) but she isn't a conventional leading lady either. It's hard to imagine what Tiffany sees in Pat...perhaps it's just a case of beautiful people being attracted to each other, even though they may be abrasive personalities (to say the least, especially of Pat)? Lawrence puts together a very strong performance and deserves her Oscar for best actress (I still prefer Naomi Watt's turn in ""The impossible"" though, for drawing out powerful emotions from the viewer). <br/><br/>I've bumped up my score (and maybe could have given it 75%, say) for the end game of the movie. The leading characters warm, as does the movie, as they/it become more conventional in a rom-com kind of way...you do start to root for the characters. So, eventually, this does turn into a date movie. <br/><br/>Robert De Niro as Pat's father (Pat Sr.) is 'interesting'...you can see that Pat Jr. did inherit some of his genes from him! Jacki Weaver as Pat Jr's mother Dolores has some emoting early on in the movie and does give the occasional arch look. Her accent was good (Australians are better at American accents than Americans are at Australian accents)...I don't think she ever lost the accent but maybe once it seemed to lose its flavour. Have heard in the media (perhaps in Australia) that she was nominated for an Oscar in this movie for her performance in the great Australian movie ""Animal kingdom""...which is the way of Hollywood. Chris Tucker as a fellow crazy of Pat the younger is sort of a running gag in this movie. <br/><br/>Did find some of the early shots in the movie rather awkward...a bit too self- conscious...perhaps with Weaver, especially. <br/><br/>Two of the subplots in this movie were rather odd too...a business sideline of Pat Sr. as well as a ""Strictly ballroom"" kind of turn (the Australian movie). <br/><br/>Even when the leading actors were being abrasive (early on, especially), there was still much humour to be had in this movie."

It's not so feel good nor is it hard hitting and take you on an emotional roller-coaster. The only reason this movie is getting all the press is because of its A list starcast.

","It doesn't matter who's in your film - if the story's terrible, they're not going to save it.

Granted, there is meant to be some chaos to it because of the unhinged nature of the characters. However, when you have so many of the actors talking over each other and spouting drivel that is obviously the result of some poor improvisation, it makes for a truly unpleasant and uncomfortable viewing. Now there will be some people who will justify this as ""it was intended this way"", but, intended or not, this is not an enjoyable film to watch.<br/><br/>A collection of poorly-realised ideas that can't be redeemed by a usually great cast.

","I had some trepidations about 'Silver Linings Playbook' because I heard it was another one of those quirky indies, which I usually don't care for. Usually in films that have quirky characters like 'Little Miss Sunshine' or 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower"", there's a quirky group of misfits who end triumphing over a bunch of straw men reactionaries (school bullies often end up in these straw men roles, for example). Fortunately, director David O. Russell's quirky misfits in 'Silver Linings Playbook', Pat Solitano, a bi-polar former substitute teacher and Tiffany Maxwell, an emotionally disturbed widow, are only pitted against one another; thus this particular quirky indie, isn't burdened with an us vs. them subtext.<br/><br/>'Silver Linings', however, is not without its problems. It's a film about a burgeoning romance between two emotionally disturbed people. Russell tries to find humor in people who are emotionally unstable. Anyone who's known people who have been diagnosed as 'bipolar', will tell you it's no laughing matter. But Russell wants us to laugh at Pat during the first act of 'Silver Linings. After he's released from a mental health facility in Baltimore as a result of an eight month court ordered commitment, Pat still remains obsessed with his ex-wife, Nikki, and throws tantrums in front of his parents because he doesn't like the 'unhappy ending' to a Hemingway novel and on another occasion, is unable to find an old wedding video.<br/><br/>In addition to the unpleasant tantrums, a flashback reveals why Pat was sent to a mental health facility in the first place--he caught a teacher from their mutual school, in the shower with his wife, and then proceeded to pummel him senseless. His court-ordered therapist, Dr. Patel (wonderfully played by a prominent Indian actor, Anupam Kher), manages to be a settling influence on Pat, who recognizes that he needs to look at the positive aspects in life (hence the title, 'silver linings playbook').<br/><br/>'Silver Linings' invariably picks up in the second act, when Pat meets Tiffany Maxwell, played by Jennifer Lawrence. Lawrence, with her manic energy, proves she has comic chops--a nice contrast to her more serious role in 'Winter Bones' (let's forget about her throw away part in 'Hunger Games). The comic banter between the two 'crazies', is the high point of the film and is probably why it's garnered so many positive reviews. There's a highly amusing scene where Pat and Tiffany compare the ill effects of various psychotropic medications they've both taken in the past. They also bump into one another in the neighborhood while taking their daily runs--both feel their personal space is being invaded and they end up trading blunt insults with one another.<br/><br/>In the best scene in the film, when Pat goes on a date with Tiffany at a diner, Pat goes too far and implies that Tiffany's illness is far worse than his. Tiffany storms out of the diner, knocking over all the plates on the table, and then out on the street accuses him of being arrogant and putting her down, in a moment where she's revealed her vulnerable side to him. But Tiffany also goes too far, falsely accusing Pat of 'harassment' in front of a crowd of people, who believe he's about to assault her. The unlikely appearance of the police officer who has been assigned to monitor Pat, prevents the crowd from assaulting him.<br/><br/>The rest of 'Silver Linings' is pure 'Hollywood'. Tiffany agrees to give Nikki, Pat's letter, in exchange for him helping her in the dance competition. Wouldn't you know it, but suddenly Pat is becoming much more serious and responsible as he practices with Tiffany for the competition. More unlikely goings on: Pat's father makes a parley bet with his friend that if his beloved Eagles beats the Dallas Cowboys in an upcoming football game and Pat and Tiffany score at least a 5 out of 10 in the dance competition, he'll win enough money to open a restaurant.<br/><br/>The outcome of the bet, of course, is a fait acompli, and sure enough, 'crazy' Pat ends up crazy only in the sense that he falls in love with Tiffany, and decides that Nikki is a thing of the past.<br/><br/>You've really got to suspend your disbelief that bipolar people such as Pat can so easily overcome their problems, merely through the love of a good woman. In the end, however, 'Silver Linings' strives to be simple, good, clean fun, with a Hollywood ending to boot. But I can't help but feel that the initial 'edginess' of the principals is lost, when they finally do shack up. Thus whatever comic energy is extant during the second act, pretty much dissipates by the end of the third. If you like the trade-off, you won't have any problems with the denouement. For me, the air in the 'Silver Linings' tire, ended up being sucked out faster than you can say, ""failed eccentric romantic dramedy."""

","I really don't know what the fuss is about. Silver Linings Playbook was getting good reviews, so I decided to see it. However, I then watched the online trailer and it put me off completely as it looked like the kind of film I hate. But a special offer and a free afternoon took precedence. It started out loud and manic and I hated it, as expected. Gradually, it moved through tolerable to not bad. So from an initial 5/10 it crept up to 7/10 by the end. It's certainly not Academy Award fodder, though. I still fail to see what's so great about it.<br/><br/>I find Bradley Cooper irritating and have never liked Robert DeNiro, but I do find Jennifer Lawrence fascinating. She always seems to immerse herself in her characters and appears to have no vanity whatsoever (except at premieres and awards ceremonies), which is refreshing. Sometimes she looks plain and sometimes attractive, but she's always intriguing. In my opinion, her performance is the only reason to pay to see this film.<br/><br/>I didn't laugh once, but I did cry at the (spoiler) happy ending. A predictable ending, but welcome nonetheless."

","Call me crazy, deranged, maniacal (why not, everybody else does), or whatever you like, but there is no doubt in my complex mind that ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is one of the best movies I have ever seen. A 21st Century Masterpiece! Writer-Director David O. Russell has orchestrated a divine, genuine flick about a Philly ""born and bred"" 30ish man who has been released from a mental institution who returns to live with his parents and also battles his bipolar disorder. The man I am referring to is Pat, who was put in the mental institution due to almost beating to death the man who his wife was having an affair with. Pat is still obsessed with his wife and stands pat in focusing on getting her back. Pat's parents are Pat Sr. and Dolores. Pat Sr. cares about his son dearly, but his main bird it seems is the obsession he has with the NFL Football team The Philadelphia Eagles. Dolores is your typical loving mom who primarily cares about comforting and smothering her offsprings. Pat gets introduced with Tiffany, a vivacious Philly gal who also has some mental challenges of her own and is still trying to cope with the death of her husband. The silver lining here is that this brilliant film becomes a utopia odyssey on dealing with broken pasts and adjusting to novice changes. Pat dismisses Tiffany mucho times due to his obsession on reconciling with his wife; but when Tiffany asks Pat to be his partner in a dance competition, the playbook is up and running on how their life readjusts with those moves. Writer-Director David O. Russell's masterpiece works on all levels due to his skillful integration of family, psychology, obsession, regret, love, and so many more authentic aspects of the film that perfects its craftsmanship. Russell's script is on the playbook as the best of the year with so many unforgettable verbiage; and is there a better written-scene in a movie this year when Tiffany is explaining to Pat Sr. that his son Pat Jr. is really a good-luck charm to the Eagles when Pat Jr. spends time with her. Bradley Cooper's starring performance as Pat Jr. is the best of his career, and should be nominated for a Best Actor Oscar; and no I am not hungover. Even without speaking in tongues, Cooper's gaze expresses so much about his character's condition. Jennifer Lawrence has just catapulted as my favorite young actress working today with her exceptional performance as Tiffany. Robert DeNiro is back baby! Yes, I am talking to you! His lively performance as Pat. Sr. is vintage DeNiro and is line for a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Jacki Weaver showed that her Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for ""Animal Kingdom"" was no fluke, and is in the kingdom of exemplary thespian talent. It was also great to see Chris Tucker return to form with his charismatic supporting performance as Pat's friend from the mental institution. The game plan for ""Silver Linings Playbook"" was executed to the max, and hopefully is in line for many Oscar nominations. So get your entertainment playbook in gear, and schedule a visit to the ""Silver Linings Playbook"". ***** Excellent"

","A family member adored it and I was prepared to do the same. Oh dear. OK My likes? Jennifer Lawrence. The soundtrack. I've downloaded a few of the pieces played in the film. My dislikes? Let me count. No let me recap:<br/><br/>All sense of reality, common sense, mental illness and human behaviour were tossed out the window.<br/><br/>Bipolar is curable if an out of control mentally ill man, just released from a state hospital with a restraining order on him meets an equally mentally unstable hot girl - yes, girl, she appears to be twenty years younger than him. <br/><br/>The Token Black Man is crazy too and comes and goes at will from the same mental institution despite being under surveillance, tee-hee, sloppy security much? TBM has no purpose in the film other than admire white man's mother's cooking and yuk it up with OCD white dad. And then, whatever job done, TBM disappears from film.<br/><br/>There are no trials for the dance competition. Anyone can enter without prior sighting, regardless of who they are or even if they can dance at all. <br/><br/>A friendly local cop monitors all the outbursts of Crazy White Man (CWM), dropping by the house, appearing at the movie theatre while completely ignoring the fight at the football game or the harassment of the principal at the school<br/><br/>Dad is a proud undercover bookie, wagering the entire family fortune on juju bets and parlays and no one stops him. Breezy mom never worries at all about the insane behaviours of her son and husband they reprise Archie and Edith Bunker in a number.<br/><br/>And the ending, so predictable and clichéd and just cringe-worthy. <br/><br/>But hey! Instant cure for bi-polar - meet a hot young chick and learn how to dance.<br/><br/>I'm familiar with the mental illnesses portrayed in this film and frankly their depiction is an insult.<br/><br/>Silver lining?

"jchodyka-712-409893","5","3","6","2 October 2013"," Mental illness looks like a lot of fun
","I enjoyed the movie the way I like reading secretly ""People"" magazine as a sort of escapism but then feeling guilty that common sense lost a battle over knowledge of mundane details of real life. But after the movie had ended, I realized that it was just another example of surrendering my sense of realism to tricky ways of enternteintment industry - and its ingenious ways of manipulating even more sophisticated audience into believing that serious matters need only a layer of honey and all will be be good at the end. I admit that the movie was fun to watch for its quirky humor and eccentric characters, but was it a realistic description of mental illness? I dare say that not. Actually I think that being mental case looked in this movie like a lot of fun. You are crazy but there are still lots of people around you although in real life families and friends slowly leave you. In the movie our main characters are supported by many family members and friends - the idea I cannot buy easily seeing so many lonely, crazy people living on streets. And what about hard realities of life such as money? He is in a mental hospital for months, has a very patient psychiatrist(only in movies)and have no problem obtaining medicine which is quite expensive in USA. Who is paying for all of that? He has no insurance after being fired and his family doesn't look rich to me. And another perk of being a crazy person according to movie: you really don't have to look for work in this lousy economy ; you get off the hook because after all - you are crazy and nobody expect anything of you. What a relief! And you still are able to do all those funny things like going to games,participating in dance contests, living in nice places, meeting easily new love interest- and a quite hot one. Well, if mental problems are like that I wish to be put on the list of candidates. It certainly beats our mundane, boring lives and constant worries about jobs,children, pensions, getting old.ill and poor. Well, dear viewer - it is like that: a lot of mentally ill people end up on streets, neither get proper treatment nor medicine; many families reject them as too much of a problem to handle. So watch the movie as something to do on a boring winter night if you need some fun but don't believe it. Life isn't like that. If you really need to watch movie about realities of being crazy and living with a crazy person - watch ""A woman under the influence"" directed by John Cassavetes with Gena Rowlands as a crazy housewife and Peter Falk playing her husband. That's how life really looks like when you suffer from mental illness - not fun at all."
"ahmad_hgh","6","3","6","23 August 2013"," Why this many nominations? Absolutely mediocre!
","I'll never understand why this movie got nominated for this many awards. It's just as good as any mediocre romance/comedy like Adam Sandler movies and such. All acts were normal (not amazing and certainly not Oscar worthy). Jacki Weaver who was nominated for best supporting actress was (IMHO) awful and did a terrible job; at some points in the theatre I was looking at her and thinking ""did I really pay 15 bucks to watch this act?"". Anyway, I believe this movie is highly overrated. Seeing that this cheesy movie stood beside amazing movies like Life of Pie, or Lincoln or Argo is an absolute disappointment."
"ironhorse_iv","7","3","6","29 July 2013"," Trying to find the Silver Lining in this movie. It's just hard to find. It's one crazy movie. It was okay film.
","My opinion on the film can be describe by one scene. I didn't know what to expect when I started watching this movie but when the credits end, I was like Bradley Cooper's character, Patrick Solitano after finishing the Ernest Hemingway's book 'Farewell to Arms'. I was wondering 'what the hell?' did I watched. I don't understand the big buzz about this film. For me it was just another higher so-so predictable romantic comedy film. The movie overall was kind of a turn off for me, personally. Maybe, it's the fact that I know bi-polars people, and I hate to watch films that trigger feelings about those people, or just that the fact, all the yelling and arguing in the film made me wonder why am I watching this as an 'escape from reality' film when people yell and argue way too much in real life. It really hard to get through the film with such disturbing scenes like Patrick looking for his wedding video, and where Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence) freaks out in front of the movie theater. Me, personally, I don't like movies that has too much yelling. It hurts my ears. The dramatic elements that were being displayed kinda left me more depressed than sympathetic. Don't watch the trailer by the way, gives out too much of the plot. After a stint in a mental institution, Pat moves back in with his parent's house and tries to reconcile with his ex-wife. Things get more complex for him when Pat meets Tiffany. Like I said before, it's a romantic comedy so it's has a predictable like ending, but no way a chick flick. I really enjoy the director's work; David O. Russell. But the movie feels like three different movies mash into one. I felt the football theme and the ballroom dancing didn't mesh well with mental history as a background. It even look like a romantic comedy half way through the film, but seriously, they forgot about the characters' mental problems and it never gets resolve in the film. I was deeply disappointed. To get back to what Pat says about Hemingway's book, yes, it would be nicer to see stories that end with a happy ending, than tragedy. I glad the movie did have a happy ending, but still, I was left wondering how these two will keep a relationship going when its build upon mental issues, and a history of violence. It's like watching two mental people fall in love with each other without knowing if they will be OK. Most people, I know that has mental problems mixing with another person with mental problem end up with negative outcomes mostly in death or somebody getting hurt. The movie play it safe with a romantic ending. The film does captured the struggles of living with bi-polar. I love how the film shows the illness from the perspectives of those who live with them and those who interact with people affected. I can see Cooper in the role. I loved how he said rude things, but, he made it actually sound like he's just bipolar. I just couldn't get into the character of Tiffany. I know they were trying to make it seem like she was depress goth-head sex addict, but it didn't work out. She seem more like a stalker than anything. She follows Pat like a craze fan. Her character seem to be have more an Adjustment disorder then a normal depression. I just couldn't figure out what she was supposed to be. It was direction-less. Still, there was nothing in Lawrence performance that made me say, yeah, she really deserve that Best Actress win at the Oscars. Even Director Russell did not believe Lawrence was suitable for the role and her audition was only a formality at first. I have to agree with him. While, I do find her sexy and glad that she can handle a mature role. I felt it was mediocre at best. The chemistry between Cooper and Lawrence characters didn't make seem like they should even like each other. I was a little disturbed when I saw the age different between the actors. I did the math on Bradley and Lawrence ages, and while it does seem odd. I do love Robert De Niro as Pat's OCD over crazed Eagles football fan father. Still, it felt like I was watching Robert De Niro playing Robert De Niro. A darker, more extreme version was filmed and scenes were shot with De Niro's character being harsher. Glad, those scenes weren't used. I do have to say, another running gag was Pat's friend, Danny (Chris Tucker) trying to escape from the mental hospital. I have to say, this is one of the few movies with Chris Tucker where he wasn't annoying. So dark and sad, but so funny at the same time. The dialogue was clever, but seem forced. The movie was very different than the book written by Matthew Quick with the same name in that it was more rounded for broader audiences. The book took the more psychological route but was still heartwarming and comical. The end of the movie was totally different than the book, but I think it was done that way to achieve individuality from the book, in a way. The film has a subplot about gambling that is not in the novel, that the NFL didn't love. Notably, while Pat's condition is never specified in the novel, one can infer from both his narrative about his memories, and other events as they unfold, that he suffered from Traumatic Brain Injury. Overall: the movie is worth checking out, because it's entertaining, but if you feel uncomfortable about a film dealing with mental illness without really trying to solve it. Then check out another film. Just try to find a Silver Lining in the end."
"galahad58-1","6","3","6","19 May 2013"," Disorderly
","Silver Linings Playbook is an interesting tale of two people suffering from mental illness. While it could have become into a modern version of a Forest Gump type of film, it tends to revert to a very foul mouthed nasty movie. The script did not need to fill in the blanks with the f-bomb almost every other sentence. The nastiness could have been tuned down to make the characters more human and decent--not all bipolar sufferers are nasty and foul mouthed. Robert Deniro was his usual f-bomb after f-bomb character that he plays in every single movie that he has ever done in his career. The acting was decent, but it was not even close to Oscar quality. Cooper was pretty good and maybe this will springboard him to becoming a real actor rather than a dumb comedy f-bomb delivery boy. Overall it is a decent movie, it would have had no Oscar consideration if it had not introduced mental health into the story. Average all the way."
"Fab4990","3","3","6","8 May 2013"," Not a documentary but good effort concerning bipolar I not II
","To start off, this movie is NOT about Bipolar II which is very different than Bipolar I. From the constant state of mania the lead actor is in, I would say this is based on traits of Bipolar I. Obviously this is NOT a documentary, but really a comment about what the disease is like through Hollywood glasses.<br/><br/>This movie did not show the depths of torment and anguish a person can go through when depressed. It was more so whimsical with the idea of a romance between people with mental illness issues. It think it would make an excellent film to show the trials of going to a hospital, interactions with society, frustration of not holding down a steady job - some can, but not often, and the more edgy side of trying to have a relationship with a person who has the illness and the misconceptions and hopes that go along with it. Nice try though, just not accurate in my experience. I'm not saying to go with a dark film either like Fatal Attraction which is more Hollywood too than anything, but I think directors and writers need to actually follow a group of people instead of dabbling with info about the disease. It's far more interesting than what is shown as temper tantrums. Those are my thoughts on the film. Entertaining is what comes to mind for this film."

"egasulla","5","3","6","4 February 2013"," It's 2012 Hollywood
","There is a lot to love about this movie: it portraits real Americans, with real money concerns and no magical solutions for it, and real behavioral issues (both the one who spent time in a mental institution and those who are out, but may not be so sane after all). It also has terrific performances by De Niro (I had to place him first, since it's been a while since he played such an interesting and complex character), Cooper and Lawrence.<br/><br/>But then again, this is a Hollywood product. Once upon a time, people with mental issues were depicted as uniformly bad, dangerous for the sane population and either confined in an institution or in the process of being taken to one, usually after committing some horrible crime. That was dumb and justly forgotten. Then some other movies would portrait mental patients as possessing some sort of hidden wisdom, seeing deeper truths that most mere mortals cannot reach. While not impossible given the fact that many perfectly sane persons were sent to mental hospitals for political or other spurious reasons, this is not representative of the majority of cases. And then a few movies dared showing mental illnesses for what they often are -grim, hard to bear both for the patient and those around him/her, and often requiring life long treatment, sometimes to ""cure"", sometimes just to keep under some sort of control.<br/><br/>In this movie (I checked the spoilers alert box) two people with issues meet, and begin working together on themselves (the ""stategy"" as they call it). That's perfectly believable. But then they get the usual Hollywood epiphany, including not just one improbable personal victory but two, and as the TV show says, it's always sunny in Philadelphia. That was just too much. It's not that happy endings are a bad thing per se. But when there are so many clouds in someone's life, a victory could be, for example, just accepting your issues. There was no need for a ""and they lived happily ever after"" ending. It is still worth watching, but not as great as it could have been."
"PWNYCNY","10","3","6","23 January 2013"," Pat and Tiffany are the love couple of the 2010s.
","This movie is not a comedy. It's about how mental illness impacts an entire family, and community. Bradley Cooper's performance is brilliant. He carries this movie. The movie is character driven; it's about a mentally ill person who is trying to come to terms with people he believes he hurt while at the same time trying to accept the fact that he is mentally ill. The movie deals with issues of noncompliance with medications, resistance to treatment, parent-child issues, marital discord, domestic violence, and personal redemption. Jennifer Lawrence is endearing as a vulnerable young woman who masks her vulnerability with bravado. Robert DeNiro is great as Bradley Cooper's father. His character has issues too, which is why this movie is so wonderful: everybody in the movie has issues, and isn't that what life is about - dealing with issues? The movie generates few laughs because it's story is too serious, too down to earth and too realistic. After all, what is so funny about somebody being released from a mental hospital? One other point: Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence in the dance scene are wonderful. Two endearing characters that the audience can root for, this makes for a wonderful movie. And if the plot is contrived, so what? It's a movie, and it's about people dealing with issues. Mental illness is debilitating and the recovery process can be rocky. The movie dramatizes that without becoming corny. Bradley Cooper deserves all the recognition he may receive for a strong acting performance of a complex character. After watching this movie one can leave the theater feeling not only entertained but sensitized to the needs of the mentally ill. After all, Pat can be anyone of us, and what happens to him can become anyone's story. Pat and Tiffany are the love couple of the 2010s; they have replaced George and Martha and Oliver and Barbara as icons for the dysfunctional couple and for this reason: Pat and Tiffany ring true; their relationship is strained yet passionate without being theatrical. The mother signing out her son; the father struggling to connect with his son; a young woman who feels cheated by life; and a man who is coming to terms with his own vulnerability all make for an excellent movie."

","As Sigmund Freud said, ""One is very crazy when in love."" Silver Linings Playbook delivers a little less than what its title suggests, but as a romantic comedy, it is enjoyable nonetheless. Adapted from Matthew Quick's novel, this film by David O. Russell (The Fighter, I ♥ Huckabees) shines as a date movie.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper leads with familiar, sun-kissed energy that made him the stereotypical guy-next-door in chick flicks (The Hangover I & II, Valentines Day) and Jennifer Lawrence flexes elegant moves in a genre new to her filmography (The Hunger Games, Winter's Bone) but in Silver Linings Playbook, the real show-stopper turns out to be Papa DeNiro.<br/><br/>Pat Junior (Cooper) is bipolar and after eight months in a treatment facility, leaves to recover at his folks. Despite the bad run with his estranged wife (that landed him there in the first place), Pat still loves her and believes that conquering his psychological demons will win her back. Tiffany (Lawrence) is a young widow nursing old wounds and idiosyncrasies of her own. Sparks fly when both meet at a party thrown by Pat's BFF (played with finely tuned sensitivity by the underrated John Ortiz).<br/><br/>This is not an odd romantic pairing; but the emotional vicissitudes demanded of Pat's role seem to fall short in its rough-hewn delivery and thus, weakening mental health themes in the finished film. Fortunately, the silver lining lies in a strong lineup of supporting cast and Pat Senior (Robert DeNiro) shines as an un-diagnosed OCD with eccentric (but believably instinctive) ground rules about ""good and bad jujus"".<br/><br/>Bulk of the film's humor and depth (premised on psychological anxiety) comes from DeNiro and it comes as a delightful surprise. I would love to see a sequel or TV-series patterned after his breakout performance in this film--spin-off of sorts. As Pat's father, the idea that some of his neuroses may have imprinted on Pat adds a natural layer to the subplot-- father and son dynamics.<br/><br/>At the end of Silver Linings Playbook, I left the cinema believing it was written with a heartfelt message nestled in its narrative. But the output fell short, thus inviting criticisms about exaggerating stereotypes for the sake of a few laughs. The mental health industry has also responded with comments about inaccurate portrayals of bipolar behavior.<br/><br/>But like I said; for date movie material, it dazzles as cookie-cutter romcom (with an edge).<br/><br/>Block out the Oscar hype (nominated in eight categories) and watch with lowered expectations; Silver Linings Playbook might just grow on you. This feel good comedy is an entertaining peal of laughs and it stands on its own merits.<br/><br/>cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com"
"cultfilmfan","10","3","6","20 January 2013"," Silver Linings Playbook
","Over the past several years we seem to have several romantic comedies coming out each year. Most of them do not interest me one bit and I stay away from them. I am sure you know which ones I mean. The ones that are predictable and despite all odds a handsome leading man ends up with his beautiful female leading lady and the chemistry does not feel real and it all feels so contrived and clichéd and it's one of those situations where if you have seen one of them, you have seen them all. Thankfully, Silver Linings Playbook is an exception to that rule. It is a film that is more, or less a romantic comedy, but also deals with mental illness and real people and their feelings. The film at times would indeed make me laugh, but at other times I sat in quiet amazement over the wonderful performances that were on display here from the whole cast and also the top notch writing that brings us deeper into these characters and provides for much entertainment and brilliant dialogue. I know some people were a little concerned about having a film where the two main characters have both suffered from and still do to an extent, mental health issues. However, I did not find that the film put that element in there to mock, or single out these characters, but instead to show a different perspective on every day life and in this case different views on love and relationships as well. When you are first watching Silver Linings Playbook, for the first half hour, or so, you really do not know which way this film is going to go, or what type of a film that it will be, but I was pleasantly surprised on all accounts. Both stars Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are terrific in this. I have only seen Bradley Cooper in The Hangover, before this and while it was humorous and entertaining, I think we all have to admit that it is not an awards calibre movie. Bradley Cooper shines in this role and gives us so much to walk away from the film thinking about as does Jennifer Lawrence as well. This is the first film I have seen Jennifer Lawrence in and she was also terrific. There is a certain element of mystery and a sense of uncertainty about her character as you watch the film. She seems to have put up barricades around herself, probably to protect her, but as the film goes along and she lets down those walls and you get to see more of her character and look past her insecurities and neuroses, you really do start cheering for her and hoping it will all work out for her as well as Bradley Cooper's character as well. It has been awhile where I have seen a comedy drama with such well layered and developed characters as they are here. They felt real to me and because of that, I could often identify with them, feel for them and feel a certain connection to them. Every minute of screen time they had, I just wanted to continue to watch them over sheer fascination of these characters and because of how well written and how well played they were. Supporting actors Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver do a great job here as well and to be perfectly honest about it, I think this is one of De Niro's strongest films and performances in years. Silver Linings Playbook often brought a smile to my face, gave me something to think about and at times almost brought tears to my eyes because of the sheer simplicity of it's characters and the beautiful relationships they have developed with one another and how they just don't give up when things get tough, or throw in the towel, so to speak, but they actually go and want to better themselves and improve their lives and get over the stigma and stereotypes of mental illness and prove that they can make it on their own and achieve what they want to achieve. This film was really special for me. It made me laugh, almost cry, allowed me to identify with the characters and lifted my mood watching the film. It put me in such a good mood that I wanted to stand up and cheer after the film was over. What a monumental piece of filmmaking where everything seemed to have gone perfectly. This alongside with The Master, are my favourite films to date of 2012. I see big things ahead for Lawrence and Cooper and David O. Russell is proving what a great screenwriter and director he is after this and The Fighter. Congruatulations to you all, you were all fantastic and did a great job."

","Silver Linings Playbook<br/><br/>Based on the book by Matthew Quick, comes David O. Russell's (The Fighter) adaptation of his beloved novel. After a short time in a mental institution, former teacher Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) moves back in with his equally insane parents (Philadelphia Eagles ""Super Fans"") and hopes to reconcile with his ex-wife. Things get more interesting when Pat meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), an odd girl with some serious problems of her own. When Tiffany finds out that Pat is interested in giving a letter to his wife, she agrees to help him in return for a favor. As Pat and Tiffany's friendship grows, it seems that a silver lining starts to grow in each other's lives. <br/><br/>I found this movie to be funny, fascinating, and touching. It's an emotional powerhouse, that makes audiences want to stand up and cheer when things go right for Pat and Tiffany. You really can feel for the characters. That's how realistic the emotions portrayed seem to be. It's a film that can make you laugh and smile, feel upset and betrayed, or sad and filled with tears. An extremely satisfying movie, that'll continue to make noise at the box office and at the upcoming Golden Globes and Academy Awards."
"gregfried8","7","3","6","20 December 2012"," Silver Linings Playbook (2012)
","There is a certain type of manic energy that drives the films of Writer/Director David O. Russell (The Fighter, I Heart Huckabees). His films tend to feature ensembles of flawed but lovable characters struggling to piece their lives together while coping with various familial stresses, chemical dependencies and existential meltdowns. Russell's newest film, Silver Linings Playbook, continues this trend by tackling mental illness with a degree of honesty and warmth rarely seen in Hollywood films.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper (Limitless, The Hangover) stars as Pat Solitano, a volatile, bi-polar ticking time bomb prone to violent outbursts, serving 8 months of court-ordered time in a mental hospital for assaulting his wife's lover. Early on we see Pat get released, almost surely before he is ready, and begin to pick up the pieces while living in his parents (Robert De Niro and Jackie Weaver) attic. It's clear to the audience that mental illness runs in the Solitano family after meeting Pat's father, an undiagnosed obsessive-compulsive wreck with severe anger management and gambling issues. Driven by delusion and a new optimistic outlook, Pat embarks on a seemingly endless quest to win back the heart of his wife, despite the restraining order she has placed on him. <br/><br/>From the start, Pat is portrayed as a filter less social pariah, instantly alienating (if not terrifying) everyone he comes into contact with. That is until he meets Tiffany, a mysterious, young widow played by Jennifer Lawrence. Like Pat, Tiffany is wild, capricious and damaged to the core. Though their initial meetings go horribly, the two eventually connect and form a shaky, co-dependent alliance. Discovering a loophole in his restraining order, Pat enlists Tiffany to deliver a letter to his wife. She agrees under the condition that he participates in a dance competition as her partner. As they begin to spend more time together, the two grow closer and Pat's behavior becomes less erratic. Cooper is fantastic as Pat, combining his natural comic ability with a dramatic awareness previously unseen in his prior films. Nevertheless, it's Lawrence who ultimately shines brightest. In Tiffany, she has created a complex character bursting with comedic energy, sexiness, intrigue and melancholy.<br/><br/>Perhaps the Russell's greatest achievement is how genuine and natural Silver Linings Playbook feels. Like its characters, the film's tone is skittish and unpredictable, seamlessly blending flashes of uproarious humor with weighty emotional moments that never seem to ring false. While it's certainly not a conventional RomCom, Silver Linings Playbook is unable to fully escape the trappings of the genre. In an instance of uncharacteristic insincerity, there is a bizarre scene in which Russell makes light of the compulsive behavior of one of his characters in order to propel the film towards a predictable yet satisfying conclusion. It's a minor blip in an otherwise memorable effort."

","If something is marketed in a certain manner, I expect it to be how it is marketed. While ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is nice character study film, it's not what I would call funny. A few chuckles, yes. But once again the promoters mischaracterized this movie as a ""romantic comedy."" It was more of a story about two, while sympathetic, pathetic people trying to work their way through mental issues.<br/><br/>The story was fairly interesting, but it left a lot of loose ends as it shifted gears between one story focusing on one set of characters and then over to another story focusing on a different set of characters. The ""Philadelphia"" inside jokes and characterizations were funny, but you only get it if you're from the area.<br/><br/>The primary actors do a very credible job with their parts. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence provide outstanding performances and are very believable. While I usually like Robert Di Nero, he just didn't quite fit this particular role and I thought he was a waste.<br/><br/>It's a movie you could probably get wait until it comes to cable.

","After his release from a mental institution, a bi-polar ex-teacher called Pat wants to reconcile with his unfaithful wife. She's taken out a restraining order to prevent him from making contact, so he enlists the help of a female acquaintance. The troubled Tiffany has problems of her own - she's a young widow using sexual promiscuity to deal with the grief of losing her husband - but she agrees to act as Pat's go-between if he partners her in a dance competition. <br/><br/>Since 'Silver Linings Playbook' is a romantic comedy, Pat and Tiffany's unusual arrangement soon develops an emotional element. Jennifer Lawrence breathes her quirky brand of combative femininity into Tiffany, but it's not enough to save the film, since everybody else is playing the fool. Whenever she's on-screen, the story has vitality, but instead of exploring this off-beat relationship between a couple of misfits, the narrative detours into a slapstick sub-plot about a small-time gambling operation run by Pat's father. Most of the film's potential degenerates into farce and sentimentality long before it concludes with a formulaic climax at the dance contest. Although it's been a huge box-office success, this play-book only has a cardboard lining."

This is what perfect casting is in a movie, and it is much more rare than it seems.

","Silver Linings Playbook is one of those movies that explore mental conditions. For some reason, these movies have more weight than ""other"" movies and are usually used to prove actors abilities. And this is exactly what happened here.<br/><br/>The main characters were portrayed by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. They both deliver fine performance, yet not very memorable, as critics in awe would like us to believe. For example, Bradley Cooper running around wearing a plastic bag presumably actually happened in real life cases, but didn't work out for me.<br/><br/>The plot might have been realistic, yet it simply failed to engage me.

Yes, we are all angry, we are all sluts, and so it goes on and on until human extinction. There was nothing incredible about the filmmaking, or extraordinary about the acting.

","i thought Jennifer Lawrence did a great job. to me she was charismatic and believable. i thought Bradley cooper's portrayal of hypomania worked. bipolar illness comes in many forms; this is one. that said, so many aspects of the film were way off. i will admit to the bias of reading the book and loving it. but i don't mind that the book was changed - for example, changing the man's affliction from traumatic brain injury to bipolar illness works well. but so many small details that work in the book are changed arbitrarily to forms that make no sense: <br/><br/>1) the title. in the book, his hospitalization taught him that he lost his marriage because he was neglectful and inconsiderate. he has resolved to be ""kind instead of right,"" and hopes that being a better man can win his wife back; that is the ""silver lining"" beneath the cloud of his injury. in the movie, he comes out of the hospital angry and inconsiderate, so the title makes no sense. <br/><br/>2) like another reviewer, my jaw dropped to hear trazodone (rhymes with hazard) pronounced to rhyme with lake. if you know of the med, it's as impossible as if they had pronounced Valium, ""vaylium, "" or Robert de Niro, ""de-ny-ro."" <br/><br/>3) the dad as a kindly bookmaker. in the novel, the dad is unavailable and surly. though i understand the director, as the father of a bipolar son, wanting to show dads in a positive light, the bookmaker addition makes no sense at all. he has no customers that we can see. he makes unwise bets. <br/><br/>4) the brother is a decent fellow in the book, has a job, family, tries to be helpful. in the movie, he's an a$$hole for no good reason. <br/><br/>5) in the book, the therapist is kind, wise, humane. in the movie, he is simplistic -""you have to have a plan"" - ineffectual, and irrelevant. plus he seems to be hearing everything that has happened in our hero's life before the session. where on earth does he get this information!?!? totally unrealistic. <br/><br/>6) the eagles: in the book, the friend, brother, and hero have a long history of loving the eagles. it is part of the hero's community. and we root for the eagles along with them. in the movie, there is no development of this community. the eagles are just something to bet on (and, again, the betting makes no sense). in the book, there's a fight with a belligerent giant's fan. in the movie this is changed - why? - to racist eagles fans attacking south Asian fans.<br/><br/>6) the police officer (not in the book). omg! as another poster has said, where on earth do you get your own personal cop to watch out for you when you get out of the hospital? <br/><br/>7) the ex-wife. in the book, she has pressed charges that put him away for years, served a restraining order, written him off and moved on. in the movie, she first comes to the dance performance and then shows no reaction when he whispers in her ear - what? - that he is now in love with someone else? a terrible scene that is completely inconsistent with the set-up of her character.<br/><br/>8) medication. in the book, he decides to start taking the meds, and they help. in the movie, maybe he takes his meds, but it's quite unclear.<br/><br/>9) terrible camera work. shaky, out-of-focus, nausea-inducing."

I'm a psychologist with a best friend who has bipolar and I beg to differ!

","Silver Linings Playbook"" was a must watch movie on my wish list after it picked up 8 Oscar nominations (not to mention that it stars one of my all time favorite, Robert De Niro) this year. Not only it has cornered all the big nominations this year, SLP is the only movie since ""Reds"" in 1981 to pick up all the 4 acting nods (Best Actor/Actress, Best Supporting Actor/Actress). With so much going for it, its natural for the viewer to expect something out of the ordinary. Alas, the only thing not ""ordinary"" about the movie is that it revolves around a bunch of ""abnormal"" people.<br/><br/>By way of story, SLP is about Bradley Cooper's character, who suffers from Bipolar Disorder, and his tryst with all the other neurotic, obsessive compulsive, dysfunctional, superstitious people and other plain weirdos that he encounters with alarming regularity in the tiny little town he resides in. Based on ex high school teacher Matthew Quick's eponymous novel, SLP neither turns out to be a screw ball, irreverent comedy (something like ""Crazy People""), nor is it a feel good, heart warming tale (like ""Forrest Gump"") or not even an accurate depiction of the real life situations of bipolar people (remember Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn in ""Lust for Life""). So what is SLP all about? I don't really know and neither does the Director David O Russell. He tries hard to make SLP a rom-com, a comedy, a quirky fun film, a family drama, a feel good film about the proverbial under dog, but eventually ends up with a mish-mash tasting more like yesterday's stale left overs.<br/><br/>The only silver lining of this largely forgettable effort is an assured, confident and bravura performance from its lead actor, Bradley Cooper. Cooper is the tour de force here reminding us that he is meant for bigger and better things than inane movies like ""The Hangover"". His performance is truly worthy of an Oscar nomination. Other members of the cast, including De Niro, Chris Tucker and Jennifer Lawrence, are at best adequate and at worst over the top, hamming impresarios.<br/><br/>My recommendation to evolved movie viewers is to skip this playbook and go watch a re-run of ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" or ""A Beautiful Mind"" if oddball characters are your preferred choice of viewing this weekend."
"viktor_666","3","3","7","10 February 2013"," Why this movie doesn't work
","Main reason: the (mis)cast <br/><br/>Most critics say Bradley Cooper is good. Well, he may be, but he's just not the role. You don't cast an alpha male to play a frustrated, delusional guy with little emotional experience (ie who giggles when a ""bad girl"" tells him about her sexual prowess). I know, as an actor he's supposed to be able to play any part, but Bradley Cooper oozes sexuality (and I'm hetero) while he should ooze awkwardness. It's about body language, it's about voice tone. He's just not the guy. Of course it's not like the script actually ask him to play a bi-polar character (only the deceptive pitch does). Where are the lows that he's supposed to endure ? Those depressing moments that mark the face and the body ? Sorry but getting occasionally p.ssed-off is not being bipolar. And yes, they could have made a great comedy with the bi-polar material (and I felt it was there, hidden in some intentions of the script), only not a nice and consensual one like the one I saw.<br/><br/>Same problem with Jennifer Lawrence. She's supposed to be a young promiscuous woman wrecked-down by life, but what we have on screen is more like an aging emo who tries to mimic Dirty Dancing in hot pants. Where are the scenes where she gets drunk and do stupid to things ? And regrets them afterwards ? Yes it could be cliché, but it's the truth of her character. She should have gone from being an manipulative child to a upbeat arrogant b.tch, to catatonic. But like Cooper, J. Lawrence is way too monolithic for the part. Putting an unhappy face 90% of the time and yelling the rest of her scenes is not enough, sorry.<br/><br/>In fact, the only character that doesn't seem out of place is Chris Tucker, because contrary to all other actors, he has a spark of craziness in him (or maybe just a little fantasy).<br/><br/>Anyway, go back in time, book Matthew Broderick in his early thirties and AJ Langer in her late twenties, get rid of all the romcom stuff and shoot this movie right ! Of course, it won't be as glamorous and consensual and probably won't get as many Oscar nominations but at least it will be original."

And definitely I didn't like how they solve the movie, with that suppose professional dance contest.<br/><br/>Each of the elements above are not the problem.

Jennifer Lawrence cements her reputation as the best actress working in Hollywood right now with her crushingly beautiful performance as the damaged Tiffany. Robert De Niro gives his best performance in years and has some of the funniest lines. The script has many laugh out loud moments but is also heartbreaking and up lifting, touching on mental health, alienation, longing, love, family, how sport and dance can bring people together and people's attitude to mental illness (particularly the authorities). As someone who worked in mental health for a while I felt that the issues faced by Bradley Cooper and his reaction to them were portrayed perfectly. No film has touched me on so many levels as this one did for years. It also has the most iconic dance sequence since Pulp Fiction IMO and a great soundtrack. Director David O. Russell has come a long way since Three Kings and it is going to be nigh on impossible for him to follow the huge success of The Fighter and now this.

","Pat (Bradley Cooper) is, at present, in a mental institution in Baltimore. He lost it, you see, when he came home from work and found his wife in the shower with another man. After beating the heck out of the male cheater, Pat's wife also has a restraining order out on him. Nevertheless, Pat is convinced that he is going to get his ""ex"" back and without medication for his obvious bipolar condition. After 8 months of therapy, Pat's mother (Jackie Weaver) does get permission to take her son home to Philadelphia. Problems continue, however. Pat's father (Robert De Niro) has his own anger issues and is running an illegal business out of his home. Dad doesn't understand his own son's situation very well and doesn't have much patience. Especially when Pat Jr., reading a book, gets so upset he throws it out a window, breaking the glass. Meanwhile, some longtime friends (John Ortiz and Julia Stiles) decide to throw a dinner party and invite Pat and the wife's young widowed sister, Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence). If it is an attempt at matchmaking, it doesn't go well. Yet, slowly, Pat and Tiff do become friends, even to the point of swapping impossible requests for each other. Tiff wants Pat to be her partner in a dance competition while Pat wants the beautiful widow to get a letter to his ex, even though its against the law. As Pat Sr. places a large bet on the dance exhibition and his beloved football team, the Eagles, the stakes are high, especially for the mental health of Pat and Tiffany. Will there be a silver lining for all? This beautiful, touching movie should be rated in platinum, as its value is more than silver or gold. Its serious issues are mixed with humor and sweetness, making for a very enjoyable view. Then, too, the direction and editing are spectacular, offering many imaginative changes of scene. Above all, the performances are amazing. Cooper displays great talent in his role as the complex Pat while Lawrence acts years beyond her tender age to shine as Tiffany. De Niro, Weaver, Stiles, Ortiz, and the rest of the supporting cast are mighty nice, too. Kudos, especially, should go to Chris Tucker for his fine turn as a fellow mental patient of Pat's. The scenery in and around Philly is both lovely and gritty while costumes, make-up and photography are very worthy, too. Yes, the finale is a bit too pat while there is some bad language thrown about, too. But, all in all, get in line soon to buy tickets for Silver Linings. It is one of the finest flicks of the brand new year."

","I love David Russel. He is quirky. He is smart. He has style. He knows how to make a movie live, and how to make a story pulse. He knows how touch different cords of the heart. Most importantly, he knows how to make fun with weird characters without making fun of them, and this skill is the key to the beauty of Silver Linings Playbook.<br/><br/>The movie deals with two broken characters, Pat and Tiffany, who suffer from mental illness (bipolar disorder and depression) and are recovering from traumatic events that changed their lives. They meet by chance, and they form a bizarre friendship when they agree of doing each other a favor, which results in them being tied in long-term project until Christmas. The story is told from the point of view of Pat, recently released from a mental hospital and also dealing with his troublesome return to his parents' house.<br/><br/>Silver Linings Playbook is an odd romantic comedy between two broken souls. Its strength comes from the genuine mixed of two opposite strategies. On the one side, it follows the template of a romantic comedy, with its predictable twists and its reassuring plot resolutions. On the other hand, it subversively refuses to follow the beaten pat, not taking comedic shortcuts and not employing shallow characters. The director follows his characters with genuine interests and love for their human faults. It refuses to divide them in good or bad. It respects their emotions and their contradictions, which are beautifully brought to life by the actors. The pain of mental illness truly comes through, and although it makes for some funny moments, is never made fun at, but instead made part of the laughter with an accepting spirit.<br/><br/>The entire movie follows the main characters closely with steady cams, letting a vast range of emotions come through. David Russell maintains this style even in the climatic dance scene---and his decision to film the scene this way, prioritizing the character's point of view instead of the choreography, show that he is a real auteur. His style is modest, personal, original, and functional to the story. <br/><br/>So, following the template of a romantic comedy,David Russell creates a wonderful movie about the lack of happiness in life, accepting one's own problems, dealing with the turns of fortune, and grabbing the rare opportunities that life offers."

","This is one of the best films of 2012. There will be awards nominations for deserved excellence. Excelsior! The Weinstein Company has become the Oscar brand name for award-winning performances, as excellence and quality seem to be the only criteria for the producers.<br/><br/>The real surprise for me was Bradley Cooper, who always plays the funny, handsome guy in movies like ""The Hangover,"" ""The Hangover Part 2"" and ""The Hangover Infinite Sequel."" Here, Cooper plays a disturbed man who is released from a mental facility. He has some court problems and a restraining order or two hanging over him. He plays the edgy, off-his-meds guy very convincingly. This is a good film for him. He shows us things we have never seen him do.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro is always interesting and fun to watch. He plays Cooper's father, an OCD Philidelphia Eagles fan who performs a series of strange rituals while watching his team. He worries about the team's Mojo constantly, and bets heavily and dangerously on them.<br/><br/>The characters are all wonderfully quirky in this script. The question of sanity is explored in an unusual way. We know, at the outset, that Cooper's character is more than a little bit off his rocker, but as the story progresses, we see an entire cast of characters who have their own issues. Cooper plays Pat, who was sentenced to the mental hospital after an incident involving his wife. He wants desperately to get back his old life, but we see how unlikely he is to recover what was lost. We see that his obsessiveness, which caused the incident, is driving him harder to make things right. We know it will not work. His friends and family watch him make the same mistakes again and again.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence, as good as she was in ""Hunger Games,"" really creates a new character in this film. You can't take your eyes off her when she is on the screen. She is a combination of crazy, sexy and intense. She erupts out of nowhere and virtually stalks Pat through the first half of the film. She is funny, also obsessive and equally as intense as Pat.<br/><br/>The script is excellent, and, even though the ending is telegraphed too far in advance, the film goes where you want the story to go.<br/><br/>This is one of the best films of 2012. There will be awards nominations for deserved excellence. Excelsior! The Weinstein Company has become the Oscar brand name for award-winning performances, as excellence and quality seem to be the only criteria for the producers."

","﻿When I hear of Bradley Cooper, I always picture a smart-ass, sarcastic and kind of an asshole yet very likable guy who sweats self-confidence from every pore of his body. That's not the case with his character Pat in Silver Linings Playbook.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT Pat has been released from a mental institution to the care of his parents with the condition that they pay close attention to their bipolar son and avoid violating a restraining order that his wife has against him.<br/><br/>From the few moments that we see Pat we know we're in for a wild ride. He's very visibly stable and incapable of living on his own, let alone be released to his parents' care. His father is played by no other than Robert DeNiro who has issues of his own and feels guilty that he didn't spend enough time with his son to notice that there was something wrong with him.<br/><br/>As dysfunctional as this movie may sound, Silver Linings has a comedic side to this whole mess thanks to the witty and quick dialogue that engulfs the audience head first into Pat's chaotic and fragile world, when something can (and will) happen at any given moment. Pat's a ticking time bomb, just not sure when is it set to go off.<br/><br/>Pat meets Tiffany (The Hunger Games's Jennifer Lawrence), a very attractive young girl who may be as messed up as Pat himself. The first words they exchange are so funny and straight to the point that it's funny to watch them read each other out,their words are like aimless bullets, they just can't contain their curiosity about each other. Their chemistry is undeniable and it's very obvious they're attracted to each other from the first seconds of their encounter, although in their condition it may be combustive and very dangerous ground. Yet she's probably the one person that can truly understand Pat and his condition.<br/><br/>And so an odd relationship builds, a relationship that may either benefit or destroy them both and that's the beauty of Silver Linings Playbook. On one side you root for their relationship to develop yet Pat's obsession with his wife gets in the way and their timing is totally not in their favor. To top it off, Tiffany has recently become a widow and her mental condition is very fragile and volatile as well. Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany has successfully made her character very believable.<br/><br/>Silver Linings has created a lot of Oscar buzz for both stars as well as supporting actor for DeNiro and its wonderful screenplay, which reminds me how good The Descendants' script was at last year's Oscars. Bradley Cooper was very believable and surprisingly serious in this role yet I can't quite picture him beating Daniel Day-Lewis in the biopic Lincoln. You be the judge."
"nickmesafilms","10","3","7","16 December 2012"," Silver Linings Playbook (2012) - Set a Goal! Find Your Silver Lining!
","Released to worldwide critical acclaim, and tons of supposed Oscar buzz, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is the film adaptation of the highly successful novel of the same name. Director David O. Russell from ""The Fighter"" has taken the liberty of becoming the man in charge of taking this one story and treating it with plenty of care. But, thanks to a beautiful script and a super-talented cast, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is the most memorable movie-going experience I've had all year. Bradley Cooper delivers probably the best performance of his entire career playing Pat, a young man with a huge case of bipolar disorder, who has just been released from a mental institution after suffering a major breakdown when noticing his ex-wife in the shower with another man. That's not really a spoiler, because it was seen in the trailer, but for now, better safe than sorry! Now, that he has returned home, he now wants to make changes in his life. He's now moved back in with his parents, played respectively by Robert de Niro and Jacki Weaver, and tries to fit in within his neighborhood. He has decided to set out and make new goals, especially one in particular, trying to reconcile with his ex-wife. But he then runs into Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence, a young woman whom also is having serious troubles of her own, after the recent death of her husband, and similar to Pat, is also a little crazy. While trying to spend time with his family, and helping Tiffany rehearse for a ballroom dance competition, Pat shares this unlikely bond with this girl, and maybe a certain and strange romance will soon occur. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is one of the best movies of the year, if not, the best. This is a beautifully realistic and heartfelt film that will relate to anyone, unlike anything I have seen in such a long time. David O. Russell both wrote and directed this film, and you can obviously tell that this man cares more about the people in his films, and less about the subject matter. He knows how to make the characters so believable, and gives the audience a chance to feel so much sympathy for these people. Also, the script delivers some of the most well-written realistic dialogue ever put on the silver screen. This is one of the best directed films of the year, and David O. Russell will probably score both a Best Director and Best Screenplay nomination respectively. Bradley Cooper absolutely delivers an Oscar-worthy performance, and if he ends up getting a Best Actor nomination, it would be great if he actually won, which will probably not happen, but it should. This actor has proved that besides comedies, he can also do dramatic roles very well. Cooper can actually act, and do these dramatic movies really well. It's that broken-down character, hoping to make things better for himself, that Cooper does a great job at portraying. Another Oscar-worthy performance in this movie comes from the one and only Robert de Niro, playing Pat's father, a man with dreams of opening a new restaurant, and has a huge obsession for the Philadelphia Eagles football team. It's so great to see one of the greatest actors of all time back on the screen in a good movie, and delivers the role with such perfection, definitely worthy of a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Although Jacki Weaver, as Pat's mother, and Chris Tucker, as Pat's best friend, each deliver terrific supporting performances respectively, it's all about Jennifer Lawrence as the female lead. After her work in ""Winter's Bone"" and ""The Hunger Games"", Lawrence has become one of the most promising actresses of our century, delivering a powerful scene-stealing performance, worthy of a Best Actress nomination. Lawrence and Cooper, respectively, share electrifying chemistry between each other, and I was able to believe in the bond that these two people shared. It was so great to watch these two actors together. The movie delivers every single human emotion you can think of. There's a really funny side to the film that will make you laugh, a dramatic side that will make you think, and overall, it just warms your heart in some way. If a movie is able to affect me so much, yet make me feel good at the same time, it's a great movie to me! Beautifully directed, fantastically written, incredibly acted, heartwarming, realistic, and intriguing, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is my new favorite movie of the year, and I won't be surprised if the film is able to score a Best Picture nomination. ""Silver Linings Playbook"", in my review, ""a funny, realistic, emotional, and heartwarming motion picture""."
"dharmendrasingh","8","3","7","5 December 2012"," Hilarious, heartbreaking and heart-warming
","Bradley Cooper characteristically charms in David O. Russell's hilarious, heartbreaking and heart-warming story about an asylum-dodging manic depressive who eventually finds a silver lining.<br/><br/>Pat (Cooper) radically alters his lifestyle, even promises to manage his anger without medication, in the quixotic hope of reuniting with his cheating wife. But then he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young widow and self-confessed loose woman who challenges Pat's assumptions about her, leading to an unbreakable friendship. Lawrence's headstrong performance I hope ensures her career will not be mired by the monstrosity that is the 'Hunger Games' series.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver are noteworthy as Pat's parents, especially De Niro who gives a rare performance requiring emotional depth and comedic flair. With a film this impressive, it isn't necessary to mention that Danny Elfman composed the score (but he did). <br/><br/>However derivative O. Russell's script (based on a novel by Matthew Quick) becomes, I cannot condemn any of it. It is transcended by acting that is so honest, you find yourself focusing not on the clichés but on cheering for Pat. The poignancy in his quest to win back his wife frankly had me almost blubbering. <br/><br/>If ever there was a film to illustrate Joni Mitchell's famous line about not knowing what you have until it's gone, this was it."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","3","7","5 December 2012"," Russell gets the best from his cast in this unconventional romance
","Look around Hollywood and you get the feeling that the art of the romance movie is either dying or has been dead for some time. Romance as a genre term has practically been replaced by the phrase ""rom-com,"" and the only alternatives are gooey teen-geared fare (""Twilight"" or a Nicholas Sparks adaptation) or the occasional period love story. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" doesn't fit any one category, and perhaps therein is its bit of genius.<br/><br/>Although you can't exactly put label on and file away director David O. Russell's follow-up to his heavily awarded ensemble drama ""The Fighter,"" that's not to say this new film is completely unique. Rather, it tells a predictable romance in an unconventional fashion.<br/><br/>As part comedy, ""Silver Linings"" has none of the dramatic weight of ""The Fighter"" or quite the same storytelling power, but both films share one critical thing in common: convincing turns from an ace ensemble cast. Russell loves familial dysfunction, and while the stakes never feel quite as high as ""The Fighter"" (that's the last comparison), the performances have this touching humility to them. Russell clearly has a penchant for getting the best from his talent.<br/><br/>Stars Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence receive a special opportunity to take their already proved talent to another level as Pat and Tiffany, two people recovering from recent past traumas with diagnosed mental issues and boatloads of sexual tension. At the same time, as much of an excuse as they have to let their characters snap without warning, they still have to make it convincing and they do.<br/><br/>Cooper's Pat comes home to live with his parents (Jacki Weaver and Robert De Niro) in Philadelphia after the court has allowed for his release from a mental institution in Baltimore. Although he refuses to take meds, we meet Pat in a place where he's on the mend, or at least believes he has the tools to overcome his past: stay positive, work to make yourself better and and look for the silver lining. The trouble is he's still hung up about his wife, Nikki, who is directly connected to the source of his issues.<br/><br/>In taking the steps that he believes will allow Nikki to love him again, Pat meets Tiffany, whose husband died recently. She has her own philosophy for coping, and becomes a major curveball in Pat's self-prescribed plan. Her connection to Nikki through her older sister Veronica (Julia Styles) further complicates her and Pat's relationship.<br/><br/>""Silver Linings"" dances around a bit when it comes to its core thread. Pat and Tiffany's relationship and complicated ""romance"" (it becomes clear from their first scene together that they have chemistry and will end up entangled romantically somehow) is definitely the centerpiece of the film, but it constantly shifts lenses. At first it appears to be about mental illness, then it morphs into a story about acceptance, then it focuses on making connections, then it becomes about perspectives, etc. These are all valid and generally related ideas, but the film drifts through them and the script never makes any deep cathartic breakthroughs as a result.<br/><br/>That's when you have to start peeling back the many layers of ""Silver Linings Playbook"" to see it as a romance story and family drama. As complicated as things are between Pat and Tiffany, the essence of their relationship can be identified as a need for an honest connection, to not let the past or the judgments of others complicate what is clearly pure chemistry.<br/><br/>The parallels to the film's family relationships are clear, though the romantic and family threads aren't quite interconnected until a plot device at the end binds them all together. In his best role in years, De Niro plays a caring but emotionally distant father obsessed with the Philadelphia Eagles. He has turned to bookmaking after losing his job and it has brought out the worst of his superstitious compulsions. His own fixation mirrors his son's, yet they are both too blinded to see the similarities in their differences.<br/><br/>Relationship dynamics are at the heart of any ensemble film and the praise tends to get limited to acting, but Russell's direction could be the unsung hero of ""Silver Linings"" among general audiences. His camera is particularly active for a film in this genre cluster and it results in several angles and takes that add to the relationship tension. There's also an almost frenetic pacing at times that he uses to capture some of the mental instability of the main characters. It can be a frustrating tactic, but it forces us to relate to the characters by experiencing the film as they experience the world, Pat specifically.<br/><br/>Russell occasionally veers into comic territory as well with his technique. ""Silver Linings"" draws a lot of its humor from dysfunction between characters both in written dialogue and physicality of performance, but Russell — in a way that feels spontaneous — gives the humor an extra bite so we realize we're also supposed to be enjoying ourselves while watching the film.<br/><br/>""Silver LInings Playbook"" could at any time take a turn for the heavy side of things given the material, but Russell's choice to lean a bit more toward his quirkier roots gives it a real crowd-pleasing quality. The decidedly romantic and satisfying ending definitely assures this, but arguably of more importance, the choice accurately reflects the film's message of optimism, to see things with a certain perspective.<br/><br/>So despite not always being cohesive and movingly eloquent, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" entertains and never apologizes for what it is — or isn't.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"chuck-526","8","3","7","3 December 2012"," part ""classic Hollywood movie"", part frank exploration of ""mental illness""
","In some ways, this film fits the definition of a ""classic Hollywood film"" from my textbook. There's the subtext of a partially hidden heterosexual romance. There's a bit of character growth in the form of an ""awakening"". Nothing really horrible happens. There are moments both of comedy and of tension, but nothing lasts too long. There are deadlines. It's even the case that the plot is set in motion by a ""quest"" which remains present throughout the movie and appears to tie everything together, but in fact doesn't really matter all that much (sounds like a ""MacGuffin"" to me:-).<br/><br/>At the same time there are some elements that are unique. Betcha can't name another movie where the various foibles of sports fans are a central motif. Or one that keeps coming back to not-quite-legal sports gambling. Or that covers dance in some detail, but integrates it into the story so seamlessly that it never seems to be more than a throw-away.<br/><br/>And it was refreshing to see a movie set believably in a lower-middle-class ethos. The decor (both wallpaper and furnishings) looked like something out of a museum. The house was too small, so the ""attic"" had been ""converted"" into a bedroom. And cars weren't the latest model.<br/><br/>The movie was sufficiently formulaic that I could figure out what was going to happen next. But it didn't matter. Quirky situations and character development mattered a lot more than the broad plot points.<br/><br/>What stood out the most though was the movie's frank and detailed description of the reality of ""mental illness"". The line between ""normal"" and ""crazy"" is shown in many ways to be much less distinct than our stereotype. A son gets thrown into a mental hospital for beating somebody up; his father gets banned from the stadium for too many fights; are they really that different? Is there some inheritance of mental traits going on here? Are all the superstitions around sports games (aligning remote controls a certain way, holding a certain napkin in one's hand) ""just normal"", or are they ""truly odd"", or do they suggest the beginnings of a mental imbalance? The scene where the father holds a fistful of several tens of envelopes, yet ""knows"" that _one_ is missing, at least illustrates OCD and may even remind one of ""Rain Main"". The same person that's a sober therapist in an office weekdays may have half their face painted and be cheering wildly for their team on weekends.<br/><br/>Characters react most strongly -often in borderline ""socially unacceptable"" ways- to truly awful things happening (sudden infidelity, unexpected death, lifestyle-threatening financial losses, threat of incarceration); some are called ""crazy"" while others are just ""stressed""; yet in all cases the bad behavior had a real and understandable reason behind it. Family and community do ""risky"" things that don't always seem reasonable and don't always work out. <br/><br/>Although not exactly right (I certainly wouldn't want this to be a ""training film"" for mental health professionals), this movie is a lot more understanding and probing of ""craziness"" than most others."
"rebecca-ry","7","3","7","2 December 2012"," Good but flawed
","'Silver Linings Playbook' is a film directed by David O. Russell about a man with bi-polar disorder who is trying to get his life back on track after suffering a mental breakdown upon discovering his wife was having an affair. <br/><br/>The story is a bit bizarre with Pat (Bradley Cooper) befriending Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who also suffered a mental breakdown after the death of her husband. Pat agrees to enter a dance competition with Tiffany in order to send a letter to his wife via Tiffany to try and re- build their relationship. The first half of the film seems a bit misleading. It portrays bi-polar disorder was just being the same as someone being a little bit odd or quirky. I don't think that they take the disorder seriously enough – for a film that a lot of people have claimed will win big at the Oscars in 2013, I don't think it will; it has missed the point with mental illness. The plot itself moves quite smoothly and I was never bored whilst watching this. The second half is better; it becomes a lot funnier and seems a lot more light-hearted. The plot is good but the acting can sometimes let it down.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper is quite bad; he has obviously done very little research for his role and has clearly read a paragraph on bi-polar disorder noticing that, under stress, they can shout and panic – there's a scene in the film where he is screaming and his eyes are blank with no emotion. This meant that the scene came across as funny and people in the audience were actually laughing during a scene that was written to be a scene of heartbreak. Jennifer Lawrence was excellent here; she portrayed her character perfectly and provided humour where it was meant to be. She has obviously done a lot of research for her role and she has had a fantastic career in 2012 which can only get better. Chris Tucker was a surprisingly positive addition to this cast; he died not annoy me at all in this film which was a huge development. David O. Russell has done a great job with the characters in this film. Robert De Niro is another great supporting character here; his role as Pat's father who has some form of OCD is just brilliant and he really seems to have portrayed it just right. This is his best performance in quite a while and I hope his films get even better. <br/><br/>Overall, I liked this film; there were just a lot of flaws within it. It has some good comedy, some great performances and is a fairly good film to watch. If you're a fan of Jennifer Lawrence, you will like this film as it is yet another film that would have failed if it wasn't for her (see House at the End of the Street). This film is worth a watch but I don't see it doing well at the Oscars – I hope not anyway."
"BharatSamra","8","5","15","22 November 2012"," Leave the cinema with a smile for a change?
","Hectic rather than dramatic; charming rather than funny; and as for romance, that would be somewhat of an insult on behalf of one of this year's finer films. Silver Linings Playbook leads rather than follows an off-beat style for its genre. Scratch that, you gather the sense that it advocates its own genre due to its uniquely complex characters and relationships, yet with a simplistic and easy to follow narrative.<br/><br/>The most perplexing scenario when engaged in the theatrical experience is how much we, the audience, are energised by these rather peculiar characters. Each conveys some form of dysfunctional behaviour, whether it is some mental incapacity, an obsession or lying to one's self. Nevertheless, they are extraneously relatable which formulates a wonderful character-audience relationship simultaneously. One can imagine the ease in which the independent studio could have sensationalised the relationships, or added the dreaded cheese factor to this delightful November release. As it turns out, we were instead gifted with this grounded, rounded earth of a film, by which I mean complete as a whole in its entirety. Once the final shot transits to the rolling credits, we feel we require no more from the two hours of pleasurable endurance, whilst also being unable to identify a single flaw, which proves evident in the countless smiling faces (including your own) around the theatre and uplifted mood around the room. The primary cause for this 'Silver Lining Theory' (Bharat Samra trademark) is undoubtedly the combination of an evidently well-written script and truly tremendous acting. The amalgamation of seemingly authentic and convincing dialogue blended with the two phenomenal lead actors and numerous noteworthy supporting actors is what fuels the picture into a smooth journey up a straight path, with some bumps along the way to enable our protagonist to maintain and test his fortitude.<br/><br/>One of the aspects of the film which as a viewer you hugely appreciate is lack of condescension. You learn so much about each individual character that there is no need to be continuously reminded of what is occurring in the narrative, as you become so immersed into their lives and behaviours, you almost instantly adopt their personalities, meaning we can assume their actions, and the motion picture's integrity does not yield, yet increases with confluent storytelling. Each actor involved with this production warrants copious acclaim as their influential authority over their roles are not for a second doubted, as they own their part so reliably well. Most conspicuously, the leads in Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are foremost worth valuing due to their, excuse the following cliché, on screen chemistry. Robert De Niro and Chris Tucker are also sensationally suited for this film, for their opposing roles. Tucker not surprisingly assists in the comedic department comfortably, while De Niro vents an irrational, confused and a times angry father to Cooper's character Pat due to his OCD.<br/><br/>I believe this to be one of the rare contemporary cinematic releases that compels throughout. It has heart, humour, hedonism and happiness, though you may as times witness the interfamily conflict, the restoration of happiness is, inevitable. The fact that not a lot actually happens in this independent film can be disregarded because it is the characters and their dialogue which carries the picture perhaps into further future award winning territory, to add to the already achieved accolades. Silver Linings Playbook is suitable for almost any demographic, assuming you are indeed above the age of consent for this particular picture, I can almost guarantee enjoyment and pleasure for at least the two hour duration, and even long after the screening, especially the climactic, quite simply fun dance sequence, along with even learning the implication of the terrific title."
"andre-bed","1","4","11","20 February 2013"," Pure C***.
","That was a real struggle to watch it till the end..Can I say what this movie is In one word ? Crazy.. Totally crazy. Not even a bit funny. The ""madness"" shown in this movie ain't that extraordinary. As a matter of fact We all know some people with emotional problems, or who don't seem to be ""alright"". But there is, usually, a reason for that. That's what this movie lacks. A good point to base the behavior of the characters. Everything seems ""exaggerated"" in this movie, even the problem of the characters and their feelings. On the other hand no one is ""normal"" around the main character. Everyone seems to have some ""disorder"" to a minor or major extent. But it's slow paced, most of the movie are people having arguments, there is this ""fixation"" of the main character upon someone, a lot of ""blá-blá-blá"", and so on.. I know American families are usually as crazy as this one, so I can understand the bonds American audience will have with it, but it is so far from my reality, so ""crazy"" I couldn't relate.

","The film centers around Patrick (Bradley Cooper), a bipolar person, who has issues. He goes into a berserk mode whenever he hears ""My Cherie Amour"" like Curly used to do when they played ""Pop Goes the Weasel."" Of course bipolar people should be introduced to other bipolar people, because you never sleep with anyone crazier than yourself.<br/><br/>Patrick is introduced to Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who steals every scene with an Oscar worthy performance. Robert De Niro plays Patrick's father, a superstitious Eagles fan, who appears to be slightly bipolar himself. While institutionalized, Patrick learned to look for ""the silver lining"" in everything in order to cope with life, something he doesn't always do too well. Tiffany has her own issues and together they haphazardly work their way into a relationship.<br/><br/>They should film more movies in Philadelphia as I have never seen the streets so clean.

"tuhin94","10","2","4","11 April 2014"," In the end, all you need is a friend to put a smile on your face.
","Up front, I am a sucker for movies that show the power of love and friendship. Silver Linings Playbook is a rom-com that thoroughly embodies those two things. No, that does not bias me. <br/><br/>The movie exemplifies what it is like to live with a mental illness. It shows how it does not affect the sufferer, but also the ones around him/her. It has brought greater awareness to people everywhere that mental illness is not a minute detail, but a headline that is constantly on the front page of a person's life. But, like Pat showed, it can be cured by a lifestyle change and a bit of luck of having the right person enter your life at the perfect time. <br/><br/>Silver Linings Playbook does not have the sappiness , cheesiness, or predictability that the romantic comedy genre has come to be associated with. Obviously, Pat and Tiffany finally getting together and Pat, Sr. winning so much money is sentimental, but the idea is to have a happy ending. Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro, and the rest of the cast put on an amazing and very lovable performance and demonstrate they all had the chemistry required to act as a family and troupe of friends. <br/><br/>The film does a good job of explaining moments that arouse some questions. For example, how is possible for Tiffany to know the exact location of Pat's run? Pat's mom was in on it. Boom. A simple explanation to keep the audience from questioning the overall quality of the movie. <br/><br/>There were some imperfections. Undeniably, errors like Pat's chain moving from on his chest to slung over his shoulder are present, but those are not the type of mistakes I am speaking of. Every movie has a few. The major point I am discussing about is the screenplay matching up with the dates. There is a scene showing the characters celebrating Christmas immediately followed by the big day of December 28th. I was not sure at first whether or not they were showing an extended Yuletide celebration or they simply skipped to the Sunday. Anyway, the number of words dedicated to this flaw is way out of proportion. <br/><br/>In the end, I had some laughs and heart-warming situations. I cannot give it a 9 and remain guilt- free. I am glad I have been a spectator to another terrific piece of work. I hope this trend of perfect-score films continues! Watched and written 04/11/2014."

"apb216","4","2","4","11 June 2013"," What was that?
","Like other reviewers, I had high expectations for this movie. I didn't know anything about the plot, I just saw short previews and really wanted to see it because I am a huge Jennifer Lawrence fan and what girl doesn't swoon for Bradley Cooper? I was even more excited to see it when I found out Jennifer won a best actress Oscar for this role. I was so disappointed!<br/><br/>The movie ends up being about Bradley Cooper (I forget the characters name) who catches his wife cheating on him in the shower of his home, and upon confronting them, the man she is cheating on him with tells him to leave. This sends Brad into a rage and he snaps mentally and beats him within an inch of his life. He is sent to a mental institution and is released about a year later. He returns to his parents home in Philly, and you slowly start to think that everyone in the town might be mentally unstable. His mom is an impossibly annoying woman who doesn't seem to have a backbone and lets her extremely OCD husband walk all over her. The dad is played by Robert DiNero, whom I had no idea was in the movie, so that was a nice surprise. This does seem to be the only movie that he is fully engaged in, and he plays his character very well, but to the point where you almost hate him. He bets on The Eagles' football games and has to have a remote placed in a certain spot and facing a certain direction. Brad is out of his mind weird, and although it was refreshing to see him playing such a different character, you just get so frustrated with the character and you find yourself wishing for the movie to end. Brad wears a trash bag over sweats in almost every single scene because he runs, and you come to loathe trash bags. <br/><br/>Things do perk up a lot when he meets Jennifer, which comes into play because he goes over to his best friends house for dinner and his wife is the sister of Jennifer, who is played by Julia Styles. It was very nice to see her face again so that was something good about it. Jennifer also has mental issues, because her police husband died and she tends to say or do what she wants. She is a bit Gothic, but only a touch which is good because if she had been any more so I wouldn't have made it very far in the movie. Jennifer is, for lack of a better word, a slut. She is open about the fact that she sleeps with men and is not proud of it. She is great at adding life to the otherwise boring movie by throwing random tantrums and screaming. <br/><br/>Brad and Jen team up for an upcoming dance competition that is meant for professionals and they both know they don't stand a chance. They help heal each other by their dancing and there is a nice little twist at the end of the movie (which I will not spoil for anyone) that turns out she knew a lot more about what was really going on than anyone else did. The movie ends with Brad's dad making a major bet that the Eagles would win and also that Jen and Brad would score a 5 in the competition, which are on the same night. <br/><br/>All in all, the people I was watching this with were complaining loudly that they wanted it to end, and I was right there along with them. I don't really like watching movies about mentally unstable people and even more so about OCD people. I did really love Jennifer in it and thought she absolutely deserved the Oscar."

","But it makes them what they are, and without it, they wouldn't be themselves, and that's what this film justifies so superbly. It's probably the best Romantic Comedy I've ever seen and it is so light-hearted and feel-good funny it'll have you wanting repeated viewings. Bradley Cooper is an American with some Italian origins who returns from a mental hospital to reunite with his ex-wife, not your usual rom com story, but it works. While he seemingly tries hard to do that, he bumps into Jennifer Lawerence, who also plays a one with problems, but as the Oscar-winning performance goes, it's absolute. Their meetings and such are so charming. And you see their similarties, and hear their separate problems. Robert De Niro hasn't been at his best in years, until now and he plays an OCD, football-obsessed dad who just wants the best for his son while Jacki Weaver plays Cooper's mother who is also good but gets shun upon by everyone else's outstanding performances. The film has it's flaws though, there is the length, and the predictability of it but that doesn't matter, Romantic Comedys are not so much for the story but the substance and heart of it, and this film does it just so right."

If you go into this movie thinking you are about to see one of the best movies in recent years, then you will be asking yourself ""Really?"" throughout the entire film. Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie overall. I just wish my expectations had not been so high. There was very good acting by everyone in the cast, and Jennifer Lawrence is arguably one of the prettiest actresses to come along in decades, but during much of the movie the dialogue just doesn't sound even remotely believable. There was also a contrived fight scene near the end of the movie that I guess was necessary for the plot, but it was entirely 100 percent unbelievable. Still, I would give this movie 3 out of 4 stars for the good acting and the good-natured script. The world needs more positive movies like this one."

","I am one of the viewers that enjoyed this movie and thought it's very watchable movie. But just didn't thought it was praise worthy as some of the critics are claiming it to be. This has a strong beginning and progresses on really well and had my attention most of the way through. But a little over half of this film it all just seemed too forced and just got kinda bored with it. It started out as this awkward romantic comedy movie that made me care and be interested in two main characters but it just started to become way too predictable and didn't have that intriguing and amusing psychological chemistry the beginning of this movie has. The plot is basically about two emotionally damaged and unstable people and the chemistry between the two. It has heartfelt and attention grabbing elements in this movie. Especially when it came to what the two characters are coping with and how they go around dealing with their emotional scars. Pat(Bradley Cooper) who is this guy that gets out of a mental institution, has a broken marriage and has bipolar disorder. And a Tiffany(Jennifer Lawrence) who is this girl that is going through depression and emotional scars after her husband died. And it's the awkward relationship between these two characters that drive this movie. But it just started to feel like the film goes in a direction where it tries to exploit the actor and actress in this a bit too much. This works in some movies but just didn't seem so in this one. Who knows maybe that is one of the reasons they took on these roles. Overall this is a alright watch but nothing really worth the hype over.<br/><br/>6.8/10"

","I started out liking this film quite a lot; it was quirky with great acting by Cooper and Lawrence and nice support work by all of the other players. I doubt though that it portrayed the bi-polar disease very well at all but that wouldn't have fit into the 'black comedy' flavor of the movie.<br/><br/>Then, the storyline weakened to standard Hollywood fare with the DeNiro Eagle's fan sidebar -- which I liked up to this point -- taken to an extreme with the betting angle, along with Cooper and Lawrence getting involved in the dance contest along with the other Pros, and being able to get above a five score, to win the betting Parlay. C'Mon.<br/><br/>The happy ending with them worked though.<br/><br/>The storyline weakening ruined the film for me; they should have kept it as a ""small"" film, where maybe not as much 'happens' as in the ""bigger"" movies.<br/><br/>But I still enjoyed the acting and dialog."
"joshua-303-92778","5","2","4","2 April 2013"," Cringe
","I didn't care for this film. In fairness, I didn't realize it was a romantic comedy. I expected a heavy drama for some reason.<br/><br/>The basics of the storyline are clichÃ©'d, like all RomComs. I couldn't help but suspect that they tacked on the dance scenes to profit from the ""celebrity dancing"" craze currently on television.<br/><br/>I don't think Bradley Cooper is a particularly good actor and I expect him to be doing ""Indie films"" within a couple of years. The scenes with him and the female lead are cringeworthy and lack chemistry.<br/><br/>This isn't a terrible film, but for the life of me I don't understand why it's getting such high ratings. I suppose it's more watchable than your average RomCom, which isn't saying much. <br/><br/>This movie is also very blue collar."
"adrean-819-339098","6","2","4","18 March 2013"," Two films in one
","I found there to be two films within this film. One worked better than the other.<br/><br/>The first half of the film worked better for me. There was a veritable tension as we decide if Bradley Cooper's character is still crazy or not. The film didn't rely on silly plot triggers in this half of the film.<br/><br/>The second half fell into too many pitfalls. I cannot see for the life of me see why there had to be so many secondary characters. Not a single one of them worked and the gags seemed tired. I've seen the Indian guy stereotype cutting loose at least five times in other films. What did the black character bring to the film? The brother subplot underdeveloped and I'm forgetting even more secondary characters..This film did not need to explore to it's depths these characters and whatever tension that was established in the beginning quickly fizzled away as we followed pointless subplots created from space ie; the dance competition and betting.<br/><br/>The film was also too long and a bit of cutting/editing and winding up some scenes quicker than they were would have added a greater vigor to the film. However, I enjoyed myself throughout the film and did not want it to end.<br/><br/>The absolute shining light is clearly Bradley Cooper, every other character cannot hold a candle to him. His female counterpart was particularly grating and painful to watch. Hats off to Bradley as he carried this film on his shoulders and it's a performance hauntingly difficult to forget."
"nowhereman1220","6","2","4","20 January 2013"," A great movie (Except for Act 3)
","MANY MANY SPOILERS<br/><br/>It seemed like the writers wrote the first hour of the movie in a set of months, and then they were harassed about a deadline and pulled an all-nighter to finish up the rest. <br/><br/>It had so much potential. Bradley Cooper gave a great performance as a man with honest intentions, but mental illness sent him astray. You understand exactly why he hurt the man in his wife's affair, and relate to his desperate attempt to win her back. The addition of the wedding song acting as a ""trigger"" that initiates a tantrum of rage was very compelling, especially when it started in his head even when it wasn't actually on. Another compelling aspect of the writing is that Jennifer Lawrence's character, Tiffany, is the only one that understands that it's playing in his head at times. <br/><br/>The most memorable aspect of the movie, as most people will admit, is Jennifer Lawrence's performance. She adds so much heart and reality to a role that could easily alienate the audience. She was a sex addict who tried to cheat the system at her work through manipulating her fellow workers, but you never question her true intentions. Despite how I feel about the movie, I was very impressed with her, and am very excited to see what Jennifer Lawrence does next with her vibrant career. Without Jennifer Lawrence, I would not have remained so attached to the concept of the story as the movie went on. On that note...<br/><br/>The movie's pace is vibrant and real as it goes on. Pat decides to go to the Eagles game instead of practicing with Tiffany, and the scene was simply him and his friend dancing in slow motion. It was just pure fun for a short moment, and my connection with these characters was what made me so unbelievably happy. <br/><br/>Then the ending comes. As I do during every truly good movie, I reach a point in the story where I begin to predict the ending. What makes a good movie great is that my expectations are never completely correct. I could predict that the Eagles would win, just as they needed. that Pat and Tiffany would score exactly a 5.0, just as they needed, and Pat would reject Nikki and chase down Tiffany, to tell her he loves her. It honestly could not have been more sappy, cheap and, honestly, rude to a captive audience. <br/><br/>One of the most powerful aspects of the movie, though, is that you can consider it a chick flick in the end, although the characters both suffered from mental illness. The audience experiences their situation from a perspective that shows how utterly human these emotions are."
"StevePulaski","8","2","4","2 December 2012"," It's self-aware but never smug
","It seems over the years that all romantic comedies have been stamped with the rather dishonest label of ""chick flicks"" due to their fluffy nature and their schmaltzy screenplays that seem to cater only to the needs of day-dreaming women that are looking for ninety minutes of simple escapism. Not Silver Linings Playbook. This is a serious and simultaneously entertaining romantic comedy that doesn't substitute antics for characters or reality for humor.<br/><br/>History teacher Paul Solitano (Bradley Cooper) has just been discharged from a mental hospital and can no return home to his parents' home after he catches his wife in the act of infidelity eight months ago and completely lost it. He learns that his father (Robert De Niro) is out of work, and making money off high-stakes gambling on the Philadelphia Eagles, and his wife has moved away and gotten a restraining order against him. Paul must now begin the time-consuming task of rebuilding his life and repair surrounding relationships in his life that have no been dismantled because of his bipolar disorder.<br/><br/>Paul winds up meet his friend's wife's sister Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence), who has been going through the pain of losing her husband and then committing random sex acts down at her workplace. Meeting each other, we can see they strike immediate chemistry, but their personal albatrosses, Paul with his ongoing devotion to finding his wife, and Tiffany with her inability to keep consistent with her behavior and emotions roadblock them into forming a solid, sustainable relationship together.<br/><br/>After spending enough time together, Tiffany reveals to Paul that she could deliver a letter written by him to Nikki and be the messenger between them if he agrees to be her partner in a dance competition. One of the several subplots, which is handled mainly in the final half of the film, is Paul and Tiffany trying to make a bet on a dance competition and a football game work out in Paul's father's favor, as he is facing impending financial trouble with another gambler, and another one involves Paul's father's OCD and superstitions to try and make the Eagles win games. With all this madness and little sub-plots thrown into the blender, you wouldn't believe that they work in unison.<br/><br/>The catch is they do and they do so in a method I can only relate to writer/director Alexander Payne and his barrage of delightful human comedies such as About Schmidt, Sideways, and most recently The Descendants. Payne constructs his characters with layers, making them relatable and easy to like, and writer/director David O. Russell (2010's Academy Award winning The Fighter) follows the same blueprint for success.<br/><br/>It also came to my attention that this picture further leads Bradley Cooper down the path of an A-list actor. His role in The Hangover is miles away from this one, and his character Paul is far off anything he's ever done, yet it seems he was born to play the role of a conflicted men who isn't all there from a mental standpoint. After coming off of the disappointing Hunger Games and the pathetic House at the End of the Street, I feared Jennifer Lawrence was on a path to mediocrity, but it took me about five minutes of her on screen before those two films slipped my mind. She embodies Tiffany in such a divine, confident way I was sure that she will continue to do more great things along this line of work. She is too not falling prey to the typical child-star Disney conventions, where young, mostly female actresses pick G and PG rated pictures that do not test them at all as people or character actors. Lawrence seems to be too good for that schlock. And it must be said as well that Robert De Niro, after a string of dismissible performances, has finally found his second calling in the film industry aside from breakneck mobster features and that is the sly, humorous father figure that is desperately trying to keep his troubled son close.<br/><br/>Both Pat and Tiffany wind up having some sort of complex, emotional outburst that affects them massively and the people around them also. Both sequences aren't played for laughs, but for complete seriousness which works in favor of the idea that Russell is not playing for cheap laughs but for respect for those with mental illnesses. Even in his sequences, Chris Tucker, noted comedian and actor that can take a light setup and drum it into something completely silly, is portrayed in a sincere light and is not offered up as the butt of the joke or a lame-brained, obnoxious best friend to reiterate everything Pat says (unlike Kevin Hart's role in Think Like a Man). Silver Linings Playbook is a simple, endearing exercise that is along the same line as Safety Not Guaranteed, in the idea that it's quirky and self-aware, but it has more to offer than stale fodder that passes for uniqueness.<br/><br/>Starring: Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Jacki Weaver, Robert De Niro, and Chris Tucker. Directed by: David O. Russell."

But she dared to face the past sincerely, admitting her weaknesses in human nature, and questioning whether the man can be as frank as herself, and what I appreciate is that she dares to take the initiative and dare to give to the people she likes. This kind of character who dares to love and hate is really pleasing.<br/><br/>The male host is a foil, the whole process is passive and slow to accept the existence of the female host. He was out of control when he discovered that his wife was suffering from mental illness. After leaving the hospital, he only wanted to work hard with his wife, and he met a female host who suddenly broke into his life, and her fate was reversed at this moment.<br/><br/>There is always a line of happiness behind the dark clouds.

","I was recently diagnosed with a bipolar disorder. It was fun watching this movie and being able to draw on parallels with the main character Pat.

Pat fixates all his attention on his ex-wife while I focused all of my attention on my father. I now have a visual of mania from a third person perspective and I feel empowered knowing that I never want to go back to that full blown state. Ok well maybe I will go back to that state sometime because it is enjoyable but then again that is just the inner demon that some people with bipolar need to deal with and defeat in order to have a steadfast commitment to stay in the bipolar wellness zone.<br/><br/>I loved seeing Pat agreeing to take his pills because of the normality that he was able to create while on his pills. The manic state can be very addicting so I am happy to have seen him understand that he was supposed to take his pills. Mental illness is real and effects everyone who loves you so it is just plain selfish to refuse to take your prescribed medicine.<br/><br/>This movie has everything that anyone could ever want, Drama, romance and dynamic characters. I highly recommend it especially if you want to get better grasp on understanding mental illness and how the mentally ill and their families are effected by it.

","Silver Linings Playbook covers the story of Pat Solitano's (Bradley Cooper) road to recovery after an incident that led him to do 8 months in a mental institute. After losing his job, his wife and his reputation he struggles to contain his bipolar mood swings. Constantly obsessing over the idea of winning his ex-wife back. This is until he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence). They form a very unusual relationship as Tiffany is struggling with issues of her own. Unlike most romantic comedies, this follows two people who have had their lives flipped upside down due to certain mental issues. They begin to work together and help each other without realizing how much they are helping each other until the end.<br/><br/>The theme constantly shown throughout the movie is self acceptance. Pat constantly searches for acceptance from his father (Robert De Niro), his mother (Jacki Weaver) and his ex-wife. Throughout the movie, Tiffany teaches Pat to accept himself and love himself for who he is. Pat deals with many setbacks as he is easily triggered due to his bipolar disorder. Along the way is Tiffany helping him realize that the past is the past and he needs to accept himself for who he is.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, the camera angles help the audience feel like they are experiencing the mood swings Pat has. Each one of his mood swings is followed by the camera closing in on Pat's face making him the only focus point for the camera. The music is a major part of the film as well. Pat's wedding song is a trigger for him. Whenever he hears the song he starts to break down. In some instances that are stressful for him, he even hears the song when it is not playing. Again, it is Tiffany that helps him realize the song is just in his head and that it is just a song.<br/><br/>This film dives into just a few of the struggles people with mental health issues deal with on a day to day basis. Though it teaches that everyone has their own issues and that self acceptance is the best way to live a happy life. Overall, Silver Linings Playbook is a great movie with outstanding acting from Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. They both take on roles that are much different from their usual movie roles. For couples who struggle to find a movie that has some romance, yet is not too cliche, this is the movie for you."

","'Silver Linings Playbook (2012)' is about as conventional as they come in many ways, if not most. Yet, even though director David O. Russell almost exclusively deals in this kind of 'Oscar bait', the film itself never quite seems like solely a soulless awards-grab; it's more concerned with telling a story than showing off its behind-the-scenes talent. While that talent are all, essentially, at the top of their game, it's the relatively unconventional and generally very well-rounded characters that set it apart from its peers. These may be involved in a predictable and slightly baggy plot, but their writing and performances combine to create some really compelling scenes. The entire affair is relatively compelling, actually. It's consistently engaging and, even, entertaining. Its non-condescending focus on mental-health issues is refreshing, too. I suppose, in a certain light, it could be considered adjacent to an indie flick, with a narrative worth exploring regardless of its potential in the awards circuit. Still, it's practically impossible to ignore the fact that it was clearly made for this purpose, especially given that it was only green-lit after Russel proved himself with the similarly successful 'The Fighter (2010)'. That's not necessarily to deprive it of its value, but perhaps to explain why it's ultimately a tad generic. In a way, though, it's a wonder that it's as good as it is, basically being genetically engineered to win awards. The silver lining isn't happiness, it's an Oscar. 7/10"

""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a quirky, mostly lighthearted flick about 2 people who are each labeled as ""crazy"" and their odd relationship. The humor is similar to something you'd see in a Wes Anderson flick (Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) or maybe even Jonze/Kaufmann (Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche NY). By that, I mean it's subtle without any big punchlines or slapstick gags. The sheer randomness and bizarreness of the characters' words, actions and reactions provide the comedy. So don't expect a lot of knee slappers, but at the same time there are a lot of funny lines that are very memorable.<br/><br/>Also, even though I described this as a ""romcom"", it's really not a romance or a comedy. It's more about the unique strangeness in all of us, set against the backdrop of romantic relationships. That's all you really need to know about the plot because it defies explanation. But I'll still attempt to sum it up in 1 sentence: A guy who has just been discharged from the nut house (Bradley Cooper) who is violently obsessed with winning back his ex-wife, befriends the ""town slut"" (Jennifer Lawrence), and they begrudgingly team up in an attempt to get both their lives together.<br/><br/>It's a great flick, probably best watched alone. Terrible first-date movie because it's not exactly your typical charming Hugh Grant type ice breaker. You probably won't want to watch it with your parents or kids either because there is a heavy, awkward sub-plot about dysfunctional family relationships. Definintely not a chick flick nor a bro flick (except that there's a lot about football, in a funny way). I would say watch it with your dog and have a great time."

","This is Russell's second best film and one of the best in the dramedy genre. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, soundtrack and acting. The entire cast delivers top notch performances with Cooper, Lawrence and DeNiro standing out. The plot revolves around a man who has lost it all landing him in a mental hospital for a stint. He returns home to live with his family where they hope he can rebuild his life and revive his love and his family's love for the Philadelphia Eagles. Essentially just be normal again whatever that is. Upon returning home the man meets a women with issues of her own and subtle sparks ignite. Their relationship is based on doing eachother a favor but evolves into much more. There are so many memorable scenes and quotes in this film it's nearly impossible for this viewer to pick a favorite but if I a had to it would be the dance contest. The film is witty, clever, unique, insightful, has a superlative love story and has a cathartic ending. It is mesmorizing, captivating and a relationship building story all around for the ages."

","1. Everyone is extremely lost and frustrated when the exam is down, the layoffs are laid off, and there is a major illness. Maybe it's a particularly serious one in the movie where Pat witnessed his wife cheating. But are these rare in life? It shouldn't be. Although it was a bit of an exaggeration to get Pat into the hospital with this incident.<br/><br/>2. The dialogue between the characters at first glance looked chaotic, as if everyone were crazy. But if you look closely, there is only one starting point for these dialogues, and that is love. The mother loved her newly discharged son, father loved mother, Pat loved his brother, Pat loved his wife, and Tiffany loved Pat. Pat, of course, is in deep love with Tiffany. A web of love, holding everyone in the movie.<br/><br/>3. Tiffany looked more serious than pat on the condition, although she had not been to the hospital and was not considered a psychopath. And emotionally, she looks a little too active. This is confusing, and it seems nonsense and illogical. But the real situation is that Tiffany is so short of love that her experience has led her to be the most vulnerable in the show.<br/><br/>4. As long as you understand the 3rd, the film's final hero and heroine kiss together only seems so valuable. Can see two neurotic patients love each other, let people feel that the world is too beautiful."

","I'm surprised that I really like this film. I'm not a movie buff and had just watched a series of films through the Christmas/New Year season as a break from the festivities.<br/><br/>For the first 30 minutes or so I debated whether I would stop watching Silver Linings Playbook. Mental illness is like poverty and sadism: portraying such situations can only replicate the reality of those afflictions. Only when Pat and Tiffany meet did I begin to grasp the actual dynamic driving this quite remarkable film. It's not about mental illness or screwed-up lives - it's about people, just people. True, Pat can run out of control, but look at his father: his generation got banned for violence, while Pat in his generation gets committed - a matter of social conventions, not medicine. Tiffany? Tiffany is real (something Jennifer Lawrence obviously grasped about her character). Her husband is killed in a stupid accident while trying to help her: no wonder she goes bouncing of everyone she meets. How else can she handle the utter stupidity of her husband's fate? The great thing in this film is watching her bounce off Pat, who in turn is so preoccupied with getting back with his wife that he hardly notices what she is doing. The upshot is that this allows her to regain some control of her reality. Then Tiffany, being the kind of woman she is, sets about pulling Pat into that reality: let's dance.<br/><br/>As for the ending: it's a moment of rest, of balance, no more. A sequel to Silver Linings Playbook would be very interesting to watch. No doubt we would see how Pat, given a reasonably solid foundation in his relationship with Tiffany, could develop in a perhaps unforeseen way, no doubt still obsessive. Would Tiffany act to sustain the balance between them? Or would she just fall away, now that she has achieved her long-held ambition to dance in public? Whatever else, they would never become a conventional married couple, like Pat's best friend and Tiffany's sister.<br/><br/>I had never seen or heard of Jennifer Lawrence before watching Silver Linings Playbook, but I am still stunned by the tangibility of the character she created. Probably a naive response on my part, but also a very pleasant one."

"Chris_Silver","6","0","0","21 July 2013"," Silver Linings Playbook simple review
","Silver Linings Playbook. At first i thought this was a reference to something that Pat, Bradley Cooper's character owned. ""Silver Lining's Playbook."" I was proved wrong once i watched it but that is what i thought at first. Pat is mentally disabled and diagnosed mentally ill. We pick up on his life when he is released out of a mental institute. His father, Pat Sr. (De Niro) is also diagnosed mentally disabled. His mother is normal. He is taken home, his parents house, to try to restart his life. He aims to get his old teaching job back and his love life back on track. He meet Tiffany (Lawrence) and the story takes off. While watching this movie i thought it was great, cute but i didn't think it deserved a Best Picture award. It was a great story and great ending but i felt it was a little bit too much of a ""chick-flick."" The cinematography and and camera angles were very cliché. Although i don't think the film deserved the nomination i do think that it was great, it was the best possible way to tell the story. I couldn't imagine the story being told any other way. If anyone was to try then it might be horrible. The production was satisfactory. In my eyes they didn't exactly hit it out of the par. The acting was able to hold up where the production dropped. Robert De Niro played his character so well. So did Cooper with his character and i see a Leading Actor Oscar in his future. There isn't very much to say about the movie other than that if you liked it that is cool, if you didn't that is also coo. This film wasn't mean to be loved is what i think. I feel like this film was meant to show the versatility of the actors and actresses in it. So if you haven't seen it go ahead and watch."

","I have to agree that Jennifer Lawrence is darn good in this. Bradley Cooper overacts with the best of them. But as I watched it unfold, I just couldn't buy into it. Of course, this is ultimately a comedy, though it is a dark comedy. Cooper is completely out of control when he is off his meds. This is pretty well presented at the beginning as he rants about getting back together with his wife (after having nearly beaten her lover to death). His strained relation with his father, a bookie/Philadelphia Eagles Fan/and a raving OCDer, is in the forefront. The dad, played by Robert DiNiro is about as off his trolley as Cooper. The mom wants everything to be nice, and is constantly caught in the middle of these ""crazy"" people. DeNiro has been banned from the Eagles' stadium because of rowdy behavior in the past and believes his not being present is the reason for their lack of success. Anyway, Cooper hooks up with Jennifer Lawrence who is newly widowed. She is also a nut case. She becomes his mother confessor and his link to getting back together with his wife. She is learning to dance and insists on his helping her with this in exchange for her participation in getting messages to his ex (there is a restraining order that keeps him from her as well as the high school where she teaches). Lost in all this is the seriousness of bipolar disorder. All the people in the movie are in serious trouble, and when the chips are down, the writer and director back off and turn it into a bit of a silly romantic comedy. Cooper is unrecognizable in the second half. Where did all the angst and despair go? These people don't have epiphanies. They are in constant battle with their disease. While it captivated me on one level, I felt it sold out and became less that it could have been."

","I had a number of laughs in Silver Lining, mainly because of the great performances of the cast. The film makers gathered together an ensemble that I'd love to see live on in another movie. Performed by lesser actors, the material would never have shone and entertained as well. I thought, however, that this was a movie that in its second half forgot the first half of the picture. We went from an engrossing movie of two characters, both mentally challenged, yet both lovable playing it for laughs to Saturday Night Fever, the second half of the movie, losing it's relationship to what made the characters so good.

The movie isn't bad, but it isn't great! It's pleasant and likable and it has some funny parts, it only lacked something and this something was probably what cost it the Oscar for the best picture.

","Silver Linings Playbook (2012) was scripted and directed by David O. Russell. It stars Bradley Cooper as Pat, who has been in a mental institution since he ""lost it"" when he came home to find his wife in the shower with another man. Robert De Niro is Pat Sr., who makes his living as a gambler and bookie. Enter the beautiful and mysterious Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence. At dinner party, Tiffany and Pat trade tales of their psychotropic medications, and then they enter into a love/hate relationship. Finally, the two become dance partners and enter a dance contest. You can take it from there.<br/><br/>I didn't enjoy the movie much, but I give Russell credit for showing us that mental illness really is an illness, and it's not funny. Jennifer Lawrence deserved an Oscar for her role in Winter's Bone, but I wasn't that impressed by her acting here. Robert De Niro's role struck me as tiresome. Of course he's one of our greatest actors, but I think he was just going through the motions in this film.<br/><br/>We saw this movie in a theater, but it will work well on DVD.

","I was surprised by this film. I hadn't expected it to be so good. I also was surprised by the top class acting from what I view as Hollywood actors. I thought they were both incredibly good in their roles. My view is that from the beginning to right before the end is it was a huge build up to this emotional ending which had me fighting tears back. The story line was so interesting, I mean yeah it was adapted from a book and I don't know how well it was adapted, but the way the story slowly folded out bit by bit was great. I liked how almost odd and quirky it was, which I think the characters had a vital role in. I liked Pat's constant fight to get his wife back (who didn't deserve him back in my opinion, and she should be the fighting for him) and the way he silently fought for Tiffany too. Tiffany was a complex character who was dealing with grief at the same time as falling in love. Bradley Cooper did an excellent performance, really incredible, and he did so, so well in playing this interesting character fighting to keep things straight and back to normal in the world around him. Jennifer Lawrence was at her best in this film, she really came out from what I'd seen her in previously and into this character who seems to be so simple to understand on the outside yet really on the inside she's a mess but still keeps strong. Both main actors did their best performance in this film out of all the things I'd seen them in previously. Supporting actors like Robert De Niro were extremely good too. All round, must see, excellent film. Go watch it!"

","Things that were well done: 1. Well acted by all involved. no bad performances and as you have probably heard the two leads (ecspecially Jennifer Lawrence) were very impressive. 2. Well directed...the way the film was shot had no flaws unlike some movies that fail to capture emotion where it does exist, instead it makes you believe what is happening is real because it doesn't try to overpower the content or hide behind it, just let's it do it's thing. 3. Works well as a romance; i would say this movie is one of the better romances out there, but that is because there aren't very many good ones, mostly inaccesible to guys entirely, but this one works from both the perspectives and has a decent emotional payout at the end and you realise that most of the screen time was working towards it.<br/><br/>Things that were badly done: 1. Badly written. in my opinion the only problem with this film comes out of it's attempt at showing the lives of people with certain mental instability. it fails at this not because of the dialog or actual events that occur, but rather it does not succeed in taking us inside the mind of the lead (Bradley Cooper) because it doesn't show enough flashbacks/ weird thoughts he would be thinking instead of listening to other people's voices... but also it doesn't take the route of trying to be objective and shooting as if it was a documentary that you can either choose to take a side in or not, because it doesn't film from angles and zoom levels that suggest being impartial to the characters.<br/><br/>a better than average film with a unique storyline that is worth watching just for the great performances but also for a decent romantic pay out at the end.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>m0n5tercat"

","Silver Linings Playbook, adapted from a novel of the same name by Mathew Quick drew acclaim and 8 Academy Award nominations. it is also the first film in 31 years to be nominated in all four acting categories. While all the performances were top-notch, Jennifer Lawrence won the Best Actress Oscar. All this is alluring enough to make a movie buff watch the film. And it turns out to be totally worthwhile. <br/><br/>Pat/ Patrizio Solitano Jr. (Bradley Cooper) is released into the care of his parents after having spent a while at a mental health institution. Although under treatment for Bipolar Disorder, he detests pills and has a hard time dealing with the fact that his wife Nikki has now moved on after an episode when Pat beat up her paramour in fit of rage and he faces a restraining order from her and the school where he used to work. <br/><br/>Ronnie, a friend of Pat's invites him over to his place for dinner, where he meets his sister-in-law Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence) who recently lost her husband and has her own share of psychological issues which manifests in the fact that the whole town seems to know for her freewheeling promiscuity. Oddly though, both hit of well over a conversation about the medication they have been on and bond well thereafter. <br/><br/>The best written parts in the story are the conversations between Pat and Tiffany, in what can be described as 'no holds barred'. There's a time when Pat says ""I don't have a filter when I talk"", which essentially describes their condition and bonding over the fact that they don't have to pretend with one another, unlike the rest of the society. <br/><br/>And among the most hilarious instances is when Tiffany chases Pat, he tells her ""I'm married"" to which she says ""So am I"", Pat: ""But, your husband is dead"", Tiffany: ""where's your wife?"", Pat: ""You're crazy?"" Tiffany ""I'm not the one who just got out of that hospital in Baltimore""<br/><br/>The other characters, Pat's parents Patrizio Sr (Robert De Niro) who is probably as 'differently wired' as his son, Pat's mother (Jacki Weaver), his humorous friend from the Baltimore institution Danny (Chris Tucker) and therapist Dr Patel (Anupam Kher) also manage to leave their mark as the film allows these characters to take lives of their own without getting into unnecessary details or sub-plots.<br/><br/>Strong script, Yes! But the film also draws its strength from powerful performances. Bradley cooper is very convincing as the man on recovery mode, taking to fitness. Tiffany as the girl who found a socially unacceptable way to deal with her loss, De Niro as the gambling addict and Anupam Kher, a serious therapist who turns out to be a crazy Eagles fan. Chris Tucker is a great addition to the film despite the small role. <br/><br/>Well, what does the title actually refer to? The silver lining is driven by the strong belief that Pat has in happy endings. His feelings are evident in an animated conversation that Pat has with his parents in the wee hours debating on why in one of Hemingway's books does the story has to end with somebody's death. He is driven by the principle 'Excelsior', the Latin word for 'ever upwards' which he keenly lives by.<br/><br/>Some pitfalls in the movie could be that the romance in the story is very predictable and that may not have ended in any other way. Generally, that is true for most romances that thrive on culminating in happy endings. Another is question on whether or not this role of Bradley Cooper is an accurate portrayal of Bipolar Disorder or not. And then the obsession of De Niro's character on betting all his money over superstition. <br/><br/>The verdict: The Oscar nominated movie 'Silver Linings Playbook' is definitely worth a watch for the skillful writing and humor brought out in the oddest of circumstances. While the movie is careful enough not to poke fun of any mental condition, those that have reservations about its portrayal on screen, could better stay away."

Unfortunately the plot quickly spirals down the trodden path of the genre, in a predictable unfolding of events: boy pines after his ex, boy meets new girl he is forced to interact with, boy gradually falls for the new girl who heals him.

Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro are simply adorable – how can you be funny, troubled and yet loving at the same time? But they did it - with the help of a very strong supporting cast. Jennifer Lawrence is young but promising, also very convincing to play someone with problems!<br/><br/>Even though Pat (Cooper) has bipolar disorder and needs medication, we can't help feeling empathized with him despite the fact that almost all characters in the movie are crazier than he is! This is so ironic and close to real life. But then it was OK if we are a little stressed out at times, as long as we have a strong supportive network and ways to release pressure. For Pat, it was running, reading and working at getting back with his ex-wife whom he is obsessed with and becomes his drive. For Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), it was dancing (and more?). For Dad (Robert De Niro), it was watching the Eagles and mending the relationship with his son. <br/><br/>The sincere and yet hard-to-express father-son relationship was beautifully portrayed. Ditto the caring between friends and families. Yes, there maybe little lies here and there and not telling everyone everything. So what? Be forgiving! Don't sweat the small stuff! In the end, we learned that whatever we say may not matter if you have good intentions. Step back and look at the large scheme of things: watch the actions, read the signs, do your research, and be positive.

This is one of the best movie I have seen this decade, the acting is so great that I was so surprised; I have seen many Bradley Cooper movies, mind me list some The Midnight Meat Train, Yes Man, He's Just Not That Into You, The Hangover, Valentine's Day, A-Team, Limitless and Hangover II. All of this especially Limitless (2011) shows how good an actor Cooper is, but this movie shows how great an actor he truly is.<br/><br/>Silver Linings Playbook is such a great movie, well written and well directed. The Weinstein Company bought the rights to the book (The Silver Linings Playbook by Matthew Quick) before it was even published, a decision I'm sure the company will never regret because not only is this movie a must watch, so you can see wonderful acting from Bradley, Jennifer Lawrence (Hunger Games (2012) and X-Men: First Class (2011)) and Robert De Niro it is a must have. It is well paced and I liked the score and the dance scenes.<br/><br/>The movie plot is about Pat (Bradley Cooper) who has bipolar disorder, which developed when he found his wife cheating on him and he nearly beat the man to death. The movie kicks off when Pat got released from the mental institution and move back in with his parents. He then met Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who was just as messed up as he was. The two together developed a relationship that helped keep them mentally stable.<br/><br/>But Pat is still hooked on getting back with his wife Nikki and Pat's father (Robert De Niro) is so determined to get his juju working by bonding with his son so that the Philadelphia Eagles could win, since Pat Sr. is placing all his money on the Eagles winning.<br/><br/>The movie is well directed by David O. Russell (The Fighter (2010)) the screenplay is well crafted to sooth the viewer to feel the intimacy developing between the leads. Silver Linings Playbook was shot on a 33 day period and it got eight Academy Award Nominations including the Big Five the first time since Million Dollar Baby in 2004, (the Big Five are: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and screenplay — either Best Adapted Screenplay or Best Original Screenplay, which has been won by only three movies It Happened One Night (1934), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and The Silence of the Lambs (1991).). Silver Lining Playbook was a commercial box office success making over 7 times its production cost and it is also a critical acclaim.<br/><br/>Here is a movie you have to see no matter what, even if you have to cut corners being down stumbling blocks, just make sure you see this.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"

","Having seen someone live with bipolar disorder, I found the scenes accurate to a point that they were hurtful to watch. That being said, all people who experience mental illness do not do so in the same way so I don't quite agree with all those who are upset a out the portrayal. I do feel like near the end of the movie the illness is glossed over in a typical Hollywood fashion which to be honest I was rooting for anyway. Loved the acting of all actors! Cooper gave good depth to his role and I also thought the role of his mother was well played. I didn't appreciate the unrealistic perception that psychiatrists can hang out with their patients as the movie progressed. That's Hollywood for you."

","After the solid effort that was ""The Fighter"", I was curious to see how director David O. Russell would follow up that wonderful film. His answer the ""Silver Linings Playbook"" an able, solid and catchy effort.<br/><br/>At its heart, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a love story, wrapped in a layer of mental and emotional distress, a dysfunctional but loving family, dancing, gambling and American football.<br/><br/>Sound complicated? Sound convoluted! It might appear so at the beginning, but once the movie gets going, the going is good, and David O. Russel deftly juggles all the aspects of this wonderful film as well as a highly talented cast, including Robert De Niro who's in fine form once more, Jackie Weaver, Bradley Cooper, Chris Tucker, Julia Stiles and John Ortiz.<br/><br/>For me, the heart of the movie is Jennifer Lawrence, whose honest and heartbreaking performance really uplifts the film. This very award deserving performance really becomes the common thread of this movie. To understand what I mean by that, you have to watch the movie.<br/><br/>""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a welcome respite from all the really awful crap in rotation now at your local movieplex!"
"DubhDoo","7","0","0","17 February 2013"," Warm and easy to like, with an appropriate title
","David O'Russell is a filmmaker who is no stranger to the Oscars. His 2010 boxing drama 'The Fighter' garnered seven Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director, and also managed to deservedly win two acting awards. Now, his most current film 'Silver Linings Playbook' has been nominated for an impressive total of eight, including the two highest honours, as well as receiving a nom in each of the four acting categories, becoming the first film do so since Warren Beatty's 'Reds' in 1981. But the question on the lips of many is ""does it really deserve to feature so strongly at this year's Oscars?"" Yes and no, frankly.<br/><br/>That's not to say that there's anything particularly bad about 'Silver Linings', it's perfectly fine, but is it the type of film that could viewed as being on even footing with some of the other Best Picture contenders? It's questionable, but as far as I'm concerned, I don't think so. Diluted down to its bare factors, it is essentially a feel- good romantic drama, which uses football as an instigator for father/son bonding in the way only an American movie could and depicts how people can manage to triumph over mental illness, in a manner that teeters into over-sentimentality. It isn't really anything you haven't seen before and becomes more predictable as the narrative progresses. Cooper's character is a teacher who has been released from a mental institution for nearly beating a fellow staff member to death, but we only get brief snatches of this as David O'Russell doesn't delve into the darker side of mental illness and instead softens any edges presenting us with an unashamed crowdpleaser, but this is something that is largely unforgivable as the film is ultimately rather charming.<br/><br/>However, don't get the notion that this is some sickly saccharine inspirational tale the like of which have become all the common, because this is a film which manages to narrowly avoid such territory and also has a rather appropriate title. Amidst the predictability of the story, we are offered a silver lining in the form of the film's acting. Bradley Cooper plays Pat Solitano Jr., the man readjusting to life after a stint in a Baltimore mental institution, and while he might not be one of the greatest actors of all time, he induces his character with a certain zest and charisma that even the most cynical viewer may struggle to resist. Jennifer Lawrence on the other hand, has proved herself to be quite the talented actress in the recent years with films such as 'Winter's Bone' and this little movie called 'The Hunger Games' and here she continues on this winning streak. She's really great as Tiffany, a young woman who bonds with Pat, able to relate to his mental illness. With his role as Pat's dad, Robert DeNiro delivers his finest performance since 'Casino' in 1995, while Jacki Weaver offers fine support as his Pat's mother and Chris Tucker lightens the already-bright mood as a friend of Pat's. <br/><br/>'Silver Linings Playbook' is no masterpiece, but it is still a thoroughly enjoyable film and at its best when Lawrence and Cooper are on screen together, especially coming to life in these moments, where I found myself properly caught up in the drama. Elevated by strong performances, it is never less than watchable and always quite likable."

","I was at a screening of this movie in Dallas last night. It's the story of a Pat played by Bradley Cooper who has lost everything, his marriage, house, job and has just been released from an institution where he was sent by the court because of his violent and crazy behavior after finding his wife fooling around in their shower with a coworker. He's now living with his parents and trying to return his life to some normalcy. His dad remains a large influence on his life, is also a reforming-violent character and an oddball played with restraint by Robert DeNiro. Coming in and out of the story is Chris Tucker's character another inmate of the institution whom Pat befriended who has a penchant for escaping. When he shows up he helps Pat get through emotional issues he's facing.<br/><br/>Pat is setup and meets Tiffany played by Jennifer Lawrence who's an oddball too with emotional issues trying to recover from the unexpected death of her husband. Tifffany pursues Pat who still has longing to return to his marriage but can't yet do so until his wife removes the restraining order against him.<br/><br/>At the most base level this is a story of crazy-offbeat-oddball characters who are trying to help Pat return to some sense of normal. Can Pat overcome his issues, respond to their support attempts and return to normalcy? Will he return to his wife? Will Tiffany prevail in her pursuit of Pat? The movie is has its entertaining moments and at times is emotionally rewarding to watch as the Pat, Tiffany and the others are engaging and creative in their approach to life. Lawence's portrayal of Tiffany is over the top and so crazy that as her relationship to Pat unfolds he seems a normal guy trapped in her crazy world but I was left wanting a stronger main character Pat than Cooper portrays.<br/><br/>After one hour of watching oddball people it was enough for me but this movie continues to throw out more crazy for another hour. Its neither crazy funny or enhancing to the story. Enough already."
"djp2000","9","4","12","14 November 2012"," Love and football
","Silver Linings Playbook is kind of a Jerry Maguire for 2012. There's a lot of talk about love and a lot of talk about sports - well, football mostly. And it involves two emotionally wounded characters at the forefront. But these two have way more issues going on than Jerry Maguire ever did. Bradley Cooper plays Pat, a man who just spent 8 months in a mental institution. He's technically married but problems with his marriage are part of what led him to the institution, and he doesn't know if his wife has any intent of even seeing him again. His best friend tries to hook him up with his wife's sister, Tiffany, even though Pat's main focus is to work things out in his marriage. Tiffany certainly has a dark side, which Pat fails to realize is actually fitting for him. His own wife is scared of him after all. But he's the kind of guy who obsesses on whatever he focuses on. So when he realizes that Tiffany can speak to his wife for him, he starts to pay her more attention. It's apparent that Pat gets both his temper and his obsessive ways from his father. His dad (Robert De Niro) is a hardcore sports fan who seems to care about nothing more than his hometown football team, the Philadelphia Eagles, winning. In his superstitious mind, any little thing can affect the outcome of a game. And that can include his son's well-being and even who he's dating. So Pat generally feels a lot of pressure on him, and much of the film is about his attempts to cope with his surroundings as well as making an effort to better himself as a person. Jennifer Lawrence shines as Tiffany, showing an acting range well beyond her years. It's not only her and Bradley Cooper's finest acting to date, it's also the best acting Robert De Niro has done in at least 10 years. The film even manages to bring a funny Chris Tucker out of seclusion who hasn't been in a movie not named Rush Hour in 15 years. The fact that the film was actually shot in Philadelphia is very beneficial. (Bradley Cooper is also a native.) The movie truly captures the Philly mentality and attitude better than I've ever seen on film before. And as someone who lives in Philadelphia, I know just how crazy the Eagles fans in particular can be; there's no embellishing that here. The movie's got a little something for everyone. Die-hard sports fans can appreciate it as much as those who like a good ""chick-flick"". But for everyone who watches, they'll see that no matter how bad things get, they can always find another path to get back on track. Silver Linings Playbook opens on November 21."

"LeonLouisRicci","4","3","8","5 May 2013"," This One is a Bad Bet
","Movies about Mental Disorders usually are given a pass by the Public and by Critics. Meaning they are given more latitude than most. That seems to be the case in this overrated Film that starts out quite good but around the second half it becomes unhinged and lapses into a formulaic and very predictable Picture.<br/><br/>There are some good Acting chops and the first part of the Script is humorous and the beginning of the Romantic Relationship is compelling but then something happened. That is nothing happened that was not either outlandish contrivances or painfully predictable. From about the time the Dance rehearsals start it missteps, stumbles and is quite irritating and boring.<br/><br/>The Movie dances around and then forces the ending with some betting gymnastics to the detriment of the subject matter. It relies on the most overused and unexciting Sports finale clichés so everyone can throw up their arms and shout Yea!!! This belongs in another type of pablum known as, we will score just when the clock runs out. Boo!!!<br/><br/>It's hard to imagine this as being sincere about Mental Disorders. More like a handle to grab some cash and awards, pulling the strings and gaining approval for articulating those with handicaps, but here, it all just seems like sleight of hand. There is nothing going on here that deserves any kind of appreciative accolades. In the end it is kind of a cheap shot at the expense of a sensitive, empathetic, and caring Audience."

","If you are going to make a comedy romance where the lead suffers from violent bi-polar disorder then it might not be a bad idea to make sure the headliner has kind blue eyes and sensitive features ala Bradley Cooper to keep it light and get you over the rough patches as he does in Silver Linings Play Book. Cooper who may well be the 21st century version of Jimmy Stewart does a commendable job of doing so but director David O Russell has a hard time getting his recipe of dash's of other films (Footloose, Last Tango, Saturday Night Fever) to reach comic heights because of the three hundred pound gorilla in the room, the illness with its violent overtones as a comedy launch pad.<br/><br/>After teacher Pat Solitano finds his wife handing out favors to a fellow educator he goes nuclear and nearly beats him to death. Institutionalized for eight months his mother signs him out against advice and the volatile young man heads home to Philly to win his wife back. It doesn't take long for Pat Jr. to act out again with a half a dozen infractions that should send him right back to the bin but it seems the enormous patience of friends and the community (Philly mind you) is full of forgive and forget. Enlisting Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence)to help in his crusade he grudgingly agrees to enter a dance competition with her. With issues of her own the two form an abrasive alliance.<br/><br/>Silver Linings breaks from the box fast with loose cannon Pat's unpredictability and unsettling behavior direction yet to be established but once it settles into it's comedy slot it is little more than a hyper When Harry met Sally. Lawrence and Cooper have some nice go rounds but outcome is telegraphed well in advance and the humor to help get us there runs its course fast.<br/><br/>To give the film its energy Russell shoots most of it in disorienting close-up with a fair amount of middle of the street restaurant and home scenes that lack verisimilitude in their drama or comedy edge with their sarcastic punch lines.<br/><br/>As Pat's parents Jackie Weaver spends most of the film welling up and wringing her hands while Robert DiNero as his bookie dad plays it with a little more intensity than his Focker dad. It is a terrible waste as we see glimmers of the greatness that was Di Nero in scenes played as straight drama instead of comedy between father and son may have made for a far better film with lighter box office returns. Russell remains intent however in coming up with ""the feel good comedy of the year"" with a touch of edge but Silver Linings Playbook double bladed topic, silly comedy out of serious illness is ultimately a dull swipe at it."

","I hesitated a moment before writing, since other reviews already here seem right on target. But, I will say, briefly, that the movie kept me laughing, moved, and totally attentive for its entire length. The spontaneity moment by moment is striking to experience as a film viewer, and gives a feeling of overall vitality. Since I am studying psychology, it was refreshing to see individuals with emotional challenges portrayed coping and trying to grow. It seems portrayed in a realistic manner, neither too easy nor too depressing or defeatist. Just real.<br/><br/>Bravo to the creators of this film. I give it a 9 not a 10 because it does not really touch on eternal existential themes of survival as the greatest classics do, but as a romantic comedy/drama it seems to be at or near the top of the category."
"vispateresa","1","3","9","6 October 2015"," What an awful mess!!
","I really wanted to like this movie, but unfortunately it turned out to be an awful mess. At the beginning Cooper does a good job at portraying Pat, a bipolar guy who just got out of mental hospital, is obsessed by his ex-wife and struggles to go back to normal life. ******Attention: SPOILERS ahead.******* <br/><br/>He meets Tiffany who too is a bipolar and nymphomaniac. Unfortunately, Lawrence's rendition of Tiffany consists in wearing the same sulky/angry expression all through the movie. Plus, the casting of Lawrence is totally wrong since she is a model-type (I think a ""girl next door"" type would have been a better choice). <br/><br/>While in any other movie (or in real life) Tiffany would have hundreds of men courting her, here she falls for Pat and even gets to the point of chasing him while he goes jogging (first truly ridiculous scene). Despite her beauty, he doesn't seem too impressed with her, not even when she gives him lectures about life while doing what seems a very sexy yoga poses with her buttocks well in sight. <br/><br/>Pat's parents don't like Tiffany but then there's this big scene (so ridiculous it's involuntarily comic): at some point, she starts listing the scores of some football team and then the miracle happens! They look at her in amazement and suddenly start to like her (!). At this point, if you had given the movie a little chance, you realize it's a joke and just want to reach the exit of the cinema. <br/><br/>But, wait! There's more: the dance competition scene! The two train to take part into the competition and right when you thought they were getting together, Pat meets his ex-wife (and by this time you have come to dislike Tiffany so much that you hope for some surprise ending and that he will get together with his ex-wife). At the end of the dancing scene, poor Tiffany is left alone and wanders in the street like a soaked kitten but – surprise surprise! – Pat realizes he's actually in love with Tiffany, they kiss passionately and live happily ever after. <br/><br/>If I should sum up this movie in a single word, it would be ""ridiculous"". It deals with a sensitive issue like mental illness in a very superficial way and it constantly swings between drama and comedy, but it seems to head nowhere. The real low point is Lawrence who has a China doll face but lacks the depth and insight that her character requires; she can't express one single feeling (how she won an Oscar Award for this role is beyond me). I can't believe De Niro accepted to play in this mess, either."

Still it's one film that's filled with emotion that when one watches they will like. And be like me just don't watch the film because your a die hard Philadelphia Eagles fan, because the picture has so much to offer in the form of a love chance and a second discovery of peace and life for two hurt young people. Based on a true story then done as a book the direction on the screen is near perfect from David Russell. Anyway set in Philadelphia, PA you have Pat Solitano(in a breakout role for Bradley Cooper)an ex school teacher who's just recently left a mental ward after being treated for bi polar disorder and it's clear he probably has no chance with his ex wife. So Pat returns home to his parents mom the laid back and soft spoken Dolores(Jacki Weaver)is still with dad that's the rough and hard nose fight you in your face Philadelphia Eagles fan Pat Sr.(in one of Rob De Niro's better roles in awhile)so is this all that Pat junior has to look forward to bleeding green on Sundays and trying to read literature. Well just when you think the expected the unexpected happens Pat meets a beautiful yet troubled still outspoken and brash young lady in Tiffany(in a mature and fine performance from Jennifer Lawrence). And along the way some relationship chemistry develops slowly but surely as it proves trust can develop between two wounded hearts with some time. Really enough words can't describe this film as one needs to watch it to feel the full emotions. It proves that damaged hearts that meet have a chance for love as time, work, and compassion can heal a damaged mind proving with anybody that love in the book can cure all as two troubled people together who love one another can produce a silver lining in the end."

Cooper's character, who is supposedly the film's primary protagonist, is portrayed in such a disturbing way that an uninformed viewer could not be blamed for thinking that those who are bipolar - a very real illness with very real, good people who suffer from it - are all miserable, violent people who obsess over others to the point of stalking them.'<br/><br/>Absolutely!

I loved the book. I even found it enjoyable reading the book knowing who would be playing the various characters in the movie. I'm no fan of Bradley Cooper, but I felt he was perfect for the role of Pat as I made my way through the book. And surprisingly, I thought he was the strongest performer when I finally watched the movie. Jennifer Lawrence (meeeeeow) was entirely underutilized in the movie. Great that she won an Oscar, but she should have won it for a movie and performance better than this. & Robert DeNiro: Does this guy simply show up for the $ these days?

"tjsprik","5","2","5","6 May 2013"," Romance or Bi-polar disorder--Movie with an Identity crisis
","I was really looking forward to seeing this movie but what a disappointment. The plot is unsure of itself, the acting adequate but not great, and the Philadelphia Eagles angle is poorly executed.<br/><br/>We meet Pat right off the bat when his mother shows up at the mental hospital to take him home, where we then meet his father (Robert DeNiro). Within ten minutes their characters are easily discernible-- mom is the peacemaker; dad is OCD, a huge Eagles fan, and prone to get in a fight or two. Pat is bi-polar, refuses to take any medication, and is living in a constant state of anxiety.<br/><br/>The mental illness at the heart of the first half of the film disappears about the time Pat agrees to take medication, at which point it becomes a romance. (supposedly it's a comedy too, but until the closing scenes there was little that was laugh-worthy). Pat begins a relationship(refreshingly chaste) with Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), agreeing to be her dance partner in an upcoming competition in exchange for her doing him a favor regarding his ex-wife.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie is dominated by a combination of Eagles football, which Pat's father worships, and the growing friendship between Pat and Tiffany. Unfortunately, none of the Eagles drama rings true if you live in the Philly area, as I do. Philadelphians have a distinct accent which goes undetected in DeNiro's portrayal.<br/><br/>Sadly the schizophrenic plot, the stilted and rough execution of lines, and the lack of a genuine Philly feel outweigh the the satisfactory ending. Overall, this film was not horrible, but not very good either. I can only guess that the Academy smiled upon Silver Linings Playbook because of the mental health angle. Wish that had been more fully explored within the context of the second half of the film.<br/><br/>The 'R' rating is for a conversation in the diner between Pat and Tiffany regarding a sexual experience she had, for partial nudity in a flashback scene, and for numerous uses of the f-word."
"tieman64","Null","2","5","23 February 2013"," Conventional fairy tale masquerading as edgy drama
","David O. Russell's ""Silver Linings Playbook"" stars Bradley Cooper as Pat Solitano, a middle aged man with bipolar disorder. Recently released from a mental health facility, Pat's determined to win back his estranged wife. These hopes are undermined by Pat's many violent, angry outbursts.<br/><br/>Pat's delusions – his wife wants nothing to do with him – are mirrored to several other characters in the film. Pat's father, for example, is deeply superstitious, and a young woman, played by Jennifer Lawrence, proves unable to accept the death of her husband. The film ends with a dance competition. Lawrence and Cooper have no chance at winning, but enter the competition riding on a cloud of optimism, hope and faith. They lose, but place high enough to win a monetary bet which affirms the superstitions of Cooper's father. The film's point? Man should remain relentlessly optimistic in the face of adversity and be constantly open to silver linings, the faint signs of which invariably line all events. Sounds familiar? It's ""Girl Interrupted"" with added testosterone.<br/><br/>""Silver Linings"" message is positively easy when your script is built upon clichés and contrivances. Cooper's yet another sad-sack middle aged man who's essentially cured through sex with a conveniently placed, ultra hot young woman. This is self-help through love and copulation, a feel-gooder fairy tale in which men are saved from themselves by the embrace of a good woman who understands their pain. Lawrence's character, meanwhile, is a giant emo fantasy; a sultry wounded girl with black mascara, more curves than a Monte Carlo racetrack, and who copes with grief by humping everyone in her office. ""There's always going to be a part of me that's sloppy and dirty,"" Lawrence says. But we don't believe her. She's sex on legs, Russell lingering on her tight leotards, designer pout and ample luggage.<br/><br/>Indeed, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" will henceforth probably be known as the film which put Jennifer Lawrence's butt on the map. Which map? Probably the map of Middle Earth. Lawrence's booty is so precious, it looks like her butt was forged by Sauron himself. And not only does Russell cast the ""official sexiest woman of 2012"" in his film, but he casts actor Bradley Cooper as well, a bronze Adonis twice voted the sexiest man on the planet. That's a whole lotta sexiness for one film. You half expect these two to break out into a suburban rap battle, Cooper free-styling ""Baby Got Back"", Lawrence ""My Humps"". What's that Cooper, you like big butts, you cannot lie? Congratulations, ima cure your mental illness with my humps, my humps, my sexy lady lumps. This some deep drama right here.<br/><br/>""Playbook's"" all about curing depression and mental illness through dancing and having lots of implied sex, but there's no ""curing"" going on in the film, only deflections upon deflections. The neuroses of Cooper's father are reaffirmed, Cooper and Lawrence merely replace their spouses and one local friend continues to drown his corporate miseries in designer furniture and material purchases.<br/><br/>At its best, the film works well as a screwball comedy. Cooper and Lawrence hide blossoming attraction with mutual resentment and much verbal sparring, but this witty banter doesn't last long. Meanwhile Russell's script leaves little room for nuance. Nothing is concealed, and there's little for the audience to do other than just watch these people crawl their way to inevitable redemption. Elsewhere the film's aesthetic echoes Russell's work on ""The Fighter"", fractured, choppy and angry – a constant stream of emotional fireworks - and so mirroring Cooper's own state-of-mind.<br/><br/>In the end, it's Robert De Niro's Pat Sr. who leaves the biggest impression. De Niro doesn't act particularly well here, and his character's not particularly well written, but because several of his subplots were removed (to push the film toward a lighter, more fairy tale ending), his character, whose latent hostilities are meant to provide a rationale for his son's troubles, retains an ambiguity which somehow makes him more rounded, mysterious and human.<br/><br/>Incidentally, Russell's underrated ""I Heart Huckabees"" featured a hero who rejects the idea of meaningful coincidence. This is the flip-side to ""Playbook"", which advocates a kind of fake-it-till-you-make-it optimism. In ""Huckabees"", our hero then suffers an existential crisis, stops trying to help others (he's an activist, like Russell was) and collapses into hedonism. He then rejects this in favour for a Zen-like state of ego-lessness and ""pure being"", a state which he, of course, cannot maintain. The film ends with our hero reconciling at least four philosophical positions into a whole new life code. This film, Russell's best, was bashed by critics and shunned by audiences. Ever since then he's become a somewhat generic film-maker, albeit one now showered in Oscars and accolades.<br/><br/>7/10 – Worth one viewing. ""Playbook's"" soundtrack contains ""Girl From the North Country"", arguably Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash's best recorded collaboration."

Hollywood's obsession with female youth and beauty over quality and credibility went too far this time. I think Jennifer Lawrence is a good actress but I just think she was terribly miscast for this role. I just couldn't buy their relationship and consequently a rating of 5 as opposed to a 7.

","I'm not really a great movie critic, but I like to think that I can appreciate the differences in styles of directing, especially how the movie is projected to the viewer. <br/><br/>I don't really go for the classic rom-com, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence play exceptional roles in this one, in fact the whole cast do. From start to finish you're intrigued as to how the movie will play out, each step of the way you feel more drawn to the characters and the acting really pulls you in to the emotions that such individuals would be feeling. <br/><br/>Honestly, my opinion is you must go and watch this. Yes there are 'cheesy' moments and it does follow the similar theme that any romantic comedy would follow, but with more subtlety (especially with the comedy). <br/><br/>I have a medical background and I assure you that Bradley Cooper really nails the role right on the head. <br/><br/>10/10 is maybe too much to award, but that's my opinion. You start with confusion and intrigue, you follow through with laughter and then you end with a slight tear of joy. What more could you want."
"lbjtheking","9","2","5","21 January 2013"," Uplifting and cleansing movie!
","After watching this movie, I can see why it has been nominated for and won so many awards. At first glance, it may just seem like a typical run-of-the-mill romantic movie, but it goes much deeper than that. The movie is about Pat (Bradley Cooper), who has recently been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a man who is working to improve himself to impress his ex-wife. He ends up meeting Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), who also suffers from deep emotional issues. These two awesomely unconventional individuals fuel the flames that make this movie so unique and so great.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper's acting is incredible, portraying his bipolar and extremely straightforward character so well that you forget he is acting. Jennifer Lawrence also does a great job as Tiffany, showing incredible depth to her pain and the emotions in her life.<br/><br/>Besides the excellent acting of the two main characters, another great thing about this movie is how refreshingly positive it is. Honestly, as messed up as Pat and Tiffany are, most people can probably relate to them in one way or another. It is really interesting watching Pat struggle through trials to become a better version of himself. And deep down, aren't most of us doing that everyday; working to become better?<br/><br/>Maybe the reason this movie touches so deep is because it can speak to every one of us; to show us that you can be better. That no matter how messed up things can get, there is still hope for improvement. Excelsior!"
"Nibbler007","9","2","5","11 January 2013"," Cooper Flew Over DeNiro's Nest...
","I'm not a fan of romantic movies. In fact, I recently bad-reviewed Bradley Cooper's ""The Words"" for the plot lacking thing those awesome actors did not so long ago. <br/><br/>But then I saw Silver Linings Playbook. And it's so darn difficult to review! I have the feeling this is a very good movie in the genre, but I can hardly describe why. <br/><br/>I saw that tandem (Deniro and Cooper) on an action flick about mindbroading drugs and all that stuff . I didn't like it, really, but seems this subject is to be exploited by the guys involved in this film.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper took a step forward in his career and made a nutcracking role. Not easy to pretend to be a bipolar if you're not one, though towards the end, he seems to control his temper more easy than I would 've thought, and that's the only flaw I can tell. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is a shocking and beautiful girl who captived my attention all the movie through, and that's not easy for me to say. Not that I am a misoginist or something like that, but I often don't give too much credit on young girls on important roles. They tend to ruin all the prospect. But this is not the case. I love her, I definitely love her (hope my wife doesn't read this review). She's perfect.<br/><br/>I mean, it resembled me a little to One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, may be a tribute somewhere there. You know, the loonies on the path who are tough enough to face society and prejudices, the ones who are diminished by others and they point the finger on us, on things what we consider ""normality"" and how sometimes you have to be very very special to fulfill a dream, or if not, to be clever enough to get yourself up together and do things right. Every member of Pat's family has an issue. Selfishness, tolerance, fanatism, pedanticism, quirk, pressures, ingenuity, obsessions, etc. A good point on the script is to vanish the psychiatry issue, and picture them as virtues somehow, instead of negative human qualities.<br/><br/>So this is about redemption, this is about love, and this is about little pathos thing we all have and how we handle it. The linings of sickness and sanity sometimes are so thin. In love, specially. <br/><br/>Still don't know how to justify my 9 out of 10 score. I simply loved it. Maybe because is an original piece, with a beautiful (and all-the-way- rocker) soundtrack -yeah, Stevie Wonder's ""Don't You Worry Bout a Thing"" is a delicious choice, and so Zeppelin's ""What Is and What Should Never Be"", with glimpses of DeNiro's awesomeness... we should cherish this one as a gem for the future, a cult movie of its own. It has a lot of great elements which merge together fine though it's a hell of a ride.<br/><br/>DeNiro is the absolute man. He may be old, but has that shine I can barely describe on other actors. Yes, he's the Italian tough guy, yes, he's an old man autoportraiting himself nowadays, but he's a legend, and he's a key role in the story. And does it so well. He'd bet your daughter that he can.<br/><br/>Sometimes the film has the predictability we hope for, but that's no harm. Romances must end well. And this one does. Though the paths which lead this beautiful story may be a little odd. <br/><br/>Very, very good and touching movie. <br/><br/>Cheers from Argentina."

I don't get when people say they were bored or the story was weird. It's supposed to be weird (They're crazy!!!) At first, I was skeptical with the Bradley Cooper and J Lawrence pair up but damn they fit quite well together. This is one of those movies that tell you how life gets so crazy you just gotta live with it. Acting was nothing under amazing! No one was out of place everyone did their job whether it be to provide comical relief or to add drama to the screen they all did wonderfully. <br/><br/>This movie is ALSO NOT ONLY FOR GIRLS!

"diac228","8","2","5","13 January 2013"," Inspiring drama with plenty of flair from start to finish
","Truthfully, the only reason I watched this movie was to see how a seemingly cut-and-paste drama could land their director an Oscar nod above the more ambitious and creative Tarantino.<br/><br/>Silver Linings Playbook however deserves its Oscar nods, and almost even deserved that Best Director nod. With a nice realistic script and fantastic performances to follow, Silver Linings Playbook is one of the superior dramas of 2012 by combining plenty of raw emotion with charm and even some humor to ease the pain. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper shines as a saddened bipolar man that moves in with his parents to try to get his life together. What follows are the interactions and behavioral changes amongst everyone around him after the several months he spent away in psychiatric care. And along the way he meets a woman (Jennifer Lawrence) that might be equally as much of a mess, but also equally in need of a good friend. Based off a Matthew Quick novel, it's much more drama than anything else but the characters will grow on you and will have you rooting for them on the final act.<br/><br/>David O. Russell is getting quite good at pulling off great performances from his cast, as he got a couple Oscars from his last movie The Fighter. This time around Bradley Cooper gives the best performance of his career by providing layers of likability even during his worst of moments and moments of detachment, while Jennifer Lawrence and Robert DeNrio are expectedly but still undeniably electric. <br/><br/>The chemistry amongst everyone in the film is what carries this movie throughout and past the dimmest and slowest of moments, when the movie starts to drag a bit in the final third. Russell doesn't have much to work with to flex the directing muscles, but gets the job done by providing calm basic cinematography while also tugging the heartstrings when necessary. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie is a good drama, pure and simple. It never becomes overly complex and bloated, it's just a straight up entertaining drama with an assortment of standout moments that swings past all the issues of running time and some fluff scenes. Silver Linings Playbook is a grounded drama that stands as one of the best of the year."

"six2561","9","2","5","9 January 2013"," Great movie
","This is a great movie. Although my husband's take away was that it is a chick flick, it is really a movie about mental illness. Yes, the ending is chick flicky and contrived but Bradley Cooper plays an awesome Pat Solitano, a man in his own head with his own demons to work through. I guess I identified with this movie because I have a ""Pat Solitano"" in my family and he's married to my sister. Not that she's cheating, but the irrational rages, yelling, repeatedly saying ""Can i tell you something?"", the OCD, the craziness when his mind gets set on a task (like finding a wedding video) . He won't take any meds either. As portrayed in the movie, it stems from the family. Examine the Robert DiNero character and his marriage relationship with his wife, mostly the way the wife manages the marriage to keep her husband and his own illness at bay. She's on edge, always smiling, everything is OK, when it's anything but. Bradley Cooper played this part spot on and I'm sure he did much research before filming. It is very difficult to play someone with a non-recognized mental illness effectively and convincingly and so emotionally grabbing without over acting it. He deserves recognition for this roll. I appreciated the way the Tiffany character, played beautifully by Jennifer Lawrence, kept him grounded by bringing his illness right smack into his face, all while going through her own grief and time of uncertain despair. If the ending was handled differently I would've given this movie a 10. But really an important film to see and maybe even take ""that"" family member or friend with you so a conversation can be started."

","For one reason or another I don't see many movies these days, so I had never seen or heard of the two primary actors in this movie, Bradley Cooper and the beautiful Jennifer Laurence. Watching them on screen in this movie, though, has truly been eye opening. They are both brilliant, if not totally realistic, in this film in their depiction of mentally ill people trying to return to ""normalcy."" The only actor I recognized immediately was Robert DeNiro, and his performance was, I think, his best in may years. The supporting actors in the cast were also uniformly good, especially Chris Tucker. Severe mental illness and other neuroses are not a laughing matter, but this film uses fantastic humor to bring those problems to our attention. And that mentally ill people - rather beautiful people in this film - need love as much, if not more, that the rest of us is something to think about. Despite the subject matter, this is still a romantic comedy. It's poignant as well as terrifically funny. Go see it."

"octopusluke","8","2","5","28 December 2012"," Oscar contention aside, this is a funny, sassy and empathetic look at mental illness
","Following 2010′s stodgy boxing drama The Fighter, the notoriously difficult filmmaker David O. Russell returns to the big screen with buzz movie Silver Linings Playbook. A warts and all look at mental illness, it's a film of unassuming beauty, pottering along with great ease during the two hour running length, but underneath the breeze is a resonating story of strength, courage and a love the likes of which we rarely see on the big screen.<br/><br/>Annoyingly, if you take a quick glimpse at the synopsis, Silver Linings Playbook wreaks of Academy Award worthiness. Adapted from Matthew Quick's debut novel, it's the story of Philadelphia, bi-polar thirty something Pat (Bradley Cooper), a high school substitute teacher who's mother (Jacki Weaver) has just bailed him out of a mental institution – against doctor's orders – after an eight month residency. What caused him to snap? He came home one day to find panties on the floor, his Stevie Wonder wedding song on the stereo, and his wife Nikki having sex with another man in the shower. Traumatized, he beat the guy within an inch of his life, and since then has lost everything – the job, the wife, the life and his sanity.<br/><br/>Pat returns to the real world and moves in with his doting mother (Jacki Weaver) and gambling addicted Eagles devotee father (Robert De Niro). Down but not out, he's convinced he can get his life in gear and win back his wife, even though she has sold their house, moved away and has a restraining order on his head.<br/><br/>Along the way, he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young widow turned sex addict, fired from her job after sleeping with everyone in the office. Like Pat, she's a little bit crazy, and they turn their unlikely power dynamic into a therapeutic friendship. Spending every day together, the two compare medications, partake in public fits of rage, and find themselves trading favors – and dance moves – to get what they want.<br/><br/>Whilst the young Lawrence has already put in some astonishing performances so far with Winter's Bone and The Hunger Games, Cooper is the real surprise treat here, finally matching his affability with a character of some depth.<br/><br/>Together thought, they have a natural magnetic charge which drives the film and elevates it from being another harangued look at mental illness. De Niro puts in his best performance in recent memory as the negligent OCD father trying to win back his son's love. Even Chris 'Rush Hour' Tucker is great in a brilliantly muted performance as Pat's delusional friend. When that guy shuts up, he really has some screen presence.<br/><br/>But all of these performances would be nothing without O. Russell's eloquent screenplay. Whilst his jolting hand-held cinematography suggests child's play, his words are that of a seasoned professional. Whilst it is no doubt a marketing catastrophe, the script makes the film unclassifiable, vigorously shifting between comedy, drama and tragedy, whilst never waning the audience's interest, or turning to the quirk/irksome like O. Russell's god-awful I Heart Huckabees.<br/><br/>It's nowhere near the best film of the year acclaim I've seen it garnered with – the pacing can be off, and it doesn't really get moving until Lawrence turns up on screen – but Silver Linings Playbook is nevertheless a great movie. With just enough crowd-pleasing sweetness, sexiness and O. Russell idiosyncrasies, it's an empathetic and moving look at people in dire straits, on the search for a silver lining. Tiffany and Pat find it in each other, and you'll find it in this film.<br/><br/>More reviews at www.366movies.com"

","When I heard that Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert DeNiro, Jacki Weaver, and Chris Tucker were all going to be starring in David O. Russell's new film (a director that has lead some great ensemble casts in The Fighter, Three Kings, and I Heart Huckabees), I was pretty excited. But everything changed when I saw the first trailer. Check it out yourself. It looks like Silver Linings Playbook is destined to be a cheesy and predictable romantic comedy that would be more fit for a March release date.<br/><br/>So you could imagine my joy in finding a movie that is deeper than I could have ever expected. A moving and romantic film that doesn't simply deal with skin deep love connections, but dares to dive further into the lives of the troubled characters that inhabit the film. And, most importantly, Silver Linings Playbook contains some of the best acting performances this year from top to bottom of the cast.<br/><br/>Destined to be nominated for Oscars with the quality of the film and the name Harvey Weinstein attached, Silver Linings Playbook tells the story of Patrick (Cooper), a former teacher who spends eight months in a mental institution after violently beating a man he caught having an affair with his wife. Released from the mental institution early, Patrick hopes to win his wife back and must find a way to cope with his everyday life due to his struggles with bipolar disorder. Coming from a family with a father that has obsessive compulsive disorder, Patrick's home life is a major challenge after being released from the hospital, and he must find a way to cope with his illness.<br/><br/>Enter Tiffany (Lawrence), a girl with struggles of her own. Tiffany's husband, Tommy, died recently and she was fired from her job after sleeping with 11 different co-workers while in a deep depression. The sister of Patrick's best friend's wife, Tiffany is set up on a dinner date with Patrick shortly after he is released from the hospital (a date neither realized they were being set up on). What seems like a match made in hell slowly turns into a friendship in conversations over prescription drugs.<br/><br/>Eventually, Tiffany and Patrick go out to dinner together at a diner where they start to find out a bit more about each other. During the dinner, Tiffany agrees that if Patrick writes a letter to his wife, she will deliver it for him (breaking the restraining order between the couple, but not something Tiffany is worried about helping with). But soon Patrick starts to screw up the conversation, having no filter on the things that comes out of his mouth, and Tiffany storms out of the diner, angry with him. Patrick tries to chase her down, but ends up in a confrontation in front of a theater and starts to have a breakdown. Tiffany realizes how bad Patrick's condition is and gets him out of the jam. She agrees later on to give Patrick's wife the letter, but only on the condition that Patrick participate in a dance contest with her.<br/><br/>This is where Silver Linings Playbook really excels. The film's two main protagonists are both troubled, confused, and ill souls, but with each other they find their purpose. Patrick struggles constantly with his bipolar disorder and Tiffany's depression is constant, but when they are with each other, it is easier for them to thrive and be their best selves. The romance that starts to build between them is always close, but distant with Patrick's desire to return to his wife. And on top of all of this, Patrick must also deal with his father (De Niro) begging him to watch the Eagles with him as he is a betting man and believes Patrick is good luck. The disorders these characters deal with are not hidden and not dealt with easily, and that is what makes these characters much more dimensional than something from a Nicholas Sparks book.<br/><br/>To read the rest of the review (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/silver- linings-playbook/"

The fact its got Bradley Cooper in it merely compounded this for me; I was debating not bothering at all. But, but: Bradley Cooper is sensational. He delivers a performance I did not believe possible - I see him in an entirely new light. He is helped by the fact that Jennifer Lawrence is mindblowingly good. Fierce, funny and utterly believable, the two of them convey a chemistry that is not matched often.<br/><br/>The story is so much more than meets the eye too.

Cooper gives a superlative career high best turn as a recently released mental patient whose near-breakdown spurs him to come up with a 'game plan' to get his estranged, unfaithful wife (Bee) back and re-enforcing his family ties with his bettor father (De Niro, in a comeback return to form) and loving mother (wonderful Weaver) with one major new element to his tenacious life - the younger sister-in-law (an incredible Lawrence) of his supportive friend (Ortiz) , whose own unsteadiness remains to be balanced. Heartbreaking at times this best realized account of mental health pic cum life affirming dramedy is the best of its kind since ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST which doesn't coddle or push away its underpinnings for self-help and self-discovery. Thanks to impressively focused acting (Cooper should seriously get an Oscar nod as well as the aforementioned leads), a somewhat loosey-goosey direction by David O. Russell (who adapted loosely form Matthew Quick's novel) and emotional clarity that has been neglected for some time from the medium of film. The give- and-take friendship/relationship between the laser-beam intensity of Cooper and the wild- card desperation-bubbling-under-the-surface of scary/good Lawrence is truly worth the price of admission. One of the year's best films. Period."

","Silver Linings Playbook is a film directed and written by David O.Russell (with the original being written by Matthew Quick as a novel). This film has got three very recognisable faces within it, with three of the leads being taken by none other than Bradley Cooper playing Pat, Jennifer Lawrence playing Tiffany and Robert De Niro playing Pat Sr. who all have taken to their roles with such precision and jaw dropping talent, it gave that final light to round off an overall amazing film with a great storyline. <br/><br/>Today was my first ever viewing of Silver Lining Playbook. One of my friends and I were doing a trade of films, I gave him Inception and he, this film. I didn't really know what to expect, I'd seen the trailer before it came out and then seen a lot of reviews and comments floating around the film on social networking sites ever since, especially Tumblr which exploded with excitement. <br/><br/>As the film started I was sitting there with a basic idea of what of the film was about, I knew that two characters had some sort of mental illness or something around that area and that they both ended up helping each other in different ways. The film started and 122 minutes later, I was sitting at the screen, sobbing my heart out at what a fantastic film I just witnessed. Heck, 20 minutes in I was hooked and glued to the screen and by the time Cooper's and Lawrence's on screen relationship started to connect, I was begging for them to just kiss and be together! Bradley kick starts the film with his background and what's happened to put him where he is, in the situation he is in, at the current moment and time and you find out about his marriage that sent him into a mental institution after he caught his wife cheating on him and he nearly beat the man half the death. Now, he is getting help to try and control his temper and outbursts etc. As the movie goes on he see Lawrence start off as a very mysterious, in-your-face, kind of girl - looking extremely attractive as always and from the word go, you can see that their characters click in a strange sort of way. The story progresses and just starts overflowing with so much emotion - especially with Cooper taking to his character so well and portraying all the little aspects that someone suffering with the condition would have, making the viewers really emphasis not just for him, but his family members and him. There is many times when he portrays the distress and frustration so well with little twitches and facial expressions that really deeper you're understanding and meaning. Meeting the same acting level is his outstanding co-star Jennifer who delivers her lines with such an emotional attachment and power that you can feel her broken past, you can see that she's a shadow of the character she was meant to be formally. <br/><br/>Put simply, all characters work in harmony making the film sing with an operatic manner making this one of my all time favourite films which gets added to my top 5 films that I love. I just believe that it's a definite must watch film, for the actors and actress's and the story line. With that, my rating out a 10 (excellent) doesn't need to be explained.<br/><br/>By the end, you are witnessing a feel good film that leaves you sitting in your seat looking like a mess while you sob into a tissue crying with happiness. <br/><br/>But hey, don't take my word for it. Check out the film and see what I'm talking about."

","""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a rare kind of film. It's a difficult task to honestly and realistically present characters who are struggling deeply with heavy issues, without tipping over into emotional goo and sentimentality But David O. Russell is the man for the job, expertly leading four of his talented actors to Oscar nominations in a film that gives a delightfully raw edge to screwball comedy. Bradley Cooper stars as a recently released mental patient, trying to put his life back together and reunite with his estranged wife with the help of a similarly struggling Jennifer Lawrence, who is recovering from the death of her husband. Their relationship buds and grows around their practice for a dance competition that Lawrence wants to dance in, and around Philadelphia Eagles football. Co-starring Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver, and Chris Tucker, ""Silver Linings"" is a quirky, affecting love story about the power of staying optimistic and the strength of family bonds, brimming with characters you want to cheer for. That I wouldn't be at all upset if this poignant comedy took home Best Picture, in a year of so many fine candidates, should be enough to get you to go see it today.<br/><br/>-Thomas Bond"

","Two years after his critically-acclaimed boxing drama in THE FIGHTER (which also won Christian Bale his first Best Supporting Actor Oscar), writer-director David O. Russell has finally returned to his roots (quirky comedy, that is) in SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK. The result is one of his funniest movies to date. That's not all -- SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is the ultimate feel-good movie of 2012, anchored by memorable cast and witty screenplay all around.<br/><br/>Adapted from Matthew Quick's 2008 novel, the story centers around Pat Solatano (Bradley Cooper), a former substitute teacher who is an emotionally troubled man returns to his Philadelphia home of parents Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro) and Dolores (Jacki Weaver) after spending eight months in a Baltimore mental institution. Apparently he is ordered to stay there because he had nearly beating a man to death following an affair with his wife Nikki (Brea Bee). He is certainly a short-tempered person, where he suffers a severe case of bipolar disorder -- a condition related to manic depressive illness. And yet he refuses to stay on his medication and believes he can control himself. Now he vows to do everything he can to win back his wife -- starting by getting in shape and such. The problem is, his wife already filed a restraining order against him, which made him even more difficult to achieve his goal.<br/><br/>During that time, Pat has unexpectedly making friend with an emotionally troubled widow named Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a self-proclaimed ""crazy slut with a dead husband"". Then Tiffany offers to pass along a letter to Pat's wife, since she sees her regularly, on the condition that Pat will help her as a partner to compete in a local dance competition.<br/><br/>Judging by the premise, there's actually nothing original about the story. But yet, it was the way of its execution that made the movie so compulsively watchable. Thanks to Russell's entertaining script, the plot is constantly funny and involving while the quirky dialogue are razor-sharp. Russell's direction is also top-notch especially the way he play the situation about the subject of mental illness and of course, two psychologically unstable protagonists (Pat and Tiffany) for genuine laughs without resulting into cheap mockery or mindless slapstick.<br/><br/>Apart from Russell's awesome piece of work, the cast are remarkably ace as well. In his best performance to date, Bradley Cooper has never been this charismatic before. What's more, his neurotic acting is often fun to watch for. As Tiffany, Jennifer Lawrence gives another tour de force performance in her career. No doubt she projects a magnetic screen presence here. She can be tough, vulnerable, sassy and sexy (love her dark hair) and most of all, an amazingly funny actress rolled all into one. She's a completely perfect acting package. Other supporting roles are equally captivating as well: Robert De Niro has never been this spontaneous in a long while as Pat's father who is particularly superstitious with football; Jacki Weaver is delightful as Pat's caring mother while Chris Tucker appears in a memorable cameo as Pat's best mental-ward buddy. It's nice to see him playing a well-balanced comic relief without exaggerating his larger-than-life persona we used to find him in movies like RUSH HOUR trilogy. Even smaller roles like Anupam Kher as Pat's therapist, Julia Stiles and John Ortiz as Pat's neighborhood friends, Veronica and Ronnie, have their own share of limelights as well.<br/><br/>Technical credits are well-calculated here with great use of its Philadelphia setting in the suburban area that you almost feel like home. Masanobu Takayanagi's zooming hand-held camera-work and Jay Cassidy's hyperactive editing combined well together to mirror the twitchy effect of Pat's whirlwind mindset. Completing the tech package are Danny Elfman's music and a perfectly-chosen soundtrack supervised by Sue Jacobs (especially that Stevie Wonder's evergreen love ballad My Cherie Amour).<br/><br/>SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK could have been a five-star comedy masterpiece, if not for its minor flaw. Too bad the middle part sags a little as if Russell is struggling to maintain the perfect momentum. But once the climactic finale kicks off with a local dance competition involving Pat and Tiffany (a memorable one, indeed), the movie is certainly exhilarating enough with a highly-satisfying payoff.<br/><br/>So if you are looking for a current movie that puts a big smile on your face and characters that you can root for, look no further than SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK."
"aandrewdorst74","9","2","6","15 January 2013"," Excellent Excellent Movie.
","I must tell you that through out the movie I was getting a little exasperated. By the end of the movie though, it all came together. That was just the superb acting/directing/writing/producing coming down on me. Jennifer Lawrence...WOW! Her acting was amazing, and Bradley Cooper was terrific. And such a great supporting cast. I won't give it away, but how you feel through the movie is exactly how you should as you live the characters scene by scene. It comes to a masterful conclusion and I have a great respect for Jennifer Lawrence(She is not just beautiful folks),even more so now, and Bradley Cooper as well.<br/><br/>Not everyone can appreciate a well done performance such as this, but then there are some who made Honey BOO BOO popular too...just think about that."
"3xHCCH","9","2","6","12 January 2013"," More Mature Than the Book
","I have recently read the book by Matthew Quick, admittedly in preparation for watching this movie. While the book had a decidedly child-like tone being told in Pat's mentally-disturbed point of view, this movie is a lot more dramatic and serious in tone. The romantic comedy is still in there, but this film is more mature than the book. <br/><br/>From the onset, you already knew that this was not going to be an exact depiction of the book. A lot of changes were noted in the transition from book to film. For some reason, the surname of Pat's family was changed from Peoples to Solitano for some reason. The tune Pat hates was changed from the really cheesy ""Songbird"" by Kenny G to the less cheesy ""My Cherie Amour"" by Stevie Wonder. All the football stories in the book were summarized into one tailgate party scene in the parking lot of the Philadelphia Eagles' stadium.<br/><br/>The story progression and development and the climax is totally different from the book but decidedly more effective cinematically. These changes made were in no way insulting or disappointing to the fans of the book. It did lead to an ending we have seen so many times before in several a romantic comedy in a scene not even in the book. But for the sake of the goodwill built up by the very effective chemistry of the two charismatic lead stars, audiences will love it and cheer.<br/><br/>It is truly remarkable that a romantic comedy could garner nominations in the top 5 Oscar categories and then some. Aside from Best Picture, Director, Screenplay (adapted), this film had the rare distinction of having a nominee in ALL 4 ACTING categories! <br/><br/>While I read the book, I already had Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence in my mind in their respective roles as Pat and Tiffany. While I can fully imagine Cooper as Pat, I simply cannot imagine Jennifer as Tiffany. However, while watching the film, Jennifer could not have been a more apt choice. She pulls off this very mature role convincingly with a ferocity and sexiness heretofore only hinted at in ""X-Men First Class."" <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper so far we remember only for his stupid ""Hangover"" movies. He gave us a glimpse of his acting versatility in ""Limitless"" in 2011. But this role as Pat seemed to have been written with him in mind. He had embodied this role of the troubled bipolar guy to a perfect T. He remains likable despite his condition, as Pat was in the book. As portrayed by Cooper, audiences will root for this guy. <br/><br/>While the book had a more dominant role of Pat's Mom, Jacki Weaver had to take a backseat to Robert de Niro in the meatier role of Pat's Dad. Ms. Weaver can count herself lucky to be nominated for the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress as her role had been considerably edited in the final screen version. Glad to see De Niro back in good comic form as Pat's supportive Dad. As originally written, Pat's Dad hardly had any dialog nor much to do. I guess this role was rewritten to deserve the talent of the actor they signed for it. <br/><br/>As for its quest to be the first contemporary romantic comedy since ""Annie Hall"" (1977) to win best picture, I do not think that is completely impossible. However, win or no, this movie will be a favorite of many audiences, even for guys only forced by their significant others to watch with them. It will make you feel good and smile when you leave the theater, and that is what we all like."
"damienasimon","10","2","6","12 January 2013"," Wow
","This is as close as it gets to real life. At first i was skeptical about this movie, not sure about how i could relate to ""crazies"". But what caught me in the trailer was the twist of how much of a focus was put on being positive and the potential for a silver lining. In essence ""Hope"" So i took a chance. I haven't regretted it, from start to finish this movie was as crazy as you could get and i was able to relate to more than i anticipated. Thats because we all get a little crazy sometimes, but thats what life is about, being crazy, but the best part is what happens when he get passed crazy and how we look back at it. We need a little crazy sometimes, so we can live a little. I loved it and if you open your minds you will love it too."
"Red_Identity","Null","2","6","11 January 2013"," Truly fantastic
","I had been anticipating Silver Linings Playbook very much for a good while now, although I wasn't entirely sure I should be. It does look like some sort of romantic dramedy, and while the genre can work well many times, it's also not a genre that does anything particularly amazing for me. And while I liked Russell's The Fighter a good amount (his only other film I've seen) it's also the sort of film that quickly fades from memory. So I can't say how well I'll like a film like this as time goes by, but for now, I'm in love.<br/><br/>I never saw a trailer for this. I only saw a clip between Pat and Tiffany at the dinner table with another couple (who I now know is Pat's friend and Tiffany's sister), and the clip hugely impressed me. I loved Lawrence in Winter's Bone, but this just seemed like such a huge step for her. And then there was Bradley Cooper, making a large impression in the short two-minute clip that I was completely shocked. Who knew the guy from The Hangover could do so much in such a small clip? So for them I definitely had high expectations, just based on two minutes. And they certainly didn't disappoint in any way, shape or form. There have been some great duos in 2012, but no two actors electrify the screen together as much as Cooper and Lawrence. They bounce off each other magically, making me long for more recent films with a central relationship as dynamic and as charismatic as this. Lawrence nails every single second of her character. There's a real energy to her, you just can't look away. People have wondered whether this is just a really large supporting role. Here's the thing. When you look at cinema's history you see a lot of roles considered ""leading"" that are sometimes really large secondary characters to a more prominent lead. A great example is Marlon Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire. But the reason he is ultimately seen as lead alongside Leigh is because of the amount of power he brings to the screen and for the fact that he brings to the film the type of spark that not everyone can achieve, and as a result the relationship between Blanche Dubois and Stanley is the central power to the film. The same goes for Lawrence here. Whatever she is in terms of category, she gives the best female performance of 2012. I say that without hesitation, and I truly hope she wins the Oscar over the also-great Chastain or Riva.<br/><br/>I wanted to talk about Lawrence before Cooper because, as it is, it's the performance with the most notices. But Cooper is just as equally magnificent and radiant, demonstrating a true talent for handling something as dramatic and comedic as this. He drives the film in ways no other actor of the year besides Jackman in Les Miserables did. But despite being the main lead of the film, his role is perhaps not as showy as Lawrence's. The role requires for a true navigation between many different emotional arcs that should drive the film in a clear and empathetic way. Cooper finds the perfect balance and as a result it's one of the easiest characters to sympathize and connect with in recent years. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast is strong, and De Niro and Weaver both do great in their roles. As is the case, I'm not sure why people are too upset about Weaver, especially when De Niro was seen as a strong, strong possibility for an Oscar nom for several weeks now and yet doesn't have all that much more to do than her. Based on reactions to the Oscar nods, I expected Weaver to be in it for very few scenes. She's more prominent than that for sure. The ending also worked brilliantly for me, but this is the type of ending that I could see perhaps weakening or making the film stronger when I reflect back on it later on. Ultimately, this is a very strong film and among the best of 2012."

","This film is recommended.<br/><br/>"" Every cloud must have a silver lining, Wait until the sun shines through, Smile my honey dear, while I kiss away each tear, Or else I shall be melancholy too! ""<br/><br/><ul><li>Lyrics from My Melancholy Baby by E. Burnett, G. Norton, &amp; M.Watson</li></ul><br/><br/>Love is strange. The search for Mr. or Mrs. Right comes with many obstacles and every relationship comes with its own special baggage. Some of its contents are neatly folded and with room to spare, nicely hidden in each fold while others are ugly and messy and filled to the brim. It's the latter type of baggage that we find in Bill O. Russell's dramedy, Silver Linings Playbook, a romantic comedy that always entertains, even if it willingly sacrifices realism in favor of that evasive feel good feeling.<br/><br/>Meet Pat and Tiffany, both bi-polar and both in need of love. Pat is just off a broken marriage for nearly a year, the result of his angry issues. Recently released from a mental institution due to a nervous breakdown, he encounters Tiffany, a tough-as-nails promiscuous widow, hasn't quite made it in the world of dating. Neither have the social skills or reserve to be seen as followers of the norm. In fact, they're the type of person that one avoids at all costs. Quirky with a capital Q, to put it nicely.<br/><br/>In fact, everyone in this Philadelphia neighborhood seems to be off kilter. Dad ( a solid Robert DeNiro ), an avid Eagles fan with anger issues of his own, has OCD and a heavy gambling problem. Mom ( Jackie Weaver, good but underused ) is the typical loving enabler, trying to calm everyone around her. All of their friends and relatives have less than happy lives. There's nowhere to go but up in this part of town.<br/><br/>Director / writer David O. Russell takes a very familiar scenario, two lovable misfits battling the odds, and plays it a little too safe. He seems more concerned with making a crowd- pleasing melodrama without any real consequences to his well-drawn characters. Russell's dialog is insightful and clever, quite poetic at times. but his plot structure is all over the place. He places his characters in different situations to force their reactions which ring false. Their highs and lows are mere plot devices to advance the story, but never go deeply into their mental instability or fragile state of mind. His intriguing lead characters deserve more than the film's predictable (and far fetched ) outcome.<br/><br/>However, it is the two main actors and their natural chemistry together that takes Silver Linings Playbook to a more honest and emotional level for the movie-going audience. Both actors lash out at each other, creating a commanding presence on screen. Bradley Cooper has never been better. He conveys the angst and confusion, that twisted sense of optimism that his character needs to survive. Jennifer Lawrence plays her damaged character openly raw and masking the internal pain. It is a remarkable portrait of vulnerability and inner strength. Yet what makes their performances so strong and memorable are the subtle glances, the silences, and words not shared between the cruelty of their actions.<br/><br/>If only the film would have been more courageous and truer to the issue of mental illness and its effects on loved ones, Silver Linings Playbook could have been a great film. It scores periodically whenever it starts to think outside the box and not follow the winning formula of most romantic comedies. But more often, the film is content to settle on staying inbounds and following that norm.

"griffolyon12","10","2","6","27 December 2012"," David O. Russell's Best Film to Date
","Silver Linings Playbook is a joy from start to finish. It's the kind of film that you feel as if you have actually experienced something, while at the same time you're wildly entertained.<br/><br/>Blurring the lines between drama and comedy, the film tells the story of Pat (Bradley Cooper), a former History teacher who walked in on his wife with another man. Pat snapped and beat the man to a pulp, being sent to a mental hospital for 8 months, diagnosed with bi-polar disorder. Once out, Pat moves back in with his parents (Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver), while he tries to get his life back on track and prove to his wife that he's changed. To say that this film is a comedy, may seem hard for someone to fathom, but believe me, writer/director, David O. Russell makes it work.<br/><br/>Silver Linings Playbook shows these serious situations, but makes them funny by amping up the neuroses of all involved. In a way, it's as if Russell is saying, everyone is a little bit crazy, as is evidenced by Pat's psychiatrist's obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles, or his dad's obsessive, superstitious beliefs that if Pat doesn't watch the Eagles' games with him, then the Eagles will lose.<br/><br/>The performances by all involved are superb. Bradley Cooper delivers a career best turn as Pat, being both likable and vulnerable at the same time, and what more can be said for Jennifer Lawrence, who portrays a mentally unstable widower, named Tiffany, who befriends Pat. Lawrence is having one great year. From her career best work as Katniss in The Hunger Games, to her work in Silver Linings Playbook, she proves that she is full of spunk, but is not afraid to show emotion or fall apart, and that is why she very well may win the Best Actress Oscar come January.<br/><br/>There is just something special about Silver Linings Playbook. It's funny and oddly heartwarming. After a career high with The Fighter, two years back, David O. Russell bests himself again with this film. This is quite possibly the best directing he has ever done, with his kinetic shot design utilizing a lot of camera movements to show the characters and emotions that he wants us to focus on at that time, by dollying the camera in or whipping it around other actors to get to the core of each scene.<br/><br/>Silver Linings Playbook is an offbeat film, and some might not find its straightforward nature all that funny, because with both Pat and Tiffany, what you see is what you get, and they both say whatever is on their mind. While they often say socially unacceptable things at the wrong times, that is where the comedy often comes from, and it's why you realize that these two are meant to be together, learning, that no matter how crazy you think you are, there's always someone out there for you who is just as crazy and will love you for who you are.<br/><br/>I give Silver Linings Playbook a 10 out of 10!"
"rjennica","10","2","6","27 December 2012"," perfectly cast actors - superb!
","Casting director hit gold with choice of actors. Can't imagine anyone else playing their respective roles more perfectly. Especially Jennifer L. who never looks like she's acting. Conveying deep emotional expressions naturally, (which you just can't teach in acting school), she may very well covet an Oscar for her performance. Ditto for Brad C. and supporting actors. The dancing sequence was a bit too short for me. Now I want to see Jen in ""Dancing with the Stars"" because she really IS a star! I'm sick of these, ""WHO? WHA? never heard of them"" celebs. Perfect match for MAX C. with her tall 5'9"" frame. And whadda figure!!! Barely a comedy as most posted. Deeper than the ""I"" meets so to speak. The football dialogue confused me.

"bobbobwhite","9","2","6","26 December 2012"," Best movie of 2012
","Been wondering all year when a truly good movie would show up, and this one is it. The subject matter of the mentally ill was not all that different or special, but what made this film special was the screenplay first and then the marvelous dead-on acting of the entire cast. Jennifer Lawrence will surely be the next big name in female actors, as she was so natural and real in her demanding role that you never saw the acting, just the character. Bradley Cooper played well the lead ""problem person"" in this film of many, his riveting blue eyes nailing to the wall any he looked at and spoke to. Robert DeNiro, in yet another role as an off-center parent, was his terrific self in much more than just a supporting role as he was integral to story development.<br/><br/>But, above it all was the truly great David Russell screenplay, as we have all seen stories with similar subject matter that were harmed or even ruined due to out of place and/or flat comedic elements and collective bad acting or a low quality script. This movie not only had the gravitas of truth and honesty in it that most don't have a clue about, but it also glowed from the very rare and intangible inner magic of a screen writing gem that resulted in an ensemble triumph most films would not even hope for, much less obtain.<br/><br/>In your lifetime, if you have ever felt marginalized or on the sidelines or not really ""in"" life due to personal issues, and that covers most of us at one time or another, do yourself a true favor and see this wonderful movie of initial anguish and despair that eventually becomes one of believable hope and triumph."
"s-fleischman","8","2","6","25 December 2012"," Excellent Character Study
","This film was excellently written and had solid performances by the cast. Bradley Cooper did a fantastic job in this role and is one of his best performances in my opinion. Equally matched by the stellar young Jennifer Lawrence this showcased her exceptional acting skills. I found myself drawn to the characters and emotionally invested in their outcomes. It is not a film for everyone with the heaviness of the content however for those who appreciate fine cinematic experiences then I would highly recommend you see the film. Chris Tucker added a lightheartedness to the film that showcased his great comedic timing and depth that I have not seen from him before. Robert De Niro just seems to keep getting better with age and this film showed sides of him that we don't get to see too often. David Russell did a phenomenal job of directing such strong players and from the man who last brought us The Fighter I would expect no less. He seems to have a talent in allowing the actors to stretch the bounds of their normal comfort ranges and elicit amazing and heartfelt performances that we just don't see elsewhere.

","If you are calling this a 'rom-com' you are misinformed. This is a dark comic look at mental illness, with the possibility of love.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper is Pat (who has an unspecified anxiety disorder)released from a facility after almost beating to death the man who was having an affair with his wife Nikki. He's lost his job, his home and is living with his parents. Dad (Robert De Niro)has trouble with anxiety as well. It seems almost everyone in this movie suffers some sort of disorder. Pat is convinced he can win back his wife if he can make his life manageable. His friend's wife sets him up with her sister Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) a widow also suffering. She says she will deliver a letter to Pat's wife Nikki (Pat can have no contact because of a restraining order), if Pat will dance with her in an upcoming competition. Pat believes his compassion for Tiffany and commitment to the competition will prove to Nikki he's ready for her to take him back.<br/><br/>Bradly Cooper if fantastic. He conveys all the anxiety, confusion, mania and anger you might expect from someone a little out of step with everyone else. There is no wink, no subtle nod that 'I'm not really crazy, this is a game'. This is a very true performance. Robert De Niro is compelling as well in his belief that his son is somehow controlling the destiny of the Philadelphia Eagles football team. Jennifer Lawrence also does very good job.<br/><br/>The Silver Linings Playbook says you can have a great fulfilling life with mental illness... but you need a strategy... Excelsior! Trivia note: If you look quickly at the theater marquee you'll see the movie showing on Halloween is 'Midnight Meat Train'."

The way the main characters are rendered throughout the film is natural: it feels like they could really be someone you know in your real life. Also co-protagonists are gorgeously portrayed: Pat's family, the doctor, the neighbours (John Ortiz and Chris Tucker's characters are hilarious). Once again, Robert De Niro at his best: love the way he manages to give such depth to minor characters just by...'DeNiroizing', I'd say...them. Last words go for Jennifer Lawrence: she keeps achieving very high standards in basically any films she plays in, whatever the genre is. Here she is even better than in Winter's Bone, IMHO.

","Silver Linings Playbook is a milestone in cinema about people with mental health problems. Usually seen as dangerous (as in Hitchcock's Psycho) or funny (Levinson's Rain Man), people with mental disorders end up losing control of their bodies and are treated apart, trapped or overprotected as it happens in real life.<br/><br/>David O. Russell's movie attempts, and succeeds in a different way, to turn the dramas of two ""troublesome"" people into a romantic comedy.<br/><br/>Handsome, athletic, and confident, Pat (Bradley Cooper) manages to be released from a mentally ill hospital where he remained for eight months after beating his wife's lover and still has a restraining order from her. Diagnosed as bipolar, he returns to his parents' home under the responsibility of his mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver).<br/><br/>The boy's father, Pat Sr., masterfully portrayed by Robert De Niro, also cannot be considered completely sane: stuck in a restaurant project, but unemployed, lives on bookmaking mainly football games, having an irrational passion for Philadelphia Eagles team, which is why he was banned from the stadium for fighting. Standing in front of the TV, he is convinced that a series of superstitious rituals can alter the outcome of the games.<br/><br/>The entry of Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence, fantastic), a young widow who lives in the neighborhood, represents a balance in the plot not because she is understanding and welcoming Pat, but precisely because she seems to be as crazy as he is. During a discussion, they pass in front of a restaurant and, seeing the sign Dines, he invites the girl:
<ul><li>Do you want to have dinner with me? - and she, with a face of hate, responds:</li><li>Pick me up at seven-thirty.</li></ul><br/><br/>Together, they comment on the effects of the various anti-anxiety and antipsychotics meds, and indulge in a ballroom dance project, which will be the movie's great climax: they will try to win a good position and still defend Pat Miller's ultimate bet."

","--This movie has some genuine, touching, human moments, but they are few and far between. They mostly don't happen due to the movie's biggest letdown, which is its poorly written dialogue. It constantly tries to explain the plot directly to the viewer in the form of characters spewing exposition. This is because the characters aren't talking between themselves, they're talking to the viewer. And their choices of topics often feel unnatural and simply serve to further the plot. It's the sort of thing which will keep breaking suspension of disbelief if you notice it.<br/><br/>--Another problem is the way it handles its dramatic build-up. It seems to recognize where the buildup should occur, but the buildup itself, much like the dialogue, feels formulaic and hollow. As a result, it doesn't do a very good job of getting you excited for the story's payoffs.<br/><br/>--I like the directing idea of using the off-the-shoulder camera with close angles during various tense scenes in the first half of the movie, to try and relay the protagonist's anxiety to the viewer. The concept is very good and offers some nice shots which explain the mood of the scenes well, often without even showing the actor's face. But it in other scenes it feels unpolished, as if done without a clear sense of purpose. This is especially problematic when the movie has some very classical romantic comedy directing towards the end, which feels polished and slightly like the heart of the movie had already left the stage.<br/><br/>--All in all, this isn't a run-of-the-mill rom-com which is encouraging, but it lacks organic writing and a single design philosophy. These flaws leave it feeling rather bland despite some cool and honest moments."

","Absolutely fantastic. Way back when the book first came out, I picked it up, and liked it. I watched the movie when that came out, and I liked it less, I felt like there was a lot of the magic that wasn't captured in the film. I haven't read the book since watching its adaptation, and maybe that's a good thing. Rewatching it five years later, it was ridiculously good, and I think I enjoyed it more when I wasn't tethered to how the book was, and I was just free to judge the movie on it's own merits. While I haven't read the book since 2010 or so, it's its own beast, and I feel they should be judged separately, in a vacuum. The book is much more about Pat and his development, especially in the first half, and how Tiffany eventually helps him with his development. The movie is more about Tiffany and Pat together, and how their relationship develops.

"Marc_Israel_365","8","1","2","12 September 2017"," The Laws of Attraction
","Director David O. Russell brings us a movie about the laws of attraction and tells us as much about those folks who fight the forces of nature as those whose gravitational pull is strong enough to bring others into their world. The variety of characters fighting societal trends spreads outside our little circle of two, each fighting their own forced separation from their former spouses. It is blunt and sweet, it is both frustrating and rewarding, and all the time we know that we are watching a formula romantic comedy.... and we don't fight it!<br/><br/>Bradley Coopers' bi-polar ""Pat"" is overly hopeful, blunt, romantically triggered, and is overly everything in all he does which is hard to take at times. Much like bi-polar patients. They drain your energy when you fight their logic and emotions, even though the reaction to solve issues is healthy. We begin to see that we all have issues that need too be addressed, and as a believer in self-help, I backed off my annoyance of Pat.<br/><br/>Pat meets Jennifer Lawrence's personality disorder affected ""Tiffany""and fights his immediate attraction due to what he (and society) tells him he should be focused on. He/we judge and repel, despite our attraction. I mean, who isn't attracted by Jennifer Lawrence?<br/><br/>It is Tiffany's (out of) control of her personal issues that leads our story directions t in Philly during football season. There is certain pop-culture pulling us along and rewarding us, but the biggest complaint from others regarding ""Pat"" keeping it together as the plot boils misses a realism of mentally imbalanced folks integrated into their families and neighborhood's that their illness can sometimes appear to be in remission. An alcoholic is not always drunk, a bigot isn't always wearing a white hood and a patients' illness is not always being publicly aired.<br/><br/>The last point that led others to recommend ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is that the bluntness and honesty on display were comedic but welcome in todays' land of socially muted folks more concerned with politically correctness than the reality we live in. Call it what it is, that's a part of the playbook that our couple shares that we relate to."

","""Silver Linings Playbook"" follows as Pat Solitano, Jr.'s (Bradley Cooper) return to his football-obsessed family following an eight month stint in a mental health facility for bipolar disorder. He 'meets cute' with Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence), who is dealing with her own mental issues following the death of her husband, and the rest of the film follows their developing relationship. Well-written and uniformly well-acted, the film (and presumably the source-material) does a fine job in superimposing a light-weight romantic comedy (which could have been lifted out of innumerable 30's musicals) over the complexities and difficulties of dealing with mental health. I have no immediate experience with bipolar disorder but I thought that Cooper's portrayal of an unstable man fixated on his ex-wife was excellent. DeNiro's superstitious football-bookie father was a great character (and proves that the legendary actor need not do any ""Dirty Grampa"" sequels to remain employed)."

","If, while watching ""Silver Linings Playbook"", you have previous experience with bipolar disease, then the film will likely speak to your heart. If, however, you are like me and really don't know anything about bipolar-ism, the humor in the movie will still keep you enjoying it throughout.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" sees Pat (Bradley Cooper), a diagnosed bi- polar sufferer, being released from a mental institution and trying to fit back into his family and society at large. This includes a father (Robert De Niro) who is a die-hard Eagles fan and is as superstitious as they come, a friend (John Ortiz) completely treading water in his marriage, and a mother (Jacki Weaver) who is always caught in the middle. It is only after Pat meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young widow battling multiple personal demons of her own, that he realizes the lengths he must go to in order to succeed in battling his illness.<br/><br/>At heart, this is a film about mental illness and its effects on everyday life. If you have experienced similar situations, the storyline will likely touch you on a very deep level. Yet, just the humor of some of the situations this crazy family puts itself in will easily be enough to keep your interest level high. The moral of the story is that we are all a little ""screwed up"" on some level, but we just need to find that ""silver lining"" to get through life. Whether those themes touch you a little bit or a lot, there is enough comedy to keep things from really bogging down.<br/><br/>Plus, even if all else fails for you in the viewing process, there is the appeal of watching the two beautiful leads. Lawrence is showcased in enough workout outfits and dance costumes to perk up males in the audience, while I hear the ladies like Mr. Cooper just a tad as well.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a solid movie, though not really an all-time classic. It does enough things right--like make you laugh a little, think a little, feel a little--to be solid and not boring in any way."

It's one of the most positive movies to come out in recent years. Maybe bit too unrealistic to be true at moments but who wouldn't wish that.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper comes in a total new avatar giving a strong and matter-of-fact performance. The authenticity he shows makes him really likable as his character is honest to the point of being rude. About Jennifer Lawrence well I wasn't sure earlier if she should have won Oscar but after this re-watch on a Saturday morning I have become sure as hell. Her performance is magical and funny and honest. Guess humans really like people who are trying to fight to recover from a personal predicament. They give us motivation that each one of us needs daily. Jennifer has played one such character in this movie.<br/><br/>Side characters played by Robert Deniro and Jackie Weaver blend naturally to the canvas of the movie and lends it a family feel. They make you feel a part of the family and show that by being together family being together people can overcome any obstacles.<br/><br/>To me this remains one of the most uplifting movies of all time. Though of course it's bit too sappy and unrealistic at some moments but I think that is required from time to time in our real and dreary lives. As his motto is 'Excelsior' which means 'Ever Upward' we all need to follow it and give a determined fight to whatever obstacle we face."

","This film is a quirky drama with an underlying comedic tone throughout starring Bradley Cooper as Pat Solatano and Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany. Having been released from a brief stay at a psychiatric institution Pat moves in with his Parents in Philadelphia and he is bent on becoming a better person and staying rehabilitated - his primary motivation being to reconnect with his estranged wife who has a restraining order against him. Pat is determined to stay positive and look for the silver linings in his life despite many obstacles he faces in the wake of being incarcerated for beating a man nearly to death whom Pat caught his wife cheating with. Of the challenges he faces, the biggest ones are internal. Being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, Pat experiences sudden changes in mood. The fact that he refuses to take his prescribed medication only serves to make the problem worse.<br/><br/>Pat is obsessed with winning back his wife and is chasing the carrot that everyone around him is certain he can't catch. Like Pat, everyone has their own problems, but believing that a happy ending is possible is the one thing we need to get what we want out of life and most of the time the main obstacle is ourselves. This is a driving theme throughout this film much akin to the film Good Will Hunting (Damon & Affleck, 1997) where we see a character that gets in his own way and doesn't see true happiness at first though it is right in front of him.<br/><br/>In Pat's quest for self-betterment and winning back his wife's heart he meets Tiffany, who he quickly learns is just as dysfunctional as he isif not more. This common thread initiates a friendship that allows them to help each other understand their issues and deal with them better. As time goes on we see the development of a crush that Tiffany has on Pat that does not appear to be reciprocated, yet a friendship has begun. Though an attraction exist on Pat's part, he must decide which relationship is an illusion and which one has the silver lining he is looking for.<br/><br/>Throughout the film we get acquainted with Pat's father, Pat Sr., and continue to get a deeper understanding of his love for the Philadelphia Eagles and his strong superstition. Pat Sr. is strongly convicted of the fact that his son is a good luck charm and consistently pressures Pat to watch the Eagles play under the guise of needing bonding time with his son. We see just how strong Pat Sr.'s superstition is when he begs Pat to watch the game with him at a time when Pat has a previous commitment with Tiffany, who is helping Pat become a more controlled person. Eventually, Pat Sr. learns that his superstition was an illusion and that even if had been real, he would have been lost a bet he hung his superstition on anyway.<br/><br/>This film shows us that we can be our own worst enemies. By believing that what we want is possible we can still end up with the result we want but a great deal of heartache can be avoided if we open our proverbial eyes and get out of our own way."

The Characters who suffer depression are not shown to be suffering the same symptoms of depression that people in reality suffer from. The Characters do not have great slumps in mood, feel like the world is against them and then isolate themselves from family.

It is a movie which shows parents who have anxiety and OCD and them trying to cope with their son who has bipolar disorder. Pat gets very angry and upset which is the part of his bipolar disorder, which shows a strong view of his mental illness. Pat denies his mental illness because people who may have a mental illness don't like other people knowing they have a mental disorder. His dad Pat has an obsessive compulsive disorder and usually moody from this disorder. I do don't believe that it didn't show enough mental illness in the public environment. There wasn't the full amount of illness being shown in the film overall. The mental illnesses wasn't being shown to its full potential, which is frustrating when you want to get an idea of what mental illnesses can do.

","Silver Linings Playbook tells the story of Pat (Bradley Cooper), a mental institution patient who has just gotten released and now has to re-enter society while avoiding the pitfalls that landed him in the institution in the first place. Enter Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a friend of a friend, who has also gone through her own problems and, like Pat, is still dealing with them. Throw in some quirky family members, an overarching goal in the form of a dance competition, some football, and you have Silver Linings Playbook.<br/><br/>Now, what makes this film work is the chemistry between Cooper and Lawrence and the sheer talent they bring to their roles. Jennifer Lawrence won an Oscar for her role and it shows. Tiffany is a brilliant mixture of varying characteristics. She's a bit manic, she's a bit of a goth, she has her bitchy moments, but beneath all of it you can see the cheerful and caring person she could be. Full of nuances and personality, she's a great character. Not that Cooper does any worse in his role. The film dedicates more time to Pat, him being the main character, and especially the first few scenes, when he's at his most vulnerable, are very effective in introducing his character and getting us to sympathize with him, while still providing some humour.<br/><br/>The story itself isn't overly complex or anything you haven't seen before, but it doesn't really need to be. Romantic comedies/dramas like this one are always more about the characters than plot, so I wasn't expecting anything more. And the story is decent, don't get me wrong. It allows for some nice character moments, some nice dialogue and it carries the movie to a satisfying conclusion. Could it have been better? Yes, but that's a nitpick. No film is perfect.<br/><br/>I'd easily recommend this to any fan of romantic comedies/dramas and to anyone who likes strong and layered characters."

David O Russell made this film for his son, who suffers from a mental illness, and he hopes to inspire everyone through telling this romantic and beautiful story.<br/><br/>This story is about a bipolar patient, Pat, who tries to adapt into his social life after spending 8-months in a mental institution. And he is determined to get back to his wife, Nikki, despite the restraining order authorized by the court. He tries different method to get in touch with his wife, but with disapproval and opposition from his family. In a coincident, he meets Tiffany, a young woman with mysterious mental and life problem of her own, in a dinner with his friend. Pat and Tiffany develop a strange friendship because of their similar illness.Tiffany offers to help Pat, only if Pat is willing to attend a dancing competition with her. And so they begin to see each other more during regular rehearsals. The whole story exacerbates into something far more serious, but very comedic. With fights, heartbreaks, doubts and reconcile, Pat finally lets Nikki go, and realizes that Tiffany has loved him since they met.<br/><br/>This was my second David O Russell's film, and the first was ""The Fighter"". He has a very unique style in film-making and screen writing. His films usually have both dramatic and comedic elements. For instance, the diner scene, in which Pat and Tiffany discuss why she loses her job. The scene turns from a funny yet strange scene, to a very serious and heartbreaking scene as Tiffany gets mad about Pat saying she is crazier than him, which also cause Pat's illusion to occur. Another characteristic of his film is that more emphasis is put on character development rather than plot development. Each of the character in the film has distinct changes in the film. Also, David likes to assemble a great ensemble cast and demands the actors to put in their 120% effort into their performance to help him tell stories in a humanistic way.<br/><br/>There were also 2 wonderful things in the film - Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. Cooper and Lawrence gave unforgettable performances in this film. Comedic timings were great, and emotional scenes were powerful. I love their chemistry in the diner scene and the fight on the street, their facial expressions and emotions were very natural. And also during the dancing competition, especially how Lawrence played Tiffany's complicated feeling towards Pat. Tiff enjoys dancing with Pat a lot, and think it is romantic, but trying to conceal her affection towards Pat because Nikki is present. These little bits of reaction and expressions did not come to my mind during the first time I watched the film, so I was quite unhappy about the result at the Oscars that year because other nominees gave powerful performances as well. But after watching the film again and again, and falling in love with the characters and the actors. I begin to think that Jennifer Lawrence's performance is award worthy. Her performance is not like other Oscar winning performances, such as with loads of crying, break-downs, and scolding, but this does not mean that her performance is not Oscar- worthy.<br/><br/>Except these, the film also meant quite a lot to me. Throughout the story, Pat's mind is only filled with ""Nikki, Nikki and Nikki"". Everything he is doing is an attempt to get back to Nikki. His love towards Nikki is undeniable, he really loves Nikki with his heart and soul. This is why he cannot see how much Tiffany has done for him, he cannot see that Nikki does not love him anymore and he does not see those signs. Sometimes, we would be like Pat, we are too focused on something, and we completely ignored the things that are happening around us. Maybe we would also lose our mind and go completely irrational because of one person. But sometimes we would also be like Tiffany, we give so much and we forget about our own needs, and we lose ourselves in the process of giving too much. Would it be great that everyone can pay attention to the signs? And would it be great that people do not get moody and sad because they want others to know that they have certain expectations from them? Of course it is impossible to avoid these things, but it is possible to get over these things. True friendship or true love is not calculated by how much we have given or sacrificed, but can be by how two people positively influence each other during this relationship.<br/><br/>A beautifully romantic-comedy-drama film, with wonderfully written characters, funny lines, meaningful storyline and 2 young actors giving great performances — if it's me reading the signs, these are the descriptions of ""Silver Linings Playbook""."
"Buddy-51","8","1","2","8 March 2014"," A breakthrough performance for Bradley Cooper
","Dramatizing mental illness has always been a tricky proposition for the movies. How often have we seen such attempts devolve into either freak show comedy or horror movie madness? ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is one of the few to get it right. It's not that writer/director David O. Russell doesn't see the humor in the situations he's depicting - there are some very funny scenes in the movie - it's that he sees humor as just one small aspect of what turns out to be a far more complex and multi- layered condition.<br/><br/>In a tour-de-force performance that finally put him on the map as an actor of extraordinary talent, Bradley Cooper plays Pat, a young man who suffers from a severe case of Bi-Polar Disorder, so severe that Pat has been spending the past few months since the dissolution of his marriage in an institution. But Pat has chosen to move back in with his parents, who work hard at trying to understand Pat's condition and to cope with his often bizarre and incomprehensible behavior. While he nurtures the fantasy that he will one day reunite with his estranged wife, Pat meets Tiffany, a local girl who seems to have as many issues as he does when it comes to functioning in the real world.<br/><br/>""Silver Linings Playbook"" makes the not entirely novel case that all of us suffer from our share of personal quirks and idiosyncrasies - Pat's dad's superstitious obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles isn't too many steps away from the irrational concerns that dictate Pat's life - but that BPD just ratchets them up to a much higher level. The screenplay, which was adapted from the Matthew Quick novel, goes from the comical to the serious to the heartbreaking to the romantic without any noticeable grinding of tonal gears. Ditto for the nearly perfect ensemble cast which includes Robert De Niro as Pat's father, Jacki Weaver as his mom, and Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany, who won a Best Actress Oscar for her work.<br/><br/>But it is Cooper who makes the movie his own. There is scarcely a moment when he does not appear on screen and the actor casts a spell over the audience from first frame to last. He avoids the role-given temptation to chew the scenery, opting instead for understatement in his portrayal of a man whose desire to fit into the world is often at odds with his ability to do so. The result is a performance that elicits both laughter and tears from the audience, but which never feels contrived or manipulative while doing so. He draws us so deeply into the core of the character that we even accept his potentially trite belief that one must look for the silver lining in even the darkest of clouds since, when you think about it, what alternative does one really have? It's a career- defining performance for an actor clearly concerned with making the most of his time in the spotlight."
"iamggn","Null","1","2","8 March 2014"," 'LOVELY' is the word for it.
","The movie is exquisite. It demonstrates about what happens when a mad man meets a mad woman. The story is about a man who gets back to his previous life after a stint in a mental institution and wishes to have a new beginning. <br/><br/>The plot is totally worth admiration. There are scenes which make you laugh, there are those ones which make you cry, and above all, throughout the movie, you are absolutely contented. Both leads, in spite of not being very much experienced have delivered unbelievably dazzling performances. The movie possesses a normal pace, filled with all the necessary drama and an ideal conclusion. <br/><br/>They assuredly couldn't have assembled a better cast. No wonder both the leading stars got nominated at the Academy Awards for 'Best Actor/Actress In A Leading Role' category. Bradley Cooper, who was the male lead, was unarguably striking. He was definitely the most appropriate choice for the leading character. Jennifer Lawrence played the female lead and notwithstanding the fact that she had a lot lesser screen time than her co-star, she was stunningly spectacular. Robert De Niro in a vital supporting role was charming as ever. Other supporting characters enacted by Jacki Weaver, Chris Tucker and Anupam Kher too were creditable. Minor roles played by John Ortiz, Shea Wingham and Paul Herman were mediocre as well.<br/><br/>You can rarely find a flaw in the direction and screenplay. The screenplay particularly is in a class all by itself. David O. Russell yet another time after his globally acclaimed project 'The Fighter' has managed to win the audience's love. Editing and Cinematography departments are thoroughly appreciable. Music by Danny Elfman has been pleasant too. <br/><br/>Summarizing everything, the movie has turned out to be one of the most delectable flicks I have ever come across. It is silly, it is hysterical, it is fine and dandy and most importantly, it is beautiful. People who take pleasure in watching romantic comedies are bound to fall in love with this one. Take out 2 hours from your busy lives and spend them in watching this one and you will cherish it, take my word for it."
"emmatails","7","1","2","7 March 2014"," Don't read the book first and you will have a fairly enjoyable time
","**SPOILER ALERT** I definitely approached this film with a lot of trepidation, especially since I did not enjoy David O. Russell's latest offering, American Hustle much. I'm happy to say that I enjoyed this film more than that one.<br/><br/>I read the book before I watched the movie, but I may as well have not. There were quite a few departures from the book which significantly took away from the suspense. For example, the reader did not know the reason as to why Pat went into the facility in the first place until about three-quarters of the way into the book and the length of time he was in the hospital was significantly longer in the book than in the movie. The film also skipped over the fact that Nicki had completely moved on from Pat, divorcing him almost straight after he entered the hospital and remarrying.<br/><br/>I've got to say that the film had a slow patch in the middle which ruined the steady pace that it had gathered until that point. It just became a sort of screaming match between all the different actors, making it difficult to stay engaged.<br/><br/>I felt the film focused too much on the relationship between Pat and Tiffany, missing out on interactions between Pat and his family, particularly his mother and brother, and also his friends, Ronnie & Veronica, which were great in the book. It also included the character of Danny far more than in the book. I didn't think that Bradley Cooper was spectacular and even Jennifer Lawrence wasn't amazing. As much as I liked DeNiro's performance, I felt it was a bit obviously a star-vehicle for him. The character had been padded out for him, while Melissa Leo's character faded more into the background, playing a much smaller role than in the novel (which was a shame, as she gave a really lovely performance).<br/><br/>Even though it has its flaws, the movie is actually pretty good as a stand-alone film, but not the most satisfying adaptation of the book."
"Thanos_Alfie","7","1","2","27 January 2014"," The meaning of true love...
","""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a nice movie and I liked it for many reasons but I have to say that I expected more from Bradley Cooper. This movie has to do with a teacher Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) who moves back in with his parents and he tries to regain his relationship with his ex-wife.<br/><br/>I liked in this movie very much the interpretation of Jennifer Lawrence and I believe that she deserved the Oscar for the Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role of 2013. I have to say that I expected more form Bradley Cooper and I believe that he did not give us the 100% of his acting. An another interpretation that I want to mention is Robert De Niro's which I found it just perfect."
"petarmatic","6","1","2","7 January 2014"," I liked it!
","I liked this film, but I do not think it deserves all the awards it was given.<br/><br/>Acting is excellent, what a cast! Dialogue is fast and dynamic! I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>This film shows well psychiatric illness. It is all too common in your and my neighborhood. Do pills help? In some cases they do.<br/><br/>And why is he running around the neighborhood with a plastic bag on the top of his body? I guess he is crazy! And she was a slut and she is not anymore? Give me a break! If you have someone crazy in your family this is a film for you!"
"robert-bowling01","6","1","2","2 January 2014"," Predictable
","This is your everyday love story. The movie starts out with a guy (Bradley Cooper) in love with his 'wife' and trying to everything in his power to be back together with her. He is diagnosed with a mental illness with he finds his wife cheating on him with another man. Then things go downhill for the marriage... blah blah blah sappy love story. He meets Jennifer Lawrence and she 'tries' to help him get back together. They fall in love. Typical love story here. It was a decent story behind it all, but all of it seemed so predictable. You could essentially tell the whole movie from after 30 or so minutes. I wish they would throw some curve balls in these types of movies. The only decent thing in the movie is the acting and Bradley Cooper almost brought that down with his dancing. Overall I gave it a 6/10."
"carlrhussey","9","1","2","26 December 2013"," A film that mirrored my own life as a fellow Bipolar sufferer.
","Silver Linings Playbook I watched over the 2013 Christmas holiday period with my Dad, Mum and Brother at home on the Isle of Anglesey, Wales, UK. What can I say about this film, as a 37 year old sufferer of Bipolar Disorder, Type 1? (There are several different varieties of the condition, as it's very complex to diagnose and treat): <br/><br/>Really EXCELLENT, ENGAGING, THOUGHT-PROVOKING stuff! This film made me laugh and made me cry. I really loved it and the main character in the film playing 'Mr. Bipolar', mirrors my own experiences wonderfully! <br/><br/>Thank-you to all the cast and crew for such a great film, which I hope will break down the stigma, misunderstanding and suffering that still surrounds the condition. As a mental health activist and a person who is 'together and well' now after a rather rocky, yet deeply insightful roller-coaster ride, thank-you for such a great movie! I really do recommend it to fellow film-goers and especially Bipolars. Enjoy! :)"
"GouramiWatcher","7","1","2","12 December 2013"," Amazing Performances make up for the shortcomings of the story
","If you're looking for a movie that is both hilarious with a meaning, you've come to the right place. This film, starring Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper, centers around two bipolar friends, Tiffany Maxwell and Pat Solitano. Pat is desperate to get back with his estranged wife, Nikki, where Tiffany is widowed after her husband was killed in a traffic accident. They come to a deal where if Pat will join Tiffany in a dance competition, Tiffany will deliver Pat's letters to Nikki.<br/><br/>The movie is superbly acted, which gained Jennifer Lawrence an Oscar win at the age of 22, plus a nomination for Bradley Cooper and Robert DeNiro. The film itself received several other Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>What is great about Silver Linings is that it accurately portrays mental illness without offensive exaggerations that are far too frequent in other programs. The humor and drama are both well balanced.<br/><br/>My only problem with this movie is that I craved more from the plot. It seemed that there should have been more to the story than practicing for a dance competition and winning a bet. However, this issue is easily overlookable, as the actors give a flawless performance."
"ilania_a","8","1","2","11 December 2013"," Not Exactly a Silver Lining...
","But there is something there! The main actors: Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence (who is now riding the Hunger Games train), Jacki Weaver, and Robert De Niro; each gave a good performance! However, I think that had it been Julia Styles as Tiffany, perhaps the film would have been enhanced; definitely the dance part would have been much better (Save the Last Dance 2001). I know that Bradley Cooper is the current idol, but De Niro takes the cake â€“ he held the movie for me. <br/><br/>I like the idea that Ballroom dancing was used as the antidote and healing process, and to get people closer too. It may be different from the book, but the message is clear to me. Too many people are classed as bipolar and institutionalized, more so than people who are on drugs or alcohol and really need the hospitalization. Physical activity such as jogging, walking and above all dancing which provides social inter- change is better. The music was not that great, the dance choreography not the most interesting, but I guess it was the maximum that these two actors could master. I gave it an 8 because of some of the actors."
"MMAsonA","9","1","2","8 December 2013"," An amazing cast with great characters creates an unforgettable experience deserving of an Oscar nomination
","Silver Linings Playbook is one of the best romantic comedies I have ever seen. I believe that this is due to the cast delivering excellent performances along with the obvious sense of great chemistry between them all. I expected this to be very predictable, as most romantic comedies are, but it was the exact opposite! I had no idea what would happen until it was happening right before my very eyes. David O. Russell did an excellent job of not exaggerating the mental health aspect of the characters, while still making those features prominent. Jennifer Lawrence's performance was outstanding, and very deserving of the Oscar she received for it! Her being beautiful doesn't hurt, either! I loved Bradley Cooper in Limitless and him performance in this movie reminded me why he is one of my favorite actors. Jennifer and Bradley have an amazing chemistry that allowed them to seem real to the viewer, you actually connect with these characters. This movie is an emotional roller coaster with the love triangles and the mental illnesses but somehow this amazing cast has managed to make it all work and make it all believable! Robert De Niro gives a very heartwarming feeling to viewers as he plays the father of Bradley's character Pat, who suffers for a mental illness due to a traumatic event. He is a very superstitious man that wants nothing more than to watch the football game with his son. Bradley did an excellent job of showing viewers that he will always love his family, although it may not seem like it at times. The twist at the end was such a shocker, and that is rare because normally I can call a twist before it happens in a film. I love that I couldn't pin this one down because it make it that much better when it finally happened! Another big part of the film is the soundtrack, as a good part of the film is based on dancing. The soundtrack was not a let down but wasn't the best I have ever seen. I feel that it fit the movie well without adding much. One exception to this was the song Girl From The North Country by Bob Dylan & Johnny Cash, which was used in a very touching part of the film. The only bad part of this movie is when the credits come rolling."

","Pat is discharged from a clinic where he was treated against nerve disease. He reached this status after he found his wife cheating on him and then left. He moves with his parents but he is obsessed with the idea of regain Nikki. His old friends have established families and his father is always upset that his favorite team lose match after match. Neither the doctor who treats him and to witch is going for therapy sessions does not understand him and says that adultery is a better alternative healing. Everything changes when Pat meets Tiffany, a young widow who lost his job because she slept with all of her colleagues after her husband's death that caused him severe depression. Mental disorders who faced the two make them approaches one another and develop strong feelings of love for each other. Tiffany offers to help him get over this difficult time in his life by signing him to a dance competition and have to take dance lessons with her and keep it secret. At the same time he promised his father he would be at a big game but as he can not be in two places at the same time, disappoints Tiffany and so she reaches into his parents house where there is a large and important bet for Pat father and the two will be involved in it to help him win.<br/><br/>The movie is good with a few exceptions. OK we already know that love solve them all but if the director would have used this to make the two heal and not to remain together I think it would have been more interesting. One last thing Pat behaves like a true crazy man along in the film with screams and crisis but near the final he is recovered miraculously and become a normal person."

"ThurstonHunger","7","1","2","6 July 2013"," Rethinking my own restraining order...
","Honestly, this sat at home for a while as I thought my wife had got the Sandra Bullock mainstream football movie. So the pleasant surprise in finally watching it and realizing my initial mistake gave this an extra boost.<br/><br/>It's a bit different than the typical dysfunctional family drama. In that the leads are aware of their dysfunction and trying with great effort to overcome. It's also different in that it strives to address a serious topic (listen to some of the David O. Kelley recounting of his son's illness on the DVD) but ultimately this is a comedy I feel.<br/><br/>In fact, I'd bet Kelley prides the Hollywood normalcy that the story takes, granted with a circuitous rout at times to find. You won't love this film as much as Kelley loves his son, but still it's worth a watch (I wish my wife could have pushed past some of the rough aspects of the beginning, but alas no...) The key is having these atypical leading characters, sure the ""chase the wrong one"" love story is hackneyed, but here Cooper's character is easily seen as chasing himself and how things were before the incident, rather than really chasing his estranged wife.<br/><br/>There are many precious moments, and DeNiro find a nice supporting role to act up a storm in (too bad they didn't edit out the lines that hamfistedly state the obvious coping strategy and illness that he as the father suffers). But Cooper carries the show (and I thought Chris Tucker shined in his small moments as well). Something about their enthusiastic energy that can be alarmingly charming, but springs forth from darker sources was fascinating. Perhaps no surprise they rose in entertainment as comedians, a career that also feeds off shock and odd angles.<br/><br/>The tone of the film is so accepting, it avoids the crass elements. But doesn't sugarcoat the sour slips. We've all said inappropriate things at times, but as Lawrence's character tells Cooper's, we typically don't say more inappropriate things than appropriate. Thanks to the disease of the film, and the ease of the actors in conveying it, this never feels like an FM shock jock reaching for provocation, just the lack of an emotional and empathetic editor in the consciousness of the two leads.<br/><br/>Anyways, if like me, you want a restraining order for the big commercial successes, I think you can have it lifted for this one."
"jake-law123","8","1","2","5 May 2013"," Was a lot better than I thought.
","Did not know too much about this film before I saw it, and I honestly didn't hear too many good things about it. Aside from the critical acclaim from all the hot critics, and the Oscars, people I knew said it was kind of pretentious. While I'll admit it is that a little bit, I enjoyed the heck out of this film. The story is very interesting, and stays focused throughout, and the performances by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are amazing.<br/><br/>Pat, (Bradley Cooper) leaves an institution eight months after being diagnosed bipolar, and when he nearly beat his wife's lover to death. Now free, he moves in with his parents, (Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver) and attempts to get his life in order, trying to get in contact with his wife Nikki, (Brea Bree) who has filed a restraining order against him. His life takes a drastic turn when he develops a friendship with his good friend's sister-in-law Tiffany, (Jennifer Lawrence) who has similar medical problems as him, after her husband died.<br/><br/>Cooper's bipolar character, while being very crazy and psychotic, (shown in several scenes) makes you feel very sorry for him, and you want to see him get better. Despite what happens, I always felt for him, and cared about him. The same goes with his parents, who are worried about their son's well being, and his good friend Danny, (Chris Tucker) who has troubles leaving the institution.<br/><br/>The performances are very amazing. Jennifer Lawrence, while being a psychotic nut, also has a lot of emotional scenes that you reach out to, as you learn of her past.<br/><br/>The story always manages to keep you focused on what's going on, and never leaves anybody behind. The film itself is very fast-paced and quickly edited, but it slows down when it calls for an important scene. It never gets slow though, every scene is either emotionally charming, or dramatically intense.<br/><br/>When people called this pretentious, I sort of saw what they meant, but not that much. Like I guess at the end when she sees him talking to his wife, and automatically assumes he's with her. Then he chases her, revealing that a note supposedly given to him by his wife was written by her, and that he's loved her since the day he met her, and they fall in love. I suppose that was a little pretentious, but it's not that noticeable. You don't focus on whats all ready been done. You just focus on how it all works out in this film. He loves her because they have similar problems, and they connect perfectly. You find out that he is okay without his wife, and he wants her. Nothing is really wrong with that, but at the same time, they could have done it with a little more creatively, but it's whatever. It's still beautifully written. Even though some dialogue is just thrown in for the sake of keeping the pace of the film, there were some scenes where I was literally getting goosebumps by how funny or clever the dialogue was. The film's comic parts can get really funny, just on how goofy and needlessly intense they are.<br/><br/>So aside from a couple of pretentious plots, this film was so good. I enjoyed it from beginning to end, and I would definitely see it again, not only because I laughed and was amazed by it, but also to see that Jennifer Lawrence booty shake in that dance scene...mmmmm."

","I can honestly say that Silver Linings Playbook has earned the right to be called one of the best movies of the year. In a long time even. Not only is it truthful and unforgiving, but it reveals the truth in such a humorous heartwarming way, that you are not even aware that you are getting the truth shoved right down your throat. Jennifer Lawrence gives a riveting magnetic performance, filled with powerful and unforgettable moments. After watching The Hangover, I wasn't expecting Bradley Cooper to give such an amazing openhearted performance. It was really a surprise. Robert DeNiro was fantastic as usual. Jacki Weaver did a fantastic job playing a mom who didn't have many lines or a big wow moment, but she stole attention from her scenes by just standing there. The performances, the story, and just everything was incredible. Really truly a must see movie."
"ciera-larose","9","1","2","22 April 2013"," We essentially join Pat on a road to recovery of sorts, a process made even more difficult by the introduction of Tiffany.
","""Silver Linings Playbook"" follows the life of Pat, once he moves back into his parents' house after being released into their care following a court ordered stay in a mental institution. We soon find out that Pat was sent to the institution because of a violent incident that almost killed a man, upon seeing his wife with another man. We essentially join Pat on a road to recovery of sorts. Throughout the film we watch him struggle to get his life back on track, a process made even more difficult by the introduction of Tiffany.<br/><br/>This is a film that manages to tackle several heavy, serious issues while maintaining a light hearted feel. This story addresses bipolar disorders, depression, O.C.D, and adultery but it still manages to remain heart warming and actually quite funny. The story seems very relatable, I mean we all go through that one emotional, traumatic break up that seems impossible to get over. So we can relate to Pat and his struggle to snap out of it. Throughout all of the beautiful chaos that this movie exhibits, we are still sent a beautiful message about staying positive and determined and finding life's silver linings.<br/><br/>I think that the cast really helped make his movie shine. Robert DeNiro and Jackie Weaver played Pats parents and both performed wonderfully. DeNiro portrayed a man obsessed with his Philadelphia Eagles and his strange superstitions. He was very stubborn and stuck in his ways. Ms. Weaver portrayed Dolores, a quiet submissive wife and mother; who was very easy to influence and really just seemed obsessed with making her family happy. Chris Tucker delivered a surprising performance. He played Pats best friend Danny from the institution. I was happy to see that he switched it up for once. He played a very mellow character that was quite witty and funny without being over the top.<br/><br/>However, the actors that I think really brought the picture home were Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. Lawrence was every depressed and dark in the beginning of the film but gradually began to open up and reveal her softer side. Eventually we got to see all of her quirky, spunky personality. She was really funny and beyond entertaining. I found myself really rooting for her. I was quite impressed with her portrayal of this character especially because this was a very adult role with a lot of grown up issues. It's nice to see her step away from her usual teen type ""franchise"" roles like those in X-Men and The Hunger Games. Bradley Cooper on the other hand, was just absolutely breath taking. He portrayed a very intense character and his emotional delivery was just bang on. He was just magnetic; I was whole heatedly rooting for him to find love and happiness. I think that this is by far his most serious and most mature role (and the same sentiment goes for Jennifer Lawrence). I was happy to see him take a step away from his usual roles as well. I firmly stand behind the statement that this is some of his best work as of late.<br/><br/>To conclude, I think that this is an absolutely excellent movie that truly does combine the very best aspects of a comedy, drama and romance films. It's full of witty humor, sharp and very direct dialogue; not to mention a multitude of life lessons about love, determination and self improvement. This movie really captures your attention and leaves you smiling on the edge of your seat the whole time. I highly recommend this movie because I believe that everyone could learn a little something from Tiffany, Pat and their friends and family about life and its silver linings."

","This really is a great movie- a tour de force by Jennifer Lawrence, who has exploded out of the gate (meatiest woman's role since Mulholland Drive), but Cooper is brilliant too, even DeNiro and Tucker are good, whom I usually find tiring- DeNiro is the most human I've ever seen him as a neurotic superstitious compulsive bookie who has passed on his problems to his son (like Claire's dad in ""Homeland""), and finally makes one forget the Good Fellas' scumbags; + Tucker doesn't do that gay scream. America's mistreatment of men is manifest- you get sent to loony bin for beating up some guy ravishing your wife in your shower??? Russell truly deserved an Oscar too for writing or directing this very smart, wordy, brilliant script. But it is crazy slutty tough tender erotic glib wounded gamin JL (her cop husband has been killed), who shines in every scene. I didn't want to see a movie about manic-depressive or OCD ""nuts"", my father was the latter, but Cooper and Lawrence are so funny and entertaining, and really admirable, AND Russell slickly tapers down the harrowing wildness (suspiciously so in Lawrence's case- she ain't taking meds?) till you love these people. She obviously was a real dancer (if that wasn't body doubles), and has the rubber physicality and athleticism (like say Jessica Alba) previously evident in Hunger Games, that is very sexy and allows her to morph into different characters and moods.<br/><br/>The ending is surprising and really wonderful, and the entire cast, from the lip-biting worried mother, to the stolid brah, to the dubiously patient parole cop, to the football-mad Indian shrink are tremendously likable and appealing. Check this out- for woman it is really romantic; for men it is has sports arcana galore and JL; for business it has the power of positive thinking; for families it displays the infinite value of true loyalty, love, and support; for film buffs it is a superbly crafted and inspirational tale."

","Finding myself in the mood to watch a Rom-Com for the first time in ages,I decided to take some advice from a very helpful IMDb'er,and change my viewing plans of the 2012 Best Picture nominated titles,so that I could hopefully spend the weekend finding the silver lining,in a rather special looking play book<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Picked up by his mother from a mental hospital where he has been receiving treatment for his bi-polar disorder over the last 8 months, Patrick ""Pat Jr."" Solitano begins attempting to restart relationships with his friends and family,with Patricks dad,""Pat Sr"" wanting his son to be around him as much as possible,due to quickly discovering that Patrick is a ""lucky charm"" for the sports events that his father is an illegal bookie on.<br/><br/>Cheerful over reuniting with his family,Patrick finds that he is unable to get rid of the deep desire that he has to become reunited with his now ex-wife Nikki,who along with separating from Patrick,has also put a restraining order on Solitano,due to finding it impossible to handle Patrick's Bi-Polar disorder any longer.Ignoring his families demands that he should not contact Nikki again,Patrick begins to talk to a girl who has continued to catch him off-guard for a number of days whilst jogging called Tiffany Maxwell.<br/><br/>Talking to Tiffany,Solitano rushes home to write a letter to Nikki straight away,when Maxwell tells Patrick that she will have the opportunity to meet his ex-wife in a few days time.Visiting Tiffany the next day with the letter in hand,Patrick is shocked when Maxwell tells Solitano that she has spent too much of her life being taken advantage of,and that if Patrick wants her to give Nikki the letter,than he must do something for her in exchange.Desperate for the letter to be delivered,Patrick tells Tiffany that he will do what ever she wants,although Solitano begins to have serious doubts,when Maxwell tells Patrick that she wants him to enter an up coming dance competition with her.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Taking a look at the IMDb trivia page,I was surprised to find out that this adaptation of Matthew Quick's novel had taken 5 years and 25 re- writes to reach the big screen,thanks to the excellent screenplay by writer/director David O. Russell perfectly balancing a mixture of Rom- Com and Drama that,along with impressively feeling extremely ""fresh"" also never becomes too heavy-handed or melodramatic.<br/><br/>Placing Patrick and Tiffany's relationship at the centre of the film,Russell gives the movie a warm folk music atmosphere by making all of the supporting characters plot threads ones that becoming connected to Solitano and Maxwell's relationship,which helps to create a strong feeling that each of their friends and families are involved in the tight binding of their relationship.<br/><br/>Using a ""floating"" camera to build a wonderful sense of the comedic and romantic scenes taking place in a ""natural"" world,Russell contrasts the earthy setting that he places the more comedic scenes against,by using stylish fast zoom shots to place the view right in the personal space of Patrick and Tiffany,which helps to allow the audience to feel the full pain and that Solitano has to experience's,as he tries to handle the worst aspects of his bi-polar disorder.<br/><br/>Backed by a soundtrack that features a smooth score by Danny Elfman and some prime cut songs such as the classic Girl From The North Country collaboration between Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash,the movie also has an extraordinary supporting cast that include Robert De Nero as Solitano bookie dad and a hilarious Anupam Kher as Patrick's US Football loving psychiatrist,Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence each give fabulous performances that connect on each part of the contrasting personality's that the characters have.<br/><br/>For her stunning performance in the movie, Lawrence shows Tiffany to be someone who is more than happy to speak her mind,but is also unable to pull the barrier's that she has put up for herself,in order not to get too personal with anyone,whilst the brilliant Bradley Cooper shows that although Patrick is more than happy to let people enter his personal space,Patrick is unable to openly express to his family and friends the desires he has,as well as the full pain that he suffers from the worst parts of his bi-polar disorder,which leads to this playbook being one that can be played again and again."

","Mental illness is no fun, making a film about such a topic is fraught with risk. Sanitise the condition and be accused of soft soaping or show it like it really is and wave goodbye to a mainstream audience.<br/><br/>Director David O. Russell has managed to find a delicate balance and tone, that for the most part works exceptionally well. A film about a serious mental condition but deceptively, not really about that at all Pat (Bradley Cooper) is suffering from a previously undiagnosed bipolar disorder. We meet him as he is released from hospital following a traumatic event, neatly essayed in flashback, to live with his parents as part of his release conditions.<br/><br/>His eternally optimistic mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver) is hopeful that everything will turn out well but is realistic about Pat's chances. Pat senior (De Niro), is less convinced but is pleased that is son is home and relies on him to bring luck to his beloved Philly Eagles. Games he must now watch from home, for reasons explained later.<br/><br/>Following a couple of false starts, Pat with optimistic catchphrases in place, is keen to win back his wife, restraining order not withstanding. He gradually starts to find a rhythm and balance to his life and is greatly aided by a relationship he strikes up with Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence). Tiffany has more than a few issues of her own to deal with and the pair eventually team up for an unlikely dance tournament. Subconsciously deciding that two ""crazies"" working together might be just enough to get through the day.<br/><br/>As Pat learns to cope with life outside, we follow their character arc through their relationship with Pat's family, friends and counsellor (Kher).<br/><br/>If this sounds all a bit heavy, you would be wrong. The first segment is perhaps a tough watch in parts but if you stay with the story, a gentle rom-com emerges which errs just this side of believable.<br/><br/>Sure, there are parts where some Hollywood movie magic has been sprinkled but without this lightening of the story, many might be put off, which would be a shame.<br/><br/>Cooper proves he can act without a Hangover and Lawrence again shows her range as she remorselessly powers into the Hollywood A-list. Here posting a spirited turn, just rewarded with a best actress Oscar award. De Niro and Weaver provide solid support with De Niro finally finding a role that at least partially uses his talents.<br/><br/>If nothing else, the story points to a universal truth, that the patients in the hospital are not the only ""crazy"" people around. Many of those close to Pat have problems of their own, they just cope a little better. Any film that attempts to make this subtle point is to be applauded and the screenplay, although uneven in parts, does a good job of making this both palatable and entertaining to a multiplex audience.<br/><br/>There is plenty to enjoy, whether your level of cynicism or life experience allows you to fall wholeheartedly for the story is up to you, there is a guilty pleasure to be enjoyed here for those that can.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>A well crafted and acted story, which manages to morph into a feel-good movie, without selling out or betraying the worthy underlying message.<br/><br/>Entertaining, thoughtful and for the majority of the running time, a story and characters you can root for and believe in.<br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/"

","Funny and excellent acting. Love Bradley cooper and Robert deniro. Hate Jennifer Lawrence's dull performance... One trick kind of horse. Bradley copper played a slightly bipolar ex teacher trying his hardest to win back his ex who he sadly lost due to his temper. Jennifer Lawrence plays a sex addict(surprise surprise) who's husband passed away. One day they have a chance meeting and... Well you can guess where it goes from there. A very unconventional, original and unique love story that provides a couple of laughs too. I would recommend it to any and all Bradley cooper, Robert DeNiro and romance/comedy fans. And it's not that I don't like Jennifer Lawrence, I don't have an opinion on her due to the fact that I don't personally know her, but her acting is tedious and quite frankly she's monotonous and tedious herself...

"jess_92","10","1","2","11 April 2013"," A lovable, rare find in realistic genre film.
","I love this film, directed by David O' Russell, in particularly because it casts the brilliant Jennifer Lawrence as the plain-spoken, cut-to-the-chase heroine, Tiffany. Bradley Cooper plays Pat, the person who's story the film is centered around. I don't usually like Bradley Cooper, I hated him in The Hangover, and I don't think many other films have done him much justice, but, in Silver Linings Playbook he seems to really engage with the persona of his character and gives a brilliant acting performance.<br/><br/>Pat is definitely not the hero of typical romantic comedies, the ones where the male character saves the day and they always live happily, this comedy is a little different with reference to the drama of the psychological aspects of the film. A family element is brought together by none other than Robert De Niro, who plays Pat's father brilliantly. The family has problems too, but have one thing in common, they are all obsessed with the Philadelphia Eagles, which football is seen as a sort of bonding time, but, there are some engaging emotional scenes between father and son. <br/><br/>Cooper and Lawrence's on-screen chemistry is so cool and the two are lovable together, constantly throwing insults, and they are not awkward with one another at any point, just brutally honest, this could have been a different story had any other actors or actresses taken their parts. Again, I think Silver Linings Playbook is enjoyable but sentimental, not at all cheesy, but an exemplary representation of a twenty-first century relationship. An exceptional film!"

","I have no idea how Jennifer Lawrence was when she played the heroine for a generation of Hunger Games obsessed teens. I do know, however, that she scored a massive touchdown in this film, Silver Lining's Playbook. I hope that she is taking her Oscar everywhere because boy did she deserve it. Hat's off to Mr. Bradley Cooper who I admittedly underestimated as your classic Hollywood pretty face. Bradley Cooper shines and delivers like no one else. The chemistry between Lawrence and Cooper sucks you in and you laugh the whole way through because you realize that these things could happen to anyone. Robert DeNiro is so genuine and so funny as the head of his household that sometimes you feel like an eavesdropper in their house and in their life as you go scene through scene. The question is, ""Are these two knuckleheads not all there?"" The answer is, ""Yes, they are a bit off and it's okay because they are honest and they stick to what matters most."" If you want to get fancy, the psychological portrayals are accurate and the in your face approach is refreshing especially if you were under the impression that a Pretty Womanesque Romcom was what you signed up for in the first place."

Where has Chris Tucker been and why isn't he in more movies? He is just pure awesomeness. Everyone in the movie does an excellent job. Cooper and Lawrence work very well together. Lawrence is so young but that girl can act. She can out act even some of the old timers out there. Why couldn't see play the Wicked Witch?

","SL Playbook is a beautiful film. The special effects are the script, the acting, the directing and editing and the soundtrack.It's just a great blend of cast, script and director. The stories of Pat and Jennifer's recent challenges unfolds in a poignantly gripping delivery. In 122 minutes, there are no false notes, just a brilliantly built crescendo of their struggles with life's challenges. There's everything we experience in our daily lives, tragedy, heartache, joy,struggles and growth. I see few films that reach inside and touch my emotions in a deeply visceral way...SLP did, and continues to. It reminds me that whatever challenges I face, there are others with like or greater challenges, and that I am not alone in my feelings and struggles.<br/><br/>The Academy Awards nominations offer the ability to shine a bright light on film that otherwise might be lost to flashier offerings. SLP's nominations highlight the many exceptional efforts in this film.<br/><br/>Anyone with a heart and soul for their fellow man and woman should see this film, on the big screen where possible. You could spend a lot of time looking for better ways to invest 122 minutes of your life, and do as well."

","You're always glad, when you find a intelligent comedy, after having watched too many idiotic, semi-idiotic and quarter-idiotic ones. But is it really a comedy? Many things go around under the surface of the heroes.<br/><br/>You've heard and seen much from Tracy/Hepburn, but Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are better. They can both explode any second and you can't say when they are happy or miserable, which makes them like something arriving from a thing called life.<br/><br/>The only thing which maybe degrades this a little are the almost slapstick scenes we have here with Robert De Niro. There's no need for it in this heavy drama."

","An amazing film, because of the high quality of the acting amidst the wavering quality of the screenplay. Also amazing that the subject matter doesn't normally appeal to me but I was easily hooked in for what turned out to be an absorbing 2 hours. There's not really any sex or violence but plenty of frank interchanges between the cast, usually loud and frantic; aggro abounds in this smart modern romantic comedy.<br/><br/>Volatile young man gets released from mental hospital back into community to recover still holding a candle for his cheating wife, finds plenty of aggro and a volatile young slut with a dead husband. And a pretty interesting relationship follows and develops. The acting by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence was marvellous, they're completely believable in their leading roles sparking off one another. They're so natural in all the important and trivial things you can even forget you're only watching a fiction film. Even old Noodles DeNiro himself can't spoil it, a great cast playing with a great script. That is, until the lead up to the climax when sadly notes of contrivance and conventionality are introduced almost on a coarser and cornier Dirty Dancing level; but then comes the glorious upbeat happy ending which is even referenced twice for double Positivity. And the production values were impeccable with deft camera-work at all times.<br/><br/>All's well that ends well. Well, what's wrong with that and why can't it happen more often nowadays?"
"Laakbaar","7","1","2","12 March 2013"," Bradley Cooper and a bunch of other people
","This movie was not a waste of money; however, nor did it bowl me over, as it did some reviewers here. It didn't move me. It didn't elate me. There were not that many laughs. I didn't particularly empathise with the characters. (But then I haven't read the book...) <br/><br/>The best part of the movie was Bradley Cooper, who played Pat Solatano Jr. The camera loves this man. <br/><br/>Like many leading men, Cooper does not have a huge acting range. He does his thing well, and doesn't mess with it. For example, in this movie his anger is central to the story, but the blowouts here were not shown with full emotional intensity. We don't see him truly lose it emotionally. <br/><br/>However, I feel that in this movie Cooper did push his range to the limit. He delivered a fairly convincing performance of what it's like for a very, very charming and attractive man to be afflicted with bipolar disorder.<br/><br/>I agree with everyone that Jennifer Lawrence's performance as the complex Tiffany character was surprising and quite good.<br/><br/>The situation and dialogue at the Solatano household seemed jumbled and sometimes a little forced, with people talking loudly and at the same time. I suppose it's realistic when portraying a volatile Italian-American family like this, but I found it difficult to follow at times. I was also thinking that this is one family I would not want to move in next door to me.<br/><br/>There were many detailed references to American football, bookmaking, and other aspects of American life that were sometimes difficult to follow (even for Americans, I suspect). <br/><br/>Jackie Weaver was good, but Robert de Niro didn't really deliver. I don't know whether it was the character or the actor though. I just wasn't moved. The scenes where he got close to Cooper felt uncomfortable, although perhaps that's what they were going for. It seems difficult to tell Pat Solatano Sr apart from Jack Byrnes.<br/><br/>I thought it was unrealistic that Pat Jr. would run into his therapist at a ball game, and that the therapist would later attend his dance performance. How many therapists would do that? The constant arrival of the same cop was also a little unrealistic.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie was a little too predictable and a little too slow for me.<br/><br/>Perhaps this review is overly negative. I wonder how much of my reaction is based on my discomfort about mental illness? Perhaps. It's a difficult subject to deal with without alienating the viewer."

","Why you shouldn't see it:<br/><br/>I've never been to Philadelphia. I hope to change that someday, because it is a city full of history, and I personally have a healthy appreciation for history and the way in which it shapes the world in which we live and the people who we become.<br/><br/>Before I confuse you, allow me to point out that Silver Linings Playbook is not a movie about history. But it is a movie set in Philadelphia. And while I've never been there, I have developed a healthy hatred for it. You may say that hatred is baseless, but I say you've never met someone from Philly. Or you're from Philly and lack proper perspective. Admittedly, nearly all of my interaction with Philadelphia and its residents has, to this point in my life, revolved around sports. But Philadelphia athletes do things like electrocute dogs (I will kindly ignore you as you point out he was an Atlanta athlete while he was electrocuting dogs, because we had the benefit of ignorance), and Philadelphia fans are widely acknowledged to be the worst in sports (unless you're from Philly then they're awesome).<br/><br/>You may be wondering why I should be suggesting that you not see a movie because it is set in a city you may or may not hate based almost solely on its relationship with sports. My response would be that Philly is a sports city, and it is defined in major part by its relationship with its sports. Accordingly, this movie, through its characterizations, very much relates to Philadelphia's relationships with its sports. So if you are like me and have a healthy distaste for Philadelphia, its people, or its sports, you may want to avoid watching this.<br/><br/>Why you should see it:<br/><br/>I said that Silver Linings isn't a movie about history, and that's true. Nor is it explicitly about Philadelphia. But it is a story about people who are the product of Philadelphia's history, and because of that, it couldn't be set anywhere else. Other films have settings that are merely the time and place in which the plot unfolds, but this is a plot that couldn't exist outside of its setting. The result is a story that is unique and compelling to me and yet all too familiar to many Philadelphians.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper has seemingly made a career of playing assholes in his movies, and that actually hasn't changed here. Maybe that's because he's an asshole in real life (you'll never guess the city from which he hails Philadelphia!). Anyway, in this movie it's almost as if his asshole personality is put back in its natural environment, and the result is a jerk you can pull for. I don't necessarily think he had to stretch his acting abilities all that far to appear in this, but he still does a fantastic job of portraying a man who is wholly unlike me but still completely relatable.<br/><br/>You can still get in on the ground floor of Jennifer Lawrence appreciation, since she's only been around for two years. But in those two years, she has two deserved best actress nominations (one of them here) and two roles in fan-pleasing box office genre movies. If she isn't on the fast track to becoming one of Hollywood's (much needed) leading ladies, I just don't know what to say. In Silver Linings, she plays a sort of mirror to Bradley's character, and likewise nails the jerk-for-whom-you-wish-good-things part (and yet she's from Kentucky go figure).<br/><br/>Aside from the two main characters, there are still a few other noteworthy members of the cast. It appears as though this was an opportunity jumped on by Robert DeNiro to get back to quality acting, and I have to say that I've never before been genuinely entertained by Chris Tucker until now. I won't say that they offer any sort of counterbalance or opposition to the off-kilter nature of Cooper or Lawrence, because they don't. Everyone in this film is off his or her rocker at least a little bit, and that's the point.<br/><br/>In short:<br/><br/>I spent the entirety of Silver Linings torn between wanting to know what happens next and still not wanting to see what happens next. The unorthodoxy of the two leads draws me in in a way that I haven't experienced in a while, and I appreciate the opportunity to care about such flawed individuals. I don't believe Cooper had to reach to play his character, but that doesn't diminish his portrayal at all, and Lawrence keeps step with him the entire time. In the end, I think nothing more than spite for the city of Philly made me leave the rating for this one at an 8 out of 10 instead of more, but I still recommend it for anyone who can enjoy a completely unusual romantic comedy. At least I think that's what it is... I don't know what other category it would fit into.<br/><br/>Exceptions to the recommendation: anyone with a jealous wife or girlfriend who might make assumptions about why you're watching Jennifer Lawrence in this movie; anyone with a jealous husband or boyfriend who might make assumptions about why you're watching Bradley Cooper in this movie; if you think dancing scenes are stupid and contrived when added into romantic comedies; people who would like to go on thinking that they're the ones with problems; anyone who can't handle awkwardness fueled by inappropriate comments; if you really do have a seething hatred for the City of Brotherly Love."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","2","3 March 2013"," All 4 acting Oscar nominations
","The last movie to have attracted all 4 Oscar nominations in acting was ""Reds"" (1981) - Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson, Maureen Stapleton. Only Stapleton won, in the Best Supporting Actress category. I am not trying to compare because I haven't see ""Reds"". Of the 4 nominations of SLP, there is again only one win: Jennifer Lawrence. But they are all good enough to. It's just a question of the competition.<br/><br/>Of the four characters, three suffer from mental disturbance of various degrees. Pat (Bradley Cooper) has just been discharged from a mental institution, 8 months after savagely beating up his wife Nikki's lover he found in a shower with her. Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a neighbor and friend-of-a-friend is a young widow who has been suffering from mental distress since losing her husband 3 years ago in a traffic accident. She sought release in having sex with 11 people (men and women) in the office. Being fired is just a minor detail and she has since stopped this compulsion. When Pat and Toffany are introduced to each other, it doesn't hit off well, at least on the surface. This is due not so much to their mental health problem as to the fact that they are both outspoken and quick to react. Their rapid cross-fire, unlike what you might expect, reflects logical common sense. The first time a common chord of harmony strikes is when they start comparing notes on the effect of an assortment of medications that they have both experienced at one time or another. Bingo: mutual empathy! Pat's mental condition is not hereditary, as his parent who vouched for his discharge and brought him home is a normal, loving couple. Well, maybe one small qualification: father Pat Sr. (Robert de Niro), a supporter of the Philadelphia Eagles with religious devotion, is banned from their stadium for fighting. Considerate, sensible mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver) seems to be the only normal person in the quartet. There is also a large, interesting support cast including relatives, friends, medical professionals, fellow patients and more. I am not going into detail here. They are all there to be seen in the movie.<br/><br/>The story is on how the two protagonists find each other through a journey of laughs and tears, and not a little craziness. It is also about how the loving parents are able to see the same silver lining the son sees and help him along the way. The specific plot line utilizes Pat's superficial eagerness to win back his estranged wife Nikki (against a minor inconvenience of a restraining order). While on the surface, Tiffany provides a bridge for Pat to reach Nikki, the ironic fact is that Nikki is the bridge through which Pat and Tiffany develop there relationship. You would have seen a lot of rom-com relationships starting with mutual animosity – in fact almost all of them do. There's no exception here, but you would be hard-pressed to find a pair with such excellent chemistry as Cooper and Lawrence.<br/><br/>There is a subplot which is also part of the main plot. Pat Sr. is heavily into betting and for some reason is superstitious that the Eagle's victory hinges on Pat being present at the game (he himself has been banned, remember?) On one fateful Sunday, Pat is torn between two commitments: the aforementioned Eagles game and an eleventh hour practice session for a dancing contest that he and Tiffany have entered. The plan of dividing the day into two halves is shattered when he gets into a brawl before the start of the game, thereby winding up in the police station rather than Tiffany's place. Coming home in a mess, he finds that the Eagles have lost and, together with that, father has lost everything. Then, in rushes Tiffany, yelling at him for breaking his commitment to her. This is one of the best scenes. While all hell seems to break loose, Tiffany turns disaster into a silver lining, a second chance for everybody. Even more important, reconciliation is effected and an affinity cemented between two of the most important three people in his life: Pat Sr. and Tiffany. The third, Dolores, has always been angelic and working silently in the background for everything good."

","Pat Solatano ( Bradley Cooper) is serving a mandatory eight month sentence in a mental institution. He feels he is now ready to leave and reclaim all that he has lost.his wife, his career, his home, his life. His mother Dolores (Australia's Jackie Weaver) has agreed to bring him home and as part of his release, he must live with his parents. His father Pat Sr (De Niro) is unaware of this agreement. It doesn't take long before we realise this is a family fractured by their son's mental illness. It is not an angry, bitter fracture but more a silent resignation of how things are.<br/><br/>Pat Sr is recently unemployed and is attempting to make enough money to start a new business via bookmaking. He bets mostly on the Philadelphia Eagles football team. The entire family are unswervingly loyal Eagles supporters and the rituals and superstitions that go hand in hand with this obsession. well let's just say that it is easy to see where Pat Jr may have inherited some of his ummm quirks.<br/><br/>Pat does not want to take his medication for bipolar disorder because he doesn't like the way it makes him feel. This causes some interesting moments, some amusing, some rather serious and as anyone who has lived with family or friends who are 'off their meds' can attest, it can go either way at any moment. One of his biggest goals is weight loss. It is never addressed exactly how much weight he has lost during his stint at the institution but as most people comment on how well he looks, one can assume it is rather significant. To this end, Pat runs every day wearing a full tracksuit and a black plastic garbage bag..the garbage makes him sweat thus hastening the weight loss.<br/><br/>It is during his daily runs that he is consistently 'ambushed' by Tiffany (Lawrence), a young woman he was introduced to by a friend at a recent dinner party. Their initial interactions are awkward and mildly hostile. Tiffany has issues of her own and she seems to instinctively know how to push Pat's buttons. The two form an almost unbearably uncomfortable relationship with the most basic of social interactions difficult for them. Yet it's good for both of them, this much is obvious and thus gives the fledgling relationship momentum.<br/><br/>Tiffany agrees to help Pat win back his wife and he in turn agrees to enter a local dance competition with her. The relationship changes and flourishes as the pair prepare for the competition.<br/><br/>This movie is touted as a dramatic comedy and there are some laughs but it is heavier on the drama. And this is a very good thing. The developing relationship between this emotionally damaged pair is lovely to watch. It did take me a little while to warm to this movie but in hindsight, this was possibly because it was very real.<br/><br/>The reality is that most of us are damaged in some way and just because you are not diagnosed or on medication is irrelevant. Too often in movies the dialogue between couples is fluid and clever and witty. This rarely happens in real life, despite what those dating website advertisements want us to believe. There are awkward pauses and confronting comments. The wrong things is said and reacted too. You try to be on your best behaviour but why should you have to be? Why should someone not accept you for who you are? And that is the secret to this movie.<br/><br/>It is about relationships that are not perfect between people who are not perfect. And that is okay. We learn to adjust and live with and love these non perfect people and if we are very lucky, they will love us right back. We can try and fix ourselves and try and fix those we love but when all the superficial stuff is gone, love is just love. Sometimes the one we love is not the one for us and we have to deal with that before we can see clearly. Most of us have been in this situation and can relate to the frustrations and pain that it causes. To lose the one you love, no matter how it happens, is painful. It's what you do next that is important.<br/><br/>Try and see this movie because it does live up to the hype and all the awards are richly deserved."
"MadEden","6","1","2","6 February 2013"," Read the Playbook. Don't Trust it.
","Welcome to the feel-good movie of the year. Probably.<br/><br/>Within its own confines, Silver Linings Playbook is a brilliant film. We can't criticize this movie, because it has already defended itself quite cleverly.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the film, we saw Pat (Bradley Cooper) throwing a Hemingway book out of the window at 3 am in the morning. Then he rushed down to his parents room and let out a rant about Hemingway and all the god-damned sadness in his novel. As he thinks, there is already too many miserable things in the world, so why can't Hemingway write a good ending to such a story? So now Silver Linings Playbook offers us a perfect ending to a good ending. The outstanding thing about this film that elevates it from many other mediocre romantic comedies is simply that, it works, much thanks to the performance of the entire cast. As far as acting goes, this is a much believable, and therefore much lovable, story.<br/><br/>The film progresses itself very well, though behind it we can still clearly see all the genre conventions pushing. There isn't too much new to this film. It simply did everything well.<br/><br/>All is left is a choice: would you believe it? Do you buy the story, even though you are more than well aware of it being no more than another delicately produced Hollywood dream? Would you let yourself to be fascinated for two hours, and then realize the fragility of this illusion? Many people do. Even most of the critics do. I didn't, but I hope you do. Knowing it's an artificial wonder, you might still be touched and moved; your heart might follow Pat's and Tiffany's every move, sincerely wishing that everything - everything, no matter how trivial - goes well for them. As characters they possess all the natural complexities and simplicities of people. They look real, genuine and they are adorable - not as characters, but as people.<br/><br/>There is Pat's rant on the stage, and David O. Russell's argument off it. A film version of the argument could very well be ""Why make Requiem for a Dream, when there is already so much despair? Why look at 'the horror, the horror, the horror', when there is already too much?"" Why not, simply, make a film like this? I didn't believe, because I couldn't. I think Russell's argument is flawed. It's a choice, between carefreely believing a wonderfully-crafted illusion for two hours and then watch it being broken and swept away by the torrents of life, and heavy-heartedly face cruel reality for two hours and then realize the precious happiness within our little lives."

","This was a funny movie experience for me. This movie takes on a very serious subject, and even though it is a serious movie, about bipolar people, and dealing with them, you also get to laugh and have some fun with them. The writing is so great, and you can tell that this story has personal experience with bipolar ism in the family. Great job! Both Jennifer Lawrence, Brad Cooper and Robert De Niro does a great job acting ways, and deserve the academy awards nomination that they have received, and i hope at least Bradley Cooper get's the award for best male actor. A great job! The story is so great also, and it's not a cliché love story that u might think when watching the trailer. A great movie! 9 out of 10 for me!"
"parallel_projection","8","1","2","3 February 2013"," A fascinating, witty romantic comedy with multiple layers
","I had heard so much hype about this movie that I finally caved in and went to see it. I have to say, for the most part, it lived up to my expectations, and even exceeded them in some cases. David O. Russell does a solid, and at times surprisingly inventive job at directing a story about a formally undiagnosed bipolar man trying to reconnect with his estranged wife while balancing a relationship with a younger girl who has problems of her own. He also wrote the screenplay, based off of the novel by Matthew Quick.<br/><br/>Although the story itself is not entirely original, the performances elevate to a much higher level, and they managed to consistently impress as the film played on. Jennifer Lawrence is captivatingly hysterical as Tiffany, the crazy girl next door who is attempting to deal with her husband's untimely death. She has many great one-liners and was able to display a fantastic range of emotions, but her performance was actually the only one that, to a certain degree, let me down. Don't get me wrong—she's amazing, but with all I had heard and with all the accolades she's been receiving, I expected her to be even better than she was.<br/><br/>The standout, for me, was Bradley Cooper, who was far better than I thought he could ever be as Pat Solitano, a man obsessed with impressing his wife after their relationship, somewhat traumatically, came to an end. His ability to switch quickly between numerous emotions— from anger to happiness to regret, and so on—was truly outstanding, and what I believe to be a pretty accurate portrayal of someone struggling with bipolar disorder. Additionally, his unrealistic belief that everything will work out well—in terms of his relationship with his wife, his parents, and Tiffany—provides a sort of comic irony as everything constantly spirals out of control.<br/><br/>That's not all, though. Robert De Niro was—finally—very good, and undeniably compelling, as the OCD, football-obsessed father who just wants his family to spend time together again. Also, Jacki Weaver does a fine job as the matriarch trying to hold her family together, and Chris Tucker provides comic relief, as if it were needed, as Pat's friend from the hospital. Rounding out the cast are Julia Stiles, John Ortiz, and Anupam Kher (who's actually pretty funny as Pat's psychiatrist).<br/><br/>At the end of it all, this film is a wild, comical, if not slightly predictable ride made all the more better by the fantastic chemistry between Cooper and Lawrence. While its main focus is on building and maintaining relationships, it provides glimpses into the thought processes of some completely irrational, oversensitive, and easily aggravated people, which at times can be stressful, and other times just downright hilarious. Because of this, it's definitely deeper and more complex than most romantic comedies, while at the same time remaining captivating and entertaining throughout. And really, if films are truly made to entertain us, then this more than succeeds on all accounts."
"theredraylives","10","1","2","26 January 2013"," Wonderfully engrossing and engaging
","David O. Russell's Silver Linings Playbook is the kind of film that dares you to invest yourself in it. It is smart, it is funny, and it is a romantic comedy with some serious issues. It is also categorically one of the most engrossing film experiences in recent memory, littered with fantastic performances and feeling, for every moment of its runtime, real. Russell's script doesn't want anyone in the audience wandering on its periphery; like it or not, everyone is going along for the ride, and no one should be disappointed by the end.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper stars as Pat, recently released from a mental hospital in Baltimore after eight months, coming home to live with his parents. He is diagnosed bi-polar, and upon his release is convinced that he's going to reunite with his estranged wife Nikki. Cooper is nominated for an Oscar for best actor, and it's easy to see why mere minutes into the film- he lives and breathes this character. Cooper completely disappears into the role, giving Pat's painful struggle with his illness and his attempts to cope with the world a vivid and uncompromising reality. His world is turned upside down, however, when he meets Tiffany (the mesmerizing Jennifer Lawrence), recently widowed and trying to find her own way in the world. <br/><br/>Lawrence is fresh off a Golden Globe win for her part and is also up for an Oscar, an award she may be poised to win on the strength, beauty, anger, and passion she imbues in her character. Already one of the most versatile actresses in this generation, she goes far beyond any of her prior work here. The chemistry between herself and Cooper is also absolutely white-hot, lending a tremendous dose of sexual tension to the entire film. The pain and bitterness beneath both characters is deeply seeded, but these two find one another at the perfect moment, when they most need one another, and every minute of their evolving feelings is deeply felt.<br/><br/>Despite the two fantastic leads, it is Robert DeNiro as Pat Sr. who absolutely steals the film, playing a character so tormented and emotionally realized that even the iconic De Niro is completely unrecognizable inside the character. This is easily his most memorable role in years. Jacki Weaver shines beside him as his wife and Pat's mother Dolores, and both of them are up for best supporting statues at the Oscars.<br/><br/>The brilliant performances are only a shade of why Silver Linings Playbook is one of the best pictures of the year, however. David O. Russell's script and direction take what might have been something far less interesting or engrossing and transforms it into a brutally tragic slice of reality, so beautifully realized in every single shot of the film. Russell puts the camera right in each actor's face, removing any semblance of choice for the audience to emotionally invest itself in these characters- every nuance between them explodes on the screen, allowing each already magnificent performance to transcend great and become truly extraordinary. Using the camera to so invest the audience in the film could have backfired, but with such incredible performances and a top-notch script it comes off brilliantly.<br/><br/>If anything is lacking it is a sense of actual tension in the love story between Cooper and Lawrence, since it becomes obvious early on that it isn't a matter of if they will get together, it is when. The script manages to overcome this somewhat with a story arc about his father betting on football, but the tension that creates is only minor and is equally predictable. Even knowing what is coming doesn't detract from the experience, however, because of how engaging and inviting the film is. This is a family absolutely riddled with problems, but they love one another, and there is a deep-seeded loyalty here that is as apparent as their love of the Philadelphia Eagles.<br/><br/>Little could be done or said that could have made Silver Linings Playbook a better film. It was predictably rom-com-ish in its presentation, despite its off-kilter characters, but this was never a detriment to the film. No matter the genre or the overtold patterns therein, any film that can showcase characters this fully realized is a magnificent one, and this film deserves every accolade being sent its way.<br/><br/>Check out my profile for links to my other reviews!"
"AvidClimber","9","1","2","22 January 2013"," Silver Linings Playbook — An emotional piece that makes it right for all of us to be a little crazy
","Silver Linings Playbook makes it right to have problems, mental problems. This is a big taboo in our society. We all have those kind of problems to one degree or an other. Even if the main characters have heavier symptoms to deal with, this is a way to show that it is acceptable.<br/><br/>At first, you'll be uncomfortable with Pat's unusual behavior, but it will immediately feel much better once Tiffany enters the scene. Even though his behavior doesn't change, once there's someone else like him, you feel immediately better. Why? Because it normalizes him. When we meet somebody like us, we immediately feel better, more acceptable, less worried what others think of us. We feel the same about others.<br/><br/>In this film, all the scenes, dialogs, and emotions are real and solid. The acting is superb and the story surprising on many occasions. This is definitively the best performance Bradley Cooper has given, and Jennifer Lawrence is his match on every level, we just don't spend as much time with her as with him. Robert De Niro plays a great character, and Chris Tucker fits right in. Everything is perfect.<br/><br/>This script even plays the ""lie"" right, and the final moment got me yearning for a girl to cuddle and love. It has been a while since a movie made me feel that. I just can't find anything wrong with it. If you want to pick something negative, I'd say that the professional dancers are not good actors. That's it.<br/><br/>The only reason not to watch it might be because you don't like that kind of story. It's about average people, with average surrounding, salary, homes, and lives. There's nothing marvelous, scintillating, or stupendous, just normal."
"herbqedi","7","1","2","21 January 2013"," Buffalo 66 re-set in Philadelphia with many more words
","Romantic? Definitely. Bizarre? Most definitely. Predictable ending? Sure. Comedy? Not the rollicking type, but in the classic sense of a non-tragedy with some amusing touches and incidents, it qualifies. Great acting? I'll take issue with consensus here - I thought Jennifer Lawrence was electric. I thought Bradley Cooper showed a bit too much physical self-control during his intense bi-polar episodes but was otherwise very good. DeNiro seemed to overlay his performance on Gazzara's in Buffalo 66. <br/><br/>Why do I compare this film to Buffalo 66? You have an off-center protagonist coming home post-confinement with unfinished business and a chip on his shoulder. You have a dancer with some emotional damage of her own as the lead female (albeit not held hostage) against a blue- collar backdrop of economic depression and local sports hysteria. <br/><br/>This film is less misanthropic than Buffalo 66 and has some brighter characters, making it a lot less dark overall - but many of the themes are similar - as is the unlikely romantic resolution.<br/><br/>One major difference - Buffalo 66 nailed Buffalo - felt like buffalo during the week I spent there. I spent 10 years in Philadelphia. First, I'm unclear whether this was supposed to take place in Italian South Philadelphia or Llanarch (a suburb just outside west Philly), but the roads where he ran seemed much too wide for either and the houses and front yards were much too wide as well. Parking was too spacious. They talk about the 76 (which everyone calls the Schuylkill - or various local take-offs - school-kill, sure-kill, etc.). It passes by South Philly, but nowhere near Llanarch (they show a Llanarch Diner). DeNiro and his betting ""friend"" seem right in character for South Philly. None of the other family members look or act the type particularly. Julia Stiles' character (sharp performance in a thankless role), family, and home with lawn seem more like Llanarch but the areas shown in most of the running sequences don't match. Then the Indian bus and the parking lot brawl seemed way too staged and forced. Unlikely that just getting off the bus - a bus they've seen before and had a friend of one of their group on it - would precipitate such a brawl. So, for those who trumpet how realistic this movie was, I found the depiction of Philly and its dysfunctional sports fanatics to be totally off. Invincible did a much better job of depicting these folk as they are. The story in Invincible was more credible also. I lived there during the Vince Papale years.<br/><br/>All that said, I generally wouldn't get so deep into a romantic comedy but this one is considered very special and ground-breaking in its characterizations. It is a good movie and does an acceptable job to me of characterizing one person with one manifestation of bi-polar disorder, his friends, and his sports-crazy dad for me to enjoy. I'd have been interested in learning a bit more about Lawrence's character's post-traumatic nymphomania and its treatment since this too can be a real dysfunction but that was glossed over and I only accepted it because of the fire in the belly Lawrence displayed. Her subtle traits and occasional physical ticks lent credibility to me.<br/><br/>So, overall, I enjoyed this somewhat Hollywood-ized and somewhat clichéd but still highly thoughtful and enjoyable movie. Certainly, I've found many less engaging ways to spend two hours in a movie theater in the past 10 years."

","What I Thought: Very enjoyable indeed. What I expected from the trailer didn't let me down in the full movie. The film is a romantic film but uses the subject of mental depression and issues to highlight how normal some of these people can be and that everyday things are just as important to them as they are to us. The relationship between all characters is one of understanding with the exception of the main two, who although suffer form similar problems, deal with them in completely different ways, but these differences bring them together in a quirky way.<br/><br/>The acting is superb here and the chemistry between Cooper and Lawrence is very believable and this is yet another genre of film she has tried her hand at and excelled in. There are a lot of strings to her bow and her nomination for Best Actress is completely warranted here. I thought the story was endearing, engaging and there are some really good funny dialogue moments in the film that seem completely inappropriate but fit the scenes perfectly. Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver who play the parents of Pat and suffer his small but meaningful outbursts at the oddest times of the day are brilliant and also get nomination nods here.<br/><br/>Conclusions: Nice story, brilliantly acted and directed and I think its very worthy of all of its nominations. I do fear however that it will fall at the last hurdle, but it has definitely sneaked up on the rest of the field and deservedly so. I recommend this film and have to give it an excellent mark."

","Before I go on to say what I thought of the movie, I must address that I went in to see this after I had read the book. If you are of that group this review may speak to you more than to others. If you have not read the book I highly recommend it to you all. <br/><br/>The movie was very good. The screenplay was very up to date with what a good movie should have. The pace of the movie and the mood of the movie was very up beat and would entertain today's audiences. I really like the adapted story. I would say it was an alternate to what I was expecting, but I was not disappointed at all. The performance given by Cooper and Lawrence was amazing and that is truly what made this movie a treat to watch.<br/><br/>Now I will contrast this a little with the book so for those who are going to see this will not be caught off guard. The story in the movie (other than for some major plot points) did not correspond with the book at all. The book had a much more serious tone to it. For example there was a grim veil around Pat in the book because in the book he is in a much more serious and mal-adaptive condition than in the movie. Along with many character adaptations, the story in the movie has 40% mutability with the story in the novel. <br/><br/>That being said, I recommend both the book and the novel VERY MUCH. The book is almost completely different and is a good story as well but a little more grim, which makes the silver lining all the more satisfying."

He goes ballistic and severely beats up the other man. Since you cannot legally beat up your wife's lover, criminal charges were filed. As part of that proceeding Pat is forced to be institutionalized and therapy thereafter.<br/><br/>He is pursued by Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who's husband recently died. She is clearly looking for companionship by sleeping with all of her co-workers as a way of obtaining human contact. In our society when a woman chooses to have a lot of sex, we decide that she has a mental problem, there's even a name for it. These two people are not mentally ill, they are both suffering from a broken heart. Pat has a panic attack when he hears his wedding song being played. This is not crazy but part of his withdrawal from the woman he loves.<br/><br/>I feel sorry for the woman who wrote a review and said that her son suffers from bi-polar disorder. She is correct that Pat and Tiffany are not behaving like crazy people. They are having withdrawal symptoms from past relationships.<br/><br/>When they come together as a couple at the end, you know that true love is not a cure for mental illness.

"rivertam26","10","3","12","28 November 2012"," The best film of the year!
","David Mamet blew me away with The Fighter. What looked like a generic sports drama from the trailers was really an intricate, overly entertaining, emotionally resonant character piece. I'm not sure how this came across in the trailers to me but there is no way it came across as brilliant there as the actual film is. Silver Linings like the fighter is an intricate character piece but even more evolved that film. It tackles complex, off the wall characters and story elements and combines them into a wonderfully unpredictable and emotionally endearing grade A cinematic stew. The film tells the story of a man named Pat (Cooper) who after an 8 month stint in a mental institution is released under his mothers care. You see he had a break because he found his wife cheating on him and was suffering from an undiagnosed bipolar disorder. Along comes Tiffany (Lawrence) a young woman who has just lost her husband and is living with a variety of personality disorders. They meet a rom com storyline forms but doesn't move in the way you'd expect. This is a film about damaged, imperfect people. People everyone of us can relate to if we are honest. There are scenes of such emotional vigor and astonishing rawness it's hard to tell you're even watching something that has been orchestrated. Bradley Cooper sheds his Hollywood image and opts for an intensely brave and personal performance. Jennifer Lawrence shows up reminding us why she was nominated for an Oscar for Winter's Bone. Her character Tiffany is so fully realized through her performance it's hard to put in words. It's so real and unhinged it hurts to watch. Robert DeBiro stars as Pat's father in his best performance in years he displays the emotional complexities of his character his slight OCD, the longing for a relationship with his son and the fear he feels about it. Jackie Weaver is also really amazing as Pat's Mom so maternal and not in a scary way like her other mesmerizing performance in Animal Kingdom. Chris Tucker even shows up for some light hearted fun, some of his best work ever. Also I would love to spotlight the inspired cinematography the constant tracking shots really freshened up the events and kept things feeling new. The thing about this film is that it's not perfect. But it's about those imperfections who make us who we are and form the relationships and experiences we have. It's an honest, funny, hilarious, endearing and memorable film.

"olivia-baker-533-385601","10","3","12","25 November 2012"," Watch This Before Anything Else.
","This is the David O'Russell film that scooped people's choice award at the Toronto International Film Festival, an award previously won by Slumdog Millionaire and The King's Speech, beating Ben Affleck's Argo. That should convince you on its own.<br/><br/>This film explores getting through life with the cards you have been dealt with. The idea is a beautiful one: two people who have experienced heartbreaking circumstances help each other to find positivity, even with the added challenge of mental instability. It should be difficult to watch, the characters can be awkward and even cruel, but their honesty makes up for it. Furthermore, the script is fantastic, encompassing a variation of moments almost bringing you to tears, before being jolted back by a line that is at the same time perceptive and hilarious. The actors are all fantastic, portraying the quirks of characters that are both ridiculous and familiar, with real perception and fearlessness. I didn't feel a single member of the cast was at any point unbelievable and this gives credit to David O'Russell's vision while directing.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best part of this film is its truth. These characters have been through more than some of us ever might, yet they still have a childishness to them, which makes the lines they deliver all the more powerful. There is real insight into their lives for two full hours, the script is so carefully constructed, and this is a rare thing to find in so many films. The message is delivered clearly, leaving me at most the motivation to go and find my own silver lining and at least feeling much happier than before I sat down to watch.<br/><br/>This film is special. Do yourself a favour and see it."
"dalydj-918-255175","9","3","12","21 November 2012"," Silver Linings Playbook shows mental illness can have a happy ending
","""Cooper and Lawrence make this story of love between conflicting people almost seem perfect"" <br/><br/>Only two years ago ""The Fighter"" came out and put David O'Russell back on top as great directors. Now he does a comedy about love and mental illness. Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) is released from a mental institution after spending many moths in. When he gets home his parents Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro) and mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver) try to make him feel better at home to get over the incident. Soon enough it is revealed that Pat is bipolar and he shows it when he overreacts to the smallest things. His friend invites him to a dinner where he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who has her own problems including a dead husband. The two then start to develop a relationship which leads to the two competing in a dance competition, in return Tiffany will help him contact with his wife Nikki.<br/><br/>This is based on the book of the same name by Matthew Quick and one of my main problems of the novel was Pat felt to central and no other character seems interesting to me. In this film the changes are very present because the father figure seems more human and actually gets along with his son unlike in the book. For a comedy/drama about two people with mental issues it seems like a more original love story because the characters are more real and less obvious in how they act around each other. Also changes from the novel is that some of the chapters are mixed around and I think it works better how they present it in the movie because it added to the heart of the characters and how they react around each other.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper plays Pat and he never has impressed me but I was blown away by his performance because it came as a shock to me. He is front and centre and even when the character does not break down he still is likable and totally unaware of what he is saying. Some of his best scenes are when he starts to lose his mind and it shows off the real talent that Cooper has never had the chance to show. Jennifer Lawrence plays Tiffany and usually known for her dramatic work was more of a surprise because of her unexplored skills in comedy. Her character can be very unlikeable at times but Lawrence brings her best to it. Her main scenes where she lets everyone knows what she is thinking is some of the best of the year. Her character is more emotional out of the pair which is why she stood out for me more. Robert De Niro was once great and for the past 20 years has not had a chance to show his skills but his turn in this film could be a new era in his career because he gets to emote as a man unaware to his mental issues. Still in his limited screen time he shows a man who like his son says anything he wants to and because of his OCD gets mad when his team loses. The rest of the cast were great to but unlike the main three they had much smaller parts are were usually used as background characters. At the start Jacki was great but as the story develops she disappears for large amounts of screen time.<br/><br/>A quick pace love story Silver Linings Playbook is one of the best representations of mental illness and how you always need someone to help you get through your problems. The ending of the film felt much better then how they ended the novel and it left me leaving the theatre with a big smile on my face as all these well written characters are finally happy. David has crafted a great cast and story showing he is back on top.<br/><br/>MOVIE GRADE: A (MVP: Jennifer Lawrence)"
"ClaytonDavis","8","3","12","14 November 2012"," Bradley Cooper delivers the year's most surprising leading performance...
","The amount of heart and wit embodied in David O. Russell's Silver Linings Playbook is one of the tender and surprising films of the year. Russell, who has brought his quirky comedies to the screen like I Heart Huckabees (2004) seemingly never found his footing in the genre. Russell has had his fans championing his choices such as Spanking the Monkey (1994), Flirting with Disaster (1996), and especially Three Kings (1999). In Playbook, you can chalk it up to the source material by Matthew Quick, or the way Russell approaches telling the story but it's one of the director's bravest attempts to date. Despite a love story that feels forced and a bit tedious and predictable, the film is a breath of fresh air to the romantic comedy genre.<br/><br/>Comically whimsical when it needs to be, the film searches and fines an emotional epicenter lying in the brilliance of Bradley Cooper and the rest of the stellar cast. Silver Linings Playbook tells the story of Pat Solitano Jr. (Cooper), a former teacher that attempts to reconnect after his ex-wife after spending several months in a mental institution. Living with his parents, Pat attempts to get in shape, focus, and reconcile relationships since his return until he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young mysterious girl with problems of her own. <br/><br/>As Pat, Cooper shows a dynamic range of comedy and emotion that audiences never knew he had. It's a marvelous turn by the actor who has shown glimpses of greatness in The Hangover (2009) and earlier this year in The Words. While most of the film, Pat operates at a level ten, Cooper never overcooks and oversimplifies Pat's candor and honesty. It's one of the year's most surprising and delectable turns.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence's approach to the character is different than others. Tiffany lacks much of the likability factor that Pat or his family and friends do. Tiffany's antics, foul-mouthed liners, and over indulgence into Pat's life can be off-putting to some. It's still unclear whether the failure is on Lawrence's interpretation of the character or the structured laid out by writer/director Russell but the performance is merely satisfactory and doesn't stand out in a cast where everyone is producing career highs. I simply don't get the overwhelming love for the performance.<br/><br/>As Pat Sr., the undiagnosed father who may have some ticks of his own Robert DeNiro, who has shown blips of excellence since his Oscar nomination for Cape Fear (1991), is back in full force; dramatic, sensitive, zealous about the work, and magnetic. It's inducing what DeNiro puts out for the audience to view moment after moment. As the overly loving and beautiful mother Dolores, Jacki Weaver practically spends the entire film on the edge of tears. Dolores, who is the exact opposite of Weaver's character Janine in Animal Kingdom (2010), embodies worry and nurturing effortlessly. <br/><br/>In another surprising turn, Chris Tucker, mostly known for eyes and laughs in the Rush Hour films, completely floors me as Danny, the mentally-ill friend with his constant yearning to escape. Tucker shows a maturity we haven't seen before, even when he's hilarious. Julia Stiles as Tiffany's sister Veronica, Anupam Kher as Dr. Cliff, Pat's therapist and especially John Ortiz as Ronnie, Veronica's husband round out what is sure to be this year's winner of Cast Ensemble at the Screen Actors Guild Awards.<br/><br/>The film also seems to have a more serious and political approach into the medicinal purposes in mental health rehabilitation. Is it about getting to the root of the issue and attempting to rid it or about drugging you so you don't have to face it? A daring question to ask as the comedy casts a shadow over this dramatic look into one man's approach. <br/><br/>Silver Linings Playbook is a sure-fire hit with a loving sentiment and heartwarming laughs. In the end, if there's one hero of this team, Bradley Cooper is M.V.P. hands down and delivers one of the year's most exciting leading man turns. A must-see in 2012.<br/><br/>Read More Reviews at The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)"

","I saw this in the theater when it first came out and couldn't believe what I had just seen. To begin with Lawrence is beautiful but cannot act. She might be able to take direction which makes her valuable but she cannot contain a character. But this is the least of the issues with this mess.<br/><br/>No coherence within the movie, no character motivation,<br/><br/>It's in the title, Silver Linings Playbook. Well? Where is it? What does it say? How did you create it? All unknown. It was probably at one time important to the theme of the movie.<br/><br/>A dangerous, violent, recently incarcerated man with a restraining order against him shows up at his ex-wifes' house and the only cop in town scolds him like a puppy before releasing him. All with a smile.<br/><br/>The father is obsessive compulsive and can't keep a job, so he gambles and bookies for a living. Wife still follows him around the house with a smile and never shows any agitation. Bets the house on a football game and she still smiles. It's only a matter of weeks before the house is gone. Nice happy ending.<br/><br/>Apparently you don't have to know anything about dance to win a dance contest, all you have to do is jump around like kids in a bounce house. It says a little about what it takes to judge a contest as well.<br/><br/>Mental illness is coddled and acquiesced to the entire movie and in the end it's clear that the actions of these characters will destroy the entire family.

","Interestingly enough I wasn't expecting much from the film, despite very positive reviews from critics. There was very little about the film I enjoyed, actually, except for Bradley Cooper's good looks. This was a freaked out, messed up film! These characters have so many issues, were I actually supposed to root for any of them? I couldn't care less about any of them - especially Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who was just downright annoying. Man, I absolutely HATED this character!!<br/><br/>I know this was (probably) supposed to be a romantic film, but I didn't feel it. I literally couldn't wait for this to end, as I found it beyond boring. Is this the non-exciting, non-interesting, non-funny, non-romantic, non-ANYTHING, very annoying version of 'Shall we dance'?? I suppose this is what one would call a chick flick, coz it did absolutely nothing for me as a man. It didn't stir any of my senses, apart from wanting to hit the stop/eject button about a thousand times!"
"Danusha_Goska","7","2","7","12 January 2013"," Cooper Outacts DeNiro in Grating, Sometimes Endearing Film
","""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a grating, occasionally endearing and humorous portrait of a bipolar misfit attempting to create a livable life after his release from a court-mandated stay in a mental institution. Pat (Bradley Cooper) chases his wife, unseen for most of the film. She has a fulltime job as a high school English teacher. Pat has no job and lives in his parents' attic. His parents, Robert DeNiro and Jacki Weaver (whom I thought was Sally Struthers) are themselves no prize winners. Dad is an obsessive compulsive football fan and gambler who insists that his son Pat must sit next to him during games while holding a green handkerchief in order for his team, the Philadelphia Eagles, to win. Mom cooks and whines a lot. <br/><br/>Pat meets Tiffany, a very, very hot young widow. She falls in love with him at first sight, but he resists her, because he wants to get back with his wife. <br/><br/>The best reason to see this film is Bradley Cooper's performance. He is terrific as a man with limited cards playing them the best way he knows how, given his limited awareness, abilities and options. Your heart aches for him. He often behaves in outrageous, indeed, illegal ways, but his insanity is an expression of real sanity in a couple of scenes. He vehemently rejects Ernest Hemingway's decisions in ""Farewell to Arms"" and he rescues his brother from racist thugs. <br/><br/>The movie as a whole failed to take flight for me. I found the main characters to be too grating, and I needed a respite or an artistic intervention that would make their qualities more bearable. There was an opportunity for that. Tiffany is a dancer, and she and Pat train to compete in a dance contest. After lengthy, detailed scenes of ugly, irrational and loud familial manipulations, false hope, and dysfunction, I could have used some well-presented music and dance. The director doesn't take advantage of that, though, and the film just squats there, annoying the audience. The film's end is less a resolution and more of a ""we're out of time here so let's wrap things up."" <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is spectacularly beautiful, and very young. She's fifteen years younger than Cooper and far too young to be convincing as a grieving widow. She is costumed in skintight leggings and bratops that emphasize her long, slim legs and considerable frontal and posterior assets. Her skin is flawless. <br/><br/>I could did not, for one second, believe this vision of health and loveliness to be a desperate, medicated, marginal, screwed up, nymphomaniac widow. I believed her to be exactly what she was – eye candy positioned to keep male viewers' eyes on the screen, no less than a playboy bunny or a cheerleader. A woman closer to Cooper's age, a woman who shows the knocks that life can leave on a person (as scruffy Cooper does) would have been more believable but less commercial. Given the very commercial choice to go with a gorgeous young woman and to parade her assets in every scene, the movie seemed less true, less daring than it thinks of itself as being."

","I finished reading the book, got up from my chair and drove to the theater to see the movie. That was a mistake. It's true, you should never read the book before you see the movie. I liked the book so much more than the movie, and felt a little disappointed. I have to say here that I am a life long resident of the suburbs of Philadelphia and am an Eagles fan, not quite as obsessed a fan as the family in the movie, but I do occasionally wear my Eagles jersey on game day, and they drive me crazy just as they did the family in the movie. I related to the author's story on every level. DeNiro's portrayal of the father was completely opposite to the father in the book, where I felt, Pat, the main character, was longing for his wife's love as well as his father's something the movie just didn't capture. As I read, I kept feeling I just wanted to hug him. Of course, I felt the same way about Bradley Cooper, but for very different reasons....oh, those blue eyes! He probably does deserve an Oscar nomination. The street scenes had an unreal quality about them I didn't like, kind of like the movie was filmed on a movie set. The best scene was the dance contest. I would recommend the film."

","SLP is one of the few movies that's worth watching on the big screen, not just because you know there won't be any loud and obnoxious people in the cinema with you, but for a seemingly good time that seems to fly so quickly that you feel slightly dazed when the end credits roll.<br/><br/>The story is interesting, if a little bit clichéd in one part, but that doesn't take away from the overall experience. It was fun trying to watch Pat try to sort out his life after being let out of the mental institution and once out he has a host of obstacles to overcome, the least of which happens to be Tiffany, a young unemployed widower.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper is excellent as the disturbed Pat, so scarily so that you think that Cooper in real life exhibits these problems. He's well supported by Robert DeNiro as his Dad, with one or two loose screws of his own. Jennifer Lawrence is good but for some reason, for me anyway, she didn't quite pull off the role of a crazed or mental person. At least not when you compare her to Cooper.<br/><br/>The pace of the movie moves along quite nicely, the editors doing a good job of moving from scene to scene seamlessly. There's never a drop or a part that doesn't fit in. The humour is funny and helps break the serious flow at the right moments.<br/><br/>All in all it's a good movie, an even better date movie, but one that you'll enjoy at the cinema."

","When it comes to relationships, there's a lid for every pot, so they say. Even if you've flipped your lid And it's not like Bradley Cooper's bi-polar Pat didn't have reason. He caught his wife cheating in the shower, got kinda violent, and winded up at a mental hospital.<br/><br/>Which is where our story begins right as he's checking out And it's any wonder they let him go free at all – a particular song makes him bonkers while a classic novel's unhappy ending sends him on a frantic tizzy. But his parents have taken him back into their home, and not without hesitation.<br/><br/>Yet Pat's father, played by veteran icon Robert De Niro, isn't exactly normal. With a hardwired penchant for Eagles football, a manner of keeping everything in place around him, and a bias for his ""normal"" oldest son he's anything but a cure for Pat, whose only solace is his mundane best buddy, married to an uptight yuppie with a cute little sister...<br/><br/>And that's where the real story begins Jennifer Lawrence's Tiffany might be crazier or rather more blunt than anyone else on board. With a sordid past – having slept with a laundry list of people – there's no subject she won't shed light on. And her pet project becomes Pat, who still thinks he has a chance reconciling with his wife despite a pretty serious restraining order.<br/><br/>The best scenes have Pat and Tiffany hanging out, jogging or wandering the suburbs, outdoing each other with combative honesty and getting closer and closer despite their neurosis, providing Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence worthy performances: each seeming too real for the world and each other. While the sporadic hand-held camera provides an edgy documentary vibe, and more stagnant scenes remind us of the romantic comedy baseline.<br/><br/>But the real catch, and what drives the character-driven story, is Veronica's promise to bring Pat and his wife (friends with her sister) back together – the stakes are raised as that silver lining now has a price. He has to learn to dance for a big competition that, occurring on the same night of an important football game, gives this unique tale a worthy climax for conventional audiences.<br/><br/>Sure it can be cliché at times. The two leads find solutions much too easily; especially since Pat has a beautiful young dream-girl/life coach that any guy would die for, making him difficult to relate with. While some of the characters, like Pat's brother and his outpatient friend, aren't entirely fleshed out.<br/><br/>But with an ultimately heartfelt performance by De Niro, and a platform for Cooper and Lawrence to shine without limits, SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is a dose of effective medicine.<br/><br/>More More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com"

","From my own experiences, medical rehabilitation is less ""feel better on your own"" and more ""take drugs to fix you"". My father pointed out several times in the movie where Pat (Bradley Cooper) would have been sent back to the hospital immediately. Doctors are not as lenient as they're made out to be here, especially in cases like Pat's (with harm to others). This movie was also surprisingly focused on football. Nothing wrong with that of course, but I guess I'm a bit peeved that it wasn't advertised as such. I've also read a lot of flak about the age difference between Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) and Pat, but get over it people, not everybody falls in love with someone their own age. But aside from those parts, I very much enjoyed the movie. I love Jennifer Lawrence like mad, and Cooper and Robert De Niro work well together. (And surprise! Chris Tucker is a funny guy.)"
"elizabethiv","9","3","13","24 November 2012"," Just a delightful film for those of us with bipolar disorder or depression, or the family members we can't help but bring along into our messy lives.
","First of all, Bradley Cooper has blown my mind. He is SO good as Pat, so vulnerable and sweet, if also a little neurotic, anxious, and obsessive. When he speaks to his therapist and he says something about he has always known he wasn't quite right, and you can hear the palpable relief in his voice. It is so relatable to those of us who have been there, suffering from an undiagnosed mental illness, knowing something was wrong with us but not knowing what. To finally figure it out, it is a relief of epic proportions, because finally you know that the healing process can start.<br/><br/>Robert Deniro gives a wonderful performance as Pat's father, who suffers from anger issues and is a bit OCD. He has never felt close to his son, but he is trying in this film, and whats more, we can see he is trying. They have a brief tender moment which brought tears to my eyes, as he tries to talk to his son about wanting to help him, wanting to spend time with him. It is moving and just a great Dinero scene. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is great, playing Tiffany, a tough but vulnerable woman whose husband has been killed and lost her job from sleeping her way around the office, the way she deals with her depression. Lonely,and one of those people who likes to help others but wakes up in the morning realizing she's gotten nothing in return, she thinks she finds a kindred spirit in Pat portrayed best in a great scene around a dining room table having dinner with Tiffany's sister, Veronica (played by Julia Stiles) where she and Pat get into talking about all the meds they've been on and how they make them feel, much to the discomfort of Veronica and her husband. <br/><br/>I don't want to say too much more, as it really is a wonderful film that should be experienced in the flow. Its funny, painful, and a romantic comedy of profound meaning. If you want to see any Holiday Romance film, this is the one to see."

","Silver Linings Playbook is an excellent glimpse into insanity. This isn't so much a romantic comedy as a crazy romance. Pat (Bradley Cooper) lost it when he caught his wife having an affair with another teacher. Now he is trying to get it together so he can get back with his wife. She has a restraining order against him, but he believes that, if he can just become the man she wants him to be, she will take him back.<br/><br/>Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) never really had it together to begin with. Her husband died and she is also trying to put her life together, trying to become the person she always wanted to be. Neither one is having much luck on their own, but together they just might be able to help each other out. Tiffany agrees to get a letter to Pat's estranged wife if he helps her with her dream – to take part in a couples dance competition.<br/><br/>Sliver Linings does a good job of showing what it is like to live with and be around someone who is not mentally stable without it seeming like a cliché. Parts of this movie can be uncomfortable, they are meant to be. Neither of the main characters has much of a filter and tend to say what they think as they are thinking it.<br/><br/>Pat comes by his insanity honestly. His dad is OCD and fanatical about the Philadelphia Eagles (The movie is set in Philadelphia.) There is no miracle cure for anyone in this movie. What the characters do find is support. They have to learn to live with and accept each other eccentricities. In this regard Silver Linings tends to reflect real life, because in the end, that is the basis that all good relationships."

","I was lucky enough to get a sneak peek at ""Silver Linings Playbook"" at the Chicago International Film Festival starring Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert DiNero, Jacki Weaver and Chris Tucker.  Not only did this high profile and talented cast pique my interest, but the director and writer of the screenplay, David O. Russell from ""The Fighter,"" was a pull as well.  ""Silver Linings Playbook"" was based on the novel by Matthew Quick.  In the film, Cooper played a recently released mental patient with a propensity for violence who tried to get his life back in order with a little help from a friend, Jennifer Lawrence, who had ""issues"" of her own.<br/><br/>  The story line and character development of everyone in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" was complex.  Without giving too much away, this film dealt with Pat Solitano, an adult with Bipolar Disorder.  As Pat (Cooper) was released against medical advice from the mental institution in Baltimore after serving time for battery, he returned home to live with his parents, as a part of a court agreement.  Pat tried to focus on getting better with the sole purpose of getting his wife back.  As Pat went to therapy, and interacted with friends and family, we gained insight into Pat's life and those who surrounded him along with a new acquaintance, Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence.  We also saw that no one is really ""normal.""  It's how far to the left or right of normal one can go before it interfered with living.  That's what happened to Pat.  We watched as his outbursts and difficulty with dealing with life in appropriate ways interfered with not just Pat's life, but his family's as well.  His mental illness tore apart and continued to tear apart the family.  But it wasn't all dark and depressing.  This movie took a serious disorder, showed it in its true light, but also found the humor within the reality of it.  Anyone who has dealt with a mental disability could relate to the various situations found in the film.  Finding that silver lining in any situation is how we can make things seem just a little bit better.  That's what Pat tried to do throughout the movie.<br/><br/>This film was carefully crafted and written with the utmost of care to develop meaningful and realistic characters full of love, depth, and humor.  Cooper's astute ability to portray an impulsive and inappropriate man with Bipolar Disorder who struggled with life was mind- boggling.  His frenetic tempo was contagious as I found my own breathing irregular and shallow as I watched him interact.  Lawrence was a great counterpart to Cooper, although, initially I thought she was too young.  She proved me wrong.  Her character also had issues which I encourage you to see for yourself, but she was the realistic balance that Cooper's character needed.  DeNiro, wrought with his issues as well and struggled with trying to help his son yet protect his family...a tough line to walk when you're dealing with an adult son.  And Weaver was  Every Mom...moms just want everyone to be happy.  She loved her family and would do anything for her kids and no matter what the kids' ages, they will always be her kids.  Family.  It's our most treasured gift, but what do we do when that gift explodes?  <br/><br/>""Silver Linings Playbook"" was a wonderful story which addressed a serious topic.  Through the use of humor, we saw how one family dealt with the serious issue of Bipolar Disorder.  The numerous and overlapping side stories augmented the main story perfectly.  Sweet, funny, accurate, and deep are just a few words that come to mind when describing this film.  Cooper's performance took him to a place I hadn't seen him before.  DeNiro, Weaver, and Lawrence couldn't have been cast any better.  How wonderful to see a story unfold before your eyes which can take an close look at an uncomfortable issue and find a silver lining."

After seeing the film I'm rather puzzled why ? <br/><br/>In many ways it's similar to a Woody Allen film with neurosis , family issues , dinner parties and potential mismatched romance featuring prominently .

","I had seen the trailer for this film and in awards season the leading actress went on to win the big ones, so I had to see if she deserved it, and if the film was any good, from Oscar nominated director David O. Russell (Three Kings, I Heart Huckabees, The Fighter). Basically Pat Solitano Jr. (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Bradley Cooper) is returning home from a mental health facility where he was getting eight months treatment for bipolar disorder, he is being put in the care of his parents, father Patrizio 'Pat Sr.' (Oscar nominated Robert De Niro) who has nothing to do but bookmaking to make money, and mother Dolores (Oscar nominated Jacki Weaver). Pat is determined to get his life back on track and he is also hoping to reconcile with his wife Nikki (Brea Bee), but she has taken out a restraining order on him after his violent episode that caused his involuntary commitment, and he attends sessions with court-mandated therapist Dr. Cliff Patel (Anupam Kher). He recalls that he became violent because Nikki was sleeping with another man who he nearly beat to death, and while they were making love the music that was playing at the time was the song at their wedding, so this triggers a bad reaction if he hears it, but apparently he does not need medication to keep himself under control. He forms a good friendship with fellow facility patient Danny McDaniels (Chris Tucker), and one night at dinner with his friend Ronnie (John Ortiz) he meets the sister of Ronnie's wife Veronica (Julia Stiles), Ronnie's sister-in-law Tiffany (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Jennifer Lawrence) has been recently widowed and lost her job. Pat and Tiffany become friends through their discussions talking about their personal problems, and then she mentions that she get him a letter to Nikki through her, but in return he must partner with her in an upcoming dancing competition, he reluctantly agrees and they arduously practise. He comes to believe that helping Tiffany and proving he can better himself will be told to Nikki and it will help him reconcile with her, and he does get a reply which gives him hope and more determination, but his father may stop the good fortune. His father wants him to attend a Philadelphia Eagles game he has put all his money on, and skipping practise for the game Pat also ends up in a fight with racist thugs beating his psychiatrist and brother Jake (Shea Whigham) and he is arrested, and the Eagles lose the game making his father furious. After Pat is released and there is an argument with the family and the young woman, Tiffany confronts Pat Sr. and points out that his treasured team had good success when she and his son were rehearsing together, she has a good knowledge for their scores and schedules. Convinced she is a ""good luck charm"" the father makes a bet with his fellow gambling friend that if the Eagles win the game against Dallas, and if Pat and Tiffany score an average of 5 out of 10 at the dance competition, then he will get the money back he made on the first bet, Pat is only persuaded by a lie that Nikki will be in the audience at the competition. Pat does get a letter from Nikki and reads it to himself, he notices a phrase Tiffany used is in it, ""reading the signs"", and when it comes to the night of both the football game and the dance competition Tiffany is upset to see that Nikki really is coming to watch the performance, so she starts drinking at the bar with a man trying to pick her up. Pat finds her and they perform their routine together on the dance floor with everyone watching, as they dance the Eagles do win their game against Dallas, and the conclusion of the competition sees them score the needed 5 point average for Pat Sr. to win the bet, the dancing couple are ecstatic. After the win Pat goes to have a short conversation with Nikki who is happy for him, Tiffany storms off seeing this, his father tells him when he goes after her that life has given him something good and it would be a sin not to reach for it, he tells his father he loves him and follows his advice. Pat catches up to Tiffany and explains that he knows she forged the letter from Nikki, but he confesses he has loved her ever since the day they met and it has taken him so long to realise it, and they share their first kiss, and the film ends with all the family reunited and happy. Also starring Paul Herman as Randy, Dash Mihok as Officer Keogh, Matthew Russell as Ricky D'Angelo, Cheryl Williams as Tiffany's Mother and Patrick McDade as Tiffany's Father. Lawrence, who famously tripped on her dress going up the stairs to get her Oscar, certainly deserved it being a terrifically feisty character with a brainy and troubled personality, Cooper is also very appealing as the man emotionally struggling but wanting to learn from his mistakes and improve, De Niro is good support as the father obsessed with his football and trying to help his son in any way he can, the story is a good simple insight into how helping someone and finding a purpose can clear your head and make you a better feeling and acting person, it is feel good, it is funny, it is snappy when it needs to be, and it is a worthwhile comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Editing and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published for Russell, it won the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and Best Screenplay.

","If you don't know what mental illness is like, you might think this is a hilarious picture. It actually is in many respects, but if you haven't had any experience with people or family members dealing with mental health issues, you may not get the full impact of this film and what it means to remain in treatment and faithfully take prescribed medications. The writers either had that real life experience or did their research very faithfully, because the reactions of characters like Pat (Bradley Cooper) and Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) are ones I've observed personally with members of my own family. It's not always easy, and one must remain on the defensive more often than is comfortable when someone you care for is tortured by erratic mood swings and delusional thinking. It was struck home forcefully when Dr. Patel (Anupam Kher) tells Pat in one of their sessions that ""one incident can change a lifetime"". I can vouch for that and am thankful every day when the meds are working and life approaches a semblance of normalcy. I thought this was a brilliant movie in the way it offers hope to those afflicted with mental health issues of their own, and a way to deal with them effectively given the proper support of friends and loved ones."

","I'll start off like this; a lot of Oscar Nominations came this movies way, and even won one... I'm not exactly sure how, or why.<br/><br/>Personally for me, Bradley Cooper was just wrong for this role. There is a certain smoothness and charm that Cooper has, and cannot shake, thus, being this uncontrollable, bipolar and erratic loon just looked really silly, and again for me, exposed his limits.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence was far better perhaps, but, this was not an Oscar Nomination performance, let alone a win. She was just the female version of Cooper... Pat and Tiffany were the same character in different genders, which makes character depth quite questionable.<br/><br/>Honestly, Lawrence was far better in The Hunger Games, than this movie, which again in my view, just reveals how the Oscars are prejudice against big budget blockbusters, just because they're big budget blockbusters.<br/><br/>De Niro, Weaver and Tucker were also very good, and a major part as to why I've rounded off the rating to a 6/10.<br/><br/>The story, direction and score, are not the best I've seen or heard. Things happen in this movie where you're like; ""What, how?"". There are also things that aren't quite resolved, or resolved properly at least.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie, as much as it allowed me to I guess, but, it does not at all deserve a single Oscar Nomination, just like how Pat and Tiffany didn't deserve the score they received at the dance competition.<br/><br/>I love the cast... The cast, is the best thing about this movie. Apart from that, it's choppy, nonsensical, a bit boring at points, but the acting ultimately, carried it quite well.<br/><br/>5/10 feels harsh, but somehow still appropriate... so, 5.5/10 from me."

At the beginning the movie was described from the perspective of Pat, but it gradually shares others like father, or Tiffany. The act of Tiffany was great! It attracts audience into the strained situation. <br/><br/>Tiffany cannot control herself and confuse Pat. I wonder if Pat really likes Tiffany at the end of the movie. I assume he likes Tiffany for sure. But I wonder if he still can not give up Nikki. It leaves many points to consider so that's why I rate this movie 9 out of 10."

","I'll start by saying this is my first review on IMDb, even though I'm here for almost 5 years already.<br/><br/>I'm an assiduous movie watcher and I really like all genres of movies but Romance is probably one of my least favorites. Why? Because apparently I've been watching the wrong movies. Today I saw ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and I realized that. This movie is amazing and if you didn't watch it yet, just stop right here and go watch it.<br/><br/>The plot is superb, the acting is incredible and it has an amazing cast. I didn't watch the movies from the others nominees to ""Best Actress"" but I'm sure Jennifer Lawrence deserved the Oscar because her acting was really good. I didn't watch ""Lincoln"" yet, so I can't say anything about Daniel Day-Lewis winning the Oscar for best actor, but I have to say that Bradley Cooper was just incredible as Patty and he surely was a serious candidate to that Oscar.<br/><br/>All in all this is probably the best romance that I have watched and it will most certainly change my opinion about romances."

","Jennifer Lawrence should give half of her Oscar to Cooper cause both nailed it. She did earn her Oscar, but she was no better than Bradley, so if she got it, he should get one too.<br/><br/>The movie is a bit sleazy, but despite that, it's really good. I saw it when it was released, now I saw it again and I will watch it more in the future. It's kind of a movie that you can't not love, but you also can not say why exactly do you love it.<br/><br/>I do not like Jennifer Lawrence, but in this movie she simply steals our hearts.

"Sylviastel","9","1","3","8 October 2015"," Crazy meets Crazy!
","I enjoyed watching Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence as two broken unstable people. He is separated from his wife after the incident. She lost her husband and went sex crazed in her office. As Pat, Cooper does a terrific believable job in portraying him with his mental illness. As Tiffany, Lawrencr won a well deserved Academy Award for best actress. I thought she should have been won for ""The Hunger Games"" but she deserved it anyway. Here Lawrence shows why she won as well with a realistic portrayal of a grieving widow. I love Jacki Weaver as the supportive loving mother. She earned her second Oscar nomination. She is a such a great actress. Robert DeNiro plays the dad and did a wonderful job as always. The film was shot on location in Philadelphia area. The Eagles scene was realistic and football is more American than Apple pie. The film is a heartwarming love story."
"febinphilip","7","1","3","15 November 2014"," You know, it's something different..
","Let's establish two things before I review this title:<br/><br/>1. Yes I'm watching the movie two years after it released worldwide <br/><br/>2. No I did not know its based on a novel until I saw the credits roll and I still haven't read the book<br/><br/>Well now that we've established this much (and you've decided whether reading this review is worth your time or not), let's jump right in.<br/><br/>Silver Linings Playbook is about a former teacher Pat Solitano who moves back in with his parents after a brief stint in a mental institution, and tries to reconcile things with his ex-wife. Tiffany comes in somewhere along the way and things get complicated for good ol' Pat. You know if you're reading the summary for the first time and you haven't seen the movie, I guess you'll have pretty much the same reaction as I did; what's so great about this movie? It just sounds too bland! Is it the power cast that fuels such a rating or can there actually be a good story here?<br/><br/>The answer is a bit of both. Bradley Cooper doesn't quite fit into his role so easily like how I do into my 40 inch waistline pajamas but he still does a good job. You want to see his character evolve because he comes out of the institution in a certain mental state and you expect that to change naturally in some way but then he overdoes it towards the end and that can be putting off; you don't radically change overnight, it's not quite possible. The more finer tuned performances were Robert De Niro and Jackie Weaver who do a splendid job as Pat's folks. Their roles don't work best together but apart in those singular scenes as father to son or mom to son; that's beautiful drama right there. Moving on to Jennifer Lawrence, I really enjoyed her character in the movie and I found she played her role quite brilliantly. The rest of the supporting cast did a wonderful job as well especially Dash Mihok (read the wacko brother from Ray Donovan) who sort of just made me laugh every time he came on scene. <br/><br/>On to the story line, I did find it to be something different. I mean the outcome is sort of realized mid-way and/or after, but the movie is shot in such a way that it leaves you guessing as to how things might turn out for Pat. It's that beautiful combination of comedy and drama which leads to this sort of thinking. However I did find the story line to drag a bit every now and then; it could have been to lay more ground work and give us more insight as to how Pat thinks and reacts in situations. But again the simplicity of the story makes it a good movie to just sit back, relax and enjoy. It's for those quiet nights when you're by yourself or with that special someone and you just want to watch a simple yet beautiful drama.<br/><br/>So go on ahead and rent this one, I'm sure you'll enjoy it!"
"Al_Marenco","10","1","3","10 June 2014"," An intensely told human experience
","I will keep this short and sweet. This is a movie everyone should watch. I don't know how well it portrays bi-polarity, or other disorders, since I do not have one nor I know enough people with them to make up my mind. All I know about is movies, character and story. And this is a very intense study, of immensely deep multi-dimensional characters going through serious life problems that anyone, whether or not they suffer from mental illness and/or conditions, can relate to. It is complex but understandable, weird but relatable, and always compelling. Some of the best performances I've seen on screen in a while carry this great piece all the way to a surprisingly non-cheesy great ending."
"JuliaRae16","10","1","3","2 June 2014"," Man with mental health problems who tries to reinvent himself and control his illness
","Basically Pat (Bradley Cooper) comes home to live with his parents after 8 months in mental hospital to try and reinvent himself to get his estranged wife back. Along the way he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who helps him in more ways than he ever imagined.<br/><br/>One of my favorite movies now. Bradley cooper and Jennifer Lawrence both have great performances. And obviously there is Robert De Niro who is always great. Bradley and Jennifer's chemistry is undeniable and their age difference in real life is completely forgotten because of this. The movie is so realistic in the sense that I wouldn't call it a comedy, or drama or really anything like that; It has it all. The drama is obviously shown through all the struggles that the main characters especially Pat and his family go through and I think most people can relate to it on different levels and in different ways. The comedy comes through the realism of it. It's not a ""comedy"" in the sense that if you want a mindless funny movie, but in an everyday realistic kind of funny. I have to also say the Bradley coopers performance is just outstanding in this. It was as if he wasn't acting, it was that great where you really do believe he is that character and forget he's acting. I loved that by just looking at his face and especially his eyes all of his emotions were right there for you to see and feel with him. That was what for me made me really connect and feel attached to his character."
"tengrc1106","8","1","3","24 May 2014"," Not bad
","Generally very good. It addresses the bipolar issue in a light tone, and focuses on the silver lining behind a bad situation which I could not agree more. The disappointment for me lies in that the plot and the whole delivery are very clichéd, sometimes even cheesy. It almost feels like the director could have gotten more out of these brilliant actors. Bradley Cooper was fine, Jennifer Lawrence was a straight up boss. De Niro was alright, not that great for me. Not sure if it's indeed Oscar quality but JLaw's performance was natural, powerful and under control, very impressive at such a young age. The overall experience is warm, positive and motivating."
"Tehmeh","9","1","3","30 January 2014"," Romantic comedies suck. This does not.
","This film is much more than a romantic comedy (which is a genre generally consisting of steaming pile of crap), although it is that too. It's a wonderful mess of drama, comedy, romance, dialogue and a certain warm sense of honesty that at times seems to fall apart, yet never does.<br/><br/>Mental health problems and a certain dark and brutal sense of honesty that can arise from such things are well represented here. It's never too hard on you (although I wish that it was), but it doesn't lose its honest touch either. Even if things are portrayed in a funny way and some corners are cut short, it keeps everything just realistic enough. I'm a nutjob myself, many hospitals, treatments and drugs behind me, and I appreciated the way these issues were handled. I heartily laughed at the scene where the main characters had a humorous discussion about the drugs they've taken.<br/><br/>This film manages to avoid preaching. Even though mental health problems are dealt with, it isn't a documentary or solely a representation of mental illnesses and how to treat them, no. After all, it is still just a movie with a story to tell. And the story is a hilarious mess. We got a reconciliation theme, therapy sessions, sports, gambling, dancing contests and you name it. This should not make any sense at all, but it does. I managed to be surprised by about half the turns the movie made. However, if you're looking for a thrilling storyline or an engaging plot, you might be disappointed. It feels like a bunch of somewhat random scenes and events. These scenes are well tied together and the red line is constantly present, but if you judge it only as a linear story, it isn't that great.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper steals the show. He's fantastic, and by now it's certain that he's not just a pretty boy. Although ""stealing the show"" might be the wrong term, since everyone else is good too. Jennifer Lawrence is very good, as is Robert DeNiro, and even Chris Tucker is alright. Imagine that.<br/><br/>The screenplay is good and well directed. David O. Russell has a reputation of being an ass at times, but he sure knows his stuff. Now I'm curious about the original book too, I hope I can find it from my local library.<br/><br/>It's not perfect though. After about one hour, the film seems to lose some of its magic and touch. It comes back eventually for awhile, but it still leaves a little stain on this otherwise great movie. I felt that some dramatic potential was lost during those moments.<br/><br/>That said, I would recommend this movie for everyone. If you got mental health problems, marital problems, or ANY problems, you might enjoy the positivity this movie squeezes from serious subjects. The positivity is surprising and also rewarding, which is quite rare. You will also probably see something in these characters that you recognize. I recognized myself and many people in my life, many times.<br/><br/>Hey, I feel good after seeing this. I missed this feeling."

","This movie depicted very realistically my own experience with bipolar, it was honest and true to the illness it avoided stereotypes, and I found it very relatable. After watching and purchasing on HD, I am officially in love with Jennifer Lawrence, watch it I'm sure you will be too. Bradley Cooper seems to turn every movie he's in to gold with the ""Midas Touch"". Robert Deniro gave a great performance depicting the father who doesn't quite no how to handle his ""koo koo"" son. Chris Tucker was great rambling away, I swear I've met people like his character. Watch it it really is an awesome movie. This movie despite its desperate subject will warm your heart and give you a Silver Lining of your own."
"jay_wray_9","9","1","3","2 January 2014"," A beautiful mess.
","I would suggest to anyone who hasn't seen this movie yet to give it a shot. From many of the negative reviews I've read, a lot of the things mentioned in them happen to be the reasons I love this movie. My advice would be to not listen to any of them reviews, and indeed any positive reviews either, and watch it with an open mind. You might hate it and you might love it. Opinions on what works and doesn't work are subjective. But I think the performances in this movie at the very least warrant a chance. <br/><br/>Now on with the review. The main protagonist in this movie is Pat (Bradley Cooper) who suffers from bipolar disorder. He is released from hospital after having a violent episode into the care of his parents. There have been comments as to how this movie portrayed mental illness. As someone who has lived with someone suffering from bipolar disorder and has a close cousin with it, I would say it portrays it quite accurately within the constraints of a 2 hour movie. We're obviously not going to see every aspect of it but the things we do see are things I recognise clearly. But we must remember that Pat is not a portrayal of bipolar disorder as a whole. Every case is different, and every person is different. It's not fair to anyone with the disorder to say that he's portraying what it is to be bipolar. He's just a character who happens to have it. -<br/><br/>This is at the heart of it about two people (Cooper and Lawrence) both of whom are hurt or damaged in some way, and how they're relationship helps to bring out both the best and the worst of each other. I feel like Coopers' performance here is him at his best. The film tends to focus on the manic side of bipolar disorder and I think his performance has both the manic energy as well as some of the subtlety required to make it a respectable, believable performance. As for Jennifer Lawrence. The Oscar was well deserved in my opinion. She played the ups and downs of her character flawlessly, especially considering that her character was an emotional yo yo. The chemistry between the two was less Hollywood and more real life to me. The supporting cast helped ground and at times exacerbate the manic energy of the movie as a whole. De Niro's performance in particular I found to be just the right amount of neurotic and sensitive. When he laughs I laughed and when he cries I felt it. It felt honest. <br/><br/>The writing and direction I thought were superb. They were both like a controlled mess. Which is exactly what it should have been considering what the story is and to match the energy of the characters and performances. Sometimes lines seem random, and the cinematography seems slightly strange, but that to me seems intentional and is what makes the movie all the more accurate and relatable in real life. There's no script in real life. We don't recite lines, we talk. And that's what I love about this. I don't see people remembering lines and cues and standing where they're supposed to. I see people talking to each other, and there seems to be a freedom in their movement that's usually missing in movies but clear as day in real life. <br/><br/>This was one of my favourite recent movies. Beautifully preformed, directed wonderfully and written honestly. I don't really see any weakness in it. But again, like I said, watch it with an open mind, and forget about what any positive or negative reviews have said. A good movie really is subjective. No ones opinion is wrong, so give it a go!"
"donuthaters12","9","1","3","6 December 2013"," Another Great Film Under David O. Russell's Direction
","After The Fighter, Hollywood and the general public has restored their faith on David O. Russell and this allowed him to have more choices in his projects. Silver Linings Playbook is definitely a film he wanted to make, as he wrote the screenplay and the plot and premise is quite risky in comparison to his previous film, The Fighter.<br/><br/>Silver Linings Playbook is written by David O. Russell. Russell mostly writes the screenplays of his films and when a director also writes the film, it also allows the director to have a connection to the script that the actors or anybody else in the production may not have. Russell has simply written a dramedy, if you look at the big picture but what makes it so unique and interesting is the fact that it touches on the topic of mental illness and explores beyond what has already been covered in mainstream film of mental illness.When I first watched this film, I thought the dialogue between characters and the personalities they project were hard to empathise and sympathise with but as with each viewing, and an increase awareness in mental illness during my degree, allowed me to realise that Russell has written a script that is so faithful to reality and that people who suffer mental illness have sometimes a complete different perception of oneself and his or her surroundings. The characters are very self-centered and only cater to themselves but this just adds on to the sense of reality with these characters allowing it to feel natural. The film explores the themes of mental illness, love, commitment, and relationships. The film at times also touches on the social stigma on mental illness.<br/><br/>David O. Russell has proved to be one of the great directors in this decade with two films gaining critical acclaim, with his next film being much more ambitious than the previous two (American Hustle). Russell clearly wanted to make a dramedy but due to its subject matter, it makes the film feel fresh and stand out from other films in the same pile. I am so happy that Russell has taken a positive approach to this film as films touching mental illness, in most cases, is seen in a negative light and it isn't fair as many people who are ""diagnosed"" with mental illness has lived a happy and successful life. Russell during the third act does dip into a cliché territory but with everything that has happened throughout the film it's nice to see something campy. Russell approaches all characters in the film with a mental illness, at times it may seem like it's a natural thing and that we do it too but modern medicine has used these little things as a criteria for diagnosis. This film may feel different and lose it's accessibility if it was handled by a different director.<br/><br/>Masanobu Takayanagi is the cinematographer for this film. Takayanagi does a good job for this film, allowing the film to feel and look accessible which is essential in the film's uniqueness. Though David O. Russell has chosen a different DP for this film, it still has the same style as The Fighter; but without the television broadcast effect. The film is mostly shot hand-held allowing us to feel like we are standing or present near the characters allowing us to feel involved in the conversation and story. There are shots that I have noticed that Russell has used in The Fighter, though this is the second film I have seen from his it may be a trademark shot or scene that is common within his films.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman is a hard working composer, working on a number of films in the past few years. Elfman doesn't have a huge impact in this film because like The Fighter, Russell loves to use soundtracks in particular moments to enhance the scene. I did enjoy the fact that the music choices for the climax scenes matches the emotions of the characters during the film. Elfman may not have a huge impact in the film or at least his score is not as noticeable but when it does come on it works so well that it uplifts us or it haves us in tears. The use of the piano in the defining moment between Pat and Tiffany at the end or the uplifting guitars in the running scenes.<br/><br/>David O. Russell is an actor's director and is always able to bring out the best and unique performances from the actors in his films even if they are not leads. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper felt natural together and the chemistry was great. Both leads portray characters with mental illness was believable but at the same time, with Russell's direction, allowing to be accessible. De Niro, Weaver, and Tucker are so great. When they have their moments, it's converts you to believing that they are great actors, or in De Niro's case seeing that he still has it. It was also nice to see Julia Stiles in films as it has been a while for me that I have seen her.<br/><br/>Russell has made an excellent film to put in his resume and I think this film will definitely will stand the test of time. It is filled with great performances, supported by the awards that the film has won, and it has great direction from Russell. If it didn't have stiff competition with the ambitious films of 2012 then this may be the best film of that year."
"liebor","4","1","3","6 December 2013"," Pretty corny and boring
","This movie is an overrated joke so I gave it 4, had not it been overrated it deserves a 6. What good is there: first half, touch of mental institution, the actresses playing, parent - adult kid with problems communication. Although nothing strong or shocking happens the potential of creating some good film mojo is not bad since there is a guy who is released from the mental hospital, has a unstable behaviour/condition that makes others give him conditions on which he should behave (boring therapy) so although being free, he is still there in a cage making his clever plans. Unfortunately this institution- medication- illusionary behavior restrains x obsession relationships are not used fully nor enough for the whole movie. The rest is predictably boring. It revolves around too much dialogues. There is a silly investment/sport-supporting superstition babbling with a backing of some Rocky Balboa training for a love dance that will of course make the love come done. Strangely, the main characters in the movie are clearly very intelligent and well educated people which does not add credibility. Nuff."

I'm not sure what makes me love Silver Linings Playbook so much but I just cannot get enough of it!<br/><br/>Not that I have ever been in a similar position as either Pat (Bradley Cooper) or Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) but I feel that Silver Linings Playbook is hugely relatable and that it could lift the spirits of anyone in the same position as Pat or Tiffany.

It baffles me how he didn't receive an Oscar for his performance. Jennifer Lawrence however did receive an Oscar which she completely deserved and I congratulate her!

","Against medical advice, Pat Solitano Jr. (Bradley Cooper) is released from a mental health facility into the care of his mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver) and father Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro) after eight months of minimum court mandated treatment for bipolar disorder. Pat soon learns that his wife, Nikki (Brea Bee), has moved away and his father is out of work and resorting to illegal bookmaking to earn money to start a restaurant. Pat is determined to get his life back on track and reconcile with Nikki, who obtained a restraining order against him after a violent episode where he beat her lover to near death. At a dinner setup with his friend Ronnie (John Ortiz), he meets Ronnie's sister-in-law, Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence), a recent widow who just lost her job. Pat and Tiffany develop an odd relationship through their shared neuroses, and he sees an opportunity to communicate with Nikki through her.<br/><br/>I so wanted to love this movie, but it turned out to be nothing more than a case of the Emperor's New Clothes syndrome. The story doesn't have one iota of surprise and painfully follows the clichéd romantic playbook to a tee. Just imagine this movie with a woman playing Bradley Cooper's character in the same style. This movie is being praised simply because its a romantic drama told from the man's point of view and he ultimately gets his young, hot girl after a bunch of pointless, heightened stakes which is supposed to develop their characters somehow. The best part is the beginning which was really strong and after that, it all spiralled down into mediocrity. Why would you want to introduce your bipolar friend who just came out of a mental institution to your wife's sister who herself was completely nuts due to the death of her husband! <br/><br/>I like Lawrence and it wasn't her fault for the way her character oscillated between shrill shouting and constantly being on the verge of tears. The character was terribly written and the Oscar she got was completely undeserved, along with being in the wrong category to boot. Hers was clearly a supporting role. But hey, she's the new darling of Hollywood. The rest of the nominations are also flabbergasting since they are all mediocre across the board, though De Niro rose above the tepid writing. I do not even want to talk about the portrayal of people with disorder here, but you gotta hand it to Weinstein though, he makes great award campaigns. Generic, contrived and a mediocre melodrama with a faux happy ending.<br/><br/>4/10"

","This story of a man diagnosed as bipolar and released from psychiatric internment at a state institution after a few months there which led him to lose his job as teacher and his wife is rather uninteresting though the movie is well made, directed and acted. He was mandatorily interned because he has severely beaten his wife's lover and he was also mandatorily restricted of approaching or contacting her. Then he's got the obsession of recovering job and wife and tries do do it by somewhat awkward means. In the course of this he meets a woman with some psychological troubles also with whom he starts a supposedly friendly relationship since she apparently tries to help him to fulfill his aims.

"yagian","8","1","3","14 September 2013"," Buddhism and Tsundere
","Recently, I read several books about Buddhism and wrote the entry ""Exoteric Buddhism and Esoteric Buddhism: Buddha, Wittgenstein, and Me."" In this entry, I summarized Buddha's teachings as follows.<br/><br/>========== Early Buddhism was exoteric. Buddha's original teaching was very simple. Our lives are full of pain and nobody can run away from it. There is nothing eternal and everything is changing in this world. He said that we should just accept this. In other words, it is the truth that there was no way to escape our painful lives, but we just had to accept such a cruel truth. It is too hard for ordinary people to accept it.<br/><br/>==========<br/><br/>I watched the film ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and found the way how main characters in this film overcame their problems was quite Buddhistic.<br/><br/>The main character, Pat, played by Bradley Cooper, obsessed his wife, who betrayed him. He believed that his wife still loved him, but people around him knew that she didn't love him any more. He suffered from bipolar disorder, and his obsession about his wife made him lose control.<br/><br/>The opposite character, Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence, obsessed his husband, who was killed by a traffic accident. She couldn't accept the fact that her husband was dead. She also lost control by her obsession about him.<br/><br/>Buddha might say that both of them should accept the fact, even if it was cruel, and it was the only way to overcome their pain.<br/><br/>In this film, they started training dance in preparation for a competition. At first, Pat couldn't understand why he should dance, but he became deeply involved in dance and gradually got freed from his obsession. While he was dancing, he didn't think about anything. Dance itself wasn't important, but devotion to dance was important.<br/><br/>Buddha just meditated and realized the truth, and Pat just danced and was freed from his obsession.<br/><br/>I'll change the subject.<br/><br/>The character of Tiffany was typically ""tsundere(ツンデレ).""<br/><br/>""Tsundere"" is a type of heroines in Japanese anime. ""Tsun tsun"" means being sullen or arrogant, and ""dere dere"" means being sweet or charming. At first a ""tsundere"" heroin behaves toward the main character coldly, and sometimes they fight each other. He doesn't understand why she is so cold to him at all. After they find that they love each other, she dramatically turns to be sweet to him.<br/><br/>Tiffany in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" showed up on Pat as an eccentric and rude woman. In other words, she was completely ""tsun tsun."" In the last part of this film, she turned to be ""dere dere.""<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence perfectly played the role of ""tsundere"" heroin and was so cute. Her performance was worth the Oscar award."
"jason-m-cook","8","1","3","14 September 2013"," Silver Linings Playbook
","Silver Linings Playbook (David O. Russell, 2012) An absorbing film with top-notch performances from the main actors, Silver Linings Playbook has much to recommend it. Its structure is a bit predictable, but Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence just about make up for that. It's good to see DeNiro in a serious role that doesn't send up previous roles he's played. Without having read the book, I'm at a loss to examine if the movie is faithful to it or not, but that's not always necessary in assessing an adaptation. I was highly impressed with this film in the early scenes, but as it went on I felt like I sort of knew where it was going, and for the most part I was right. <br/><br/>One plot development that was pleasantly unexpected was how Pat Sr.'s OCD began to tie in with the romantic plot between Pat Jr. and Tiffany; I thought that was very well executed. At one point I wasn't sure which of the Pats I wanted to jump into the screen and hit. That is a testament to the fine acting displayed by both Cooper and DeNiro, that they were completely behind the choices made by their characters and did not downplay them or do a halfassed job with them. Storywise it also showed the similarities between the two characters: Pat Jr. may not have suffered from OCD as such, but he definitely had his obsessions to grapple with. Jacki Weaver should also be singled out for praise, playing her own character as having to deal with the issues of both husband and son, and doing so with warmth, grace, and humor. According to IMDb, Jennifer Lawrence was the most excited to meet Weaver out of all the rest of the cast, due to Weaver's role in Animal Kingdom.<br/><br/>Probably not the best film of 2012 (I still have yet to see a few of the big names, Argo and Zero Dark Thirty among them) but a very good film for all of that. 8/10"

","To some degree, relating to the situations and conditions of the main characters in Silver Linings Playbook may increase your overall enjoyment of the film. This is a heading that anyone should acknowledge before pressing play.<br/><br/>With that out of the way, what this film is, at its heart, is a romantic comedy that does certain things well and others poorly. The on-screen chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, whose relationship is a focal point of the film, is jagged at best; and this is to the film's benefit, as you watch their interactions unfold. The father-son relationship between Cooper and Robert DeNiro is almost completely unbelievable, and if this film has any sour sticking point, this is it. DeNiro's casting seems almost purely for name power, as if the filmmakers weren't confident enough in Cooper And Lawrence being attractive draws (which they undoubtedly are, Cooper perhaps more so now than DeNiro has been in years).<br/><br/>With the volatile relationship between Cooper and Lawrence, a great many of situations develop, some predictable, some not, but they all are arranged and constructed appropriately to tell a tale of adversity, perseverance, and the crazy moments in between. At times it feels forced, at others confused, but for many American families, this is life. I can relate, and I refer back to my opening paragraph as a reminder that so much of this film can either hit you in the heart or fly over your head depending on who you are. This is true of most art, but Silver Linings Playbook is a bit more focused, almost but not quite a ""niche"" film.<br/><br/>Overall, a great film, but anything resembling universal appeal is lost due to the subject matter and some unwarranted casting choices. But for those of us who can relate, to some degree, I do believe you'll feel the same as me; well worth the 2 hours.<br/><br/>P.S. - I've noticed more than a few reviews of this film that claim the movie doesn't accurately portray mental illness, and that it makes light of a serious issue. You cannot, in any way, blame the film for this; it is a story, to be enjoyed or not, not a documentary on the mental disorders of the main characters. Keep that in mind."

","I remember seeing the trailer and wanting to watch this movie. The roles of a bipolar man and a nymphomaniac woman interacting was appealing<br/><br/>The mental illness aspect was overplayed in the trailer yet was very shallow and almost irrelevant. The dialogue seemed forced and pointless at times. The occasional outbursts from both Rob and Tiffany was decent but the interaction between them was disconnected. Rob was aloof, coming across as wooden. And Tiffany seemed disengaged throughout. Not a believable relationship at all.<br/><br/>It seems using a popular name like Hemingway draws interest but it really added no substance to the film. The premise of Rob being stuck pining for his wife was good, however, the acting deliveries were cringeworthy. I saw this movie on a top 10 list and shuddered.<br/><br/>The movie may be worth seeing for a fresh change of story and new elements to character background. Be warned though that the pace and story devolves half way through and the ending is despicable."

","Silverlinings Playbook begins on an uneasy feeling, a man (30's), Pat, is released from a mental hospital, picked up by his mother, who is adamant about getting him out of there asap. Pat has some anger issues that become too violent at times, threatening society.

The attraction is captured brilliantly and effectively. Love at first site pours off the screen. Follow this with a witty emotional script about love in this prescribed modern life.

It is a very pleasing time to recognize someone you could be with for the rest of your life...no questions...in silence, a look, a recognition of yes...risen from melancholy and regret.<br/><br/>A beautiful film to watch again, in segments. It is definitely trying to say something under the surface. Refreshing, fun, and potent. Great acting and casting was dead on.

","As nearly as I can figure, Harvey Miramax likes his movies to start out all edgy and unconventional, as long as they turn into feel-good fantasies by the end, and David O. Russell likes raucous ensemble comedies with everybody yelling and shvitzing and running his program. Russell must've loved the idea of a compulsive father and a bipolar son under the same roof, and De Niro's OCD bookie dad more than earns his keep, but son Pat, the film's protagonist, is kind of a misconceived character, and Bradley Cooper struggles to make him seem like more than just a screenwriter's sock puppet.<br/><br/>Bipolar or not, Pat's a mixed-up, messed-up guy who's had to whittle things down to a few basic concepts, which works okay as a survival strategy, but tends to make everything he does and says seem selfish and simple-minded-for reasons too ludicrous to go into, e.g., he has a manic temper tantrum when he finds out that Hemingway's ""A Farewell to Arms"" doesn't have a happy ending. Aussie actress Jackie Cooper is great as Pat's underprotective mother, and Jennifer Lawrence is a powerful presence in the manic pixie (or, if you prefer, the depressive freakazoid) dreamgirl role, though her big scene, which takes place in De Niro's crowded living room, gets ruined by excessive mugging and stagy ad libbing by the supporting cast.<br/><br/>I'm emphasizing the negatives here because this multiple Oscar-nominated movie is really a pretty decent mainstream romantic comedy; it loses some momentum before the big finale, in typical romcom fashion, and really only deals with the subject of mental illness in a very skittish and sitcommy way. I would have liked it a lot better if I hadn't been led to expect something more insightful and original."
"gau_white","8","1","3","10 June 2013"," Enjoyable movie that gives you a good laugh and a strangely beautiful love story.
","Since the first time I saw the movie poster in the tube station, I'd been feeling all excited about seeing Silver Linings Playbook without having the faintest idea what the movie is about just because of one simple fact: I'm a big fan of the two main actors: Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. I guess we have been all familiar with them since The Hang-over and The Hunger Game climbed up the Box Office chart last year. I can't remember since when I've been going crazy about Bradley (so crazy that I even watched Case 39 just because he had a tiny role in it!) but I fell in love with Jennifer right the moment Katniss appeared on screen – absolutely a hit! However, I didn't think Jennifer and Bradley would look good on screen together – Indeed, I was a bit worried that this combination would not work and I should have just waited for the DVD instead of wasting money on the cinema – not only because they kinda belong to two different generations but also because of their previous choices of characters that are not so harmonious. Turned out I was so wrong! In a nutshell, Silver Linings Playbook is a very enjoyable movie that promises to give you a good laugh and a strangely beautiful love story.<br/><br/>Silver Linings Playbook tells the story of a former teacher, Pat (Bradley Cooper), who returns home after 8 months in a mental hospital for the bipolar disorder. He tries to prove to people that he has got his life back and now he makes attempt to get back to his separated wife who cheats on him with the History teacher that he almost beat to death when he caught them. Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) is a widow of a police officer who still suffers emotional and intimacy problems from her husband's death. She lives at the garage of her parent's house which she turns into a dance studio to practice for a dance competition. The competition is what brings the two characters together as Tiffany offers to help Pat to reach to his wife on one condition that he has to be her dance partner. Generally, the movie emphasizes on family bond, hope, love and happiness as written in the name: Silver linings that appear in both Pat and Tiffany's life when they find each other.<br/><br/>At first I thought it was a psychological movie so I kind of prepared myself for 122 minutes of deep breathing and heavy cloud of serious thoughts. In fact, it was a romantic comedy which was perfect for entertainment on a Friday night even though the romance seems to outweigh the comedy. Anyway, there is still psychological stuff going on as each character offers something very unique and believable to the movie. They all have problems – compulsive-obsessive, bipolar, addition, mood swing but their imperfections are indeed what makes the story perfect. We are not robots. We are flawed. But there is always something different and special in each individual that we can offer the world. Those are the details – the color, the condiments, the diversity that make our life so beautiful, that give us our freedom to be ourselves. Again, I fell in love with Jennifer as Tiffany at first sight as hers is a dark, unstable, disturbed portrayal of a widow who is very straightforward, bold and strangely cool. She has a surprisingly good chemistry with Bradley on screen as I love every single minute they are facing each other – always something very unexpected and enjoyable.<br/><br/>The first few minutes of the movie is probably not very interesting as the comedy does not really work and there is nothing much going on. However, as the story went on, I started to be hooked and before I realized it, I laughed my butt off and felt like I was a character in the movie. It really got me – not just the two main characters and their struggles but also what's going in that world, the family, the life. What makes this movie so likable and highly rated is that it is so believable. There are many situations involving extreme emotions that could have been awkward and fake but the casts pull it off so well. I actually cried towards the end of the movie as the romance starts to blossom. I could see myself in Tiffany and her situation, I felt for her and I was so moved and at the same time disbelieved at the happy ending. Perhaps, It was indeed too good to be true but it was, in the context of the story, the only way out for both of them, Tiffany and Pat; that is Love.<br/><br/>It was also probably the only flaw of the movie as it started to reveal the romantic and comic nature of the genre. The shift was not as persuasive and deep as it should have been and the ending was a bit of a cliché. I think Jennifer was relatively more convincing than Bradley in this but probably because her character mostly acts upon his actions, therefore it's more natural. Whereas Pat's obsession about getting back with his wife should have been developed more so that it would be more reasonable when he switches his affection to Tiffany. However, it was still acceptable and watchable. And overall, it is just a minor drawback of a touching, funny and hugely enjoyable movie."

"Ziya90","8","1","3","9 May 2013"," In spite of some minor flaws, the silver playbook shines
","When I saw the name as the director of the film, I was almost sure that this film would be an offbeat romantic comedy and I was right! However, it doesn't mean that the movie is perfect or that great. You know, David O. Russell is a story teller, not a minimalist, not a formalist, it has advantages and disadvantages both. The main advantage is that he tells his story well, but the main disadvantage is that his movies are lack of any art form. I mean watching his movies is like reading a book or listening a story, not cinematic experiences. In the end, I wasn't impressed by the film cinematically or artistically, but liked the story and loved the characters. Depending on his style, his director identity, the story of the movie seriously exhausted me which I can see as a flaw, but the story and the characters saved the film for me. I didn't expect metaphors or deep character studies from the movie, but the movie could have been deeper anyway. This is a sincere film first, it doesn't play to the crowd, but as I know, it has been criticized as it is a formulaic film. Well Yes and No at the same time. The problems, but all of those were minor, of the movie for me are for example the movie was not devastating or intense enough. Yes, this is a romantic comedy, but I would have preferred a The Fighter-like film. At least darker than this film. In other words, this might have been a really depressing film, but it is not. This movie reflects some habits of the director too, for example there is a ""merry"" family similar with the family in The Fighter etc. As for De Niro, with all my regard, I believe that the actors who were the golden actors or legends of their ages don't play that great when they are old (most of them) Chris Tucker who gave a mind bending performance in The Fifth Element seems out of place in this movie, but the actor adds energy into the movie. Bradley Cooper is pretty good, but sorry not great. As for Lawrance, my first Jennifer Lawrance movie was X-Men First Class and I couldn't warm to her honestly and I thought that she was a bad Mystique in comparison with amazing Rebecca Romijn, but in this movie, I almost fell in love with her and even her crazy character. I loved her character too I confess. She shines, she steals the show from everybody! By the way, a beautiful little detail I caught in the movie was the movie hadn't evil ex wife cliché, it was different (see it and decide for yourself) The dance competition stuff may be makes the movie cliché and conventional, but also sweet and realistic. By the way, it reminded me Little Miss Sunshine. However, the motivations of the characters, their inner worlds aren't handled well, insufficient and a little shallow. We understand them, but we can't enter their inner worlds. The movie has not any problem about emotional involvement, but, not deep enough. I can't feel that these two people are desperate losers or stand for any kind of character in real life. And we witness their life with independent sections, so we cannot internalize the film totally, but all these doesn't affect the whole film much. By the way, it would have been much better, if the film had ended a few minutes earlier. Silver Linings Playbook is still a very good movie for what it is."
"adityamurti79","8","1","3","7 May 2013"," Everything in the movie is about mental breakdown, and slowly and steadily, and quite comically you make sense out of it. You relate to the method in the madness.
","Its a stressed out world indeed. And we are all stuffed inside this pressure cooker, dreading from the fact that we might grab too much of that mid flab, frantically transferring the balance on that god damned credit card to flash that Steve damned i Phone.<br/><br/>We have husbands and wives cheating on each other while they had acknowledged their unconditional love just the night before. We are super informed and more aware, except for two things. A substantial lot of us could be ""undiagnosed bipolar"" or a ""superstitious OCD"".<br/><br/>I know you might have never realized that, but that's what this movie does to you apart from making you marvel at the creative genius of the script writer, the director, and the acting cast.<br/><br/>There are Hollywood movies with a pent up storyline, and compelling and dramatic performances jazzed up with an out of world graphical realism. They most certainly come with the wow effect.<br/><br/>And then once in a while you have a farm fresh movie with a simple story but crazy characters. An Indian psychiatrist (Anupam Kher) preaching his patient about the importance of Excelsior and medication. The protagonist patient (Bradley Cooper) working on his strategy for his previously undiagnosed bipolar disorder. Jennifer Lawrence as a self proclaimed and widely acknowledged slut with her own bipolar and medication to take care of. Robert De Niro in what he does best but with an added superstitious OCD as he is out of job and has been betting his balls off in American football.<br/><br/>Behind these characters is Bradleys mentally challenged desire to get back in shape and win his wife back who has been remorseless about getting hotter under the couples hot shower with another man. Jennifer is the one worth her salt by being the only one in the movie to confront this mental craziness with her overpowering bipolar.<br/><br/>When you have a once in a while farm fresh movie where everything is about mental breakdown, and you are watching it and slowly and steadily making a sense out of it. This, not through a nerve wrecking and nail biting storyline, not with a slapstick overtone, but through madly interwoven edgy characters. When you love it because you understand and relate to the method in the madness even if its remote. It is then you realize the creative genius of Silver Linings Playbook.<br/><br/>The movie is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Its right there in the league of The Tao of Steve, The Royal Tenenbaums, The Darjeeling Limited, Jeff Who Lives at Home, and Our Idiot Brother.<br/><br/>It's only a lot crazier and a lot more better.

","While I don't think Silver Linings Playbook was quite worthy of all the praise it got from the ""experts"" and the academy, it was still a very good movie. Bradley Cooper is absolutely fantastic. This is by far the best role he's ever had and he shows that he really is a very good actor. Jennifer Lawrence is also incredible. Not only is she stunning but the range of her acting abilities seems to have no bounds. A lot of that range is shown in this film and, while I can't confirm that she did in fact perform better than the competition, I can say that her role was flawless and I can't argue her winning an Oscar for it. The supporting cast was also great with Robert De Niro and Chris Tucker, among others, providing added depth to the movie. The only flaw I had was that it dragged quite a bit towards the middle/end portion. It started great and ended great and most of the middle was very entertaining but from about the 60% to 80% part of the film it did feel a bit sluggish. Nonetheless, the dialogue and character development keeps you intrigued so I think most people would appreciate the movie."

","Before I even begin on the performances, this movie paid attention to the small details, helping to create a captivating story that almost brought my first movie tear. Things like transitioning from a still shot to stedi-cam so smoothly because it's motivated by a character movement. The way the story line takes you in and out of healthy and unhealthy, stable and unstable, and for someone experiencing this for the first time, until the Hollywood ending, you can't really tell what is going to happen next. Diving into the tender topics of bi-polar disease, gambling, domestic abuse and all of the things people try not to talk about at the dinner table. Then to compliment it all, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence each with a pair of grand slam home runs in the bottom of the ninth. Cooper honestly made me frustrated he played his role so well; At one moment he's good and ""cured"" then next he's still obsessing and believing things are going to happen that aren't and it is so beautifully photographed, it takes you in and doesn't let you turn your head away, brilliant film."

","I really liked the acting and the script. The movie was good overall. I have to stop at good and can't go to very good. Nobody in this movie was a clear thinker. I can't believe the romance that ""blossomed"" between Pat and Tiffany. They started out using each other, and they ended up in love. I left the movie thinking they had an unhealthy connection that was far from love. They might end up killing each other. The biggest turn off in the movie was the racist scene at the stadium parking lot. This scene definitely had no place in the movie. The dance scenes and the music throughout the movie made me feel something for Pat and Tiffany. I don't think they felt anything other than a sense of replacement for those they lost."

","Pat (Bradley Cooper) is released from a psychiatric hospital and moves back into his parents' house. He has been diagnosed as bipolar and has a restraining order against him by his ex-wife, Nikki (Brae Bee) He wants to get his life back and constantly looks for silver linings to let him know he is on track. He meets a somewhat damaged Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) but is still obsessed with Nikki and wants her back. <br/><br/>So what we have here is troubled boy (Pat) meets troubled girl (Tiffany) and can these two negatives make a positive? What makes this work is the dialogue between the two because when one has nothing to lose one becomes brutally honest. And, that is what we have here and it was most refreshing even with numerous F-bombs flying everywhere. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper must have bought a Flobee (google it) as his beard is always the same length throughout, but the beard was necessary to give his face some much needed definition. Good move. He does a good job and he needs to stay with drama and leave those unfunny and raunchy HANGOVER movies behind. They made Jennifer Lawrence look a little Goth, but once you look into those eyes you instantly fall in love. When she delivers her lines it's like she is talking directly to you. The chemistry between these two works only because of her eyes. When she is on screen, you don't see anyone else. (Hey, we fell in love with her when we saw Winter's Bone. Nothing has changed.)<br/><br/>A very good supporting cast is bolstered by Jackie Weaver (Pat's mother) and Robert DiNero (Pat Sr) who does probably his best work in years. Pat Sr is an avid Eagles fan but has lost his job and now makes book and this plays into the movie's outcome.<br/><br/>Danny (Chris Tucker) who was also in that psychiatric hospital with Pat keeps getting released, or so he says, but the cops always find and return him. He was okay even though he was given subdued lines. What happened to the Chris Tucker we liked from those Rush Hour movies? Subdued lines and Chris Tucker don't mesh. Hey, we had Pat rant and rave when he was off his meds and everyone was afraid of him, why not Chris Tucker when he's the best at that and he does it with humor? They could have found a way. Bummer.<br/><br/>There is a twist in here (it's a good one) and you could see it coming from miles away and this is where the love story really takes hold. The highlight of the movie is the dance contest that Tiffany talks Pat into practicing for and actually performing in. As we (and they) go along we just cannot understand why Pat cannot see that silver lining - he keeps looking for - that is before him all the time. <br/><br/>All in all this is excellent, but the dialogues all around and Lawrence's eyes make it so.<br/><br/>Silver Lining Playbook was nominated for Best Picture. Bradley Cooper was nominated for Best Actor. Jackie Weaver was nominated for Best Supporting Actress. Robert DeNiro was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. David O. Russel was nominated for Best Director and Adapted Screenplay. Jennifer Lawrence was the only one to come away with an Oscar: Best Actress. Well deserved. (9/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes, some at the football game; and Pat goes berserk a lot in the beginning. Sex: No. Nudity: Briefly a female backside only Language: Yes, mostly in the first half."

Then the film went into a total different mode that all of the sudden became an all too predictable standard feel good Hollywood movie. The ending was rather silly and did a disservice to all of the exceptional actors especially Bradley Cooper and Jackie Weaver. It really did feel like two movies were spliced together and it is a real shame as this film had the potential to be a classic that would have resonated with audiences for years to come."

With a supporting cast like De Niro, Weaver and Chris Tucker, there was no way this film could go wrong. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper makes the movie real.

","The deserved Oscar-nominated, Bradley Cooper and Oscar-winner, Jennifer Lawrence are the two actors that made this film a phenomenal success. <br/><br/>The change of their maturity and relationship of their usual characters came quite a shock for me when watching this. Bradley Cooper seems to be the guy more at an upper level in many ways and more out there like Limitless, Hangover, Wedding Crashers and The A-team. In this film its amazing how he can portray a character that's has a great disadvantage in life and is trying his way to recover. He expresses more emotion in this film and better than any other of his previous movies and that is what got him the Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is a actress who has become a real star so quickly in this industry. After watching this film a couple of days after seeing the Hunger games for the first time shows on what a great actress she is from playing a 17-18 year old born survivor to at least a 5 year older recovering widow with great distress in life. That I believe is what got her the Oscar this year. This is I think her first movie of her getting to play someone much older and be able to express her full potential as an emotional actress.<br/><br/>I must admit I am not someone who usually watches these kind of films with an essence of romance even though it was a comedy but the comedy was something that made you laugh inside and put a smile on your face. I also can't remember the last time I shed a few tears for a film especially at the end. I am also glad to see Chris Tucker again which we haven't seen since the Rush Hour films with Jackie Chan with also a rise in his sense of maturity from his previous characters."

","What a great story. Diseased however, by the plot dictating the characters actions, instead of the plot manifesting from the characters. It really seemed like as soon as the main character did anything wrong, the police showed up. There seems to be a theme pattern in movies today that portray a character's wrong doing by immediately showing the punishment for the action. This falls short of realism and destroys the credibility of a what looked like a fantastic movie. I think it is possible that cops do not have to turn up every time something emotional happens. People can neutralism situations themselves. I found this very unreal and tarnished the movie."
"balyan-rahul","8","1","3","16 March 2013"," In a boringly sane world, a bit of madness is something to celebrate
","I am coming late to this film – after it got 8 Oscar nominations (with all 4 acting category nominations), and after a 22 year old Jennifer Lawrence winning the best actress award. I found it to be heart-warming story which approaches love and life with disarming honesty and directness.<br/><br/>The setup is unconventional – a guy chasing his illusion of love in a confused state of mind, and a woman struggling to overcome her sexual addiction while surrounded by men who are preying on her weakness. They both are trying to come to grips with their lives while living with imperfect families, imperfect friends, having imperfect relationships – and soon one forgets who has the mental disorder here. The film doesn't try hard to fit any particular genre; it is more serious than a rom-com or a chick-flick, but does not make heavy weather of the struggles of its characters battling their mental illness. The soundtrack really stands out and lifts many key moments to the music ranging from from Led Zepplin, to Bob Dylan, to Stevie Wonder.<br/><br/>The acting by Jennifer Lawrence is deserving of the Oscar and her skills are far ahead of her young age. I was a bit disappointed by Robet De Niro, he seems to have lost the edge totally and is falling back on the sort of roles he has done in the past. Anupam Kher plays a convincing part and its great to see him get his due for his talent.<br/><br/>In a boringly sane world, a bit of madness is something to celebrate. Must watch – 8.5/10 (from www.rahulbalyan.com )"
"preston-luther","9","1","3","14 March 2013"," A Silver Lining to the Rom-Com Genre
","After enjoying the best directorial success of his career with ""The Fighter,"" David O. Russell continues his success with his new romantic comedy ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" which he wrote and directed. But unlike your standard Hollywood rom-com, Russell adds dimensions to his characters and their relationships at a level that crafts them not as mindless characters who answer to the screenwriters, but as real people with real emotions.<br/><br/>Having said that, this film undoubtedly belongs to its eccentric characters and the actors that portray them. The film only goes as far as Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence can take it. Fortunately, they both deliver outstanding performances that earned both of them Oscar nods from the Academy. Cooper plays Pat Solitano, a bipolar fellow who recently suffered a breakdown after discovering his wife Nikki cheating on him. Lawrence portrays Tiffany Maxwell, who like Pat, also suffers emotionally after the death of her husband. Both Cooper and Lawrence give performances that differ from their normal roles, requiring each to depict individuals who externally display their psychological and emotional issues and possess internal disarray as well. <br/><br/>We follow Pat Solitano as he struggles to accept his failed marriage with Nikki. He attempts to remain positive in order to discover a silver lining in his life, but really only in the hopes that it may lead him to a reunification with Nikki. Actually he winds up meeting Tiffany, with whom he agrees to participate in a dance competition in exchange for delivering letters to Nikki. Throughout their relationship, we see Pat struggle with his desire to reconcile with his wife and his developing feelings for Tiffany at the same time. The true joy of watching the budding relationship between Pat and Tiffany comes from the acting and the dialogue. Russell does not have them spew out thin, ordinary lines but rather complicates them and makes their dialogues intriguing and indirect. <br/><br/>Pat also must deal with the existing relationship between his superstitious father Pat Sr., Robert De Niro, and himself. Pat Sr. possesses psychological issues of his own in his obsessive compulsive behavior when it comes to the Philadelphia Eagles. He turns television remotes in unusual positions, always carries his handkerchief, and incessantly begs Pat to watch the game with him. The complex relationship between Pat Sr. and Pat revolves around the struggle of each to deal with the others psychological problems. <br/><br/>A lesser film might mishandle the relationship between Pat Sr. and Pat and have it come off as one dimensional. Russell does the opposite, however. He superbly handles their scenes and through excellent writing adds depth and layers to his characters and story. One particular scene I'm thinking of involves Pat Sr. waking up Pat to go to the Eagles- Giants game and telling him ""I want to do anything I can to get you back up on your feet. That's the whole point."" Perhaps Pat Sr. does not simply view Pat as a good luck charm but rather desires to spend time with his boy in order to help him through his troubles. This father-son moment adds another dimension to the relationship between Pat and his father that works to emotionally enthrall the audience. <br/><br/>Now does this mean ""Silver Linings Playbook"" avoids any romantic comedy clichés? No. The film does play to certain conventions of classic Hollywood cinema. But that fails to outweigh the strong, captivating dialogue, the multi-dimensional relationships at work, the tremendous, heartfelt performances, and the overall splendid direction of David O. Russell."

","My best friend who is a female in her 30's and my 22 year old little brother are both bipolar. Watching not just Pat struggle with his disorder but everyone who is in Pat's life also struggle with how to deal with it definitely hit me close to home. The presentation was so true and real that it resonated with me, the way you sometimes hear veterans talk about a perfectly done a war movie. This film captures the struggles that go along with loving someone who is affected by mental illness. You're not just watching these characters live their lives but you find yourself completely filled with empathy as if you just received an adrenaline shot. Having watched my little brother throw out relationships with people over the years, I found myself rooting for both Pat and Tiffany in a way that I almost never get caught up in modern movies. Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Chris Tucker are all absolutely perfect. I recommend this film to anyone from any walk of life but you especially have to see it if you have anyone in your life that you love who wrestles with mental illness. I haven't FELT a movie like this in years."

","With this film, Jennifer Lawrence won the Oscar for best actress in a strong performance as the main protagonist in showing how she handles a very difficult role of insecurities, psychological conflicts, loneliness, a dysfunctional environment and the shared moments with a bipolar partner. I did not like (or understand) the film in its integrity due to the local theme and the mood it was transmitted in a very ""American"" way containing: the admiration for football, the strange mood of protecting society from patients with mental problems, aggressiveness in the conversation .... finally jokes, slang were not easy to grasp, much less to understand his humor if the viewer did not live in United States for a while ..... this causes you to lose much of what was presented. The music, the performance of the main actors and De Niro as a father is great, but still, I did not enjoy at 100%l.

"shaankhan-u","9","1","3","28 February 2013"," EXCELSIOR..That's what this Light Hearten Rom-Com is all about.
","O Man!! The last time I had the same feeling after watching any movie was with Frank Capra's IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT (1934), De Sica's Ladri Di Biciclette (BYCYCLE THIEVES), Hayao Miyazaki's Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi (SPIRITED AWAY) or Shoojit Sircar's VICKY DONOR (2012) among few. These movies make me feel fresh after watching them. They kinda make my day. The life is already hard, and then movies like this work as a sheer relief to the hectic schedules and overload of work.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies where you can sit with popcorn and coke, relax on a lounge and enjoy the evening with one of the most fine Rom-Com of this year. The most appropriate movie for spending a quality time with your loved ones.<br/><br/>It is a happy-and-gay-feel movie where you need not try hard understanding the complications of it, you can just lay back and go with the flow as the movie promises a 110% entertainment. Its easy, smooth, fun, decent, clean, cheerful, light-hearten and beautiful.<br/><br/>BRIEF STORY & CHARACTER SKETCH<br/><br/>The movie deals with Pat's (Bradley Cooper) life after he gets discharged from a mental asylum. He is on a Restraining Order. He is completely devoted towards her wife who left him now and they are not living with each other. In the whole movie he struggles to get to Nikky, his wife in several ways while he comes across many harsh realities of life and explores the love. Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) is a widow who finds solace in sex with almost everyone she meets, which has a really touching reason of doing so that she explains later in the movie. Pat Sr. (Sir Robert De Niro) is Pat's father who is a typical old man and is very superstitious. He is a bookmaker and a die-hard EAGLES fan. Dolores is Pat's mother who is again a typical old lady and want everyone in the family to be happy and at peace. And last but not the least is Dr. Cliff Patel (Anupam Kher) who is a psychiatrist (Pat's Doctor) and also a motivational source behind helping Pat & Tiffany to be friends with each other. The film is a light hearten one and hence the story does not revolve around a major plot but still never loses the beauty in its simplification.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW<br/><br/>David O. Russell has already proved himself as a director with lot of potential in THREE KINGS and THE FIGHTER. And this time he excels and out-stands all his previous works with SILVER LINING PLAYBOOK. Here he delivers his best execution till date with nice and decent camera angles and with a pacy, nice, crisp yet descriptive screenplay which he wrote himself for the screen. The production design is something to praise for and the editing by Jay Cassidy who also marvelously edited 'Into The Wild' (2007), its top notch this time as well. Bradley Cooper was at his equilibrium peak (specially in the scene where he tries to find his wedding video.) and could have been a clear academy award winner for Best Actor if Lincoln would not have happened this year. Jennifer Lawrence was at her best and Sir De Niro was as expressive as always with his evergreen expressions and natural yet flamboyant nature of acting, rest of the cast is also a great support as well and provides the expected performances. And the best thing in the movie - the background score - the music of the film by Danny Elfman, its so appropriate and soothing. For those who read the novel by Mathew Quick, trust me guys its still going to appeal you like all fresh.<br/><br/>RATING<br/><br/>I will rate this flick 8.5/10. Its truly one of the best films this year. And a must watch for all those who are looking to spend 2 hours watching a 'time-worthy light-hearten' movie with a shelf line. David O. Russell made it to the hearts of all this time which he lacked with his previous ventures and a vital support to help him in this if not the only one is Bradley Cooper. My man, this film goes to your performance. Two Thumbs-up for the movie!<br/><br/>Nudity : NO. Sex : NO. Language : GOOD enough to watch with kids. Drugs : NO. Violence : NO<br/><br/>*UNIVERSALLY VIEWABLE*"
"jenifer-m99","10","1","3","22 February 2013"," This is my friend, with an ""F""
","I have to admit, more often than not I disagree with critic's choices for Oscar Contenders. I especially didn't expect to love Jennifer Lawrence's performance so much. But the hype about this film is 100% accurate. <br/><br/>When Pat and Tiffany first meet, I thought she was just as crazy as Pat does. Not just the ""eccentric"" kind of crazy, but completely bat-s**t crazy. But as you get to know her, and understand how she has gotten to this place in her life, you just want to give her a hug. I think it would have been easy for a young actress to try to over-act a character like Tiffany. But, Lawrence's understated performance depicts an isolated and misunderstood girl who had to grow up too fast when she lost everything that mattered to her. She shows us a girl with a tough exterior who just below the surface is a fragile and frightened child who doesn't want to be alone anymore and it is positively flawless.<br/><br/>The story is fresh and extraordinary. It gives a behind-closed-doors look at the stigma of mental illness in a way that doesn't beg for sympathy. It shows how everyone's family is a little dysfunctional and even a ""normal"" person could snap if given the right conditions. The moment Pat Sr. realizes that his initial opinion of Tiffany is completely wrong is priceless. She seems to be the only person who isn't afraid to tell him what he needs to hear. Instead of going postal like we would expect, he surprises everyone and we witness his realization that maybe what he (and his son) need isn't more medical mumbo-jumbo, but someone who doesn't pull any punches to try to appease them. I think at first, Veronica wanted to set Tiffany & Pat up to keep them both from bringing their messy pasts into her pretty new house. But following Pat's meltdown in front of the theater, it becomes apparent that what they're both in desperate need of is a friend who understands them. Lookout Jessica Biel, Rachel McAdams, Emma Stone, and Amanda Seyfried; America's new sweetheart has arrived and after this Sunday, she will likely have the words ""Academy Award Winning Actress"" in front of her name."
"jane_dutoit","7","1","3","18 February 2013"," Is it a good movie? Yes. Is it Oscars good? Not even close.
","In essence, Silver Linings Playbook was a good movie. The actors were good, the script was good... But really, that's all it was. It didn't move me to tears, or even any sort of heightened emotional plane. It just.. was.<br/><br/>I thought by not seeing the trailer I would avoid over-hyping and then being disappointed later on, but alas, this was not the case. The rather lacklustre trailer pretty much echoed the film in its entirety.<br/><br/>First of all, I'm baffled as to why the movie is even called Silver Linings Playbook. He mentions Silver Linings a handful of times.. And doesn't speak anything of a playbook. So. That confused me. I at least thought it might have been about writing down his ""Silver Linings"" moments, but no. Even the notion or symbolic nature of a playbook or anything wasn't even present... So whatever. It was just him muttering about it now and then. If anything the film should have been called ""Excelsior"".<br/><br/>The acting was good. Bradley Cooper went further than he has before and Jennifer Lawrence was consistent as usual. Their performances were good, and the whole cast was too, as a whole. But did any of them really move me? Make a connection with me? No. Honestly, the best cast members were the supporting roles, and I was left feeling underwhelmed by the leads. The only one that came close to being interesting and who really BECAME his character was Robert De Niro. In my opinion, that's the only Oscar the film deserves - his supporting.<br/><br/>Also, as an editor I find it ridiculous that this film is even considered for an Editing Oscar. The editing is alright, but nothing to write home about. There were multiple continuity errors that took me out of the moment.<br/><br/>The story, apart from being a bit confusing in terms of the whole silver linings/excelsior stuff and a few plot points that fizzled into nothing, was good. It was a sweet and simple, touching story. The ending was a bit rushed and lame (I would have preferred it to have just ended at the concert at the end), but eh.<br/><br/>Also, as someone with mental health problems, I did expect to have more of a connection with the film. Alas, I didn't.<br/><br/>All in all, I did enjoy it. But would I see it again? Probably not."

","Director David O. Russell also adapted this winning screenplay from Matthew Quick's novel about a young man from Philadelphia at a crossroads in his life; just out of a mental institution and living with his parents, he's determined to reconcile with his estranged wife while staying off medication and keeping a new, positive outlook in order to rebuild his world. Mercurial, chatty, funny, intimately-felt and acted comedy-drama could well be Russell's most commercial enterprise yet, though one which still contains enough prickly edges to make the shifts in tone both wonderfully erratic and unpredictable. The opening scenes are broadly drawn, however the characters are a likable group, and Russell does a terrific job at sweeping the audience up into this amusing and volatile scenario (with recognizable dialogue and behavior reverberating throughout). The cast is uniformly excellent, and Russell (as both director and writer) never drops the ball, keeping his pace lively right down to the wire. ***1/2 from ****"
"walterbruno","6","1","3","15 February 2013"," A talented failure
","Strong points first. The film is a re-casting of the Rocky story. With a background in working-class Philadelphia, it deploys football and betting as substitute imagery. A strong cast makes the most of their witty and oddball lines; dialogue is contemporary and properly self-conscious and often very funny. Excellent cast and casting add production value. The film starts strongly and concentrates on details of character. A usable story line brings it all together, if rather predictably. Weak points next. This film is ostensibly about a father and son; in reality, it's about their women. That's because the writers know next to nothing about the male mind, ethos, or condition. This is a film written and produced from a male-feminist mindset. The football imagery is overdone, thudding, artificial, and excruciatingly cliché. The film is somebody's clever conceit, not a viable concept. The betting imagery is overwrought and far too clever to ever work. There isn't a female character in the story who isn't strong and wise, fragile, but unbreakable. There isn't a male character who isn't chatty, kooky, dependent, self-absorbed, foolish, aggressive, brutal, or just plain dull. The men couldn't survive 10 seconds without their gals, or without dreaming about them. In the end, the conceit gets tiresome and insulting to the audience. A film destined for Gender Studies and social edification."
"armin-durakovic","9","1","3","3 February 2013"," An inspiring movie - ripe for an Oscar
","I am not much into drama or romance movies, but once in a period I watch one, and I have to say that I really enjoyed and was very moved by Silver Linings Playbook. It's not one of these classic romances where You wait, from the beginning of the movie to the very bitter end, for the main characters to develop a love story and that's it. It's different and it excites the viewer until the very end. I was expecting a total different plot, and was delighted by watching it, because it wasn't at all predictable like it usually is in that kind of movies. The characters are developing their relations very realistic. The moods of Pat's (Bradley Cooper) bipolar disorder give You an insight of a mental disorder and You never know how he will behave in the next scene. But after all, he is smart and develops a strategy by having always a positive attitude, so the dramatic scenes are never depressing, but tense. By the first half of the movie I was so much into the main character, that I realized what Bradley Cooper was really capable of. In his previous movies he had absolutely different roles, like the confident, macho leader in ""Hangover"" opposing to this role, where he is a soft, but moody teacher, who is afraid of his emotions. He is indeed an recognized actor that deserves the Oscar. De Niro's acting was very impressive. He had always a serious and caring attitude as Pat's father, but due to his sarcasm in severe situations, as well as his football fanaticism, he always brought me to laugh. Jennifer Lawrence had a nice performance. With this movie she proved that she is capable of acting in more serious roles. I don't think that they could find better actors for this movie. It's worth to watch!"
"Troy_Campbell","9","1","3","1 February 2013"," Beguiling, poignant and affecting.
","Of all the movies released this month, SLP was in the lower half of my 'must-see' list. The trailer was decent and the cast were all attracting awards buzz, but I just didn't think it was my kettle of fish. When I'm wrong, I'm really wrong; this charming little picture from David O. Russell (The Fighter, Three Kings) absolutely swept me off my feet. Russell, who also penned the script, strikes a perfect blend of drama and comedy throughout, using the humour to open up the characters which subsequently adds more poignancy to the serious moments. It's an affecting tale regardless, but it's hard to imagine it being quite as hypnotic on screen without Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence as the lead couple. I was beguiled every step of the way by Cooper's bipolar-affected Pat and Lawrence's off-kilter widower Tiffany, as they spark up an unlikely friendship that endures the whole gamut of emotion. Both nommed for Oscars – as well as Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver for their parts as Pat's parents – Cooper will understandably struggle to beat his counterparts but don't be surprised if Lawrence walks away with a Golden Baldie, she deserves it."

I thought the first part of the movie was very slow and I found it a bit disturbing but once the second half kicks in, the first part takes on more meaning and it all comes together perfectly. It reaches Chick Flick status at the end but I can easily look past that. I have watched it a few times now with different people and it gets better each time! I have seen every other movie up for the Oscar this year and this movie blows them away, not even close. We are all entitled to our own opinions so give it a one star if you feel that is accurate (? some have) but this movie was worth every penny and in a day and age where 90% of the movies are not worth watching it was so refreshing to see this."

Bradley Cooper was an excellent choice for this film, and he is really worth the Oscar nomination as his performance is graded 10 out of 10.

","Wow!! This is the first word that comes to my mind. <br/><br/>It is a wonderful story of love and emotions. The movie revolves around Pat (Bradley Cooper), a man who has had issues with his relationships, making him go through some mental trauma, leading him to being sent to an institution, from where his mother is finally able to get him out. A chaotic marriage with his wife, Nikki; where he has been trying to get back in spite of a restraining order, ever since his last violent outbreak. An up & down relationship his father, played by Robert De Niro, who is retired and spends his time and money on betting on football games, being a ardent fan of the Philadelphia Eagles; which is one of the only thing keeping the family together.

The screenplay is brilliant; backed by some excellent performances by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence (she is great like always). There scenes together are wonderful. Other cast did well too, especially Robert De Niro. After this movie, I'd have to say that Chris Tucker (plays the role of Pat's friend and, was in the mental-hospital with him) is an extremely under rated actor, and I felt that he could have been utilized/direct much more. <br/><br/>The film takes you though a wonderful journey which can best be described, only when you see it yourself.<br/><br/>Overall a great watch, one my best this year.

","This is an inspirational movie about how two broken souls found each other and heal each other by their love for each other. It also sends out a very important message – that there is life after every tragedy, every broken heart. Although I realize in real life, life doesn't always have a happy ending. This is also a film about family, friends, love, compassion, understanding and helping one another. Every characters has their own life problems, while trying to live with their own life/problems and somehow remember to look around and give their support to a friend in need. I especially like the ever-so-patient friend (John Ortiz), of his love and support for his bipolar friend I was never aware of the intensity of the mental pain and anguish suffered by a bipolar until this film. Through this film, I learn more about bipolar, how it affects the life of the patient as well as those around him i.e. the family and friends.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper gave a very good portray of a bipolar, for once, we could get pass his good look and concentrate on his acting instead. I would like to praise Jennifer Lawrence for her role as a depressed young widow. She is very convincing and has the potential of a great acting talent. I could only imagine how depressing and painful it is to be a widow at such a young age, at of the pain and guilt of losing that someone you love so dearly and so suddenly.

"chaos-rampant","Null","1","3","27 January 2013"," Paradox, delusional narrator commits to dance
","The Oscars are famously fuddy in a cinematic sense. So, having earlier this week murmured at the snubbing of Moonrise Kingdom, I am now pleased to see this film take its place in the lineup. Part of me is not convinced by some of it, for instance that we should be shown in films the achievement of a perfect happiness as the ending depicts here, if you will a happiness that is happiness because it is perfect. In reality, things rarely fall into place but that shouldn't preclude happiness of the present moment, being whole now with just this whatever it is, in a Buddhist sort of way. <br/><br/>But on with the film. <br/><br/>I come to this as a viewer steeped in narrative dissonance, paradox and asymmetry, these are all things I value in the films I see, in particular when those are carried in a visual way—the Japanese are masters of this, try and track down the seldom-seen All About Lily Chou Chou. <br/><br/>The story here is that we follow a distressed group of more or less delusional people who suffer the usual social frictions with an unusual acuteness, precisely the fact that things are not into place but broken, and through the film overcome their damaged selves to come out on the other end, still more or less damaged but whole. In truth, we all walk through life with delusional expectations of the ideal life, this is just comically exaggerated in this group. <br/><br/>This is most clear in the football-obsessed father, who outgrows his compulsive disorder that in order for his team to win, things or people have to be in a certain place, in a certain order. They don't, life fluctuates. It can go either way. The acceptance of this fundamental truth is what in my eyes sets this apart from something like The Descendants, a touristy film that mistakes manufactured beauty (linked to memory as a Hawaiin postcard) for purity. <br/><br/>The beauty is all in the recognition that things are damaged, dissonant, incomplete. Which brings me to my main point—all of this is wholly carried in the narrative in a visual manner. <br/><br/>The obvious first. The narrator is clearly delusional—to that effect throughout the film the camera is tightly screwed at eye-level, intensely prowls as he does and bursts into views. The narrative has a bipolar energy, with mood swings all over the place. In that vein, I would have liked more swings in the mood, in the 'color' of the camera, together with more visual narration, but so be it, the film is dialogue-driven first, plot-focused. <br/><br/>This type of first-person camera I have elsewhere remarked that can achieve the literary effect of stream-of-consciousness, of consciousness hovering in and off itself, where what we see is not necessarily 'real', but as Malick exemplifies and Herzog before him, can lead to ecstatic perceptions of 'real' intensity. <br/><br/>The filmmaker is aware of something along those lines, you will see in the scene where the man attacks his father in the wedding video scene, that suddenly remembered images from the earlier assault that was the breaking point burst into view. <br/><br/>In line with bursting views, mood swings, and the acceptance of a dissonant life is the dancefloor climax—things fall into place when you commit to the dance together, the dance as love, but this doesn't have to be the ideal dance as you'd normally expect, a 5.0 will do. <br/><br/>And in the actual dance, we have abrupt swings from ballroom jazz to rock'n'roll, from normalcy to how these people experience feelings. The dance reflects who these people are together, a little sloppy but committed. <br/><br/>That's all more than enough. What makes it so enjoyable though, and ultimately exhilarates, is that the whole is continuously stitched with paradoxical behavior. I only recently discovered Lubitsch, whose famed 'touch' was about exactly this. <br/><br/>The finale still bothers, but I can write it out of my mind. This is good stuff."

Well, I actually thought his work was well measured and his performance was strong. Jennifer Lawrence and De Niro were well deserved nominees too.

Well directed and even Chris Rock had to act and not rely on comedy. The story was pleasing and showed the real nature of Bi-Polar disorder in a well informed manner and David O Russell has worked hard again. An excellent piece of work."
"cadfile","7","1","3","18 January 2013"," Just Misses Being Oscar Worthy
","Movies about people with mental illnesses isn't my usual thing unless it is a documentary. Family dysfunction played for laughs can be entertaining. I liked Silver Lining Playbook even though the main plot wasn't my usual taste. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence did a good job. I don't think the film is worthy of the Oscar nominations it got but it was worth the money I spent on the ticket which is a good thing.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper plays Pat, a man who has finished a stint in a mental health facility after an ""incident"" involving his wife and another man. He has previously undiagnosed Bi-polar syndrome but decides to will himself better so he can return to his wife and former life. He tries to maintain a positive attitude even to the point of delusion. Due to the terms of his release he is forced to move back in with his parents, played by Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver. Pat's mood swings result in waking up his parents to listen to random rants in the middle of the night and to then tune out when his father berates him for a trivial slight.<br/><br/>De Niro's Pat Sr. has some issues of his own. He's a bookie with an obsession with sports superstitions while Weaver's well intentioned Dolores tries to gloss over and ignore the family issues simmering below the surface.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence plays Tiffany who tries to cope as a young widow of a police officer by sleeping with everyone she comes in contact with. She lives with her parents as well but in a renovated detached garage. Her family which includes her sister Veronica, played by Julia Stiles, have their own dysfunctional issues. Veronica is a demanding wife driving her husband Ronnie, played by John Ortiz, into fits of rage he takes out on random objects in the garage.<br/><br/>I really liked how all are these people seemed broken in one aspect or another from irrational dependence on superstitions to using sex as a coping mechanism. I think it might have been boring if Pat and Tiffany were the only ""crazy"" people in the film.<br/><br/>The acting seemed real and natural but I did have issues with some of the funny moments. Some of the comedy fell flat to me because it was too absurd for the situation. The laugh out loud moments were few and far between for my tastes. I know it wasn't trying to be a sitcom but the pacing seemed off where I was put off guard during some of the comedic moments.<br/><br/>Another issue I had was some plot holes. For example it seems all the main characters seemed to know each other before the time set in the film but in the beginning it seemed they didn't know each other. I got confused. Pat Jr. knows Veronica because she is his BFF Ronnie's wife but he barely knows Tiffany even though she lives in the same neighborhood. Pat walks Tiffany home from Veronica's then walks home himself? Those moments didn't make sense. Then there seems to be more with Pat's mom, Dolores, trying to get Pat and Tiffany together but it's only mentioned in passing late in the movie like maybe there was a scene or two taken out.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on the tacked on character Danny, Pat's friend from the mental hospital, played by Chris Tucker. He either was added at the last minute or maybe his appearance in the film was cut back in editing because he seems so under used in the film for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>However, the last 30 minutes made the film for me and washed away many of the problems. I really liked the ending and it was satisfying.<br/><br/>I think this film got several Oscar nominations because of writer/director David O. Russell and probably because many Hollywood types see themselves in Russell's dysfunctional world. I think these kind of films don't push the envelope hard enough and I get bored with quirky ""crazy"" people.<br/><br/>I just don't find movies about people with mental illness to be entertaining. It is a fine line to walk and while I applaud Russell for the attempt, I think ""Silver Linings Playbook"" falls short of the goal posts.<br/><br/>I don't think the film is Oscar worthy but it is above average and worth the ticket price I paid."

","This story isn't really to innovative and so is its presentation. It all reminds more of a normal American family that lives on the edge. And this exactly is what makes this so lovely and great. You would think that Robert de Niro who always plays brilliantly does the best acting and has the best character here. Or maybe Bradley Cooper, who already has proved his abilities lie beyond partying in movies like Limitless.<br/><br/>But really, the one who touched me the most was the character Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence. Her story and the things she did and told because of that made so much sense in so many ways. Every move she made, every emotion she gave just everything about her character was very well provided by an incredible acting job, one sure worthy of an Oscar.<br/><br/>If you do not wanna watch this movie by now, you might as well never watch anything meaningful in your life again.

","This is a movie that hits all the romantic comedy tropes: the meet cute, time spent circling each other, montage where they grow closer, epiphany, overcome some obstacle and kiss at the end.<br/><br/>It's a traditional formula. So, why is it so good? Because it subverts what makes these tropes unbearable. The meet cute is an agonizing, awkward scene. The time where they circle each other is heart wrenching. The montage is fraught with truly touching moments of growth. And when they beat the odds and finally allow themselves to fall for each other, it is a beautiful, touching scene that you, in spite of seeing from the beginning of the movie, want to actually cheer for these two characters.<br/><br/>It is all rooted in the performances. David O. Russell tells a story that draws you in because of the relatability of these characters as the try to come to grips with some very serious situations. But, what is most beautiful about this movie, is that this movie never shies away from the ugliness that these characters are capable of. You know they are good people, but they are dealing with significant mental issues. Which makes the climax and epilogue that much more beautiful. You feel like these characters have earned their happiness, not just stumble upon it like so many movies.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful movie that has a tremendous heart to it."
"jmoney-2","9","1","3","17 January 2013"," A raw, honest and funny comedic drama about two broken people who help fix each other.
","If you watch a game with a die-hard Philadelphia sports fan, you may think they're bipolar. One minute they're on cloud nine. One bad play later -- they're in the depths of despair. Most Philadelphians who are crazy about sports aren't really crazy. But Silver Linings Playbook is about one Philly sports fan who does in fact happen to have a serious personality disorder.<br/><br/>This isn't a movie about sports, though. Sports are merely the motif for a raw, honest and funny comedic drama about two broken people who help fix each other.<br/><br/>The movie set in 2008. We know this because of several real-life sporting events referenced throughout the movie event that myself -- and many other Philly sports fans -- remember well. (I loved that there's an entire scene built around a discussion of DeSean Jackson's infamous goal line blooper.) Bradley Cooper, himself a native of the Philadelphia suburbs, plays Pat Solitano, a substitute teacher who returns to live with his parents after spending eight months in a mental hospital. He's desperate to reconcile with his wife, who has gotten a restraining order against him. Things get complicated when he meets a beautiful-but-troubled young widow named Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence. Both have seen their lives unravel -- one because of a mental illness, one because of a tragedy. The movie is about getting closure, about letting go, and about finding that silver lining.<br/><br/>Cooper gets to show more range and paint with a broader pallet than his usual leading man roles have allowed, and he takes full advantage of the opportunity. Robert DeNiro plays Pat's father and he gives the kind of terrific, moving performance you expect that from an actor of his legendary status. Lawrence is also quite good. The true revelation, however, is comedian Chris Tucker who has a small role as one of Pat's fellow patients. He gives a subtle performance that seems far removed from the brash persona he became known for in the Rush Hour movies.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast and crew do their jobs well. Danny Elfman's jazzy score is one of his best, and a great soundtrack that features everyone from Led Zeppelin to Stevie Wonder supplements it.<br/><br/>Director David O. Russell (who adapted Matthew Quick's novel) specializes in movies about troubled young men and their families. In the Solitano family, life is centered on sports. Russell understands what many who don't appreciate sports often fail to grasp. Loving sports is not just about the love of the game – it's about being part of a community, it's the way fathers and sons bond with each other and how total strangers find common ground. When Pat speaks of his fondness for Sundays spent watching football, he talks as much about the game day food his mother's cooks as he does about the game itself.<br/><br/>Pat's personal motto is ""Excelsior,"" which is Latin for ""ever upward."" He's an optimist who believes he can improve himself and better days are ahead. In other words -- as every Philadelphia sports fan knows -- there's always next year."
"richcarter1962","10","1","3","16 January 2013"," Somewhat Uncomfortable to Watch
","First you may wonder why I have given a movie a 10 that was uncomfortable to watch, let me explain. Both Bradley Cooper's acting and the writing for this part was ""dead center perfect"". I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder about 25 years ago now, and have taken every drug mentioned in the movie at one time or another. So this movie had a very direct connection for me. It was uncomfortable for me because in some of the scenes I could very clearly see myself. Also the drugs do take a while for your body to get adjusted to, and do make you feel fuzzy until they do. The compulsion to find his wedding video was another scene that made me cringe a little because of the pain that Pat (Bradley Cooper) feels and the exasperation that his parents feel while trying to deal with him.<br/><br/>Now on to the movie, the dialogs were ""real"" I mean really real not movie real, those same discussions that Pat has with his Dad (Robert Dinero) have probably occurred in more living rooms across the country than one could even imagine. I think this is the most acting Dinero has done in a long, long time. Most of his movies these days are played way over the top often for comedic effect. This role he plays just right, he's not a perfect dad nor is he bad Dad. Like most Dads he is struggling to understand his son, who doesn't even understand himself.<br/><br/>In case you've been living under a rock or don't get out much, Jennifer Lawrence is the ""real deal"". She is the next big thing in Hollywood. She was very good in The Hunger Games, but she really gets to stretch her acting muscles in this role. Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) is a deeply flawed person, you get to witness this in her first scene in the movie. The way she peels away the layers of herself mostly in soul bearing scenes with Bradley Cooper.<br/><br/>This movie will probably not do well at the box office, because not one person gets his head chopped off, no cars turn into robots, and not a single person is tortured with a drill to the eye. If you want to see a movie that strikes a chord as being about something real, and characters that by the end of the movie you will find yourself deeply invested in, then do yourself a favor and see this movie."

Jennifer Lawrence took just another firm step in her promising career. Anupam Kher was pretty good also in a major role!!! David O. Russell, in his vibrant direction, brilliantly deals with the mentally special ability issues. Yeahhhh, Surely Cooper played one of the best leading roles in 2012. But wellzzz, it was not such extra-ordinary movie to create the hype of getting the massive eight Oscar nominations!!!"
"ghost_dog86","8","2","10","29 November 2012"," All Eagles fans are nuts!
","I really enjoyed this romantic comedydespite the fact that I'm a Cowboys fan (and that's saying a lot).<br/><br/>Maintaining an overall tone that is both dark and witty, while at the same time quite touching and genuine, ""Silver Linings Playbook"", aside from being my early pick for best ensemble cast of the year, proves (once again) that even though writer/director David O. Russell is responsible for ""I Heart Huckabees"", there is still hope for him as a filmmaker (and no, I didn't like ""The Fighter""). Using the backdrop of an eccentric Philadelphia community obsessed with the Philadelphia Eagles, this movie tells the story of a man who is recently checked out of a mental institution (played by Bradley Cooper) by his mother. In an attempt at a fresh start and with hopes of getting back together with his ex- wife, he must illicit the help of a widow, who might be crazier than him (brilliantly played by Jennifer Lawrence). ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a breath of fresh air within a genre that is normally riddled with predictable Harlequin romances, starring a neutered Zac Efron or crying Channing Tatum. In short, in case you didn't know that these kind of films existed, this is a romantic comedy that in turn, is also a very good movie. <br/><br/>As far as comedic entertainment value goes, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" isn't always laugh out loud funny, but makes up for it by having an extremely well crafted storyline, with its entertainment roots strongly grounded (for the most part) in reality. And this aspect is only accentuated about 30 minutes in by the chemistry that Lawrence and Cooper bring to the screen, as they interact in some of the most genuinely intriguing back and forth's seen in any film this year; in any genre. <br/><br/>While I'm on the subject, allow me take some time out to elaborate on some of the standout performances in this film. First off, Cooper gives a performance that finally proves that he can act (calm down everybody, ""Limitless"" wasn't all that) playing a character with mental illness in very Jack Nicholson-esque fashion (not an award worthy performance, but still pretty damn interesting to watch). I must also make it a point to say that Chris Tucker, who only plays a bit role as the seemingly pointless token black friend character, plays it with such enthusiasm, injecting much needed doses of comedy sporadically throughout the movie, that by the end, he may have many audiences asking themselves ""where has Chris Tucker been for the past decade?"" And maybe the most surprising aspect of this movie is how, after an assortment of awful career choices (to the point where nobody under 18 thinks of him as one of the greatest actors of all time) Robert De Niro, playing the father with OCD, finally gives a performance that doesn't feel like he's phoning it in. As for the most stand-out performance, the award goes to Jennifer Lawrence (see what I did there?) giving the BEST PERFORMANCE OF HER CAREER! You heard me. That's right ""Winter's Bone""/Sundance snobs! As the equally eccentric (and ex-slut) foil to Cooper's character, Lawrence plays the role with unabashed vigor and something to prove, in a performance which will hopefully garner enough attention from the Academy to obtain another Best Actress nomination; but this time, for a good movie. <br/><br/>The only hiccups in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" occur in its final act, when a lot of the genuineness is lost, as the story becomes a sort of contrivance; BUT an entertaining contrivance. What all of that means is, the generic romantic comedy pot hole which this movie falls into in the final 20 minutes (having to do with drastic life choices being solved with a competition) will probably be dismissed because of everything good that proceeded it. <br/><br/>Final Thought: From the lively acting, to the gritty low-budget feel that O. Russell brings to the screen, to a script ripe with undeniable believability (also adapted for the screen by O. Russell) ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is no doubt the best romantic comedy of the year. And, as I alluded to before, is a film which in every way supersedes the chick-flick, Katherine Heigl norm, translating into a date night movie which can be enjoyed by either sex; and even by the Bradley Cooper fans who think ""The Hangover"" was ""the greatest movie ever, Bro!"" <br/><br/>Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

","Pat is a man who has just been released from a mental institution after serving 8 months on a plea bargain. He was committed because after he came home early from work one day, heard his wedding song playing and found his wife banging the history teacher in the shower. In a momentary lapse of judgement and an obvious crime of passion, Pat nearly beat the guy to death. Upon getting out of the institution, his main goal is to rebuild his relationship with his wife, who now has a restraining order on him.<br/><br/>Enter in Tiffany, who is a recent widow. Her husband got hit by a car after going to Victoria's Secret to buy lingerie for his wife in hopes of spicing up their sex life, which Tiffany had turned off after 3 years of marriage.<br/><br/>Then you have Pat Sr. and Dolores, Pat's parents. Pat Sr. has lost his pension because of the financial crash and now runs a bookie business and his wife supports him for doing so. Pat feels that his son is a good luck charm and wants him to stay close during Eagles games as his presence helps the Eagles win.<br/><br/>Then you have Pat's friend who has made big money because of the financial crash by flipping houses. But with the this new found wealth he feels stressed, restricted and ready to bash things at any given moment.<br/><br/>There are other bit characters in the film as well and when you throw all this into the blender and you have one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert DeNiro give outstanding performances and I believe all three will get Oscar nominations this year. All three of them simply own these roles. But more than just the incredible acting, this is an incredibly emotionally engaging story. In here you have two very damaged people who find ways to help each other. And even though Pat might seem to be a loose cannon, if you look at the people around him, they are no different. I have always believed that humans walk a fine line between sanity and insanity. There's a Tragically Hip song called Thugs that says, ""Everyone's got their breaking point, for me it's spiders, for you it's me."" Profound in that I believe this to be true. We do all have our breaking points. For Pat, walking in on his wife and seeing another man performing with his mouth on her private parts in the shower, while his wedding song was playing, was enough to push him over the edge. And if that is what it takes to send you over that precipice, how do you recover? This movie explores that journey, and it's not an easy one. Pat doesn't get better over night, or after 8 months or even after spending a few months with Tiffany. It's hard work, but eventually, the human spirit will find ways to mend itself.<br/><br/>I have a friend who gained 150 pounds in a matter of about 18 months. He used to be model good looking. And then something or rather several things tested his mettle. And he lost. For 8 years he kept the 325 pounds on, he drank, he smoked and he was lazy. And then one day he just woke up and decided he'd had enough and he lost the 150 pounds and stopped smoking and drinking and now he's back to his old self. It's like Pat in this film. He has to work at it. The human psyche is fragile and sometimes it needs to reboot. This film is that journey to reboot.<br/><br/>In a way, this film reminds me of Perks of Being a Wallflower....but for a different age group. Both are in my top three of the year. One is about discovering who you are at a young age and the journey that ensues. The other is discovering who you are at an older age, and the journey that ensues to make yourself better. Both are brilliant and poignant and brought a lump to my throat.<br/><br/>Silver Linings also brought a tear to my eye. It's truly a remarkable film.<br/><br/>One final note. There is some criticism from a vocal minority who say it goes typically predictable or cliché at the end and I disagree with this completely. It is the opposite of cliché. This is a film about a journey and to have them not end up together would be a travesty. Their courtship and ultimate pairing was part of the journey to make them whole again. That is not cliché, that is just brilliant writing.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Silver Lining Playbook<br/><br/>Starring: Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro<br/><br/>Synopsis: After losing his wife, house and job and spending eight months in a mental institution, former teacher Pat (Bradley Cooper) now trying desperate to prove to his wife and win her back that he has made a lot of changes in his life for the better. When Pat is introduced to Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) everything becomes more complicated as he finds her to be very mysterious and with equally as many problems as him. <br/><br/>Review: The film opens after the events of what brought Pat to be institutionalized and we're not given any answers to why, when or how from the beginning making him a hard character to like from the start although it is a story that follows Pat and not being given any time from him you quickly find a likable side to him, despite what's happened. Whilst trying to get in to shape and begin his life again with his family and trying to reach out for his estranged wife, Pat gets invited to a dinner with friends and meets Tiffany a recently widowed and mysterious woman. From anger management problems, OCD and a drive for perfection, being introduced to all the characters via Pat's eyes and drip fed information about their character traits and flaws you'll even start question what actually constitutes ""crazy"".<br/><br/>An unlikely pairing of characters between Tiffany and Pat does keep you intrigued as the story flows and as deeper truths are revealed and why they're helping each other to stay away from their own demons. A film like this with a talented cast from Jackie Weaver, Robert De Niro and Chris Tucker provide equally as interesting additional characters as the leads themselves. If you ever thought that Bradley Cooper or Jennifer Lawrence were not good at acting, I believe this film will prove you wrong. To star in a film playing a troubled character is a difficult task, however playing a trouble and likable character is almost impossible last seen portrayed well by Jack Nicholson in ""One Flew over The Cuckoo's Nest"". I don't think it's a film for everyone and not a typical comedy-drama at all. <br/><br/>Watch this if you liked: Lost in Translation, Shopgirl or Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist.<br/><br/>Verdict: Not a film for everyone I understand, however if you like a film that makes you think and keeps you entertained that's actually believable this is a film I'd strongly recommend."

Both delivered amazing performance that makes you think they are really the characters themselves. Bradley Cooper plays a man suffering from bipolar illness, a very different from his usual roles. This shows how versatile an actor he is. Jennifer Lawrence as usual never picks a role that failed. All her movies have been brilliant. A must watch movie."
"aharmas","10","2","10","23 November 2012"," Damaged Relationships
","About a week ago I saw all these mentions of possible award recognitions for both Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper. Lawrence's inclusion didn't surprise me because I had seen her memorable work in this year's ""Hunger Games"" and her turn in ""Winter's Bone"" a couple of years ago. Cooper's puzzled me because he is famous for his effective but lightweight turns in comedies and a disappointing serious turn in an earlier 2012 film. My interest was piqued, but I was hesitant because Russell's ""The Fighter"" didn't exactly thrill me. That perception certainly didn't prepare me for a most pleasant surprise in ""Silver Linings"".<br/><br/>""Linings"" doesn't give much time to prepare for its intensity. From its earliest frames, Bradley Cooper makes a formidable entrance, giving us a preview of how troubled and disturbed his character is. In other films, we have seen the actor's tricks and desperate call for the audience to admire how good they were. None of that is here. Bradley's physical moves and powerful stares justify the character's history. It's not surprising the neighborhood isn't welcoming back. Even his own family who loves him dearly, hesitates in getting closer because the man is a walking time bomb.<br/><br/>Bradley's performance is more powerful and accessible than the one Phoenix gives in ""The Master"". It's direct, clear, with a pain we can relate to because it has clear origins, and it resonates with rawness. We can sympathize with his ordeal, even when we don't understand why he fell so hard and resists people's help. Just when we are getting ""used"" and involved in this man's story, we meet another bruised soul, and there is fire to match in Tiffany's (Lawrence)acting. She is, in fact, giving a quieter performance at first, but we can't look away because there's something daring about showing her flaws and still finding room in her life to get closer to someone potentially problematic for her.<br/><br/>Both leads have fantastic chemistry, showing how each is drawn to the other by curiosity, physical attraction, and compassion. After all, they surely can relate to her painful losses. Much of the movie's pleasures originate in seeing how this partnership will turn out. We are not sure if they can handle each other, whether this is a good idea at all, and there is a sense of pessimism because we feel this couldn't turn out well.<br/><br/>The ads certainly promised humor in this film, and I kept thinking that such sadness and madness couldn't have any room for any of that, without diluting the power of the conflict, but there are moments when we'll have a laugh, which originates in the sincerity of the film's screenplay and how real the characters feel.<br/><br/>In all honesty, the film works because both Cooper and Lawrence are giving probably the best performances of the year. In fact, they're so good, they lift a fine supporting cast, and De Niro, as Pat's peculiar father manages to shine in a couple of scenes. There's something very satisfying about the ending, which is hard to envision at first, but we keep hoping for, as the relationship evolves. Be prepared to see one of the best films of the year."

","Saw Silver Linings at a preview screening just a couple of days ago. I wasn't 100% sure I wanted to go, but thought it would make for an acceptable date night with my wife. What a surprise! Brad Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Nero were pitch perfect. Avoiding the cinematic trap of becoming too maudlin over the problems of the romantic leads, the film was both funny and touching. The script had me guessing until the very end. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>I also have a slightly different perspective to add based on my professional experiences in the mental health field. The lead character's diagnosis didn't fit very well with his on-screen behavior. Portrayals of the hospital weren't 100% accurate either - but then they didn't need to be to move the story forward. Still, the film showed genuine compassion and respect for the struggles of the mentally ill. I especially liked the way that the story gradually revealed the deep quirks of those around the romantic leads. Mental illness isn't always a black or white issue - it's a matter of degree."
"DICK STEEL","10","2","12","12 January 2013"," A Nutshell Review: Silver Linings Playbook
","One of the films that received the largest number of Oscar nominations for this year's edition of the Academy Awards, Silver Linings Playbook is one uplifting film in a long while, centered around a bipolar disorder sufferer released from an institution after eight months, to reunite with family and friends. Director David O. Russell trades the boxing gloves in The Fighter for romance, keeping the triumph of the human spirit as one of the themes in this film filled with hope that all good things come to those who persevere.<br/><br/>While some may balk at the lead pairing of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence for their age gap, they blow away their critics sharing great chemistry and acting craft opposite each other, that you'd root for their characters to overcome several obstacles placed in their way that threatens to tear apart the good things they share, despite spending most of the time bickering with one another, sometimes due to the fact of their bluntness and directness<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper plays Pat, who suffers from bipolar disorder and got into trouble with the law when he discovers his wife's infidelity, Now out of a mental institution, he has a loose strategy of gaining back his life based on constant exercise and therapy, while finding himself having to spend time with his dad Pat Sr (Robert De Niro) who is trying his best to reconnect with his son through football, and Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), the sister of his friend's wife (Julia Stiles), who has the means to serve as his conduit to wife Nikki (Brea Bee), who had served a restraining order on him.<br/><br/>Much of the scenes here naturally gravitate toward the broken souls of Pat and Tiffany, which forms the main bulk of the story given their awkward nature toward each other, that slowly grows on you. With Pat, we witness his manic attacks when the right buttons and triggers get pushed, trying his best to keep some sane semblance of a life without inconveniencing his family, while Tiffany battles from depression, as well as a rotten reputation of being the village bicycle of sorts after losing her husband. It's a tale about two broken people having to find strength in each other, and to continue identify and acknowledge the good in the people who have hurt them, and it grows on you emotionally.<br/><br/>What made David O. Russell's work stand out, boiled down to the excellent casting, and eventual delivery by the actors involved. Bradley Cooper shows off his acting chops here without needing to be overly melodramatic, playing a man obsessed with getting back at his wife, and may be missing the forest for the tree if continue to be obviously blindsided to the attention of another. Jennifer Lawrence had proved before with Winter's Bone that she can handle smaller, more personal roles rather than the commonly rote, big budgeted blockbuster ones from First Class to The Hunger Games, and continues to show why her star is rising, and is one of the best actresses of her generation.<br/><br/>The rest of the ensemble also chipped in with wonderful performances of their own. Robert De Niro is probably the go-to man to play fatherly roles these days, and he doesn't disappoint with his Pat Sr having shown favouritism to his other more successful son. Trying his best to re-connect with Pat Jr, he does so in the only way he knows how, through that of a football game, with stakes raised when he becomes the bookmaker in order to save enough for the opening of a restaurant. Chris Tucker also came in now and then to work his motor-mouth and spew some of the best comical lines in the film, while Jacki Weaver as Pat's mom brings a little touch as any mother character would toward the son, wishing for him to be better, and playing the key role in getting him discharged, to be taken care by family instead.<br/><br/>Cinematography by Japanese Masanobu Takayanagi made Silver Linings Playbook seem a little bit like a documentary with plenty of hand-held scenes, while the soundtrack boasts an eclectic selection, with a score thrown in by Danny Elfman. Then let your heart be charmed by troubled people each seeking out a renewed chance to pick up the pieces in their lives, as well as the underlying romance in the movie. A definite recommendation, and clearly one of the highlights as best film."

","Let me start off by saying I don't usually watch romance movies, but I would make an exception if all of the other movies are like this one. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. It stars Bradley Cooper as Pat Solitano, a man with bipolar disorder who has lost everything, and Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany Maxwell, a recently widowed and troubled woman. The chemistry between these two characters is unbelievable. I honestly left the theater thinking I was Pat Solitano, and that I did have bipolar. Robert De Niro was in this movie, and he was spectacular. This movie was very well acted. Chris Tucker was in this movie and I was surprised that he did so well. If you don't feel like reading this, and don't know what movie to watch, watch this one. I hope it becomes an instant classic. The best part about this movie was the fact that you have a group of talented actors and actresses, playing the roles that you wouldn't imagine talented actors would be in, playing to the best of their ability. Any movie that combines sports, comedy, and Jennifer Lawrence, sign me up. I don't even think that I can review it fairly due to the fact that I can't make it sound as good as it is. This movie should win best movie of the year, hands down. I have seen Moonrise Kingdom, and as amazing as that movie was, it pales in comparison to The Silver Linings Playbook. I would give this movie a 12/10 or 120%, due to the fact that it is amazing. Its great acting and lovable characters just add to the charisma. I wish I could erase the movie from my head, go see it again, and experience the euphoric rush. This movie is like a drug, except it doesn't cause physical damage, or you don't feel bad watching this. I hope if you went to watch this film, you enjoyed this film as much as i did. See you in the next review."

"oOoBarracuda","1","1","4","23 March 2017"," Silver Linings Playbook
","I've been struggling with writing this review's introduction for days, mainly because the film is awful. I've never been enamored with Bradley Cooper, and I really can't stand Jennifer Lawrence, but Silver Linings Playbook garnered a lot of critical acclaim at the time of its release and I was open-minded enough to treat the film as a blank slate and experience it. The 2012 film by David O. Russell was a bleak attempt at an artsy romance with a twist that actually came out to be as mainstream as any other romantic film released. The film follows a man after his release from a mental institution as he attempts to readjust into society post-diagnosis. A narrative with no one to root for or any personality to latch onto, Russell paints a disgustingly ignorant picture of mental illness that one should receive an award for completing.<br/><br/>Despite medical orders and the advice of his doctors, Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) is discharged from the mental institution from which he was court-ordered to stay to the care of his parents. Pat is only released under the agreement that he stays with his parents and abides by the restraining order established by his ex-wife. Pat doesn't want to take the medication he is prescribed and believes that he can ""become well"" again largely by adhering to a physical regimen and strict reading schedule. His initial reaction is to re-establish a collection with his ex-wife, he's never taken his wedding ring off and believes that she will see her own flaws and eventually want to come back to Pat. As this possibility becomes more unlikely, Pat is set up with Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), the sister of a friend of his. Although initially non-responsive to Tiffany's advancements, Pat eventually agrees to partner with her in a dance competition she has signed up for. Through the practicing, Pat becomes less obsessive over the thought of re-marrying his ex-wife and sees the possibility of starting a new life rather than simply resuming his former life, despite Tiffany's manipulation.<br/><br/>Ugh. What a horribly lazy plot device--a dance competition that was so out of place in the film, a space landing would have fit better. Every character that we are supposed to care about is completely revolting, and I had no interest if any of their story arcs would work out for them or not. Did Hollister or American Eagle finance the film? It seemed like their glaring emblems were all I could see on-screen, especially during Robert De Niro's scenes. I don't know if the production team was too busy trying to create a fake-indie film that was actually incredibly mainstream to actually research mental illness but its portrayal was ignorant and offensive. The awful supposed twist ending was ridiculous. We were NEVER going to believe that his ex-wife had actually answered his letters. How do you root for a relationship based on mental abuse and lying to work out? I found nothing redeeming about this film and I hope to never even think of it again."
"ryklinker","8","1","4","16 December 2014"," Following his release from a mental institution, a man comes home to live with his parents. He soon meets a woman in the neighborhood, and they bond through their oddities
","Pat Solitano is an interesting man. The audience meets him just as he is being released from a mental institution after serving his time for assaulting the man who was sleeping with his wife. Though he remains aware of his problem, he refuses to take his prescribed medication, and he struggles through his time on the screen. With a mind disillusioned with the idea that his wife who left him still loves him, and that he just needs to talk to her, Pat is visibly incompetent of letting his past mistakes go. Although his parents do their best to point him in the right direction, he insists on trying to go back in time. When he meets Tiffany, he finds someone who he can use to send written letters to his ex-wife. As time goes on, however, he begins to realize that his past life isn't important, and that the present (Tiffany) is what he should pay attention to. Tiffany is troubled in her own way. Her husband was killed from a fatal car crash, and she hasn't been the same since. Looking for some form of solace and acceptance, she became, shall we say, a loose girl. She has made herself a vulnerable object, and she is desperate for a way out. Once she meets Pat, she finds someone who is suffering in his own way. Though at first their personalities clash, they soon find that the other is exactly what the other needs to go through life. Pat Sr. is a die-hard Philadelphia Eagles fan, or at least that's what he is on the surface. With dreams of a restaurant of his own and his savings on the line, the older man has become very frenzied with the success of his favorite football team. Although he denies that superstition has become a part of his game-viewing routine, he has exceeded the label of a ""crazed fan"". Although it does not initially come out, he truly cares for his son, and he soon puts his entire faith in his son's ambitions.<br/><br/>My Thoughts This is a film about people. Though the plot itself is somewhat basic, it is the people that flow through it that make it the great film that it is. On multiple occasions, director David O. Russell has been quoted as saying that he doesn't care how the script works out, just as long as the characters are presented in a manner that conveys the script's message(s). Though he had a relative success in Three Kings (1999), the director finally hit the big time following the back-to- back successes with The Fighter (2010) and Silver Linings Playbook. Like many other directors, Russell frequently works with the same handful of actors, and this grouping is quite an impressive bunch. Though he has just begun an undoubtedly promising career, the director has repeatedly worked with Bradley Cooper, Christian Bale, Jennifer Lawrence, Amy Adams, and Robert De Niro. If he can keep being at the helm of gem like he has done so far, I cannot see how he cannot join the ranks of the best directorial careers in cinematic history. The acting across the entire cast in this film is one of the best I've seen in a while. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are both brilliant in their portrayal of the complex Pat and Tiffany, and Robert De Niro delivers a performance that does not take over the movie, but it fits perfectly into the supporting aspects of the film. This film received quite a bit of critical attention, and it was nominated for 8 Oscars: Picture, Best Actor for Cooper, Best Actress for Lawrence, Best Supporting Actor for De Niro, Best Supporting Actress for Jacki Weaver, Adapted Screenplay, Directing, and Film Editing. Although the lone win was for Jennifer Lawrence, I found Cooper's and De Niro's performances to be very notable. I attribute this large amount of losses to the fact that this particular year in cinema featured a large amount of great films that were based on historical events, particularly Lincoln and Argo. Based on the mission to save Americans stuck in the Iran Hostage Crisis, Argo took home Best Picture, and as for Best Actor category, Daniel Day-Lewis took home the award for his performance in Lincoln. Though I mean this as a joke, it could also be a true statement; who isn't going to vote for Abraham Lincoln? I think that this film brings to the screen a great collection of characters, and I recommend this film for that same reason. Now I must warn you, the language is quite bad. Though the F-words do fly, they fly with purpose. Contrary to some films where curses are used as frequent as punctuation, this film only uses vulgarity when it is necessary to portray strong emotions and feelings. This is a film where you have to stay focused in order to acquire the full experience. Though it may be slow at times, it is the characters that drive this film, not the plot. A bit slow at times, and I have trouble accepting the fact that Pat Sr. would bet on his son's dance performance. I understand that this shows that he is caring for his son and what his son wants, but I found this a little too cliché for such a great movie otherwise.<br/><br/>www.sportsandcelluloid.blogspot.com"
"Rickting","8","1","4","11 December 2014"," A unique and powerful love story
","I don't normally watch romantic films as you know what's going to happen. Here, if you've watched the trailer or read a plot summary you haven't already seen the entire movie. It's just a drama about 2 troubled individuals and their resulting friendship, but it feels different, unique and moving. Silver Linings Playbook combines a lot of different elements: Mental illness, American Football, romance and comedy. It's a difficult mixture to get right and there are times when you're unsure whether you're meant to laugh or be moved. However, those moments are only sporadic and the elements blend together remarkably well. It's elevated by the acting: Bradley Cooper, after the disaster of The Hangover Part II, is extraordinary as Pat, although he's overshadowed by Jennifer Lawrence's awe inspiring Oscar winning performance. Even more satisfying is Robert De Niro giving maybe his only truly noteworthy performance since Heat. Every actor in the film does a good job overall.<br/><br/>With developed characters and strong dialogue the screenplay is finely written and goes to various extremes of its elements but manages to wrap up in a moving and believable conclusion. David O Russell makes a typical formula look far better visually than it would normally, and a best director Oscar may be on the cards in future for him. Inevitably it's quite a tough film at times and isn't the most original film out there but it's better than the overrated American Hustle. SLP is a very entertaining movie throughout its runtime and the acting and humanity of the script draws you in very quickly. It looks like it may be a fairly boring movie, but it's far more interesting than expected. Jennifer Lawrence is the star of the show, but Robert De Niro's return to form is great to watch. Sadly, he went and did Killing Season, Last Vegas and Grudge Match, but we'll always have Taxi Driver. Well deserving of its best picture nomination, this is a superior drama movie and it's not your average love story. That's a good thing though. Take this over The Proposal.<br/><br/>9/10"
"cynthiaumbersen","6","1","4","30 March 2014"," Another Movie that Glorifies Screwed up Hollywood Values
","This film had talented actors and a compelling story, but it ultimately validates the very dysfunction that caused such unhappiness in these characters to begin with. The film suggests that it's no big deal to forge a letter, lie to people you love to coerce them into doing what you want, and more. (Avoiding spoilers) In fact, it glorifies dysfunction and then suggests that more dysfunction is the way to ""heal"" and/or help a person. Huh? <br/><br/>How come the characters are perfectly fine with being lied to and betrayed? (They would likely have greater difficulty trusting others than most.) Answer? Screwed up Hollywood values. How sad that cultural rot is the cornerstone of pop culture today, and the measure of what is considered to be ""cool."" This image of America is what is exported to the rest of the world. <br/><br/>Hopefully, kids will find out through experience, (Since the media teaches them the opposite) that honesty, accountability and personal responsibility aren't old-fashioned, but fundamental to living a happy and fulfilled life."

","Bradley Cooper has a ""Silver Linings Playbook"" in this 2012 film directed by David O. Russell and also starring Jennifer Lawrence and Robert DeNiro.<br/><br/>Delores Solatano brings her bipolar son Pat Jr. home from a mental health institution, although it's not recommended by the doctors. She also didn't tell her husband, Pat Solatano Sr., who is now a bookie.<br/><br/>Pat Jr.'s history is checkered due to his illness. A former teacher, he came home one day and found his wife Nikki in the shower with another teacher while ""My Cherie Amour"" played on the stereo. He beat the man to a pulp. His wife has a restraining order against him. Pat Jr. is now in mandatory therapy but refuses to take his medication because it makes him foggy. He thinks exercise and good health are the way to go. The first time he goes to the psychiatrist's office, ""My Cherie Amour"" is playing in the reception room, and Pat trashes it.<br/><br/>One night he looks for his wedding video and can't find it. He wakes his mother up, which wakes his father up -- and ultimately the entire neighborhood and the police.<br/><br/>Delusional, Pat believes that if he gets in good physical shape, which he is doing, adopts a positive attitude and always looks for the ""silver linings,"" his wife will come back to him.<br/><br/>One night at a friend's house for dinner, he meets a widow and recovering sex addict, Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence). After a rocky beginning, Pat asks Tiffany if she will deliver a letter to Nikki. She will, on the condition that he is her dance partner in an upcoming contest. He reluctantly agrees.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful, entertaining movie with heartfelt performances by all involved. The film shows the difficulty in dealing with bipolar illness not just for the person who has it, but the whole family, and how in some ways it has ripped them apart. So there is healing needed for the entire family.<br/><br/>I remember when Bradley Cooper was on Alias. He was a cute young leading man with a pleasant personality who had obviously been picked up by a top agency, as he started showing up in movies. It turns out that he has a tremendous talent. His performance here is very honest as a man always on the edge who fights for control and is determined to meet his goals. ""You have to have a strategy,"" his therapist (Anupam Kehr) keeps telling him. Kehr is excellent as Pat's low-key therapist.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence does a great job as Tiffany -- some people don't like her acting style, which is very overt, but I do. She is very intense, I'll grant you, but she plays a woman with lots of challenges. Robert De Niro is superb as Pat Sr., with an OCD personality who has trouble communicating with his problem son.<br/><br/>Chris Tucker is Pat's friend from the institution who keeps discharging himself and getting picked up by the police and taken back. He's hilarious. Finally, Jacki Weaver as Pat's mother is delightful - a loving woman trying to reconcile father and son and keep the peace.<br/><br/>While some people found the ending formulaic, I loved it. I'm a sucker, so sue me.<br/><br/>A warm film, well directed."
"cannibal_corpse_59","9","1","4","20 January 2014"," A Great movie!
","Finally completed the movie. What can I say? Exceptionally good movie, Silver Linings Playbook is. The message of the movie was very well presented; that there is hope for people who are deemed as outcasts by the society. And how love can control even the harshest of illnesses. <br/><br/>Every actor in the movie was extraordinary; especially Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. Jennifer Lawrence never fails to amaze me. The ease with which she plays different roles is breath-taking; surely one of the best versatile actresses in the industry. A very well deserved Oscar for the lady.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper showed why he is one of my favourite actors; his performance was sublime - he showcased every emotion known to mankind in an exemplary manner, be it venting anger or oozing care. He did it all. He really deserved an Oscar for this performance.<br/><br/>And do I need to say anything about the legend Robert de Niro? I don't think I need to, but I still will: his character of Pat Sr., at times, seemed more crazy than Cooper's Pat Jr.. And he pulled it off brilliantly, as he has done for decades now. Actors like de Niro don't come every day, we should cherish him while we can.<br/><br/>A shout-out to Jacki Weaver and Chris Tucker for their amazing acting as well.<br/><br/>A 9/10 movie for me."

Not usual love between two people who went through a really awful period. In start, that love between Pat and Tiffany wasn't so bright, they were just a friends in start with a pretty similar past. Pat tried to impress his (ex) wife, he just came back from mental institution and he decided to start new life. And Tiffany still was depressed of death of his ex husband and he became a sex addict. Friendship got a new meaning when Tiffany realized that she and Pat got so many stuff in common and they might be a good couple, but Pat still was blind, he thought his ex wife will forgive him about everything he has done. Tiffany tried to open his mind, but no, he still was blind. After some time, Pat actually realized all ""signals"". But Tiffany was kind of disappointed, everything happened on final dance tournament when he told her what he thinks about her and asked her for having relationship.

"TxMike","Null","1","4","16 May 2013"," Good movie, deals with the heartbreaks in life and our searching for the Silver Linings.
","As are many good movies, this one is based on the book by the same name. My wife is an avid reader and finished the book not long before we saw the movie, in glorious detail and superb sound on Blu-Ray. She says the movie is basically faithful to the book, but of course has to leave a lot out to stay at an approximate 2-hours running time. One thing she mentioned in particular, as a change, Pat Sr. seems a bit more mellow and likable in the role De Niro creates for the movie.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper is the lead as Pat , and we see him coming back to his parents' home after an 8-month absence. After he had come home to find his wife in the shower, naked, with another man, he sort of went berserk and ended up in a mental hospital. But when he gets home, trying hard to use all of the tools he was taught to tame his bi-polar disorder, he continues to talk as if he and his wife will reconcile.<br/><br/>His good friends and neighbors, a couple, invite him for dinner and to meet the wife's younger sister, Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany . She has had a fairly recent tragedy, her husband died in an unfortunate incident. But Pat and Tiffany get along from the start as fire and ice, oil and water, vinegar and bleach. In other words, they clash. Usually in this type of movie it means they are actually meant for each other.<br/><br/>The movie has a really fine cast, rounded out by Robert De Niro as Pat Sr. He has his own issues, a bit 'OCD' having to arrange his remotes exactly a certain way on the table, and now running a gambling business of sorts, puts a lot of faith on 'karma', if Pat Jr. watches a game with him on TV, for example, their Philadelphia Eagles have a better chance of winning.<br/><br/>So basically all the main characters have serious issues, and the movie is about overcoming them and figuring out a way to make it through life and relationships. One thing I like is the use of dance as a catalyst for Pat Jr.'s recovery, he is basically roped in by Tiffany to learn a routine and be her partner in an upcoming dance competition. It also ends up getting tied to a gambling bet, but that is minor. The real idea is that people, and we see it also in autistic children, often an art, like dance or music or painting can help them overcome many issues and function at a higher level. Dance was able to do this for Pat Jr.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence received the Oscar for Best Actress for her performance as Tiffany, and it is easy to see why. At her young age she is already an acting force, and when you look at her various roles to date, all different, it makes sense."
"Ryan_MYeah","10","1","4","12 April 2013"," Led by David O. Russell's strong writing and direction, Silver Linings Playbook is a powerfully acted, meaningful little movie.
","In 2010, director David O. Russell ended his six year absence, and returned to the big screen with his knock-out hit (No pun intended) The Fighter, which managed a grand total of seven Oscar nominations, including wins for actors Christian Bale and Melissa Leo. Flash forward two years later, and his next movie is up for a whopping eight nominations, also setting a record as one of the only movies to ever have nominations in all four acting categories. That movie is Silver Linings Playbook. I've been anticipating this one for months, ever since it premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. Let me just say it didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Inspired by Matthew Quick's book, Silver Linings Playbook follows Pat Solitano Jr. (Bradley Cooper), a man released from a stay in a mental institution after catching his wife cheating on him, and beating her lover to near death. He's staying with his caring and worrisome mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver), and his obsessive compulsive Eagles fan father (Robert De Niro). Pat is hopeful, despite a restraining order, that he'll be able to reconcile his marriage, and that's only one of the problems that are running around in his mind.<br/><br/>As bad as Pat's problems are, he's got nothing on Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a recently widowed woman with whom Pat finds a kindred spirit. Tiffany strikes up a deal. If pat will compete in a dance competition alongside Tiffany, she'll deliver a letter to his wife explaining about his current situation.<br/><br/>Much like our central character, the movie is understandably prone to certain mood swings, balancing out between personal drama and laces of dark humor. This is a very personal movie for Russell, known for his own history of off screen controversy. The ease with the dramatic pace of this movie, the issues of familial turmoil, our main character's quest to reconstruct his life, the well timed wit, and a whole slew of fascinating characters is only part of what's done excellently by Russell, who drew upon his own experiences and that of his own son in writing the script. The mental issues are met properly, but through Russell's eyes, we also get to witness the vices of many of the other characters here, which ensure that the movie never gets boring.<br/><br/>Just as strong as he is a writer, Russell's direction is as fantastic as always. If there's one thing that can be said of the man, even in his weaker entries, he's always had a knack for extracting terrific performances out of all of his actors. The lead character on paper is only as good as his actor, and Bradley Cooper expresses every believable ache out of Pat Jr. Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver are typically strong as his parents, while Chris Tucker works with a nice little comic relief role.<br/><br/>But I know who you all really want to ask me about: Jennifer. Lawrence. I can say absolutely nothing about her that hasn't already been said. She steals this movie, serving as that perfect match for Cooper. The best parts of this movie are when we get to see the irresistible chemistry between these two, and Lawrence sells them all convincingly. This is such a peculiar, but very warm, sincere, and charming performance. One of her strengths is how well she conveys Tiffany's emotion, but at certain times, she'll even play it up to convey several at one time. She has one specific scene in a diner that left me unsure of how to feel towards her. Pitying, tickled, intimidated, uncomfortable? It's not common when I find a performance like that that makes me feel so many different things all at once. Lawrence is far and away one of the best performances of the year!<br/><br/>As such, Silver Linings Playbook is one of the best movies of the year, allowing O. Russell to stretch his legs with a challenge, and unqualified success. It's a sweet and meaningful little movie that should resonate deeply with many a member of its audience. Now if only Ernest Hemingway would stop triggering such negative reactions...<br/><br/>***** / *****"
"in_shahieras_prince","4","1","4","26 January 2013"," Motivationally Confused..
","Silver Linings Playbook - What a story of this Oscar nominated actor, Bradley Cooper was acted for? It seemed valid for the role but pretty confusing for the story. I mean, it wasn't really an entertaining movie, but the whole story was poorly elaborated. What was really happening, or what was actually happen then to his ex was unexplained. The story was hardly about fate or faith. Too much of impossibilities, but fortunately it was created creatively. It was adorable for Pat and his routine, and sweetly, when the whole story of getting his ex back, while keeping what (or who) he was with. One thing I love move about this movie was the motivational values it might represent to us, the viewers. Kinda okay, and it might deserve 4 to 5 stars.."
"haosstoposto","5","1","4","23 January 2013"," Could have been a lot better
","Sadly, it is not a comedy or a drama. And also sadly it is a very predictable movie. I was waiting a long time to see it and I am disappointed. These is not a single laugh to have and none of the story strands has been explored deep. We have different threads like mental illness, family problems, obsession, romance, lies and manipulations, broken girl, football and dancing and also two likable central characters but unfortunately the director misses his chance to delve into these opportunities. In short the story goes: Guy (Pat) leaves mental institution – he is still obsessed with his ex wife (Nikki) – girl Tiffany (also with mental problems) enters his life – she makes a scheme to be with him and win his heart and body – they dance together – happy end. Many of the motivations for characters in the movie are hazy at the best. In the movie we see that Pats mother helped Tiffany to be with his son but it is hard to comprehend why. Tiffany is well known in the entire neighborhood as a slut (maybe with a heart of gold, but whatever) and I don't think there is a mother who would like to have such a girl with her son. Especially when her son has mental problems. But that is not the only thing. We have therapy sessions"" with psychiatrist dr. Patel which are devoid of any therapy or insight or dialogue. We have football sessions with Pat's father (Robert de Niro) but we don't see a father – son relationship between him and Pat. We have dance sessions with a super-hot Tiffany but not much dancing is shown. Or passion. We have Pat's aggression problem but it's not much in this movie. It seems that the director took a little bit of everything and put it all together. All in all, a missed chance, watch it if you must. I give it 5 stars because between Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence there is without doubt chemistry."
"thesar-2","8","1","4","17 January 2013"," That's Bradley Cooper?
","If not for the terrific performances and depth to EACH character in Silver Linings Playbook, this movie would've tanked outside Oprah's OWN cable station.<br/><br/>Okay, yes, the story is very well done, as is the cinematography, music, dialogue, etcetera, but above all else is the wonderful performance by Bradley Cooper and I never thought I would say that. I am not a fan of his; in fact, he was my least favorite character in the Hangover series. But, here, he gives the performance of his career.<br/><br/>Notice how I didn't mention Jennifer Lawrence yet? Oh, of course, she's excellent. But, I expect that out of her. (I have yet to see her critically, and publicly, panned horror film of 2012, so in my mind, so far, that woman can do NO wrong.) Okay, I enjoyed her once again, but again, I already expected great things from her. I was shocked by how well Cooper played the bipolar hero of our story.<br/><br/>Recently released mental patient, Pat (Cooper,) tries to put his life in order by being positive and reclaiming his lost wife at his side. All the while, he's unintentionally testing his elderly parent's (and the police's) patience with his uncontrollable outbreaks and being wooed by the great, and almost equally messed up character of Tiffany (Lawrence.)<br/><br/>At probably too long of a length in running time, you know how this is going to pan out, but it's still suspenseful throughout because of the excellence of acting on the side of Cooper and his raging one moment to calm the next. I don't even know too many people with this problem, and yet, I know this is realism.<br/><br/>In addition to all the greatness I've spoken about, the movie is full of heart, comedy and great strides in performances from everyone involved, including Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver and yeah, even Chris Tucker. I did love his reoccurring character throughout.<br/><br/>Again, it's a tad bit long, especially since the end, while thoroughly welcomed, is foreseen. Overall, it's absolutely a delight and highly recommended."
"jaxbubba","8","1","4","15 January 2013"," A terrific, highly original film with exceptional performances!!!
","Kudos to writer/director David O. Russell (The Fighter / Three Kings) for doing an exceptional job getting extraordinary performances from his stellar cast. This is a film which has done the impervious task of securing Academy Award Nominations in every acting category, a feat that has been accomplished since Warren Beatty's ""Reds"" in 1981, and the first film to receive four acting nominations since 2008's ""Doubt."" The writing is brilliant, and the acting is radiant as Bradley Cooper (Patrick) and Jennifer Lawrence (Tiffany) light up the screen in this very original, highly entertaining romantic comedy. I really believe that Academy will reward David O. Russell for his Adapted screenplay of the Matthew Quick novel ""Silver Linings"".<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is definitely deserving of her Academy Nomination and Golden Globe win for Best Actress as Tiffany Maxwell in this film. A role I would have never imagined that this 'Hunger Games' star could ever pull off, Lawrence proves that she is a force to be reckoned on the Hollywood scene and a certified ""A"" list actress for this performance. The Tiffany Maxwell character is a certified nut case. Coping with the recent death of her police officer husband, Tiffany resorts to sex to cope with her stress.<br/><br/>Equally unparalleled is Bradley Cooper's performance as Patrick. Again, a role I would have never expected Cooper to be able to accomplish. The Patrick character is an undiagnosed bi-polar individual with moods swings and delusions brought on by severe stress, or in other words, 'he's cuckoo for cocoa puffs""!!! As the film opens, Patrick has been incarcerated the past 8 months in a psychiatric facility after he inadvertently walked in on his wife having an affair. <br/><br/>To round out this delicious cast of miscreants is Robert de Niro as Patrick's dad, Pat Sr. The Patrick Sr character is an obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) suffering die-hard Philadelphia Eagles fan, who is tremendously superstitious and has recently lost his job and pension. In order to make ends meet, Patrick Sr runs a book-making operation from his home. He has also been permanently banned from all Philadelphia Eagles home games due to an altercation in which he started a fight within the confines of the stadium. I really believe that the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor is a two horse race between De Niro (Silver Linings Playbook) and Tommy Lee Jones (Lincoln), both performances are worthy of their nominations.<br/><br/>I would like to acknowledge some very noteworthy cameo appearances in this film from Chris Tucker (who really needs to have David O. Russell direct him in a full fledge film). Tucker was funny, entertaining, and a joy to watch on screen. Also Julia Stiles role as Veronica (Tiffany's sister) was another fantastic performance, and Stiles never has looked more beautiful on screen.<br/><br/>My only drawback to this whole film would have to be the film's climax. After 110 minutes of some really great dialog, plot twists, some pure lunacy, and some really great acting. I feel that David O. Russell, just kind of phoned the film's climax in. The last 12 minutes of this film culminate at a Philadelphia Dance event in which Tiffany has wanted to enter all her life. We not talking 'barnyard' prom dance of ""Footloose"", or 'resort talent show' dance of ""Dirty Dancing"", but full fledge ""Dancing with the Stars"" Ballroom competitive professional Dancing. A sequence painful to watch; both Cooper and Lawrence were uncomfortable at best on the dance floor and I literally cringed during their pinnacle 'lift' move which had Jennifer crouch area awkwardly situated in/on/at Cooper's face (it really reminded me of the ""Police Squad"" movies sequences where Leslie Neilson would have OJ Simpson's crouch in his face for comedic relief) to make matters even worst, the recovery move was equally excruciating to endure. However, I digress<br/><br/>Again, I truly enjoyed this film. I highly recommend seeing this very original film with fantastic performances from a stellar cast. Well deserving of all the pre-season award nomination accolades/attention that it is receiving."
"dgefroh","9","1","4","15 January 2013"," Silver linings is ""GOLDEN""
","This movie is getting a whole lot of buzz with nominations from both the Golden Globe and the Oscars. With that powerhouse backing most movie goers will trust that this is indeed a decent movie, and they would be right, except it is more than just decent. Look, I'm not much of a romantic comedy guy, Jennifer Aniston and and Kate Hudson have pretty much ruined that genre for years to come, but then comes along this masterful tidbit. This movie has all the right ingredients to bring romantic comedies back from the dead. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are truly exceptional in their respective roles as is Robert De Niro and for that matter the entire cast. Also the storyline is original and at the same time intriguing, a rare combination in 99% of all romantic comedies. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and think it may be one of the best in this genre in the past several years. If you watch movies strictly for the entertainment value, this one will deliver, if you watch for great acting portrayals this one will deliver. Do yourself a favor and see what all the buzz is about."
"Thomasdinnegan75","8","1","4","14 January 2013"," Is it deserving of all the hype?....
","So, I suppose with all the hype and Oscar nominations this movie received, I felt I had to see it. I didn't expect much of the plot, and I was right. However, the acting is simply amazing and makes this film more than watchable. Don't get me wrong I liked the plot, but it wasn't anything amazing. <br/><br/>This movie is about a man who was admitted to a mental institution, after he beat this guy he found his wife having an affair with, bit far fetched, I know. It is revealed though that Pat (Bradley Cooper) is bi- polar and that's why he escapes prison, to enter the hospital. Anyway, after Pat gets out, his whole life is based on getting back together with his wife because ""they're entirely in love"" and have a chemistry that ""makes people uncomfortable"" because its so strong, remember Cooper's character does suffer with a mental illness :P. Then Pat meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), and it gets predictable from here after. <br/><br/>Yes, this movie is slow, Yes this movie is unrealistic in parts, Yes this movie doesn't correctly portray Bi-polar,but you know what, i actually enjoyed it. I thought Cooper was amazing!! He was funny at the right times, but matched this with his superb acting when Pat, his character has a breakdown. As for Lawrence, I've heard so much about her, but i didn't see any of her work. Its safe to say I know understand the fuss, I thought she was enticing, crazy but sane at the same time, just like the character is suppose to be. This was the perfect role for her. De Niro also adds a lot to this movie as Pat's OCD gambling addicted Dad. As for Chris Tucker, he made me laugh all the time, in fact I think he absolutely completed the movie. <br/><br/>Overall, I wouldn't say I get the hype about this movie, its nothing near a masterpiece but at the same time its 100 miles away from being poor. Its a movie you will enjoy because of the acting! if you're looking for an amazing plot, i wouldn't expect much, however Cooper, De Niro, Lawrence and Tucker make up for that with magnificent performance's."
"blperoc","9","1","4","12 January 2013"," An old school gem
","This movie has the same emotional tension that you would feel when watching ""Breakfast at Tiffany's."" The acting is fantastic. Jennifer Lawrence continues her rise as probably the best actress of this age. She may not win the Oscar this year as Jessica Chastain also had a fantastic performance in Zero Dark Thirty and I expect her to win, but I expect Jennifer to be at the top nearly every year for the next 40 years or so.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is as good as you would expect from the known and unknown members.<br/><br/>This movie seems to get better and better as the minutes tick by right up until the end.<br/><br/>George and Audrey could have done no better."
"cox526","9","1","4","12 January 2013"," Wow - best film of the year - very emotional
","I have to agree with a number of the comments on this film - meggz3 put it exactly as I wanted to write it and I probably wouldn't do a better job of it as she or he has- I have to say I was blown away the acting was brilliant throughout by a sterling cast. Robert De Nero playing the OCD father deserves a best supporting actor and Jennifer Lawrence just gets better in every film and of course Bradley Cooper is just great - So many films will get the tip and the wink for the Oscar above this but that doesn't mean it doesn't deserve to be right up there with them. The superlatives for this film will still be going on about this gem of a movie well after the Oscars and I for one will be seeing it again because I fell in love with Jennifer Lawrence too! I don't want to say too much as I don't want to be blacklisted- but to play a role that is as difficult as somebody who has mental illness issues and to be as convincing is something else- but when two people do (an actor and actress) it is mind blowing - For me it is the best film of the year and I have seen most of the films that are in contention for Oscars- what they deliver in the most part is special effects or a history lesson or simply good old fashioned violence. But this film delivers comedy and romance in equal measures that leave you elated at the end and that is exactly how you want to leave a cinema experience I would be even more elated if this gem got best picture but I can dream"
"terrellrobinson71","9","1","4","12 January 2013"," Here's one movie that's worth subscribing your medication for
","I think I've officially gone crazy for ""Silver Linings Playbook"", David O. Russell's romantic dramedy about breaking through mentality, gaining your own perspective about life and to also find a brand new start even when it's least expected. Lucky thing about this movie, it is funny and heart-wrenching at times, it's also intelligent about the characters who goes through these real issues at certain moments and there's also some harrowing moments in which our hero and heroine deeply explore themselves and go even further, exposing their own vulnerabilities in the process. Based on the best-selling book by Matthew Quick, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" follows Pat Solatano (Bradley Cooper), a man suffering from undiagnosed bipolar disorder who was fired from his job as a high school teacher and spent 8 months in a mental hospital in Baltimore after he beats up the history teacher who was caught having sex in the shower with Pat's (EX)wife, Nikki. He comes back home to Philadelphia in order to get himself fit so he can reunite with her, even though she has a restraining order on him. He has a dad (the great Robert De Niro), an Eagles fan and local sports gambler who is quite forceful on him and a mom (a superior Jacki Weaver) who just wants things to be normal. Along the way, here arrives Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence, yes, that Jennifer Lawrence from ""The Hunger Games""), a young girl who also has issues after the loss of her police-officer husband. He spots her when his friend Ronnie (John Ortiz) and his wife Veronica (Julia Stiles) invited him to dinner. Tiffany has already been known as ""the crazy slut with a dead husband"", she likes Pat so much, she even offers to sleep with him. He refuses, stating that he's still faithful to Nikki. So what does these two characters do? He wants to send a letter to Nikki, she wants him as her partner for a dance contest in exchange for that. When the two get to know each other more and more due to the training for the dance contest, their feelings grow stronger for each other. It's kind of a small miracle that ""Silver Linings Playbook"" doesn't fall prey to the romantic comedy playbook, it unexpectedly makes up its own rules. We understand that each of the characters is just like us and it makes room to balance the melodrama, humor and heart of something like this. Now that's something special. What David O. Russell does as a director and a screenwriter is that he knows the characters are not perfect people, but they are real people including Pat's psychiatrist Dr. Patel (Anupam Kher) and Pat's friend from the mental hospital, Danny (Chris Tucker). What makes the film works and the real reason to see the film is the cast. It's amazing to me that Bradley Cooper, who I liked in movies like ""The Hangover"" films and ""Limitless"", gives without a doubt the best performance of his career. As Pat, Cooper goes all the way developing his happy-joy qualities as well as a dark side. When he breaks down emotionally, you certainly feel his pain of what's he done. Jennifer Lawrence has become one of the best young actresses we've seen in years. Here, she delivers another brilliant and fearless performance and she could possibly get an Oscar for best actress, maybe. She was 21 when this movie was shot, but quickly proves that age is nothing but a number as she plays a woman who may be a floozy, but she likes herself for who she is and she doesn't want people to berate her for that. Robert De Niro definitely gives one of his best performances ever since his Oscar-Winning performance in ""Raging Bull"" as Pat, Sr. He certainly captures the emotion, excitement, and the forceful will of teaching Pat how to live and don't give up, but also keep a look out for the next Eagles game. The rest of the cast, especially Weaver, Tucker and Kher, they have their great moments and God bless them for it. So what if this movie ends like any other romantic comedy? It adds more unexpected surprises that no one would ever witness, even the ending has that in spades. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is truly a movie you won't forget and the silver lining is this: We've gone crazy sometimes. Have you?"
"liamfairweather14","9","1","4","12 January 2013"," A very well acted film
","When i sat down to watch silver linings play book, i didn't really not what to expect. Not a massive fan of drama's but do enjoy the occasional. However i was completely surprised by the diversity of the movie from the cliché drama about mental illness. Silver linings play book was a very cleverly made and enjoyable film and would recommend it to anyone who likes a feel-good ending!<br/><br/>the film starts off by typically introducing us to the main character, who shows us very early on that although he has left the mental institution he was situated at, he still has clear problems mentally. Pat swiftly returns to his family and the director does a very good job of creating a very awkward and anxious atmosphere in the Solitano house.<br/><br/>After half an hour of showing pats struggle to regain mental stability and including scruffs with his family and encounters with a police officer, the director introduces tiffany, the other main character. Tiffany is straight away shown to be in the same boat as pat. Both cooper and Lawerence do a brilliant job of conveying the social awkwardness and insecurity in which they create when around friends and family, especially cooper. He conveys the mark of a man who looks to be on the road to progress but be constantly betrayed by his pedantic and instable mind. His weird habits and obscure choice of words project a very unique character and is a big part of the films success.<br/><br/>Anyway, pat and tiffany work together to help each other with the things holding them together. Pats is his drive to be re-united with his wife and tiffany's is to dance, however its clear tiffany has an interest in pat beyond helping him. After a unexpected twists and many avoided clichés, we find ourselves engrossed in the plot of this film and the characters within it. Pat and Tiffany with compete at a dance show, despite an unexpected twist and finally fall down to cliché's in the last 10 minutes. however, it is worth noting that this was the best and most suitable ending and was unavoidable, really.<br/><br/>The relationship between the characters is probably the most binding factor in this movie's success. The ever changing relationship between cooper and Lawrence conveys the nature of the two and is constantly changing throughout the film. Even with one is mad with the other, they are shown to be repeatedly drawn to forgive the other, and the changing relationship shows their mental instability through their changing emotions. Both slowly transition to normality through the film by helping each other fulfill their needs and the way the director brings the family into the climax of the film is wonderfully woven and successfully executed. Another mention should be given to Robert De niro who conveys a dad, who has his own pull on the plot and may come across as a pushy dad who doesn't understand his son, but as the film goes on, De niro comes into his element and shows a very compassionate and loving side and really adds to the feel-good theme to the film.<br/><br/>Other parts of the film such as the excuses fro Charis tucker as to why he is repeatedly 'out' of the mental institution and coopers spontaneous outbursts add a comedy element to this brilliant drama.<br/><br/>so, in general i loved the silver linings play book and would recommend it to anyone seeking a movie filled with symbolic actions and intricately woven story arcs. Brilliant acting from established actors reinforces the backbone of this movie and makes for a special experience!"

","This film is about a man with bipolar disorder, who finds sanity and hope in life through a quirky woman.<br/><br/>""Silver Linings Playbook"" tells the life of a young man, whose life is shattered before he meets a quirky woman called Tiffany. Through a series of constructive activities, they both find meaning and hope. I think the two main characters are very well portrayed. They are magnetic and fascinating in their own way. I really like the way that both of them find healing and solace from each other. It is a comforting and satisfying scenario. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper both act well, making their characters so alive and convincing. It is a pity that Jacki Weaver's role is so small, I think it is a bit of a waste of a great actress. Overall, I think ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a film with great performances."

"cameronmorewood","9","1","4","12 January 2013"," Silver Linings Playbook
","David O. Russell's new movie, Silver Linings Playbook, is completely different from his last, The Fighter, but somehow, both films have the same energy. It's hard to describe, even though that's my job. I guess, if I had to call it something, I'd call it exuberant life, a kind of ecstatic energy that makes you just as excited as the characters in the movie. It's a rare kind of movie that's not only sick with a terribly fascinating disease, but it's also contagious. <br/><br/>Have you ever met someone who's been so down on their luck, so consistently bummed out of a good time, that they get excited the minute they think something's going to work out for them? They almost obsess over it? That's Tiffany and Pat. He's a bipolar teacher, just out of the looney bin- and he's desperate to do one thing- reconnect with his unfaithful wife, who has a restraining order against him for the same reason he was in the looney bin in the first place. Pat beat up his wife's partner in infidelity. Who wouldn't? Walking home to that? However, no dice. Pat gets locked up in the psycho shack. Tiffany, played by a pitch-perfect Jennifer Lawrence, is a young widow who's trying exhaustingly to compensate for the death of her cop husband by screwing, well, everyone. <br/><br/>It's not only a very good film, but it's also a unique film because of the way it tells a light human story in such a hard dramatic way. The most invigorating aspect of Silver Linings Playbook- and there are many- is its masterful script and the actors delivering the well-paced, careful lines. There isn't one or two great performances on display here. There are five."
"hanmarsch","8","1","4","11 January 2013"," Surprisingly good
","I can be a bit of a tough critic when it comes to movies; And really, I have to admit the only reason I saw this was because I really wanted to see a movie and, well, De Niro. It is a really good movie though, one that I would recommend to almost anyone who asked. <br/><br/>I get tired of movies about romance that are focused on the teasing, the bickering, the conflict of the two characters before ultimately, the admittance of love. (usually followed by the overdone sex scene) But this movie didn't involve a whole lot of that, and I think Cooper and Lawrence both did surprisingly well in their portrayal of people suffering of mental illness. I myself have (am) suffered (suffering) from mental illness, and to say the least, it's really, really, really difficult to live with. I've been really down lately, and I saw this movie on a whim, not really knowing what to expect. It lifted my spirits though. It's not the greatest movie in the world, but you know, it's entertaining, heartfelt, and above all, realistic."
"leinef","7","1","4","9 January 2013"," It was very funny; definitely a must-see for fans of romantic comedies
","Yesterday, my friends and me went to the cinema and chose Silver Linings to watch. We all had no real idea what this movie was about except for being fans of both lead actors. What I remember from the movie today is that it was extremely funny, the acting was good but it was not one of the best movies I've seen. <br/><br/>The movie is using so many clichés and the typical ending. But still, the direct dialogs/discussions make it somehow special. OK, I didn't get the purpose of Chris Tucker (I guess it was only for the fun moments); him being such a stalker was more scaring than romantic; some parts where they talk was a tad too long and in comparison, the ending seemed rushed. And am I the only one who was not convinced by the ending? <br/><br/>But these points are just small. I still enjoyed it and this is definitely something for romantic comedy lovers. People who are used to action and similar may get bored at some parts when watching this movie."
"evanston_dad","8","2","13","29 November 2012"," Don't Totally Buy the Happy Ending, But That Doesn't Mean I Don't Like It
","Much of the talk swirling around ""Silver Linings Playbook"" has centered on Jennifer Lawrence and her feisty performance, but Bradley Cooper is the one who impressed me. Nothing I've yet seen Cooper in prepared me for how good an actor he can be given the right direction and material.<br/><br/>The direction and material in this case is supplied by David O. Russell, who has made one movie I outright love (""I Heart Huckabees"") and a few others (""Three Kings"", ""The Fighter"") that have been almost as good. I'm not sure I'd class ""Silver Linings Playbook"" at quite the same level, but it's pretty darn good. Cooper, who dominates the film and is in nearly every single scene, plays a troubled man recently released from an institution and determined to get well. Lawrence is an agitated young woman who's got all sorts of issues of her own, and we wait to see if this odd couple is going to end up together at the movie's end. Russell is not a conventional filmmaker, so a happy ending, or at least a conventional one, is not necessarily guaranteed, and I guess the fact that the film ends by resolving everything a little too neatly after giving us such a serious, unrelentingly grim first half is by biggest quibble with it. Still, it's nice to think a story like the one portrayed here could end the way this one does, even if I don't really believe it would.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver play Cooper's mom and dad, and in a few scenes, Russell is able to brilliantly convey the family dynamic that led to Cooper's issues in the first place.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

"g-bodyl","9","1","5","18 May 2014"," Wonderful Film!
","Silver Linings Playbook is an incredible film that brings to the light the subject of bipolar disorders, one of the rare films to do so. This film is so sweet and sentimental in one way, but in another way we get to see the dark side of bipolar disorders which results in extreme mood swings. But this film features an incredible screenplay that touches up on all the emotions, fantastic acting that uses the screenplay with heart and soul, excellent directing by David O. Russell, and just a compelling story about a disorder that affects many people worldwide.<br/><br/>O'Russell directed a film about a guy named Patrick who has just been released from a mental hospital and he moved back in with his parents. He also has a goal of reuniting with his wife despite a big incident that occurred between them. While pursuing his goals, he meets Tiffany whom ultimately has a dark past and problems of her own.<br/><br/>This film is a haven for acting because the acting here is just incredible. The chemistry between everyone is just top-notch and it's clear that everyone was very involved with the film. Jennifer Lawrence is just amazing and she clearly steals every scene she's in and she deserves her Best Actress win. She shows awesome chemistry with Bradley Cooper, who comes into his own this movie. Cooper shows lots of range by taking this role and this was a risk that paid off handsomely. Robert De Niro gives his best role in years and Jacki Weaver does a great job as well.<br/><br/>Overall, Silver Linings Playbook is just an excellent film that is not only funny, but is deeply touching. The first hour and fifteen minutes are the best, while the final half goes through the conventional romance stage, but it's very much worth watching thanks to the excellent acting. It's well-written, well-acted, and one of the best drama films of the year. I rate this film 9/10."

","My favorite movie. I love this movie. It understands what I go through everyday (am not mentally challenged). The complex relationship between Pat and everyone around him is what i go through is what I go through. This movie is about detached people trying to find their way in this dark, pessimistic and cynical world. Everyone tries to find someone who completes them and these people are trying to either find them or trying to get them back. I love the way I feel when I am watching this movie. When I watch a movie and I love it I repeat it in my sleep. My memory might not be too good but I do repeat this movie in my sleep whenever I am feeling blue. When life hits you hard you can watch SLP and you will feel okay. This movie speaks. It has a beautiful soul. It gives a voice to people who can't speak. Jennifer Lawrence shines like a golden star. She plays Tiffany Maxwell with such ease that it makes me uneasy as to how she did it. It has romance, drama, jealousy, everything that one feels. I cried when Pat confessed his love for Tiffany, I smiled with amusement when Tiffany had her breakdown. David O Russell is the greatest director of his generation (You could argue but let's just agree to disagree). He does a beautiful job of carving a treat out of a book. I always like the book more than the movie but this is THE ONLY EXCEPTION. This movie taught me how to see the SILVER LINING in every bad thing. I love this movie and I hope you do to."

"MovieAddict2016","9","1","5","28 January 2013"," A ""feel-good movie"" that earns its feelings
","The romantic comedy has never been the most respected genre in film, but and I think in earnest that's because so many of them just go through the motions and don't let their characters earn the sympathy that the filmmakers expect the audience to feel for them. <br/><br/>Silver Linings Playbook is a rarity, an ostensibly ""feel-good"" movie that doesn't pull punches and isn't afraid to go dark places but ends up trusting in its characters and its audience enough to see it through to the end. Bradley Cooper is solid, Jennifer Lawrence continues to reveal herself as one of the best actresses of her generation; and how refreshing is it to see Robert De Niro finally finding himself in a good movie again after years of slumming? This is his best performance in years and I hope he continues choosing better projects in the near future.<br/><br/>David O. Russell got a bad stigma in Hollywood for a few years after I Heart Huckabees and the infamous meltdown video, but with this and The Fighter he has thankfully proved he still has the talent that made him such an interesting filmmaker early on in his career.<br/><br/>In a year full of great movies, this is one of the better ones, and one I'd like to revisit again.

","As the film opens protagonist Pat Solitano is being released from an eight month sentence to a mental institution. He has lost his job as a teacher, his home and his wife has a restraining order against him but he is still convinced he can win her back. Soon after his release he meets young widow Tiffany, who has issues of her own, at a dinner after which she invites him to spend the night with her but he refuses. That isn't the end of things and soon he is trying to persuade her to get a message to his wife; she agrees but has a condition; she wants to take part in a dance competition and wants Pat to be her partner. Pat's parents are a little bit concerned about him seeing Tiffany although his father's reasons is somewhat peculiar he believes the Philadelphia Eagles will lose if they don't watch the game together! As the day of the dance approaches it gains greater significance following Pat being told his wife will be watching and the fact that his father has made a large bet on the outcome.<br/><br/>Given that all the main characters seem to have mental issues; bi-polar disorder, anger control problems and obsessive behaviour; one would be forgiven for thinking it was either going to be overly worthy or in poor taste thankfully that wasn't the case. This is largely down to the leads; Bradley Cooper is great as Pat and Jennifer Lawrence positively shines as Tiffany. They make their characters believable and likable. Of the supporting cast it isn't surprising that Robert De Niro gives the most memorable performance; his character's obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles is both disturbing and amusing. The film isn't without its flaws of course and unfortunately the biggest flaw is the cliché ending even if that is the ending that viewers probably want. Overall this film is engaging, funny, sexy and well worth watching."

","David O. Russell's ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is not a romantic comedy in the general sense of the term. Far from the movies featuring crazy situations while it's obvious how everything will turn out, this movie looks at the problems that have affected the main characters. The behavior of the bipolar Pat (Bradley Cooper) gives one a sense of how hard it must be to be around bipolar people, while it is understood that his behavior is unintentional. Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) has also had problems in her life but is looking for a change. Pat Sr. (Robert DeNiro) is the character that really caught my eye: he comes across as a damaged individual who just does what he thinks is best.<br/><br/>The movie adds up to a really good look at what Pat has to go through to reach his full potential. It was also interesting seeing Chris Tucker in this movie, since we've gotten used to him playing silly roles. He's very believable in this serious role. Really good film. I'd say that Jennifer Lawrence deserved her Oscar win (although I didn't see every nominated movie)."

Here's why:<br/><br/>You take up the long-lost and beloved genre of rom-com and take up all the Oscar winners' tit bits and you make a movie. You add some emotions, shaky camera-work (which they term realistic), great actors and you get SLP. It's a simple drama and I couldn't find comedy in it. Yeah, it made my partner cry... so what? I induces emotions, yes I appreciate that. But to be very frank, I didn't really enjoy much watching SLP till it reached the climax. And another thing was, I could somehow predict what was to happen. Well, it might have appealed to the stereotypical or electrolytic people but I have to announce - this doesn't work anymore. You may have bagged a lots of accolades, but god, it doesn't intrigue!<br/><br/>Now, the Bradley is amazing, Jennifer Lawrence is child labour. First Hungry Games, then that House at the end of street drama and now this! And I hear she received some other critics award. Oh, god spare me the horror and please give it to Chastain!<br/><br/>Anupam Kher acts dumb, so does De Niro sometimes.

","Beautiful movie; I loved it! It's not your average romantic comedy. The story, the characters, their bonding, the situations - the whole screenplay is quirky, gritty, moving, and sublime. It doesn't get so intense, with a tinge of humour always in the air.<br/><br/>Everyone's unique and a little bit nuts, in their own way. No matter how different and crazy you are, there's always someone out there who's equally different and can match your craziness with their own.<br/><br/>The casting is outstanding; it's rare to find such a remarkable ensemble. Bradley Cooper is fantastic and compelling; his most natural character till date. Jennifer Lawrence is brilliant; she always amazes me with the range of emotions and characters she can handle. Robert De Niro and Jackie Weaver complete the terrific ensemble, with their magnetic presence. Julia Stiles, Chris Tucker and Anupam Kher also do interesting cameos.<br/><br/>In an era, where most romantic comedies are melodramatic, over the top and unbelievable, 'Silver Linings Playbook' sets the bar for how intelligent, well-acted and charming romantic comedies can be."

","I started writing this review before the movie ended. WoW! Where do I start? Acting -- perfect. Casting -- prefect. Dialogue -- perfect. Plot -- perfect.<br/><br/>I did not see Jennifer Houston in the Hunger Games but I read the book and see how she would be very good for that role. I now see why she is a superstar: in addition to her superb acting, I have to say she's one of the hottest girls on the planet! IMO the combination of brains and beauty is perhaps the most wonderful of spectacles in the universe.<br/><br/>We expect the big names to deliver and he did, I mean De Niro. I can confidently say that Bradley Cooper is now a star (in terms of acting versatility).<br/><br/>Shea Whigham -- great in Machete, Boardwalk Empire and here as well; a very promising future. Jacki Weaver, boy was she wonderful. Julia Styles, loved her in The Bourne Ultimatum -- smart and sexy -- want to see her in more movies. Who else? Anupam Kher!! 100% great! <br/><br/>As a side note, I think Jennifer's somewhat Gothic look in the movie better suits her than the most recent pictures I saw on IMDb from the Golden Globes.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure this is my favorite movie I've seen in the past year. 10/10."

"ketgup83","8","1","7","14 January 2013"," In a nutshell - Well-executed direction, strong screenplay and more importantly powerful performances
","Silver Linings Playbook was one of the best movies I've seen in recent times. The story was completely out of box with versatile performances by Bradley Cooper , Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro and Anupam Kher.<br/><br/>Released from a mental institution , Pat tries to reconcile back to his ex-wife after losing his job , his house. Moving in with his parents , he meets Tiffany, a mysterious girl with problems of her own but who becomes the only silver lining in his life.<br/><br/>From the director of critically acclaim The Fighter, David O' Russel gives in yet another powerful drama with some knockout performances. The story and script is powerful with some high octane drama that is sure to keep you engrossed. However , this movie is challenging and is made for niche audiences that is sure to keep some folks at bay. Couple of scenes have been executed brilliantly - the scene where Pat tries to find his wedding video at 4 AM in the morning, the scene at the Diner restaurant between Pat and Tiffany and her sudden burst into flame is one of the best scene in the film. The film relies more on actor performing at the moment and that is the best part. Direction contains lot of gravity and is handled superbly. Screenplay is grasping. Editing is crispy. Art direction and Cinematography is good. Dialogues are punching. Story , based on Matther Qucik's novel , is well-written. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are the soul of the film. It is their enduring performances which makes this film more watchable. Watch out for their chemistry as if they are playing real characters. They vehemently supported by fine performances by Robert De Niro and Anupam Kher.<br/><br/>Silver Lining Playbooks is definitely a strong contender for upcoming awards this season for its well-executed direction, strong screenplay and more importantly powerful performances. Excellent 4/5"
"arnieiam","10","1","7","11 January 2013"," Fly, Eagles Fly!
","I am a Philadelphia Eagles fan. One of the few in Canada, because most NFL fans here are Patriots, Bills and Packers fans. Why am I talking about the Eagles? Well they are actually a large plot point of the film. I'll get to that in a bit.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper plays Pat Solitano, a man discharged from a mental institution as he is diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He is trying to patch things up with his family and his wife while focusing his aggression into something constructive. Cooper was excellent for the part and I think it has something to do with this film being centred in his hometown. When I think of Philadelphia, two actors come to mind: Will Smith and him. Too bad he didn't do the accent, would've loved the have heard 'dat Philly tawk yah mean?'. And he can dance, that's nice. I heard Mark Wahlberg was in talks for this role... yeah... dodged a bullet there.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence plays Tiffany, a fellow nutcase who helps Pat find focus by involving him in her dance project. She was very good in her performance. It just keeps bugging me that she's my age. She is already and accomplished actress while I still have no clue whether or not to apply for grad school. Damn.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro, I love seeing him back. He plays Pat's dad, a very superstitious Eagles fan. See. He also bets on Eagles and Phillies games. This role is slightly different but still De Niro. Since he is from New York it was nice seeing him as a South Philly dad.<br/><br/>And it was great seeing Chris Tucker again especially in such a downplayed role. As a comedian I never thought he was funny, he was always just shrieking in his whiny register, here I actually liked him. And also the Indian guy who plays Pat's therapist, man the onslaught of Indian actors in American films continues.<br/><br/>I guess I liked this film a lot because it was directed by the director of Three Kings, which is actually one of my favourite films. Also this film wasn't over-dramatic it had the right balance of emotions.<br/><br/>Going back to the Eagles. I could tell from the beginning line that this film took place in 2008 because they were referencing DeSean Jackson dropping the ball at the 1 yard line. That was a surprisingly good season, since they went to the NFC title game for the 5th time but they lost. I hate Larry Fitzgerald for that. Because of this film I really miss Donovan McNabb as quarterback and Andy Reid. Hopefully Michael Vick and Jason Peters can recover and give us the ring we badly deserve.<br/><br/>Finally in all the bits involving the Birds, why couldn't they get Merrill Reese to do some voice overs?"

","And the winner isÂ…""Silver Linings Playbook!"" <br/><br/>Let me tell you whyÂ…the stars could be aligned and by coincidence (NOT!) the film will finally role out in wide release this weekend after a run of building, building, and not quite yet, building to NOW!<br/><br/>Growing up my childhood idols were Muhammed Ali and Pete Rose (Same age btw as my dadÂ…) and at 46 my idol is the legendary film conquistador Mr. Harvey Weinstein; he loves film like fat kids love cake & ice cream and his track record of acquiring the right film at the right time is beyond legendary. <br/><br/>The most appreciative reaction in the foreign film category this morning was the announcement of The Weinstein Company's recent acquisition (immediately after its screening at AFI in NovemberÂ…) Norway's ""Kon-Tiki."" They were denied a double nomination with the remarkably inexplicable (but, this is the Academy we're talking aboutÂ…) slight of ""The Intouchables"" a popular and universally loved tale of both ends of the financial spectrum. <br/><br/>But along comes ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and it's Harvey magic time! The film received the Grand Slam of nominations (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor and Actress,) making it the first film to do so since 1981's ""Reds.""<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert DeNiro, Jackie Weaver and David O. Russell all signed up long ago with the game plan being be the underdog. A film not just chock full of stars but of ""actors"" and some of the best in the business at that and if you combined the receipts of Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, and Chris Tucker you'd have people in the seats because this trifecta of the future paired with the anchors of DeNiro and Weaver will do more for the veteran duo than vice-versa.<br/><br/>Solid formula and TWC strategy and boom! Eight nominations; for a comedy? A drama? A dramedy? No, eight nominations for the best winnable TWC type film. Herr Weinstein spun his magic for ""Shakespeare in Love"" (Directed by John Madden who's latest project ""Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" was snubbed loudly today) and that film beat ""Saving Private Ryan"" for Best Picture in 1998, remember? Was it a comedy? A drama? A dramedy? No, it was the foundation for a slew of Oscars yet to come and a recipe no one else has been able to master. The film is directed by David O. Russell and has been nominated to the big dance his last two times out with 2010's ""The Fighter"" and today for ""SLP"" and like ""The Fighter"" his cast was nominated for Best Supporting Actress and Actor and had wins for both Melissa Leo (defeating fellow cast mate Amy Adams) and Christian Bale. So, TWC gets to work their magic because no major blockbusters stand in their way. They can manipulate in a Tom Sawyer kind of way convincing a movie with 5 A-Listers is the underdog film and should be considered for Best Picture and hopefully somewhere in the Amblin Entertainment/Dreamworks office someone in their machine will work day and night for the next six weeks to not let a repeat of 1998 happen to ""Lincoln"" what ""Shakespeare in Love"" did to ""Saving Private Ryan;"" and I think King Harvey has Mr. Spielberg right where he wants him; Again!<br/><br/>Peter Santana"

","The only thing Silver Linings Playbook suffers from is a case of a studio not knowing exactly how to market it. The marketing lead me (and others, judging by the mostly female audience in the theater) to believe this was just north of a rom com chick flick. The only reason I went to see it was because I couldn't believe that David O. Russell, notorious nutbag director of The Fighter, Three Kings and I â™¥ Huckabees would make a rom com chick flick. I was right. This is a funny, painful, heartbreaking, heartwarming, complex romantic tale about real, complex people and families.

","Pat (Bradley Cooper) is just out of a psychiatric institution, after eight months of ""treatment"" for violent behaviour and assault on his ex-wife's lover. He lost his job and his home and he is forced to move in with his parents.<br/><br/>Tiffany (Lawrence) is a young widow, stricken by grief after her husband's death, who turned to compulsively sleeping around. The fact that Lawrence plays a part written for a woman over thirty undermines her credibility, but not her capability to deliver.<br/><br/>They meet not-so-cute at a dinner organised by Tiffany's sister and from then on the plot creeps along, following their tentative relationship. It does not help that Pat's father, played by De Niro, is a bookmaker obsessed with football.<br/><br/>Way too much screen time is dedicated to this sub-plot and if you do not care about football - like me - you might find the second part quite tedious, with all the betting and games. Maybe without that and with a tighter editing, it could have been a decent movie... still not Oscar-worthy, but Cooper and Lawrence have some chemistry and their characters are marginally endearing.<br/><br/>On a general note, even if Pat is generically described as ""bipolar"" and Tiffany as ""borderline"" they seemed just two people who found it difficult coping with traumatic events - which does not imply any serious mental illness.

","After watching the movie I peeked at the reviews and was surprised that many people were upset that the movie didn't display a person dealing with such things realistically. Personally, I think their behaviour fit well with the genre and general mood of the movie and I didn't find it entirely odd (though there were some holes in the plot that were overlooked).<br/><br/>The movie was missing the lows of the bipolar state but as I can see they didn't go for a realistical portrayal this is fair. I think the heights were somewhat there - the naivety that he's going to get his wife back, his attempts to get better or her motivation to deceive him about Nikky's letters. Some of their irrational behaviour was on spot. Everyone was a tad ill which added on the comedy factor. This is by no means a serious movie.<br/><br/>Illness aside, the plot definitely had some issues. We don't learn what he says to Nikky at the end (which should be important to us) for one, and it's highly unrealistic that she would go seeing him after she cheated on him. I think they missed to add some more dramatic scenes for us to see the two protagonist resolve their past, so we'd get a closure - this stage was completely skipped and they moved from being sick to being fine in one go.<br/><br/>The acting was nice and I had fun watching it despite the holes in the plot, although it's not worth rewatching."

","SPOILER ALERT...the film in my opinion is as bipolar as Pat is.By that, I mean that there is a wave of depression that viewers accept by the movie, but at the same time there is an optimistic perception of things that dominates also in this film, just like Pat's way of bipolar thinking and living.The problem with the mental illnesses is that even if the patient has overcome or at least settled down his illness, the people around him are very suspicious and never actually believe that this person is healthy.This is an extra and an unjust problem that has to face.Maybe only another patient can really understand and believe him/her.In this case Tiffany has affection for Pat.But with these kind of illnesses, even the patients can be suspicious to each other a little bit,like pat was during the dinner with Tiffany.The movie depicts very well the Pat's way of acting as a bipolar and develops a very strong bond of love between them two.Jennifer Lawrence's performance as Tiffany is very attractive cause almost every guy would want a girl like Tiffany to act with fully passion for him and to try to help him from his serious issues that bother him.One of my favorite romance movies, for sure!"

","""Silver Lining Playbook"" got Oscar nominations in the four acting categories for the first time after three decades, succeeding Warren Beatty's ""Reds"", Hal Ashby's ""Coming Home"" and Sidney Lumet's ""Network"". As far as acting goes, this is nowhere near what these movies showcased, but I won't make a commentary on the acting, let's just check the film's summary. Just read it again and get back to this review.<br/><br/>I'll tag this review with the 'spoiler' mention anyway, but seriously, isn't the spoiler obvious from the start? If there's anything Woody Allen and romantic comedies have taught us, it is that anyone with an ex-wife will end up meeting a stranger hell, this is already given away in the summary. If we don't get that Patrick (Bradley Cooper) and Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) will be together, we haven't seen enough movies in our lives. That said, I have nothing against predictability as long as it is satisfyingly conducted and occasionally creates a few original situations. I found none in ""Silver Lining Playbook"", not that I didn't enjoy it to some degree, but the 'masterpiece' labeling and awards' nods sort of heightened my expectations.<br/><br/>I guess the mental troubles of many protagonists and the way it raised ""awareness"" about the obsessions that can damage people's lives, (such as anger problems, compulsive habits, gambling, sexual infidelities etc.) are so many positive elements that speak in favor of David O' Russell. But why are critics pretending that he ""pioneered"" something as if ""Ordinary People"", the heartbreaking chronicles about a family stricken by grief and trauma or a masterpiece like John Cassavetes ""A Woman Under the Influence"", never existed. That movie alone should put to shame any attempts of comparison. That Lawrence won an Oscar and not Rowlands is perhaps more maddening than any situation in ""Playbook"". Lawrence was good, but a few emotional outbursts don't equate the realistic embodiment of craziness, and neither does saying that you love sex with that ""sultry mysteriousness"" and shadowy eyes.<br/><br/>There is a sort of half-serious half-awkward vibes the directing constantly tries to exude and while it doesn't fail to provide some emotional depth, it just rings false during these moments meant to be crucial. Take the Halloween date: the writing is so cringe worthy it is painful. First of all, all through the film, Pat insists about a reconciliation with Nikki, ""Nikki this, Nikki that..."", so it is plain obvious that he won't be cured as long as he's obsessed with Nikki. It works to the point of annoying insistence, thrown at our face like the indicator that he's not cured yet. And while there's obvious chemistry with Tiffany, the date is ruined for the stupidest reason: he believes she's crazier than he is on the basis of the sexual experiences she revealed. I couldn't believe he would believe it. Her reaction was naturally anger but fake as it was induced by a fake situation.<br/><br/>And don't get me started on the ending, Pat finally got over Nikki and needed to tell her so, but couldn't have he avoided giving Tifanny the wrong impression? No, because we needed the obligatory romantic chase on the sidewalk. Best Picture contender? Gimme a break!<br/><br/>Or I must have a problem with O' Russell but while I can see the well-meaning intent behind each of his movies, they always leave me cold. I would moderate this feeling with ""Silver Lining Playbook"" because here and there, there were some moments where my empathy rose toward some characters, and that includes Jennifer Lawrence and Jacki Weaver, who played the mother, but most of the time, I was wondering why this movie is elevated on a pedestal of ""eye-opening masterpiece about mental disorders affecting a suburban family"", while in the best case, it's got the appeal of made-for-TV afternoon dramas, only with a star-studded cast. De Niro is one of my favorite actors, but even an A-lister like him can't redeem the directing, all through the first act, I was wondering why David O' Russell was over-stuffing his scenes with hand-held camera moments. <br/><br/>Sure, it is to accentuate the whole confusion and mental chaos but I could only feel noise and dizziness. There was no build-up to make even this confusion emotionally affecting. It comes at such early points of the film that you don't even know who's crazy or who's not, so the emotional mess is an effect rather than a plot-driver. The second altercation between Cooper and De Niro works better, because we know them and their back-stories, well enough to share their pain. But these moments of strong emotional resonance aren't enough to compensate for the relative emptiness and predictability of the story and the preposterous plot points such a random bet supposed to solve all the family problems and a dance contest that was obviously injected to provide some visual escapism for the film's climax. <br/><br/>Otherwise, there was nothing that felt genuinely and powerfully realistic in that film. Awkward doesn't equal realistic except when it's handled by a director who doesn't try to imitate other directors. Whenever I see O' Russell, I got vibes from his 'masters' and after Scorsese in ""American Hustle"", here it is Cassavetes, but speaking of him, just go watch Rowlands' performance in ""A Woman Under the Influence"" and tell me that ""Playbook"" is as powerful. De Niro's crying was effective but it didn't break my heart as Donald Sutherland did in the climactic confrontation or the last ten seconds of ""Ordinary People"" and he didn't even get an Oscar nod for that.<br/><br/>Sorry for all thel titles' dropping, but if I can use this review to give publicity to real masterpieces that powerfully dealt with family trauma and troubles; it will all be worth it."

","This film prompted me to sign up and write this review as I was really moved by it. Creating an impacting, engaging, enlightening and entertaining film which centres around mental health is not easy. It was achieved and excelled by Silver Linings Playbook. This unique narrative flows exceptionally well, with unexpected turns that draw you deeper into both the story and the inner workings of each character. I appreciate films that are able to do all of this, while conveying very important messages, such as the line of what determines 'crazy' running through every one of us. There were many fine details that went into how this was achieved and I was left seeing all the parallels in my own life and family. If you are looking for an intelligent film that elegantly conveys insight into mental health and takes you on a journey that will leave you feeling positive, emotive and moved; look no further."

","In Life We've all had are ups and our downs, been in crazy relationships and had parts of ourselves that nobody else can truly understand and all of this is addressed in David O Russel's, Silver Linings Playbook. This movie perfectly balances Drama and Comedy to create for both a heartbreaking and heartwarming movie that every one can relate too. The performances in this movie are mind blowing with Bradley Cooper really surprising me with his lovable portrayal of a man who struggles with his conditions but you're able to get behind him because Cooper always portrays him as a good person at heart. Jennifer Lawrence one an Oscar for her performance and it's well deserved it showed that a she could to more than be Mystique or Katniss Everdeen she has absolutely Amazing Chemistry with Bradley Cooper and you truly feel their connection together. Robert De Niro does some of his best work here as Coopers father trying desperately to hold his home and family together with De Niro showing Vulnerability and Emotion that we've rarely seen from him. Behind all these great performances is a great director and David O Russel is proving to me more and more that he is one of the best directors working today he doesn't get in the way of these amazing performances he holds back and let's you see them. Every character in this move has something that makes them a human being and relatable making you care more about them towards the film climax. The main plot point of the movie is the romance between Cooper and Lawrence and you care so much about them getting together you just feeling every time they have a scene with just the two of them. I have but one flaw one this movie and it is the sub-plot between Cooper and his ex wife there's never really any scene where you get the chance to see them together as a couple and see what Coopers character is missing so much with her. Overall Silver Linings Playbook was one of the greatest movies of 2012 and is virtually universally Beloved if you want to watch a relatable film about life and relationships then watch this film right now. 94%-A"
"Reznik_T","7","0","1","6 October 2016"," Far from perfect, but still a very enjoyable movie
","This film has its problems, for example: The tone is a bit all over the place. There are scenes when it almost feels like it's a full-on spoof comedy (Bradley Cooper meeting his psychologist at the football game, or the whole scene with De Niro, JLaw and Randy arguing about parlay betting on the Eagles vs Cowboys game and the dancing contest), even though that's not what the rest of the movie is like. Also, Chris Tucker, although he was really-really funny, felt very much like he was shoehorned in the film for comic relief (meaning a different kind of comedy than what the movie naturally was without him). Besides there were some scenes when I felt like David O'Russel just lived out his JLaw fetish; e.g. when her and Bradley Cooper first meet, the close- ups of her cleavage, her hand and her face didn't feel natural, it was kind of awkward.<br/><br/>BUT: it's still a really good movie, I liked it a lot! The performances are fantastic. Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Jacki Weaver, John Ortiz (OMG he was so funny in this film) are all great, but I have to say, Robert De Niro stole the show. I haven't seen him giving such an excellent performance for a long time! The movie made me care for the characters, it made me laugh, it made me tear up, and also it's beautifully photographed.<br/><br/>I'm normally not into romantic drama/comedies, but this one, even with its flaws, is a well done piece of cinema. I give it a 7.5."

","Typical ""mentally-diseased boy meets mentally-diseased girl"" story. I already saw that one in Garden State in 2004. And that movie had a better soundtrack, too. Look: meeting a beautiful girl and falling in love doesn't instantly solve all of your problems. It sure as hell doesn't cure mental disease. In fact, it often causes mental disease when it ends in a tragic divorce or worse. Didn't both of the main characters end up messed up largely because of the people they were originally in love with? Bradley Cooper falls prey to aggressive, manic episodes whenever he hears his wedding song that reminds him of his wife's infidelity; and Jennifer Lawrence treats her depression, intensified by the death of her husband, by having sex with lots of people. The cinematography was pretty darn good--as I often find myself saying after watching films about mental disease/ psychoactive drugs/ etc. mind-altering states, the cinematography ""made me feel like I was (insert mental disease/ psychoactive drug addiction/ etc. mind-altering circumstance) myself"" (and in this case, ""manic"" filled in the blank--with ""ADHD"" also being appropriate). Cooper and Lawrence had good chemistry (mainly because they're both beautiful people) and some very real and probing dialogues happened here, but the overall narrative was unconvincing. Not enough struggle. Again, things don't just get better because you fall in love with some hot girl. My prognosis is that the aftermath of this film will not be all rainbows for our two smoking-hot protagonists."
"GeeWillickersRadioactiveMan","5","0","1","29 August 2016"," A Decent Film Hurt by Condescion
","Silver Linings Playbook is a romantic ""dramedy"" about two mentally unstable individuals finding the ability to overcome their personal issues through the power of love. I thought the acting was very good throughout this film. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence both play relatable characters whose power comes from the subtlety of their portrayal. And, for me, Robert De Niro's portrayal of a gambling- addicted father always waiting for his break was utterly brilliant. I found some of his scenes to be the most moving, despite his role as a secondary character. The flawed way many of the characters are portrayed is true to life and is the strongest point of the writing. However, I did feel that this movie falls into familiar and predictable tropes that are at best forgivable and at worst pretty condescending.<br/><br/>---Spoilers Below---<br/><br/>While I enjoyed Bradley Cooper's acting very much, I was thoroughly perplexed by his character. The entire story seems to hinge up a singular plot device. Which is, when his wife cheats on him. I couldn't help but repeatedly ask myself, ""why does he still want her back?"" I found that motivation, entirely unbelievable. So, since the entire plot rests upon that event, it really hurt my ability to suspend my disbelief for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence does well with what she's given. But, unlike many people, I found her character one-dimensional and thoroughly stereotypical. While Bradley Cooper is given providence over his mental illness, Jennifer Lawrence's character is an amalgamation of Hollywood stereotypes about women. When her husband dies, shes loses control over her sexuality. They work that back in, but only by expressing how before, she still couldn't control her own sexuality. Further, without Bradley Cooper, would she have been able to recover? He has a famliy for support, she is an outcast. So, she's relegated to dependence upon a male, and that's how she overcomes her mental illness.<br/><br/>To focus on the death of the husband, I found that totally ridiculous. Just thoroughly unbelievable. For him to die in a freak accident would have been fine, but to make the situation have to be so pseduo- poignant was stilted and painfully reaching.<br/><br/>Every time I started feeling invested, I was quickly deterred. For example, when Robert De Niro is confessing his shortcomings as a father, I was thoroughly moved. I'm a big fan of his, and I can say, that was some of his finest acting ever. Then, the mood immediately changes and all the weight is gone. This happens with needless conflict as well. Bradley Cooper is going to go to the game with his father. This is a really important bonding trip between them. It's meant to signify ""silver linings"" and positivity. And then, Jennifer Lawrence's character is angry because Bradley Cooper will have to miss dance practice. If she cares for him, shouldn't she see how important that is? Couldn't they have had dance practice early that morning, instead? It really throws a wrench for me, when needless conflict is suddenly injected. And, once again, Jennifer Lawrence is acting incredibly irrational.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if her being irrational is supposed to be her ""mental illness"", but it just feels like a total trope to me. I thought her scene in the diner was pretty great, and then her character is never given that kind of agency again. That was the only time I thought she had a genuine mental illness instead of some caricature of one. That's not her fault, either. It's the stereotypes in the writing.<br/><br/>The writing and direction is supposed to make us feel in the scene. And, it works pretty well. The dialogue succeeds in that area. But, the cinematography tries way too hard. The camera is constantly shaking around and bobbing like some MTV reality show. It's a pet peeve of mine to begin with, but this whole movie was bobbing up and down like a ferry ride.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say Silver Linings is a pretty good movie. The acting is quite good and at times it's able to transcend the stifled writing. But, the strange camera choices, the repeated stereotypes towards Jennifer Lawrence's character, and overall unbelievable motivation take away from what would otherwise be an excellent film."

In this case, my expectations for the film were met so they did not influence my reaction in a negative way. Occasionally though, some movies will be so hyped up that my expectations are unlikely to be met and this sometimes causes me to be overly critical of the film and give it a bad review. This is one of the reasons I try not to see previews or trailers for movies before I watch them.

","I am not a particular fan of 'Rom-Coms' unless they are very good and very funny – and very few of them ever are. This movie is not too bad at all. I watched it with my wife and we both thoroughly enjoyed it. It tells the story of a bi-polar hero, Pat, recently released from mental hospital after beating up his wife's lover, and his attempts to win his wife back. It also tells of his growing relationship with Tiffany, a similarly afflicted bi-polar young lady who wishes to compete in a dancing competition, and somehow persuades Pat to be her partner.<br/><br/>It is well written, with a number of original twists, well-acted and it succeeded in keeping our interest throughout – rooting for the predictable outcome. I confess that I found some of the early action irritating as there is little doubt that Pat's outbursts of anger and violent behaviour should have resulted in his re-incarceration, yet the local cop does nothing – very odd. But I guess I am being picky, as there is much to like about this endearing collection of oddballs – from his wacky OCD friend - inmate Danny who keeps escaping and pretending that he has been legally released.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper is very good in the lead role and I just loved Jennifer Lawrence as his bipolar dancing partner. She is a sexy, amiable and a very good actress. I am a long-time fan of Robert de Niro and for me he can do no wrong – a bit like Al Pacino. So yet again he acquits himself incredibly well as the gambling mad father who puts everything he owns on the result of a football game and his son's dancing results.(A parlayapparently) It's all great fun and the movie deserves it plaudits. Did it deserve its Oscars? Hmm not too sure about that."

","David O. Russell's collaboration with Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence can be seen as a work of art and a dour mess. Just like Picasso's paintings, Silver Linings Playbook, with no reason behind its title, feels broken but whole at the same time. The on-screen duo, who're mentally unwell for different reasons, juxtapose the convoluted story. They're not the most likable singularly, but put together they're a tour de force. Both are equally outstanding; Cooper's Pat wants to win back his wife and the only way to do that is to help out Lawrence's Tiffany. As they grow closer, they become stronger characters that I'd happily watch over and over again."

","First time first I must say that I hate you David O'Russell for making a movie that not only full with great performances from its cast with a great story, but also make the drama light enough to be called as romantic-comedy and open up the possibilities of being liked by a lot more people.. The plot is simple, it is a family movie that tells stories about hope, love, and chances but the script just made this movie more and more entertaining to be watched.. Jennifer Lawrence's performance describe it all with her Oscar that she received from this movie, she's really flawless especially with the help of her other movies 'The Hunger Games' that also released in 2012.. Bradley Cooper, I just can't realized he can turned his performance to be an A-class Hollywood actor when the first time I know him I thought he'll trapped in a lot of comedy movie (Silver Linings is a comedy movie too, but different from his other previous movies).. Robert De Niro I guess there's no need to doubt his acting, while Jackie Weaver completed the performance with her 2nd nominated Oscar performance in this movie, two years in a row which just make her one great commodity actress to become the mom in a strong drama movie.. The other performances from the other cast were good too, Chris Tucker, Julia Stiles, John Ortiz, well they just need to be sharpen a little more so they can be turned into a diamond that shines..

"Screen_Blitz","8","0","1","17 November 2015"," Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are the true revelations of this grounded testament on love and complex relationships
","Silver Linings Playbook is a magnificent testament on family and complicated relationships uprooted unpleasant circumstances. It is charming story of love between two people find each other's in odd and and unexpected points in their lives. Who is a better director than David O. Russell to tackle on his ingenious tale? That's right, the famed director of the comedy 'Three Kings' and the dramas 'I Heart Huckabees' and 'The Fighter', operates with soaring humanity on bringing together this heart-stirring tale based on the Matthew Quick's 2008 novel of the same name. It is not your average romantic tale that Hollywood has helmed thousands of times to the point where two strangers fall in love and everything from there contributes to a formulaic trajectory before leading to a ""happily ever after"" conclusion. Here, things are a little more complicated than that, and that is where actor Bradley Cooper and actress Jennifer Lawrence come into to play, striking at the heart with performances that are too difficult to ignore. Bradley Cooper plays Pat Solitano, a man suffering from bipolar disorder and has somewhat frequent mood swings. His life takes a turn for the worse when he comes home to find his wife Nikki cheating on him with another man. After delivering the man a vicious beating, Nikki kicks out Pat of the house and files for divorce. After spending a few months in a psychiatric hospital, Pat moves in with his parents (played by Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver). In the meantime, he tries to rekindle his relationship with his now ex-wife, but this proves to be impossible since she's put him under a restraining order. One night, he is invited to a dinner where he meets a troubled young woman named Tiffany (played by Jennifer Lawrence) who's husband is dead and is living with her parents and sister Veronica (played by Julia Stiles). Pat and Tiffany began bonding and form a relationship, while learning that they both share the similar problems.<br/><br/>In a world where romantic dramas are often lie on the groundwork of run-of-the-mill formula, David O. Russell doesn't believe in pounding filmgoers on the head with overblown sentimentality or expectations. Instead, he offers more of an emotional build-up of a complex relationship rather than just going for the skill with sizzling the story of an endless cycle of hugs, kisses, and melodramatic disputes. What he does is challenge the viewers with a story between two characters that starts out as simple bond with no hints of love interest peeking in sight. In fact, as the story progresses, it digs the deep into the emotional problems two characters face in their lives that make seem almost impossible that a congruent relationship will likely brew. Bradley Cooper's Pat is emotionally disturbed by his past marriage that ended in an unhealthy note, while Jennifer Lawrence's Tiffany is a tragic character who feels lost in a world where everyone fails to make sense of her dilemmas. The truth is neither of them are more messed up than the other. As the two grow closer and closer, that is when the emotional resonance hits. And the chemistry between the two would not work as sufficiently without the genuine performances by Cooper and Lawrence, both of whom ground their roles with strong gravitas. Although their inflated age gap may their relationship a little difficult to buy into, these two Hollywood veterans know how to make things work, as does Robert De Niro who delivers a smear of charm as Bradley Cooper's father. Let's also not forget an unexpected appearance by Chris Tucker who been's off the map in several years following his departure from the 'Rush Hour' franchise, but it makes a sweet effort to return for a minor role as a dance teacher late in the film.<br/><br/>Silver Linings Playbook is a magnificent cinematic effort that shows Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence embraces their talent with amazing fortitude, and David O. Russell maturely tackling on a story that never feels hammy or contrived in any way. It is a film that taps at the heart while never shifting the light away from the admirable talent on and offscreen, and it all deserves your attention."

Being a fan of Bradley Cooper, it was amazing to see him in a role he's never done before and just absolutely nail it. Where was an Oscar for this role? He had a way of making the audience laugh with his no filter one liners about a disease that is, in reality, actually really serious. He made the character his own and didn't disappoint. Jennifer Lawrence rightfully deserved her Oscar playing Tiffany. With her heartbreaking meltdowns and quotes that we can all sometimes relate to. It's not a confusing plot. It's people trying to move on and continue with normality in their lives despite their mental illnesses and other things that happen. It shows a real but funny look on how to deal with these certain circumstances that can have a stigma behind on why we sometimes just crack."
"abbyclaussen","8","0","2","1 October 2015"," Silver Lining Playbook review
","All great movies have undiagnosed bipolar and mentally crazy characters in them, am I right? Well in the movie, The Silver Lining Playbook, by David O. Russell, two ""crazy"" characters are able to create the balance between normal and nutty, resulting to an extraordinary movie, along with the sensational music that helps set the mood. Pat, played by Bradley Cooper is an average Joe, until one mistake sends him away to a mental hospital, redefining the way he looks at life. Eight months later, Pat is released from the mental hospital with only one goal in mind; win back his estranged wife, Nikki, who wants nothing to do with him. As Pats plan seems to be going on a smooth ride, Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence, comes in the picture. She is just as crazy as Pat, having lost her husband to a tragic accident, she is one wheel away from falling off the train tracks. However, little do they know that what they need the most is somebody just as idiotic as themselves. Thanks to Pat, Tiffany is able to join a dance competition that she has wanted to do for years but never has had anyone willing to do it. Together Pat and Tiffany form a friendship over dance, exercise, lost, football, and most importantly life. Not everything in life has an explanation, but with the right attitude one can always find a silver lining. The bondage between Pat and Tiffany is what really ties the movie together as a whole. In the beginning of the movie, both characters are going through a rough time in their lives and do not have anybody to turn to. But, after they meet each other that all changes. Their past is what connects them and allows them to aide each other to overcome who they were with who they want to be. For example, during one of their dance rehearsals Nikki tells Pat how her husband died and what that did to her; with the idea that telling him this would comfort Pat into realizing that it is okay to feel and show emotions. Being crazy together is what they do best and for them that is that exactly what they need to start this new chapter in their lives. Music, something that helps people feel all sorts of emotions, can really be a lifesaver in times of need. With regards to this, in The Silver Lining Playbook, music is just as much a key component to the movie as the camera is to the making of the scene. Each scene has music that elaborates the storyline even more and brings the viewers to a deep emotional connection with the characters. Considering this, during the dance rehearsals, the music always flows with Pat and Tiffany's moods and feeling for that day, bringing the audience to feel as if they are in the movie with them. Just as the characters evolve throughout the movie, the music does as well, making it even more worthwhile. This movie will have the viewers laughing and smiling from start to finish; thanks to the direction of David O. Russell. David O Russell has a distinctive technique when it comes to the makings of his movies. His vision is simple, yet each scene portrays a magical moment that keeps the viewers wanting more. Some of Russell's particular specialties in his movies are the emotional attachment his characters get into, the long images within a scene, and the realness of the narrative content. Russell's distinct delivery of the Silver Lining Playbook is what makes this movie a must see. As a final point, The Silver Lining Playbook, is a movie worth seeing for all generations, guaranteed to brighten your day and help you accept that a little crazy in life can be a good thing."

Now she has a restraining order against him despite the fact that he plans to rekindle the marriage. Eventually he encounters Tiffany while out jogging. She too has issues that stem from the death of her husband and her sexual history that followed leading to her losing her job. After a few public episodes, she agrees to give a letter he wrote to his wife in return that he helps her win a dance contest. Cooper has rarely been better. He plays Pat as a desperate guy struggling to mend a relationship that may be beyond repair. Yet through Tiffany his focused is sighted on new abilities, friendship and healing. Tiffany is brilliantly played by Jennifer Lawrence who lives with her issues and outbursts but focuses on a goal that includes improving Pat.

","I read the book, then watched the movie. I wanted comparison, as I study it for educational purposes, and I have to say, I was impressed. <br/><br/>MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS<br/><br/>First off, I don't go into a movie adaptation of a book expecting anything. And especially shouldn't with this one. It's not totally different from the book. Some aspects are still attached, but this one is very jumbled compared to the book. But, this is a movie review. Not a book comparison.<br/><br/>As for the acting, I applaud anyone who can seep themselves into the shoes of someone ill. And between Bradley Cooper's bipolar character and Jennifer Lawrence's unstable one, these two had chemistry. In terms of romantic, it was breezy and unpredictable. Just on-screen, it makes me plead for more movies with them together. De Niro hits the nail on the head every time. I loved Stiles' blunt character as well. <br/><br/>I was iffy on cinematography at first, but I believe it all translates into the story. Shaky at the beginning, but sturdy at the end. I loved the pan in the part where Lawrence's character is jetting to the bar. And I loved the fussing family scene. It was intense, and as the tension built there and flopped back and forth, I found myself wanting to explode with the frustration. <br/><br/>Overall, I give it an 8/10. 8/10, because of the transcription from book to script was so off, yet 8/10 because it was really an enjoyable film."

","This movie has come to be one of my absolute favorites. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence make a perfect combo in this mildly twisted and awesome movie!<br/><br/>I rented this movie knowing nothing about it, saw it on the shelf and just picked it. As I had no expectations of it what so ever when I started watching it I admit, I was a bit sceptical. The dialogs, the camera angles... everything about this movie was so different from movies I had previously seen. But, as the story went on (I would not give up on this movie despite how I felt in the beginning), it just got better and better!<br/><br/>I have recommended this movie to all of my friends and have also, by now, seen it myself about ten or fifteen times since Februari 2015 (and I'm not even embarrassed about that), which is basically the best way for me to explain how good this movie is to me."

","This movie was great. Great acting by Cooper, Lawrence, De Niro & even Tucker. O. Russell did a great job directing this movie.<br/><br/>Pat & Tiffany are just two characters who the audience can find themselves attached to and can also learn a thing or two from. They are funny and relatable in more ways than one might think that they are. <br/><br/>I've been seeing people say that it's a boring movie, but honestly, if you find the patience for it, you will eventually begin to understand the film. Along with if you've read and enjoyed the novel by Matthew Quick. <br/><br/>Moving along, the performances of De Niro and Tucker were very realistic and attachable. Cooper & Lawrence did the most phenomenal jobs trying to beat one another in who is the most mental. Altogether this was an excellent film that I would recommend being watched by people of all ages.

","This film is an excellent look at life with bi-polar disorder and love. It focuses around a man who is released form the hospital and he aims to get his life back on track. His father(Rober De Nero) wants him to try to be part of the family again but he pushed him too far. Pat(Bradely Cooper) then meets Tiffany the crazy woman who husband has just died. the two fall for each other and enter a dance competition. Tiffany is played by Jennifer Lawrence, who won an Oscar for her performance, is dark and hilarious at times. The film does deal with the disease in a serious way but does add in laughter to make sure the viewer dosen't end up in tears. The whole cast shine and the film was nominated for 8 Osacrs in total."

"vijayprasanna2896","8","0","3","12 April 2015"," Jennifer Lawrence soars really high here.
","Silver linings playbook is easily one of the best movies in the year. This is a film that could gone wrong really bad and turned into into a big mess. But inspite of all , this film is hugely entertaining and has got some really solid stuff in it. Jennifer Lawrence is something else in this movie, her silences and condescending looks warn you of some imminent danger and bring subtle change is the movie's direction. Bradley Cooper is really good too and so is Robert De Niro. The reason this movie is able to stride forward without falling apart is because of the performances of the actors, one of the best in the year, and gripping screenplay, and unique visual style. However, my only disappointment is that the movie runs on well trodden story- boys with problems meets a similar girl and they find love. But the only excuse that I have is that there is good family drama too which prevents the movie from dwelling on a cheesy plot. It's a really good movie and if you haven't watched it, give it a try. Not a waste of time, I can guarantee that."
"Kings_Requiem","10","0","5","23 March 2015"," Excelsior!
","It's without a doubt the best movie of the year. Everything about it is just so spot on. I hope it cleans house at the Oscars because it definitely deserves it. I just related to this in a BIG way. I've been pretty much exactly where Bradley Cooper's character was and I still deal with it on a daily basis. Even certain things that he did during scenes were things that I've done before. Just crazy. <br/><br/>The cast is absolutely fantastic. Cooper is so great. I've always liked him, but this is just so completely different from anything he's done and he sells it all perfectly. Lawrence is a revelation. I would say its definitely her most mature performance to date and arguably her best. DeNiro finally with a performance that actually means something. He's great as well and really proves why he was such a good actor in the first place and thankfully shows us what we've all been missing these last few years. Chris Tucker and Jackie Weaver are also there, but neither one is really given much to do in order to make a significant impact. <br/><br/>This so seamlessly blends the comedy and drama together that its kind of surprising. For a movie to make you laugh one second then put you through that emotional wringer the next is just great and its really an amazing accomplishment. Yes this movie does have a lot of the usual trappings that most romantic comedies have, but what sets this one apart is its characters and writing and commitment to seeing these characters through to end. This isn't your traditional McConaughey/Hudson bubble gum Rom-com where nothing really matters and we couldn't really care less what happens to these people...this is something different and something substantial and their problems are real and what they go through actually matters. These are people we actually care about. <br/><br/>So we don't mind if the outcome is a little predictable because the actors have created such rich characters that we like and who we wanna see happy and who we wanna see overcome their troubles. Life is full of struggles and it always will be. Wives cheat, husbands die, and football teams lose, but as long we have people we love and people who love us there to keep us going then we'll be okay. Time heels all wounds and we're all just looking for that silver lining."
"Gideon24","9","0","5","19 March 2015"," A blistering drama rich with sharp performances
","Writer/director David O. Russell, who first caught my attention with Three Kings hit a bullseye and created his masterpiece with Silver Linings Playbook, a quietly intense, strikingly original, and blistering drama that simultaneously tells a fascinating story and affords the viewer the opportunity to imagine the backstory without ever taking our focus away from what is happening on the screen. I haven't seen anything this original on the screen since Being John Malkovich.<br/><br/>The 2012 film stars Bradley Cooper as Pat Solatano Jr., a former teacher who apparently had a mental/emotional meltdown of such intensity that he lost his job, his ex-wife divorced him and put out a restraining order against him, got banned from the school where he worked, and was committed to a mental institution. As the story unfolds, Pat is being released from the institution, thanks to his mother, after eight months and against medical advice and moves in with his parents, with one mission on his mind and one only: to reconcile with his ex-wife Nikki. Enter Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a friend of a friend of Nikki's, with issues of her own, who is aware of Pat's obsession with Nikki and uses it to her advantage to get what she wants from Pat, which turns out to be more than she thought and is in deep denial about.<br/><br/>Russell's Oscar nominated screenplay based on a novel by Matthew Quick, fascinates because despite the fact that the two lead characters speak without filters and are searingly honest about their feelings, while at the same time, we are never told exactly what happened eight months earlier that actually landed Pat in the institution and I found my imagination running wild trying to imagine exactly what Pat had done. As a matter of fact, as I watching the film at one point, I actually said to myself regarding the character of Pat that this guy speaks without filters and about five minutes later, the character actually said the exact same thing on screen. I loved the fact that even though Pat does speak without filters, he never revealed exactly what he did to land him in his current position and is in complete denial about the fact that Nikki no longer wants anything to do with him. <br/><br/>Russell's direction, which also got him an Oscar nomination, is on the money, particularly in his depiction of the the other characters in Pat's orbit. It was so fascinating to watch the reaction of people in Pat's Philadelphia neighborhood to his return...every time the slightest noise comes from the house, all of the neighbors pop out of their windows to see what's going on. There's a great moment where Pat briefly returns to the school where he taught in an effort to get his job back and we see a teacher literally run into the building in terror when she sees him coming. Again, it forces the viewer to wonder what the hell this guy did that prompted this kind of reaction from a former co- worker. We notice throughout that people are either frightened of Pat or walk on eggshells around him and this is done without dialogue for the most part, and that can only be credited to evocative direction.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper turned in the performance of his career, that should have won him an Oscar, as Pat, a tragic figure trying to start his life over without really facing the demons of his past and his inability to accept the fact that his ex-wife wants nothing to do with him. Jennifer Lawrence won the Oscar for Outstanding Lead Actress for her explosive Tiffany, a character whose vulnerability is only overshadowed by her unpredictability...you NEVER know what this girl is going to do from one moment to the next and that's what makes the character so fascinating to watch.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro and Jackie Weaver also received supporting actor nominations for their performances as Pat's parents, people who are so consumed with love for their son that they too seem to be in denial about the fact that they might have checked Pat out of the institution prematurely. De Niro has rarely been so quietly moving on screen and Weaver is just superb and should have won Best Supporting Actress. Mention should also be made of the performances of John Ortiz and Chris Tucker as friends of Pat from the inside and the outside who support him no matter what. This is the closest thing to an actual human being that Tucker has ever played.<br/><br/>A one-of-a-kind motion picture that will haunt long after the credits roll and demand multiple viewings."

","Silver Linings Playbook was a very pleasant surprise, and I say this with complete and utter understatement. It felt so good watching the film that I'm thinking I could have upped my rating a tad. Among all the movies I've seen recently, this one was the first one, the first American film that felt like a complete product, or work of art. After a golden generation of overachievers, there always comes a lesser generation struggling to find their calling. Their style. David O. Russell - I haven't yet read the book - adapted a love story that reached to me at a time when I wasn't looking for a romantic movie.<br/><br/>I didn't even know the genre of the movie. And I think the threadbare first half of it, lit up whenever Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) appeared, was a successful exercise in making a gritty romantic comedy. I liked how shameless the script was. The words never got vulgar, despite the grimdark subject matter. I knew something interesting was happening before my tired, jaded eyes when Tiffany asked Pat to have sex, and he refuses. We do have a glimpse of Tiffany's bare back, reflected from a mirror. The real flash of brilliance is that the mental illness of the two main characters, does two things. It provides a plausible reason for Tiffany falling in love with Pat. Secondly it provides an opportunity to sidestep the pitfall researching mental ill health for the sake of psychoanalyzing misery, pain, deprivation, alienation, and lust. The decision to say no both to sentimentalism and cynicism meant that the filmmakers simplified their task. <br/><br/>The best decisions are also the simplest. The casting director could have chosen any guy for the role of Danny. Instead they chose Chris Tucker, a guy who is no longer credible in any role he plays, walks by or flies over. Instead of trying to bulk up the lean running time of the film by introducing Tiffany's mum and her own issues, we get only what's important. This is reflected by the empty, renovated garage where Lawrence and Cooper will practice their dance. Lawrence says she thought of putting a ballet barre there. I loved this movie. It felt good watching it. As soon as I realized Lawrence and Cooper will not copulate, and do drugs, I realized I was watching a chick flick, but I forgot the set up quickly and didn't care if it was a feel good movie. Not what I even dreamed of, but it was retrospectively the best film that I could have seen. The characters of Tiffany and Pat are going to live happily ever after. Tiffany says that she didn't want to have children. Smart girl. Hope the review has been helpful to you."

","SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is basically DIRTY DANCING with mentally ill people. Two lost souls - Bradley Cooper just out of the nut house after having been diagnosed as bipolar following his wife's affair, Jennifer Lawrence an ex- slut still broken up by her cop-husband's death in a traffic accident - find each other in Philly. When she becomes a conduit for him to pass messages to his wife (who has a restraining order on him) he agrees to help her in her dance competition. Throw in De Niro, in a rare recent performance that isn't phoned in, as his OCD bookie dad and you've got a film. It's a cleverly written and well acted new spin on an old formula which makes it one of the best American rom-coms in recent years."

","Hearing a lot about this movie around the time it came out in 2012 and seeing the trailer, I had to see it. I finally got around to it after I came home from being away for 5 months at Army Basic Training... and it didn't let me down. <br/><br/>I had known Bradley Cooper from the Hangover and Wedding Crashers, and his performance as Pat proved to me that he can do more than be a comedic actor. He is really funny, but he finds the right combination of drama and comedy. Having seen him in this, America Hustle and American Sniper, he's come a long way from doing comedy and I look forward to whatever else he does in the future. Jennifer Lawrence gets a lot of hate these days because she's insanely famous now and has been nominated for Oscar 3 times winning 1 for this movie. Call me a fanboy all you want but I think she earned it. Like Cooper's character, she's funny but also finds the right dramatic beats as well. Not to mention she's very beautiful ;) Sorry... Couldn't resist. They also prove to be strangely perfect for one another since they both bond over the fact that they're really out there. This is the best that Robert De Niro has been in years, he almost had me in tears at one point. And the rest of the cast was really good also. <br/><br/>I'm not bipolar, but I have a tendency to be really emotional when the situation doesn't require it, and I related to this story and how some of my family's habits can get on my nerves particularly my father and sister. Because we all have that part inside of us that makes us in a way ""crazy"", some more than others. David O Russell finds the right balance between drama and comedy, and the emotional moments can be really intense to the point where you might feel uncomfortable (in the right way). And with the ending of Pat and Tiffany getting together fits in with the overall theme that even when things aren't going well for you, there's still a bright side to it and it does get better in the long run. And I think people need to stop complaining about them getting together. Like that doesn't happen in real life. Life isn't always dark and depressing. And as an Eagles fan, I dug the hell out of the football stuff :) <br/><br/>With a movie like this, it could've easily come off as sappy and eye rolling but David O. Russell found the right tone and making the characters and story feel grounded. And I also liked the soundtrack with Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash and the musical score by Danny Elfman. I'm proud to say that this movie has become one of my all time favorite movies."

","Its complexity begins within its characters. After a stint in a mental institution, former teacher Pat Solitano moves back in with his parents and tries to reconcile with his ex-wife. The content isn't for everyone. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. The movie has enough to keep you entertained and the directing and cinematography are well done. A little too slow-paced for a film. The urge to just walk away almost got me a couple of times. But, in the end, this is an excellent character study."
"williemajeska7","9","0","4","23 July 2014"," This movie will restore your faith in Hollywood
","In an era in which it is tough to find a film where you genuinely feel for each and every character David O' Russell's Silver Linings Playbook restores faith in the fact that it can still be done. It is a film that tell's a love story through the unique lens of mental illness. This unique lens allows us to look at things we take for granted such as relationships and day to day life in a way that shows how complex and difficult they can actually be. While at the same time showing how important it is to have these relationships because everyone needs the love and support of others to get through life. Whether it be dealing with mental illness or the loss of a loved one we often can't handle it alone and need aid from those who truly care to get through these times. This film shows the stresses that are put upon those who become the helpers while also showing that in the end the helping hand you reach out to others often pays off for you in the end as well. Helping others helps you and giving people a chance despite their mental condition or any other circumstance is worth it because you never know what that person has to offer unless the chance is given.<br/><br/>The film features one of the most beautiful, unique, slow-burning romances i've ever seen in a film and the climax is well worth the wait. It is a masterful work all around, the acting by Cooper and Lawrence as well as the rest of the star studded cast create the perfect mood and atmosphere for such a story. The tone is perfect and the issues that are dealt with in the film are handled in a gentle way that allows us to learn and observe throughout as we can see the inner workings of the characters minds via facial expression and wonderful script.<br/><br/>All in all I'd say this film is the best film of 2012 due to the fact that it tells one of the most beautiful love stories ever put to film in a way that not only entertains but educates and enlightens. A must see film. I didn't really delve into much of the actual plot and goings on of the film because I want you to be able to experience that for yourself, I felt that a review such as this one would show what I thought of/ took from this film in a way that would inspire others to watch it/ watch it again. Hopefully it worked. Thanks."

","This film is a work of art in itself. It was masterfully directed, and very worthwhile to watch. The acting, of course, was top-notch. Every member of the cast pulled through with an exceptional performance. <br/><br/>The best of this film, though, can be appreciated in it's subtleties. The character development was dedicated, but not in-your-face. Throughout the story, we experience a tantalizing build-up to a climax. The chemistry between Lawrence and Cooper is almost tangible, especially as they dance. The final few scenes, within which the story arcs, are spectacular. Instead of relating to the characters, I felt as if I WAS one of the characters. It felt that real. <br/><br/>Truly, much more depth to this movie than I ever anticipated. I hope to see more like it very soon."

","Interesting and memorable dramedy about an emotionally scarred pair, one with bipolar disorder who is recently released from a psychiatric hospital (Cooper) and the other a young widow (Lawrence). The two leads do an excellent job of showing their characters' instability without ever being overly-dramatic or pity-party about it. The story is grounded in reality very well, but the romantic climax falls into place a little too easily. De Niro, Herman, Kher, Mihok, Ortiz, Stiles, Tucker and Whigham are all terrific in their supporting roles, but it seems like Weaver might let her Australian accent slip and is definitely not convincing as a Philly homemaker. Based on the book by Matthew Quick. Definitely a movie with replay value. Captures the difficulty of living with bipolar very well and how it also interferes with loved ones.<br/><br/>***½ (out of four)"

","The Silver Linings Playbook focuses on many types of mental illness and some characteristics that sign mental illness. The protagonist Pat has a number of mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, bipolar and possibly ADHD. In the film this is depicted very well and seems very realistic but still makes it light hearted. Other characters such as Pat's friend/ love interest Tiffany also ha signs of mental illness and has been on all the medications that are for people with things such as depression but has not actually been diagnosed with a mental illness as far as we know although she may have grief due to the passing of her husband."
"dom-lerose-8","Null","0","2","15 June 2014"," 'Silver Linings Playbook' just works in every way! It's one of the most feel-good films of all time!
","Mental illness is an issue all over the world. It ruins lives and causes many problems. Mental illness can also cause goodness. In David O.Russell's terrific film 'Silver Lining's Playbook' we see two unique characters, Pat and Tiffany, who struggle from emotional and mental problems. Bradley Cooper plays Pat, an ex-teacher who is recently released from a mental health institution. Pat tries to make his life better by working things out with his relationships. His wife left him due to his problems and cheated on him before hand. Pat has extreme anger issues that are revealed multiple times, and are especially powerful in an intense fight between him and his tough father played by Robert De Niro. Pat is agitated easily, is pretty lonely, isn't happy with the way things are going, and then meets Tiffany. She has her own issues. Tiffany is played exceptionally by Jennifer Lawrence. Tiffany is unemployed due to sexual matter, has a deceased husband, has anger and emotional issues, and doesn't really have anyone in her life. As the two form a relationship, they enter a dance competition which helps their friendship grow. What's excellent about this film is that it shows what it's like having mental illness and how it can be solved. The themes of friendship, acceptance, and love show how people can fight mental illness. It also shows how people who have struggles are still people and should be treated as so. Every actor was terrific. Bradley Cooper proves he's more than just a comedian by giving the best performance of an actor in 2012. Jennifer Lawrence gives a break-through performance as well. The supporting cast including Jackie Weaver and Robert De Niro are wonderful and realistic as well. David O.Russell's screenplay is so rich and contains excellent characters and themes and is overall a healthy, delightful, feel-good story. He also adds monumental directing to capture the change and glory of the characters to make this one of the most inspiring films you'll ever see!"
"Chase_Witherspoon","6","0","1","13 June 2014"," Urban neurotics
","Cooper is almost believable as some kind of crazy-eyed (though functional) neurotic, with an unpredictable demeanour whose quest to win back his estranged wife detours in an unexpected direction when he seeks to exploit her recently widowed sister to 'broker' the reconciliation. As the two spend more time in each other's company, a mutual attraction blossoms and while it's a predictable outcome, it's not without moments of endearment.<br/><br/>The concept is fine and some of the whacky characterisations are stand- outs (Chris Tucker in particular), but I found the dialogue at times seemed too sophisticated, or perhaps self-indulgent, like a poor-man's Woody Allen movie where everyone exhibited a varying degree of neuroticism and always had something prophetic to announce with just the right sense of timing. Jennifer Lawrence is clearly a capable actress, confident and sultry, but at times I felt she in particular suffered most from the self-aware dialogue and it made her character uneven as a result. <br/><br/>There are some quirky characterisations in both Tucker and Wigham's roles, and while DeNiro's presence elevates the prestige of an otherwise small-scale movie as a middle-class Jewish, sport-loving patriarch, I still felt the material was well beneath his capabilities – more subtlety on the page was desperately needed at times. Weaver's part as the seemingly docile, traditional-domesticated wife I just couldn't grasp – the erratic accent and a role so minor I was struggling to comprehend why all the hyperventilating concerning her portrayal; how she'd scored an Oscar nomination for such an innocuous performance eludes me. <br/><br/>Despite my criticisms, it's still very watchable and not without genuine interest, just not what I would label a great film worthy of the plaudits it garnered on its premiere; one of those films where some of the individual components display more promise than the overall result actually achieves. In short, it's a good movie but not a great movie."

The ending dance scene was hilarious. <br/><br/>The Bad:Ending seems illogical,because we see on screen it appears as though Pat's illness is treated only after taking a few pills,and going in to dating Tiffany.I liked the ending from the book better,it shows that Pat is still fighting his illness,but also tries to handle his love for Tiffany.My absolute favorite parts from the book are missing such as Pat finding out Nikki has moved on,and she got remarried.Also,in the book,Pat Sr. rarely talks to Pat when he gets home,and Dolores,can't stand it and decides to give up on cleaning and doing everything she does that Pat Sr. won't do until Pat and him get along.I would have gave it a 10/10,without the illogical ending,and it didn't miss part from the book.<br/><br/>But overall,the acting is amazing.It still captures the most important moments from the book.And is a great mix of drama and comedy.I'm so glad one of my favorite books,was made into a good movie,which captures the best elements from the book,while leaving out some,of course."

","Quite a jumbled up mixed bag of a movie here. Jennifer Lawrence won the Academy Award for Best Actress for this? That was not an Oscar winning performance. She was great at times, with a monologue or two that I can see helped seal the win, but Jessica Chastain was WAY better in Zero Dark Thirty. Overall, Ms. Lawrence was just very good but not exceptional. Bobby De Niro was great, I sure hope he was runner-up for Best Supporting Actor (if they have such a thing with the voters behind the scenes.) Bradley Cooper definitely deserved his nomination for Best Actor. So well done. But the movie lost me at the dancing and then seemed to take a whole different direction with the football. I've got nothing against either but they just didn't jive with the first half of the story. Because I am a man, I am not supposed to especially like romance stories but this one here works and I liked it a lot. Obvious, yes, but I probably like it because it was kind of discreet and sneaks up on the viewer rather than being so stupidly and grossly in your face the whole time. The story has much more to it than that. For some reason I wanted to like this more, and I still give it a fairly high grade, but a Best Picture nomination? If the Academy never idiotically expanded the field to 9 films, I sure hope this would not have made the cut.<br/><br/>7.5 / 10<br/><br/>--A Kat Pirate Screener"

The film was a roller coaster of emotions...anger, humor, despair, elation, etc. Welcome to the bipolar world. I thought the director did a splendid job of thoughtfully exposing bi-polarism and how it can affect those who suffer from it and their families. This is a film that stirs your emotions...in a variety of ways. And, isn't that the goal of filmmakers...to move you. SLP gets a 10 for zapping a plethora of emotions in me.

Jennifer Lawrence deservedly won the Oscar, and Bradley Cooper did a phenomenal job too. I fortunately don't deal with mental illness (regardless of what my friends think), but the writers made it easily understandable within the context of the story, and of course the acting immersed you into the struggles. Anything that might come across as a crazy reaction or situation in any other movie makes sense here, and not in a dismissive way like ""anything can happen because they're crazy"". It's a family drama with heart, some laughs thrown in and a touch of romance, all in a believable setting (especially if you believe pretty people can be as messed up as anyone else). 8/10"

","When Pat Solitano Jr. gets discharged from a court ordered stay in a mental hospital, the only thing on his mind is to reunite with his wife Nikki, who has a restraining order on him for beating up her lover. The audience is treated to an emotional sometimes funny roller coaster ride of pitfalls and obstacles Pat refuses to see. Determined to show his wife he is a changed man, Pat tells his therapist he doesn't need medication and chooses instead to maintain a positive state of mind and look for the ""silver linings."" <br/><br/>It isn't long before the viewer understands the scope of Pat's issues during his melt downs and violent reactions every time he hears his wedding song, (Stevie Wonder's ""My Cherie Amour,"") among other triggers. Tiffany Maxwell, a recent widow with issues of her own, meets Pat at his friend's house and sparks fly between them. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence have real chemistry and the audience is immediately smitten with these two misfits. Aside from sharing the same kinds of medications, Pat and Tiffany seem to understand each other. Pat sees a means to communicate to Nikki through Tiffany and she promises to give Nikki (her sister's best friend) a letter from Pat, but in exchange he must be her dance partner in a competition. <br/><br/>Complications arise when Pat's father bets on a Philadelphia Eagles game, money he's been saving to open a restaurant. His OCD and unusual superstitions lead to some very funny scenes. As a die hard Philadelphia Eagles fan he is convinced his son, who has been rehearsing with Tiffany instead of attending games is causing the Philadelphia Eagles to lose. This leads to one of the best scenes and major turning points in the film when Tiffany having been stood up, confronts Pat at his house. The outburst is hilarious and powerful to watch. The stakes go up when Pat's father raises the bet and uses his son's dance competition score as a parlay to win back his money. Now everything rides on the dance competition and Pat feeling the pressure, refuses to compete. <br/><br/>This movie offers an unusual love story supported by a very strong cast. Bradley Cooper was the biggest surprise for me. Having seen him previously in comedies like ""Hangover,"" Cooper gives an outstanding performance and proves he has the acting range to tackle complex difficult roles. David O.Russell's adapted screenplay based on the novel by Matthew Quick also does a great job as director of ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and garnered two Academy award nominations. Russell was originally attracted to the project because his own son suffers from a bipolar disorder and OCD,issues addressed in the movie. Russell brings sensitivity and strikes a balance with the characters and their neurosis in the film. All four lead actors including Robert Deniro, (as Pat's dad) earned Academy Award nominations. Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany, gives a sassy multi-layer touchdown performance and won the Oscar for best actress.""Silver Linings Playbook"" is worth watching!

I shut down my computer while the credits were still running, threw on my clothes and walked with Purpose on Playoff, football Sunday to a local watering hole with Wifi, to sip on a beer while I write down my thoughts on this fantastic film. The story of the short circuiting of human emotions painted in this film has filled me with adrenaline. My heart is beating as if I just sprinted, my hands are trembling a little. The spectrum of scenarios that triggered emotional meltdowns in nearly every character of this great cast could not have been more authentic. Delusional relationships, a song, gambling, obsessiveness, inappropriateness, hyperactivity, loss, sex, love, arrogance, zero filter.<br/><br/>There was an innocence in the flow of the dialogue. There was understanding, suspicion, awkwardness. Whether good or bad, the consequences related to the perception or delusion of not being understood struck me like a 90 mile hour fast ball in the ribs.<br/><br/>No one goes through life without being misunderstood on occasion, the problem is that some folks live with the delusion of being misunderstood all the time. The surfacing of not being in control of your feelings is what makes living interesting and of course dangerous as well. <br/><br/>Who doesn't want to be consumed with love?? I can understand breaking in to a fight for my brother. I'd show, or at least try ( I'd probably fail ) at controlling my hormones for a dancing partner as fine as Jennifer Lawrence for a woman I still Love. I can understand trying to control my hormones for that woman I still Love and the delusion of her loving me back. A woman, my wife of nearly a decade who I caught cheating on me with a colleague, in my house, with our wedding song playing in the back-ground. I'd confuse my fathers love for his very apparent obsessive compulsiveness. I'd understand my friends obsession with his haircut and his rain man knowledge of the Law. My other buddies over-worked, loveless marriage that hates his job. A marriage with an overbearing controlling wife, newly minted with a baby, a mortgage. The stress and craziness, on the cusp of having a nervous breakdown you hear in the rants he only reveals to you.<br/><br/>This cast was colorful. Chris Tucker and John Ortiz gave wonderful performances !

Some may say if you want to see the best of Jennifer Lawrence you should have to watch 'Hunger games', of cause she helped a lot to make huge gross profit on the series but trust me that is not her best, but this is. Hope you remember the part when she broke into Pat's house after Eagles lost the match and Pat Sr. lost everything to Randy and make a scene confusing everyone. I literally replayed that scene for more than ten times and still it makes me say 'Wow'. In the movie Bradley Cooper plays Pat's role really well, and others also do their parts actually well.

I went into the theater hopeful, because of the beautiful and unique cast line up, but still haunted with a lingering cloud of doubt (especially after sitting down with a film like Prozac Nation.) I expected the acting to be favorable, the scenes to be cliché, and maybe sometimes over exaggerated. What I got instead was an amazing chemistry between Lawrence and Cooper, scenes and characters that I could relate too, and a light shined on mental illness and what it is truly like to live with it, or live with somebody who has one. <br/><br/>The film starts out in a mental institute, with Cooper's character having just woke up and beginning his day with his morning routine. It is his last day in the institute, he is finally to be released to his family - who must monitor his every move. He works steadily toward his goal of overcoming his illness as to gain his wife's love back. Along his journey of rehabilitation he meets a woman, (Lawrence's character) who he's known of all of his life, but has never realized just how much they share in common. <br/><br/>It's an exploratory story on the darkness of mental illness, and also the light that can be found despite all of the struggling.

","So as probably many of you (me included) haven't read the book that this movie is based on. Well you know what? It doesn't matter at all. The movies plot have a different ending and a different take on the storyline than the book. The movie tells a tale of a man that just got out of mental institution trying to get back with his family. His father constantly wants him to see the Eagles games with him, whereas in the book his father hardly talk to him and when he does his dancing thing the Eagles lose three games in a row in the book. Now this doesn't really matter at all, the movie and the book shouldn't be seen as the same. It is lovely based on the book, but leaves out to many essential elements to be a true ""book- movie"". It is like the book is Pats and his moms (which name is actually Jeanie and not Dolores) view on the story and the movie is how Pats father would (in a theoretical perspective) reply if asked about his relationship with his son. I would though recommend seeing the movie before you read the book or else you will be annoyed by the differences, whereas if you see the movie and then read the book (like me) you'd probably enjoy the different story. <br/><br/>As far as actors go, Jennifer Lawrence is Tiffany! Coming from seeing countless interviews before I read the book and saw the movie it shocked me how simular Jennifer Lawrence personality is to the character Tiffany in the book. Lawrence is a down to earth, non-cocky, kinda ""don't give a f***"" person. Reading the book she is just perfect, seeing how she talks and displays herself in interviews the crew couldn't found a better Tiffany. As for Bradley as Pat I'm not so sure, could've probably found a better personality, but lookvice he is a pretty decent depictation of Pat. De Niro great as always, really works the role as a man who is not sure whether to accept his son back, but still tries his best. Also very good depict action. <br/><br/>I rated it a 8, since it is as a standalone movie and not as a book depictation a great entertaining movie. If I where to rate it on how well they recreate the book as a movie it would've been maybe a 5 or even a 4, the director just allowed himself to much freedom to pick what he liked from the book and leave out what he didn't. Still a great movie."

","I started watching this movie at my office and in the first 10 min. it struck to me that it is going to be something great...first of all bravo for Jenifer Lawrence acting and B. Cooper great too. Tiffany (JL) is such an amazing portrayal of a mentally imbalanced person...she just pours life into it. Robert D'nero is an cool OCD mind, crafted so beautifully. Pace of the film is such that you actually live the life with them and you don't want it to end. and yes i had tears.

","The film tells an absolutely great love story. That someone from a psychiatric comes to a better person to win back his true love is exciting and interesting. Great idea!

Jennifer Lawrence is good, but had already delivered better performance. Robert De Niro is absolutely great, but unfortunately goes completely under.<br/><br/>The narrative also knows for weak points. How to develop Tiffany love to Pat, why is unclear what Pat Nikki whispers at the end and why Tiffany knows all of a sudden the football results ...

","As a person who has been dealing with Bipolar Disorder for almost four years now I found this movie very hard to watch. Not because it was bad but be cause of how accurate and relatable Bradley's character was. With BP you are out of control and in denial and in fact During a manic episode i hit a person i deeply cared about and was hospitalized for it and that was what made the movie hard to watch because for most of it, it was like seeing a reflection. I'm the last person to say all people BP are the same and act like this but most who have it as long as they are stable the can find some way to relate to it, but people who don't understand BP might find this movie a bit of a over reaction and I don't think people understand that what was Pat's driving force, His wife he didn't see that as obsession he saw the need to be with his wife as a way to keep him stable. And all of the arguments that could have seemed nonsensical were logical in his mind. Yes there were some absolutely cliché and predictable moments but I think that is what made the film whole with out them on screen you would see a crazy man doing crazy things for a reason that could have put him in jail. the predictability of the movie gave it stableness and depth."

","It is difficult to write a review on a film that was made out of creative imagination based on reality. If you are the type of guy who wants dominating action through the entire film like John Rambo or Expendables movie, maybe this is not for you. However, you can try shifting to another genre and see if this movie works for you. This movie is best for people who have patience in understanding the situation and can analyze each line from those who plays it. Scripts are great and meaningful so you wouldn't have a chance not to think but amaze. <br/><br/>The story runs on two basic individuals who are both worn out from their past. Pat (Cooper) whose wife cheated on him by having an affair to a history teacher and caught them having sex in the bathroom. It resulted to a violent event. Pat was sent to a mental institution to mend the feeling of depression, anger, frustration and other contributing factors that made him incapable to function as normal thinking individual. The movie story starts after his released from the mental institution. In this film, Cooper has shown a very unique acting talent which I have never seen in the past. He took viewers into a level in which you can feel how ground is shaking when someone got into trouble from the past and how to recover from enduring pain that brought false hopes and eventually turned into another fruitful result on the hands of newly known woman (Tiffany). <br/><br/>Tiffany is totally broken when she lose her husband from a car accident. She found ways to cover loneliness by acting like a whore to the point that she is possibly having sex to everybody in the office where she worked and got fired. <br/><br/>Laurence who played Tiffany in the film made a difference on her acting career. It is on different stage and far from her previous acting movie but being pretty and sexy was never removed from her natural inclination. <br/><br/>This movie implies recovery from down and hopeless situation into positive mindset as it tells you that life may break your heart ten ways to Sunday and see the reason why Sunday is your favorite day again. <br/><br/>The story is really good that set part on them and how they cope with the challenge from their past and the way to the present situation that will change their views as they continue to discover things that will make them happy and affirmative in life."

","Let me start off by saying that Jennifer Lawrence is my favorite young actress as of right now because of this movie, she and cooper have such a great chemistry together, i loved her acting. She and cooper are two people suffering from problems caused by different traumas in there lives, one being psychological and the other being physical/behavioral. You really connect with the characters, if your someone who has been or is in a similar situation you automatically connect with them, an no i am not just talking about having a mental problem, but having feeling that no one else gets you, that life is just passing you by while your living in your parents house and because you can't get over certain aspects of your life you feel like there is no way out unless you change completely. Well this is the story of two people very much alike in a weird but good way, the honest direct nature of these two individuals is just captivating you cannot look away, many of us have things you just wan't to say and release but you can't because of how people might think of you. Bottom line these types of movies aren't for the feint of heart and if you like, straight forward no bullshit direct type of movies with drama and some romance than by all means, watch this movie i highly recommend it."

","I didn't expect this. When the academy awards came out I didn't understand why the best actress didn't go to the old lady in Amour. Now maybe I have a clue. I laughed all the way through the first half and laughed sometimes through the second half. Jennifer presented a characteristic girl consistently; in the dancing competition she was like a princess but she was still this girl. Everyone needs a girl like her in his life. She really makes who you are. And after making it all about you, she will show her vulnerability and it's your time to take care of her and that's when you grow. The story is a little bit like the epic of Gilgamesh for me. I can identify with the main character. The story deals with modern problem; everyone is insane and sick in some way, yet with strong will, companion and help, we can finally overcome shitty situations and be happy. My parents are lunatics and I'm still pretty green in the dating field. At the age of 18, stepping into finding friends and partners, I need this exact movie in my freshmen year. The camera is skillful. It makes the audience feel sick and angry when it wants to. And the dance competition scene and the kissing scene are dreamy and like a modern version fairy tale. This movie is a modern version fairy tale. I first felt like ending the movie with the beautiful shot of them kissing and all the Christmas lights, but after second thought, I agree this movie needs a final scene to tell people explicitly that they live happily ever after, which is the ending Pat wanted since he hates Hemingway so much."

","To date this has to be Bradley Coopers finest work, it just goes to show he can act given a fine script such as this. Silver linings play book is a clever movie where by the camera work is both focused and random all of which appears to be deliberate. The dialogue and script as well is also somewhat random in parts, but this too I felt was deliberate as we are watching a movie about people who have issues on differing levels and it shows that nobody is without their quirks and it gives the sense that you are also in that world to. As the trick here is that is only slightly hinted at what the full gravity of why Pat(Bradley) was in an institution.<br/><br/>I don't normally do ""Romance"" but this movie is an exceptional example on how not to do just slush but have a well crafted movie on top. Both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are perfectly cast and steal the screen and Robert De Niro's performance is also brilliant and not his usual hard man role."

","I found it a little hard to get into at first with Bradley Cooper over- acting in places, which was beginning to put me off. The introduction of Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) though changed all that and the narrative began to make more sense. All the performances were excellent with (for me) Jennifer Lawrence standing out. Yes, I know De Niro is there but he's really not a major character although he does play his part very well. Bradley Cooper was good, but no better really than I have seen him before. The action is littered with an awful lot of music, some I was familiar with and some not so much; all of it fitted the visuals well though and it made for a welcome enhancement to the entertainment. Over all I found it a well rounded romantic comedy (with some drama thrown in for good measure) and just a twist of quirkiness. It even touched me on an emotional level (a rare thing these days) so it gets a pretty high recommendation from me.<br/><br/>SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED<br/><br/>My score: 8.3/10.<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."

","After getting released from a mental institution, Pat (Bradley Cooper) moves back in with his parents and dedicates his life to patching things up with his ex-wife. Things start to get a bit more complicated when he meets the gorgeous Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), who has mental health problems of her own, and the two strike up an odd friendship.<br/><br/>The best thing about 'Silver Linings Playbook' is that you have some very good actors doing some very good acting. The film itself is alright, I wouldn't say it's great. It's based on a novel, and it's easy to see how a lot of the scenarios would play out better in prose; the writing, too, isn't always strong. Yes, it does have its moments, but I get the feeling that I'd probably have enjoyed it more as a novel.<br/><br/>But let's get back to the acting. It is the performances that make 'Silver Lining Playbook' better than it probably should be. Top of the heap is Jennifer Lawrence, who is just incredible. It's the film she won the Oscar for, and deservedly so. She's funny, tragic and pitiful all at the same time. Her comic delivery, her facial expressions, her ability to pull off the crazy mood swings as seamlessly as she does. This is the kind of performance you'd expect from a seasoned actor, not from someone barely in her twenties. Bradley Cooper is great too, and he probably would have gotten all the accolades had it not been for his co-star.<br/><br/>What stopped the film from being a great one was the portrayal of mental health. For the first half of the film, I was actually very impressed. The mental health issues are treated with sincerity, albeit with a strong tinge of humour. But as the film goes on, it starts to get a bit farcical and loses that sincerity. A shame, really. Had it been shown with greater care, I think 'Silver Linings Playbook' could have staked a claim for being one of the films of the year. Instead, the film will be remembered for allowing Jennifer Lawrence to give the best performance of her career to date, and not much else."

The story sucks you in and gently shakes you. This is not a typical Hollywood film. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence give outstanding performances. Not since ""The Graduate"" (1967) have I thought this long and hard about a couple well after the final reel unspools.

","Silver Linings Playbook is that rare film about characters with mental illness that manages to be quirky and sad and funny and charming all at once. Director David O Russell takes some serious themes and treats them with such humor and wit that you'll find yourself giddy from excitement by the end of it.Bradley Cooper plays Pat, a former teacher with bipolar disorder, who must move back home with mom and dad after spending eight months in a mental institution for brutally attacking his wife's lover. Pat's father (Robert DeNiro) is concerned for his son's health, but could do with some help himself for his gambling addiction and his OCD. Pat's mother meanwhile (Jacki Weaver) is incredibly patient with both men, constantly trying to broker peace at home by cooking up special treats.While working towards getting his life – and particularly his marriage – back on track through therapy, exercise, and positive thinking, Pat is introduced to the equally troubled Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young widow who's dealing with depression by sleeping with everyone in the neighborhood. This pair of crazies (literally!) trades insults, compares medications, and instantly forms a weird connection.Russell's script, brimming with originality and unpredictability, gives the film's terrific cast ""real"" characters to sink their teeth into. Even when the film goes into conventional rom-com territory in its second half – Pat and Tiffany enter a dance competition that means the world to her – the characters and their lines never stop feeling recognizably real.Robert DeNiro is nothing short of excellent as the flawed Pat Sr, and Jacki Weaver is nicely understated. Even the skilled ensemble of supporting players (including Anupam Kher as Pat's committed shrink) hits all the right notes. But the film, of course, belongs to its fine leads, who never miss a beat. Bradley Cooper, always a likable presence on screen, is a revelation here, underlining his funny, moving performance with just the right hint of pain. Jennifer Lawrence, all of 22 don't forget, lights up the screen as the deeply complex, rude, foul-mouthed and yet incredibly vulnerable heroine. Together they're electric, and just watching them spar is one of the great joys this film offers.Silver Linings Playbook, under its bittersweet exterior, explores themes of family, second chances, and notions of what is ""normal"" in the world. Relying on humor – often dark humor – to tell what is eventually an upbeat, feel-good story, the film quickly finds a place in your heart and stays with you long after you've left the cinema.I'm going with eight ratings , and I strongly recommend that you don't miss Silver Linings Playbook. You'll come out with a goofy grin plastered on your face!"

After Tiffany promise Pat to get a letter to his wife Nikki (played by Brea Bee) who currently have a restraining order against him. Tiffany asks Pat to enter a dance contest in return where sparks starts to fly. Pat is then left with a complicated decision when his wife shows up to the dance. If I had to come up with a theme, it will be ""Repairing my love."" In the movie, this theme can be included in majority of the movie. Pat is a man destined to repair his relationship with his wife and the community. He constantly tries to exercise to get fit because he believes that is what his wife wants. This theme is also applied with his father Pat Sr. He tries constantly to suggest that they sit down and watch a football game because of a father and son tradition. In one specific scene Pat Sr. was telling Pat that he was sorry he wasn't their more and wants to fix that bond. In a different scene Pat was talking to Ronnie about his marriage in front of people. Ronnie then pushes him off to the side, trying to quiet him down. Pat insists that Ronnie fix his beautiful marriage that is in the beginning stages of failure. Dr. Cliff Patel (played by Anupam Kher) also suggest that he repair his friendship with Tiffany, after a fail attempt by his friend Ronnie and Veronica blind date set up. Pat then decides to listen to his Doctor and give Tiffany a shot at friendship in order to get to his wife. Pat repairs his friendship with Tiffany several times, but at the end where he went up to his estrange wife. When Tiffany seen this, she rushes out the dance hall, but Pat runs after her while confessing his love in a letter. The first movie or film that came to my mind with this same theme was Forest Gump. Forest was constantly repairing his relationship with Jenny. In the Silver Linings Playbook, two techniques that was use that put emphasis on scenes in the movie was angle and motifs. The director use angles in a common conflict. When a conflict arise, they are shot individually until they make up then they are shot together. He shows the division in a situation. I also believe motifs are involved with the beginning scene with the radio and mayonnaise jar. Pat picture at his parent's house. The word excelsior is also shown as images throughout the movie and the Philadelphia Eagles symbol. In this beautiful film, it shows that a person with a positive attitude can mend broken wings and repairing themselves while repairing the right relationships. Now that is excelsior."

Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence deserved their Oscar nominations from their performance in this flick. I loved the original script, the chemistry between all of the characters, the dialogue, it just plain worked. I went to the theater with some girlfriends to see it, we were laughing so hard (almost to the point of crying when the dance scene happened near the end). You want these characters to make it, to come through whatever they are dealing with, as during the film you start to relate to them, feel the empathy people should feel for others. So kudos to the director, the screenwriters, and the actors here, they did their job impeccably and even when I saw it a second time recently (had to have my husband see it), I loved it even more, which is a true test of a good film in my opinion."

","It was one of the few movies, i have seen with such closeness to the real life. i must say that Bradley Cooper is now taking up impressive projects... recently saw his latest movie ""place beyond the pines"". He has flair in all genres like comedy, action and romance.<br/><br/>I really liked Jennifer Lawrence in this one, her character is mysterious but attractive, but i feel she deserved the Oscar more for ""winter's Bone"". good performances from Robert de niro(as always), Julia stiles, Anupam Kher and Chris tucker(long time since i have seen him :D)<br/><br/>it is a heart warming rom com which u can enjoy a lot."

","I remember in 1998 when As Good As It Gets went up against Titanic for the Best Picture Oscar. I remember thinking that it was no contest. Titanic was just too big and too awesome (yeah, I liked it). But what film have I watched at least once a year since? Here's a hint: Nobody dies in it.<br/><br/>As Good As It Gets continues to charm me as an example of how a village of dysfunctional but honest people can not only save each other, but drastically improve each other's lives.<br/><br/>Enter Silver Linings Playbook starring Bradley Cooper as the recently released mental patient willing himself to overcome his bi-polar disorder without medication and finding aid from an unlikely mentor (Jennifer Lawrence (Winter's Bone)) recovering from her own grief-driven nymphomania. Most self-help books would tell us that this match is an absolute disaster waiting to happen, but David O. Russell's writing and direction actually sell us on how it can work.<br/><br/>This starts with a scene fairly early on in the film. Pat (Cooper) and Tiffany (Lawrence) openly compare notes on psyche meds to the horror of their unhappily married hosts Ronnie (John Ortiz) and Veronica (Julia Stiles). This is an odd conversation but it is played with such charm that we are with them. Their gleeful candor tells us they're okay. The embarrassed hosts on the other side of the table, however, are not.<br/><br/>This theme repeats throughout the film. Pat and Tiffany do ""weird"" things or tell their thoughts too openly, loudly or at the wrong time of night. But one thing comes through in every scene from these characters: honesty, honesty, honesty. And we love them for it.<br/><br/>We love them because we see our own family on the screen and we think of just how fun it would be to have a Pat or Tiffany come over and hurl open the closets in our own house, just as long as we're not there or it's not about anything we don't want said, but yeah we kinda want it. Don't we? Over the past few weeks, we've been listening to platitudes from cultural and political leaders about how we need to have a ""serious conversation"" about mental illness in this country. That's about how far it's gone. In truth, we'd rather yell about guns or violent movies instead of looking at a significant portion of our population who are tired of having to hide, take their meds, and not do anything ""unusual"" so they can avoid strange looks and do their best to fit into ""normal"" society.<br/><br/>Silver Linings offers an alternate view. While it is ambivalent about meds (as it should be, because lets face it: meds, for many, can be a bridge over troubled waters), it is very clear about one thing. What we view as illness might very well be a magnificent personality making its way to the surface. And what we view as normal or functional might be completely dysfunctional and destructive.<br/><br/>The key, the film seems to argue, is community.<br/><br/>Americans like to feel good about themselves and this year's Oscar lineup gives us plenty to feel good about. We enjoy watching our country abolish slavery, rescue hostages and assassinate a monster. Those things are easy for us to enjoy because there is a clear right from wrong, especially after the hindsight of history. Silver Linings Playbook, however, challenges us to reconsider what we think of as weird, scary or dysfunctional and it calls into question our ""normal"" way of treating those we consider to be ""abnormal""."
"Mr_Sensitive","7","0","1","12 June 2013"," Nice movie; Lack ""Wow"" factors
","The experience was great, it was fun/ heartwarming/ humorous at time/ and well written and executed. Yet for me it still lacks that ""wow"" factor of many great movies. And at the end by a week or two I cannot quite remember or care about it anymore.<br/><br/>I thought the movie was written really well but it was the actor's performances that really bring out the best out of this movie. The story of a man with mental illness tries to get back his life by trying to reconcile with his ex-wife. Things change when he met mysterious girl – Tiffany. <br/><br/>I thought Brad performance as a mental patient was really good, much better than I give him credit for all this time. I thought he was even better than Jennifer Lawrence whom also did a remarkable job here (though not really an Oscar worthy). What they both did as for the rest of the cast is what really save this movie from going straight to DVD kind of movie.<br/><br/>Apart from good cast/ great performance and well written lines and story I can't really pinpoint anything else that standout. It was fun to watch the first time, but somehow I don't quite crave for more of it. At the end it is just another good romcom.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Worth rental, see if you will like it because I don't really see anyone will watch it repeatedly. <br/><br/>Rating: 7/10"

It was honestly a little tiresome at the start and I found myself quite confused about the incredible reaction it had gotten. <br/><br/>I think that to really understand this movie, you have to watch the entire thing because that's when it all sort of comes together and you see all the different layers more clearly. <br/><br/>I personally loved it. I thought it depicted the issues at hand very well. I know people who are bi-polar and honestly, the movie was pretty accurate. The acting is brilliant, and the characters are great.

"doug_park2001","7","0","1","11 June 2013"," SLP: An Interesting Combination of Qualities
","Some will call it a winning one; some will call it otherwise.<br/><br/>SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK doesn't quite work as a conventional comedy because it just *isn't all that funny. As a drama about mental illness, it falls short because it tries too hard to be funny; plus, the lead characters are such stereotypes of bipolar-type people. {And in either case, the scenes of violence are horribly fake.} As a kind of funny-serious social satire on how everyone--along with the society they create and inhabit--is nuts in a myriad of ways, this film works VERY well, even if it does take some time to develop.<br/><br/>The first half drags and is a bit unfocused; moreover, it seems overwrought with acting, script, and directions that try a bit too hard to portray crazy people. I found it very frustrating but soon discovered that it provided good set-up for the second half. There is also some nice and subtle foreshadowing here regarding the craziness of Pat (Cooper)'s family and all the other supposedly normal people in the film. While Jennifer Lawrence (as Tiffany) over-acts--just as Cooper does--it helps to elucidate the less stereotypical side of her in the second half. Her script--e.g., ""Humanity's just NASTY and there's NO silver lining!""--and entire character contribute a great deal to this film. The second half is also sometimes repetitive and unfocused, but the whole theme really shines through, and it could not end any better. Tiffany and Pat's dance scene is hypnotic (and I'll admit, pretty funny).<br/><br/>In the end, it's fitting that a film about craziness follows such a crazy structure.<br/><br/>*Many obviously disagree with me on how funny this film is--I'm just calling it as I see it."

","Silver Linings Playbook is the Oscar-winning cake you get when you mix the following ingredients: Harvey Weinstein's production skills, David O. Russell's directing technique, and a terrific multi-generational cast (from Robert De Niro to the thrilling comeback of Chris Tucker). Today being the US-release of the DVD, I had to celebrate by reviewing this universally acclaimed movie. This story adapted from the novel The Silver Linings Playbook by Matthew Quick has already helped and will help so many misfits. Unlike most of the audience, I don't think the characters portrayed in this movie are nuts. I found a lot of myself in both Pat (Bradley Cooper) and Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who have just been damaged by life. SLP is a simple story about families and the constant struggle it is to maintain relationships. O. Russell focuses on many kinds of relationships. From parenting to friendship, love, or sibling tension: whatever your problem is, you will find an answer in SLP. I adore the O. Russell technique that reveals his actors' talent. The movie was nominated in all 4 acting categories at the Academy Awards which hadn't happened in 31 years. Jacki Weaver does a mean Philadelphian accent. Robert De Niro in the role of a father with affection and addiction issues is captivating. Weirdly enough, Cooper and Lawrence is an on-screen couple that works. I actually forgot that she is too young for the role because she delivers such an intense performance. She is the only one who came back home with a well-deserved Oscar. I was delighted by Cooper's radical mood swings or Lawrence's defying monologue to De Niro's face. It's a pleasure to see Tucker as Pat's friend from the institution and Julia Stiles as Tiffany's control freak of a sister (and now we can all agree that Stiles is a much better dancer than Lawrence). SLP will speak to the common folk because you can relate to the characters. It is about family issues, coping with loss, football, addiction, dancing like 'dad at prom', and fitting in. Silver Linings Playbook is about life.<br/><br/>1 reason to watch: If you find yourself misunderstood by your relatives, this will give you hope and give them insight.<br/><br/>Read it here: http://squeerelist.blogspot.com/2013/04/silver-linings- playbook-2012.html"

","This movie is excellent and every one should know. Bradley Cooper gave his best performance ever ( it was amazing how an actor from the hangover could be so good he definitely shouldn't have lost the Oscar to Daniel Day Lewis but that just my opinion). Jennifer Lawrence do I even have to explain what an amazing job just amazing and De Niro was great to I thought that Jacki Weaver could use some work. <br/><br/>Now lets get into the review of the film I started off with Pat Solitano (Cooper) leaving the mental institution and moving in with his parents (De Niro and Weaver), the movie is already giving this warm pleasant vibe so we now it's gonna be good. It's a beautiful, cute, warm, and funny film about a mentally ill man finding his way in a weird way with some obstacles as he does not want to leave is original wife Nicki and he meets tiffany who has some depression issues. Everyone should see this film. Definitely one of 2012s best movies."
"Forgotten_Conscience_Productions","9","0","2","8 June 2013"," Silver Linings Playbook Review: Can you find the Silver Lining in your life's Playbook?
","""Life is a struggle that no one actually survives."" It's a difficult thing to do, figure out how to cope with the world around you and the problems you encounter. Things are hard, they take work and even then there aren't really any guarantees you'll achieve anything. Is it any wonder that people go a little crazy? How crazy can things get though? Perhaps what's crazy is the world around us, or even the people in it. No matter what it is some people can't cope, or they don't cope very well. At the core of Silver Lining Playbook is the question of what do you do then. How do you deal with a world that makes you crazy? The story centres around Pat, a guy recently released from a mental institution after a traumatic incident sent him over the edge with a condition he didn't know he had. Now living with his parents, he struggles to figure out how to move forward when in some ways he is still very much stuck in the life he left behind. With no job, no prospects and a town full of people who know what happened to him, he tries to find some aspect of his life to hold onto while managing his condition. What he ends up holding onto is his wife. Very much out of his life since the incident, Pat becomes focused on the idea of getting his wife back despite the reality that he isn't allowed to communicate with her.<br/><br/>Sufficed to say this proves to be more difficult then it seems to him and he begins looking for a work around to this problem through his very supportive friends and family. There's only one problem, his friends and family aren't the benchmarks for normality either. And this becomes the perfect mix for a family rom-com with an interesting twist on it. It's long been a staple of the romantic comedy genre to question the idea of normal. Stories from the 80s and 90s were big on this kind of theme, particularly in the realm of the high school drama version of a romantic comedy. Since then many stories have tried to establish what normal is, or at least what we want normal to be with some success here and there.<br/><br/>For Silver Linings Playbook however, normal is in fact the abnormal. Most of the characters have some strange way of dealing with the world. But in particular what makes it all work is the quirky way in which Pat, as played by Bradley Cooper, lives in the world. He is very honest and direct with people about what he sees or feels yet he does it with a kind of charm and openness about himself that it's hard to feel insulted by him. Topped off by the fact that he has learned to try and look for the silver lining in even the most horrible things.<br/><br/>What's interesting is that because of the unusual nature of the characters, I was never quite sure where they will end up. Romantic comedies have a tendency to go in certain ways. Sometimes they work and sometimes they don't. More recently they've tended to get a little ridiculous with their story lines. This film feels neither ridiculous nor cheap. It goes for the emotionally honest moments and with Jennifer Lawrence, Robert DeNiro, Chris Tucker and Bradley Cooper in the roles they manage to hit them pretty well.<br/><br/>Can you find the Silver Lining in your life? I can honestly say that this movie is something of a silver lining in my life right now.<br/><br/>To check out more of my reviews, go here: http://andrew-heard.blogspot.ca/"
"madk777","10","0","2","7 June 2013"," Perfect in its imperfection
","This is the type of film that fantastically blends powerful literary themes with an entertaining premise in an innovative and enlightening way. A lesson: judge not--for we are all imperfect, damaged, and/or carry baggage, in one form or another. Part of being human is learning to accept our flaws, and those of others. The theme of forgiveness, and letting go of the past wrongs of others (whether they be familial, spousal, or otherwise), despite how these transgressions have affected you is mixed in there as well, as there is a certain freedom in purging this negative energy from one's psyche. This combined with another theme, perhaps articulated as 'don't be afraid of change', or 'get out of your comfort zone', make for an interesting dichotomy. The widely known 'Serenity Prayer' comes to mind when I think of these two somewhat conflicting ideas, in that there are some attributes that we may work on in order to improve ourselves, those close to us, and our respective relationships with the latter, yet some that should be accepted as part of who we, and they, essentially are.<br/><br/>Countless other thematic ideas will certainly come to the mind of a receiving viewer, one such being a powerfully resounding lesson in love. That is, it is not the amount of time a relationship lasts that determines its worth, but how deep it goes. But I digress, as you could spend the greater portion of a semester studying the various literary devices in a great film such as this. As a matter of fact, I think it would be a wonderful movie for a film class to get into, despite being surprisingly mainstream.<br/><br/>Depth is an attribute that extends to the characters as well. Developed in such an uncompromising, yet approachable way, they are lovable, yet different from what one may see of others on the surface because they are so 'real'. Many of them, like the protagonist, suffer from afflictions of the mind, accumulated over their years, and allowed to fester to a point of visibility. Although Bradley Cooper's character, Pat, is the only one to be institutionalized for his 'illness' (although we presume that Jennifer Lawrence's character has been at some point as well), they all have issues. Patrick's father suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder, and although his habits can get intense, and his thoughts quite outlandish, they are tolerated and catered to by the rest of his family because they love him. Patty's friend, after having a baby and overworking, seemingly suffers from an undiagnosed form of anxiety disorder, and relates to Pat because of this. Another friend, detained with Pat before his release and played by Chris Tucker, has an addictive personality and has struggled with illegal narcotics. Pat himself has bipolar disorder, which he only came to know due to an altercation with the man his wife was having an affair with. Most widely known mental illnesses are touched on in this film, and it is a beautiful perspective on how we categorize or value others, and how that might be flawed. Part of being human is accepting that we are not perfect. So, maybe we should stop trying to be? I loved it. 10/10."

","Silver Linings Playbook is as an enjoyable two hours that you could hope to get from a movie. The four leads are truly marvellous – although I haven't seen too much of Jacki Weaver, it was great to see Bradley Cooper showing how much more he has to offer, Jennifer Lawrence confirming what most of us already knew and Robert De Niro showing there's life in the old dog still.<br/><br/>One of the more ridiculous complaints I've read is that ""It's not as good as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". Well, no its not. But that movie remains one of only three to scoop the big five Oscars, so not being as good as it is hardly much of a criticism. Yes, the film is predictable. And I was thoroughly pleased at that. It's become fashionable over the last few years – almost clichéd in fact – for Hollywood to throw a curve ball at you, just for the sake of it. SLP gives you exactly what you want; it just does it with a wonderful script and fine performances.<br/><br/>I can honestly only see two reasons for someone not to like this. Either you've seen the acting nominations and vague plot and are expecting something in the league of Cuckoo's Nest. Or you're one of those darling people who link their film tastes directly to their superiority complex, and therefore shun anything popular. If you fall into the first category, then beware – this movie is wonderful but it's not an all-time great. It's a perfect comedy-drama-romance which does not try to extend beyond its reach. If you fall into the second category, then you need to wise up a little because you're only punishing yourself!"

","This was better than I expected. It's an amusing not too serious look at mental illness bipolar, add, addiction. The characters are quite endearing all round and the upbeat feel of the story and dance climax are what makes this a hit. The humor is surprising and fresh. The romance itself was expected but the evolution of it wasn't that clear. They seemed to be just getting friendly then suddenly they are supposed to be all in love. How did it happen? <br/><br/>Bradley's character Pat looks pretty sane compared to some people I know but it's light hearted so that's okay. Jennifer's performance is good but not Oscar worthy. A nomination would have sufficed. Her delivery is convincing but her face wasn't that expressive here, I think she was better in Winter's Bone. Despite the age gap her chemistry with Bradley is good. Robert de Niro as Pat's father looks older here than of late. Interesting to see his OCD as a milder form of mental illness. Chris Tucker has put on weight and isn't as funny as expected.<br/><br/>Overall worth a watch."

","Much like P.T. Anderson's The Master, this is a movie I enjoyed, in large part, for the performances. I think Silver Lining Playbook has a very entertaining story to go with it. It didn't feel like another version of a story I'd already heard, and it didn't feel completely predictable. Another movie it reminded me of was Little Miss Sunshine, where a lot of the characters are going through difficult times, but it ends up fun and life-affirming somehow. Jennifer Lawrence and Robert DeNiro were especially great, and I'm glad they both were recognized for it. I think starting with a great script makes a big difference, but the performances were what made me feel it. When Tiffany asks, ""You love me?"", I actually care if she ends up happy. It's nice when a movie can do that."

","If you were like me and read the book before seeing the movie I'm sure you found yourself thinking, ""No!!! That's not what happens!"" during the course of the movie. After blocking out the book version this movie becomes a wonderful yet sad tale of two completely screwed up individuals. As much as I enjoyed the book there were so many parts that were way too drawn out. For once a movie included all the good parts that you would like more explained and let out or briefly touched on the parts you didn't care to know that much about. The very basic idea, characters and storyline of the book was written into a movie script which would be more accepted to audiences. It was nice to have parts you never expected and actually left you thinking if it would end the way the book did or not. One of the best movies I've seen in the last 10 years. Do yourself a favor and read the book as well if you haven't. If you haven't seen the movie read the book first and then see the movie."

","Something there is about a movie that while in the theaters everybody loves and then the Oscars come 'round and awards pour in, you you're left with the thought 'how can two actors known for such films as potty mouth Hangover I – III and credibility challenging violence such as Hunger Games make a film worth all the hullabaloo?' Well, SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is the enormously successful answer. Based on the novel by the same name by Matthew Quick and freely adapted for the screen by writer/director David O. Russell, this stage brings an unusually fine opportunity to reveal the rather phenomenal talents of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence while also demonstrating the brilliance of ensemble productions.<br/><br/>The story briefly outlined is as follows: Against medical advice and without the knowledge of her husband Pat Solatano Sr. (Robert DeNIro), caring Dolores Solatano (Jacki Weaver) discharges her adult son, Pat Solatano Jr. (Bradley Cooper), from a Maryland mental hospital after his minimum eight month court ordered stint. The condition of the release includes Pat Jr. moving back in with his parents in their Philadelphia home. Although Pat Jr.'s institutionalization was due to his beating up the lover of his wife Nikki, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Nikki has since left him and has received a restraining order against him. Although he is on medication (which he doesn't take because of the way it makes him feel) and has mandatory therapy sessions with Dr. Patel (Anupam Kher), Pat Jr. feels like he can manage on the outside solely by healthy living and looking for the ""silver linings"" in his life. His goals are to get his old job back as a substitute teacher, but more importantly reunite with Nikki. He finds there are certain instances where he doesn't cope well, however no less so than some others who have never been institutionalized, such as his Philadelphia Eagles obsessed OCD father who has resorted to being a bookie to earn a living, his best friend Ronnie (John Ortiz) who quietly seethes over the control wielded by his wife Veronica (Julia Stiles), and Veronica's widowed sister, Tiffany Maxwell 9Jennifer Lawrence), a recovering sex addict. In their fragile mental states, Pat Jr. and Tiffany embark on a love/hate friendship based primarily on what help the other can provide in achieving their individual goals. But they may reevaluate their goals as their relationship progresses.<br/><br/>The entire cast is superb – including Chris Tucker as a mentally challenged friend Jake – and the joy of the film is that even while dealing with the controversial subject of bipolar disorder, the story and the actors portraying the characters (each bruised in a particular way) always seems real and gains our empathy. But it is the glow of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence walking the very thin line of social adjustment with the grace of the finest of actors that makes this film so special. Highly Recommended. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

","Hey people nice to read my review, <br/><br/>the story begins a bit of retarded, I most certainly didn't like it, but after the first struggle of about 25 minutes, it's worth watching, (Unfortunately, you do need to see the first few minutes) <br/><br/>At the beginning... Kind of foolish to begin that way, but still, you see a young man who is completely screwed up (pardon the language) during the film he will be helped by Tiffany (a role by Jennifer Lawrence), who (in the end of it all) will help him get sane. It's also a movie about dance, and in case you're wondering, no this is not the kind of movie like Grace or dirty dancing and similar. The dance idea is working for our dear friend to make him sane again. Also Julia stiles is in this movie (sorry, I'm a succor for good looking woman, and in this case, I do have the idea that she should be more in the movie, at this moment, I do believe she has a kind of by-roll) Nevertheless, In the ending... (hussh this one up, would you?) they get together, they curl up together (Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper) on a lounge chair, and who in Gods name wouldn't want to curl up with Jennifer Lawrence?<br/><br/>It's quite a nice production, though the first few parts are quite.. well boring, but it's nice to view though. <br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Paul"

","Silver Linings Playbook is the story of Pat Solitano(Bradley Cooper) who struggles with bipolar disorder. After Pat gets picked up from a mental institution by his mother, Dolores(Jacki Weaver) he tries to put his life back on track. The reason he was put into the mental institution was because he almost killed the guy his wife slept with. Pat's dad, Pat Sr.(Robert De Niro) is unsure if Pat is over his manic days. Along the way, Pat meets Tiffany(Jennifer Lawrence), who is a widow. Once they start spending more time with each other, they realize that they have a lot in common.<br/><br/>This is one of the best romantic comedies I've watched recently. Cooper & Lawrence share great chemistry together. A note on the performances. Bradley Cooper is outstanding as Pat. In his first dramatic role, Cooper's acting has improved substantially since The Hangover films & Limitless. Jennifer Lawrence is brilliant in her portrayal of Tiffany. She deserves the Oscar for Best Actress. Robert De Niro & Jacki Weaver are excellent as Pat Sr. & Dolores respectively. Chris Tucker is effective as Danny. Anupam Kher is mind blowing in his small but substantial role of Pat's psychologist Dr.Cliff Patel. All in all, Silver Linings Playbook gives you your money's worth of entertainment."
"twiceasdrunk95","7","0","1","11 April 2013"," Great acting; bad plot
","I guess I'm probably missing something, because I heard several people saying that this film was brilliant and unmissable but I really don't understand why. All of the acting is amazing, I can't knock points for that because this film changed my mind about Jennifer Lawrence, however I really think it's been hyped too much and rated too highly for what it is. I find it somewhat insulting to great films which are rated around the 8.0 that this film got anywhere near them because, despite the brilliant acting and the somewhat well done character building, it wasn't all that it's built up to be. Most of the film is slow and it feels twice as long as it actually is which makes it quite hard to sit though. The subplot with Pat's father feels unnecessary. In fact most of the film feels as if it didn't need to be there. <br/><br/>Worth watching, but don't expect too much."
"dromasca","6","0","2","6 April 2013"," everybody's crazy
","I am trying to remember at least one character in Silver Linings Playbook who is not crazy in some way. You know, what we call a normal person, who is not or was not a patient in a mental institution, is not on psychotic medication, is not going to shrinks or a shrink himself, has no mania or obsession, does not live his or her life according to canned solutions prescribed by psychiatrists. Actually there may be one - Dolores, the mother of the deranged home where much of the action happens, splendidly acted by Jacki Weaver who also is hinted to be the deus-ex-machina of the sophisticated intrigue of rehabilitation of her son Pat (Bradley Cooper, much better than in any other film I saw him before) out of the mental institution where his stay seems to have been caused more by legal reasons than by health troubles. In the process of getting back his life, which includes for some reasons (never explained) getting back his cheating wife who was at the origin of all his troubles he will meet a new love (Jennifer Lawrence - great looks, average acting, but then she is really only 22). It's just that the Pat's system of reference (as the one of other characters in the film) is so much deformed by the stereotypes of therapy and legalism that seem to rule over the life of the heroes that only the rules of Hollywood good-feeling scripts succeed in bringing together the intrigue towards the end.<br/><br/>It is certainly my problem that I am not a big fan of suburbs drama or of romantic comedies. It is the problem of the film that it cannot offer credible solutions to the problems of the characters. If this was real life there would be no happy character in this film. They live in times of economic uncertainty, lose jobs or run in-secure businesses. Family lives are buried in boredom and mediocrity. They are stuck in unhappy marriages. They are on medication. Even their American football teams do not do too well, and sport events turn into violent incidents with ugly racist facets. The aspiration to a positive attitude seems to be imposed and artificial. It's mean drama packed in the artificial wrapping of therapy and optimism, but the source of optimism is not clear. It sounds and looks superficial and artificial.<br/><br/>There are many details to like in Silver Linings Playbook. Dialogs are extremely well written and acting is so natural that you feel that you are present in the suburb home, and that the characters are folks like the ones you met yesterday. You even forget that Robert De Niro is the actor who played uncounted number of gangsters, his maniac focus is so well targeted here to the obsessions for football and betting. Director David O. Russell makes the best of the neurotic ambiance and temperament of his characters and eventually drives the viewers in caring about them. It was not a bad film, despite the amount of clichés that outnumber the moments of real emotion, but I left the screening with a feeling of dis-orientation - serious problems are dealt with the wrong approach. A little bit like the issues the characters in the film have to face and the way they try to solve them."
"CoolBrz","Null","0","1","31 March 2013"," A great movie, maybe not so great a study of mental health issues.
","As many reviewers have noted, this movie is not a documentary about being Bi-polar or Manic Depressive or a Nyphomaniac. Don't go into it hoping for that, and you won't be disappointed. It does, however, succeed as a film without that. The acting is mostly superb, the directing and soundtrack are awesome and the movie leaves you feeling good. It may not be reality, but its a great 2 hours of suspended disbelief. And J Law is absolutely on pace to become one of the top actors of all time if she manages to stay aloof from the induced-psychosis of stardom and stays true to herself. I am pulling for her!"

","Just when you would have been forgiven for thinking Hollywood had exhausted all ideas (going on recent years), consigned us to nothing but annoying animated crap, ior rebooting much loved (and better left alone) franchises, comes this movie.<br/><br/>It is easily the best movie I've seen in a decade, if not much longer.<br/><br/>Cast: Perfect, not a soft performance amongst them. Bradley Cooper shows that he's not just the Hangover guy, or the comedic lead, he's a seriously good dramatic actor and deserves respect for this role. I myself have aspergers and have some behaviours that identify with bipolar sufferers. At no point was Bradleys portrayal less than believable to the point where i identified with his character. Respect.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence likewise got her character to be believable as well, and must also be respected for her portrayal. She's utterly charming, when not being equally s schizo as Bradley. Being beautiful as well is just the icing....<br/><br/>Robert De Niro, just continues to be the best actor (with i think the greatest face) of our generation. We would all be happy just to watch him eat toast for breakfast in the morning. His character runs the gamut of emotions in this movie, just as much, if not more, than the other leads. He never disappoints.<br/><br/>Jackie Weaver, high time she got such a great mainstream role. a fellow Aussie, she plays the perfect caught in the middle housewife. great work! Im only writing about the characters here as thats what this film is about. There's no distractions, no big explosions, nothing to detract from the characters being fully explored and evolving. Not even Jennifer Lawrences amazing body in the dance related scenes distract you from staying superglued to the stories arc and following all the characters developments, because its that well done, and that takes some doing! I hope its not another decade before i actually see another movie that can even come close to this. Just perfect."

","Although I am not fan of romantic comedies and this is supposed to be one, this movie manged to break my stereotypes and surprise me with spontaneity of whole story.Characters are not one-dimensional so you don't know what they will do or say next(well most of time).Also actors portraying them are excellent in their roles so that makes you immerse in story and empathize with main characters.I would like Jennifer Lawrence character was given more attention,though,because it would be more interesting.Other actors were solid,not over the top,so they didn't draw attention from main story,and addition of Robert De Niro is major plus for any movie.I didn't notice directing at all,to be honest,witch is good thing i suppose. Anyway good movie to watch.It is not amazing,but it is really good."

Jennifer Lawrence's acting is so amazing. And I also have to admit that the actor's acting is also amazing and he actually has much more scenes in the movie, he also deserves an Oscar! Those kind of movies always amaze me, like Notebook, A beautiful mind etc. Just watch it I would say and you will see what is a Oscar winner looks like. I will wrap up here. Thanks. I do not know why IMDb puts a minimum 10 lines requirement here, it does not make any sense."
"nesfilmreviews","8","0","2","23 March 2013"," Best Rom-com in years
","""Silver Linings Playbook"" avoids all the rom-com pitfalls and clichés--a breath of fresh air to a stigmatized genre I typically avoid like the plague. It is an unconventional, quirky, amusing comedy drama about troubled people looking for love, and one the best romantic comedies in recent memory. <br/><br/>After a stint in a mental institution, former teacher Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) moves back in with his parents, and tries to reconcile with his ex-wife (Brea Bee), who has a restraining order against him. Pat is curiously confident and upbeat despite this because he's determined to repair the damage he's done to his life and surprises everyone by moving onward and upward. Things get more challenging when Pat meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a mysterious girl with problems of her own. Tiffany offers to help Pat reconnect with his wife, but only if he'll do something very important for her in return. As their deal plays out, an unexpected bond begins to form between them, and silver linings appear in both of their lives. <br/><br/>The phenomenal performances by Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, and Robert DeNiro are what make this film work so well. In addition, terrific supporting roles by Chris Tucker, who works his motor mouth with some of the best lines in the film, while Jacki Weaver as Pat's mom does a fine job as well. David O Russell's screenplay is fantastic in the way it requires both father and son to face and deal with their mental problems together, through the Philadelphia Eagles, and a dance contest nonetheless. Addressing serious life issues with grit and emotion, injected with a potent dose of humor throughout. The writing is sharp, witty, and insightful with great character development. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is ultimately a beautiful film about being comfortable with oneself, and approaching life with a sense of optimism despite shortcomings and setbacks."
"itsjustmyopinion","10","0","2","21 March 2013"," Immensely enjoyable
","Immensely enjoyable from start to finish. Wonderful acting by actors who all of perfect for the roles they play and are all a joy to watch.<br/><br/>The dialogue is at times funny, at others moving and thought provoking. It doesn't attempt to take itself or the subject matter too seriously but is very effective with its message. It's an easy to watch movie rather than a medical lecture so if you want the latter, there are probably better forums. The characters are easy to relate to and the charm of people striving to overcome personal hurdles is present throughout. Perhaps the hurdles are lower than in real life as the characters are all deeply attractive on many levels but the desire and struggle to look beyond negativity resonates in a world far too often presented negatively by the media and people echoing the media. There may be better endings and less predictable story lines but the movie had won well before the finish. There are overtones of another great film 'A beautiful mind' but this is less taxing to watch and any film featuring the enigmatic Tiffany is likely to be successful.<br/><br/>With such a well crafted movie, it is no surprise the sound track is excellent. It never dominates and yet occasionally stands out. Brilliant films tend not to have sequels but I'll be eagerly awaiting the next films featuring the people involved with this one."

","The reviews sold me on seeing this and I'm glad I didn't wait for it on DVD. Sometimes sad, a little bit crazy, the family ties and arguments we all can relate to seemed very real.<br/><br/>First you wonder what could possibly be wrong with this guy and then once the fear of him subsides, you hope for him to get better, be a better person, not cause himself more grief and find true happiness.<br/><br/>As the family's story unfolds you begin to understand how he ended up in a rehab (of sorts) and later when the fights break out with ""Dad"" you really get a sense of how deeply troubled they both are and a little of the roots of it (not quite enough though which is why I rate it a 9).<br/><br/>The acting was terrific, everyone was good in the parts they played, and best of all, in spite of a potential communication disaster near the, the couple do get a shot at their own ""Happily Ever After"".<br/><br/>Somewhat predictable in spots, you probably won't mind ~ after all ~ ""All's Well That Ends Well""."
"nvenier","9","0","2","18 March 2013"," What is Crazy?
","What I loved about this movie, apart from everything, is that it keeps making me think. It makes me think most of all about what it actually means to be ""crazy"" and whether we all have our own mental health issues in some form and to some degree.<br/><br/>Even though the movie is focused on Bradley Cooper's character, Pat, I find myself thinking more and more that it is really about his father, Robert De Niro's Pat Senior, whose own mental health issues go a long way to explaining how Pat Junior has turned out. We are all influenced by our family, and particularly our parents, and poor Pat Junior has had a lot to deal with. Robert De Niro was terrific, and I'm not normally a fan. Shout out to Jacki Weaver, fellow Aussie, who was solid.<br/><br/>The dialogue in this movie has some cherry moments that are very funny. There is a lot of humour in this movie, but I would not call it a comedy. There is also a romantic situation, but you can't classify is as a romance nor a rom-com. This is a drama with the lot.<br/><br/>I liked JL and BC before this movie, but I love them both now. They were both illuminating.<br/><br/>I read a previous review that bagged the movie because it was nothing like the book. I understand that disappointment, but not having read the book, I love the movie and I also love the sound of the book as described in that review. They do not need to be the same.<br/><br/>The minor characters add a lot of depth, and in delightful, unexpected ways.<br/><br/>The scenery and overall look of the movie is not pretty or colourful, which puts a lot more pressure on the script, performances and storyline and they all rise to the task.<br/><br/>I am thrilled to find a modern movie that is not only enjoyable and entertaining, but thought-provoking and rewarding. I will watch it again and again."

","THis film is interesting, the characters are very well played. The main actor Bradley Cooper, plays Pat who is basically nuts. But from my point of view he was just suffering from an unexplained disaster and i felt sorry for him as it felt like he was being led on, you wish someone would just tell him ""mate she has left you and is never coming back"" but if they did we wouldn't have a film. Tiffany on the other hand I believe she is more nuts then any of them! Her expressions, her mystery and her determination is the highlights of her character, she is an amazing actress and brings the film a lot of interesting character, she made this movie for me. I went in with no expectations of the film and it was a perfectly fine film."

","He goes from a terrible hangover twice, to being a freak out of jail, to a bipolar man fighting for the love of his wife, way to go Bradley Cooper. Silver Linings Playbook is an Oscar nominated film for best picture for many things. Bradley Cooper for best actor, Robert DeNiro for best supporting actor, best supporting actress, best director, Jennifer Lawrence won for best Actress, and it was also nominated for best picture. This film deserved most of its nominations, but Jennifer Lawrence definitely deserved her Oscar win. Silver Linings Playbook was not something I expected to be good, good thing I was wrong.<br/><br/>I didn't think Bradley Cooper could do this well in a lead role. His performance blew me away. His mood swings, his charisma, and his charm gave him an Oscar nomination. He went from a drinking problem to a mood disorder. He caught his wife cheating on him and he lost it. With a combination of that and his wedding song playing at the time, he beat him within an inch of his life. He was then rehabilitated in a medical facility for mood disorders and the movie kicks off with his release. In the very opening scene with his mother we see the comedic charm he brings to the movie. He helps his friend escape and they play it off like he was released as well and just needed a ride. This is a gag they play throughout the movie and the character himself is a nice touch to the movie. From the first scene to the last Cooper gives it his all. My favorite scene is when it is late at night and he is reading A Farewell to Arms and he is angered by the ending. He goes ballistic and throws the book through the window, waking up the whole neighborhood. We see him go from happy to angry to sad to sorry and it was a really well acted scene. He goes nuts, his father panics, the mother cries, and it ends with a touching moment. We also see conflict between him and his father. Robert DeNiro plays the father who has obsessions with football rituals. He is much like his son and DeNiro did do a really good job in the role but I don't think he deserved an Oscar nomination. I expected a little more from his character and I was a little disappointed. He likes to have his son there watching the game, he has three remotes a certain was, all because he believes it will help the Eagles win the game. It is little moments like these that drive the movie forward and lead to the rest of the film. Then we meet Tiffany. Jennifer Lawrence plays Tiffany and right when you see her on screen everybody knows that the story will instantly turn to the relationship between Pat and Tiffany. It did, it was a little cheesy, but it worked. Cooper and Lawrence had this natural chemistry and you could tell they liked being together and acting together. They have similar problems and similar personalities and they bounce off each other in the most entertaining way possible. At first they don't like each other. Another scene was when they are in the diner and they are both taking shots at each other and Tiffany goes nuts. It is scenes like that which got her the Oscar nomination, and she well deserved the win. Overall, Silver Linings Playbook really had it all, humor, romance, touching moments, and scenes I could watch again and again. I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did, and that is never a bad thing. With strong acting led by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, funny humor, a strong supporting cast, and a fantastic script Silver Linings was one of the best films of 2012 and gets the WillyT Seal of Approval. It is a movie you don't judge by the cover and really need to get into. If you have a girlfriend or boyfriend, watch it with them because it is a good movie for couples. Watch it again and again and appreciate how Bradley Cooper made this transition from comedy to a film that was mainly drama. Look past the cheesy moments and the easily predictable ending and just embrace the magic of film."

","I loved the movie. It's been ages since the last time I had been so much touched by a movie like this. It's not the gorgeous act of the main characters of the film which makes it touching for me. It's not because the score is composed by my favorite composer Danny Elfman. It's not because all the beautiful little moments of love and care of which you would see a lot in the movie. It's not because all those slight yet weird kind of comedy all through the scenes. It's not even about the beautiful rhythm of a normal romantic life you could give a bipolar back. It's this very combination of all these together which has made this movie special for me. I'm touched and Hope you Find it Touching too."

","Terrific and believable escape via troubled twosome. Life wasn't promised to be easy for Pat Solitano(Bradley Cooper), spending eight months in a mental institution following his painful divorce only to be court ordered to move back home with his parents. Pat Sr.(Robert De Niro)and Delores(Jacki Weaver)try to understand their bipolar son, who insists on trying to cope with life without his medication in pursuit of a healthy living regime with hopes of reuniting with his ex-wife. Pat is looking hard for the ""silver linings"" in his life, when he meets another troubled soul, Tiffany(Jennifer Lawrence),a self-proclaimed slut and woman of mystery since the death of her husband. Things really get complicated when the upbeat Tiffany offers to help the pathetic Pat reconnect with his ex. In return the fetching Tiffany wants Pat to be her partner in a dance competition. Could this be a therapeutic aid in their individual therapy or a step toward a meaningful relationship between them. Lawrence is adorable, witty and hilarious. Cooper is as confusing as De Niro is deadpan funny. And the use of Stevie Wonder's ""My Cherie Amour"" is brilliant. Rounding out the cast: Chris Tucker, Julia Stiles, Anupam Kher, Shea Wingham and Paul Herman."

"dmmhtsa","Null","0","2","8 March 2013"," Highly Recommend
","I won't give you a long drawn out summary of the movie - you can read other reviews or the actual summary on IMDb if you want that. However, I will say that even though I am a huge fan of Jennifer Lawrence, I expected 'Silver Linings Playbook' to be just like all of the current mush - a fried egg completely raw on one side and burnt black on the other - over-driven, yet underdeveloped, marketed as a drama to hook viewers sick of what now qualifies as a classic chick-flick. <br/><br/>However, I was wrong, thank goodness. This is the movie that should be used as the playbook for all future romantic/drama films. They actually hold off on the sex scenes, instead of trying to fast track your attachment to them - developing the characters themselves and the relationships between the characters emotionally and psychologically. The issues addressed, how the characters handle them and how they are eventually resolved, for me, all echoed of real life silver linings. I am not going to say that you are going to walk away feeling like you've been rammed in the gut - you won't, because this isn't a 'demanding' movie, by any stretch of the imagination. But it is an echo, as if you yelled your life into a canyon, and something like your voice came back, except a bit more warbly and little less clear. <br/><br/>I was left with this lingering feeling of relief, as if the different complicated aspects of life are not so black and white, but at the same time, aren't so gray, either, as morality-mongers and Hollywood would have us believe. <br/><br/>I was sick of watching movies where the characters find true love in the first 20minutes of the film and then have sex as acknowledgment that this is their true love, all the while pretending it's just a fling and the sex meant nothing. I was sick of knowing that the the next 40minutes of the film would focus solely on those same characters running away from each other, while the meaningless (separate) drivel of their (individual) lives is portrayed, as if that would make them deeper to the audience, and and finally, ending up together because 'they just can't be apart', despite the fact that during the movie they learned absolutely nothing personal about each other (apart from sex).<br/><br/>If you are sick of this kind of over-done/under-done movie, then 'Silver Linings Playbook' is for you. Even if you aren't sick of such movies, 'Silver Linings Playbook'is still for you, because you will still love it and in fact, it may even serve as an eye-opener."
"sandyonmovies","9","0","2","6 March 2013"," Somewhat controversial but a worthy Oscar contender.
","I've never been a fan of Bradley Cooper. Sure, I've enjoyed Hangover or Wedding Crashers but he was never the main character driving the movie.<br/><br/>Now I can say that I am a fan. His performance was touching, I felt sympathy towards his character and he made me go through Pat's mental illness with him. Cooper knew when to be serious or add the perfect punchline and make the entire theater laugh. It actually looked as though Cooper had the bipolar disorder himself, not just his character. If he sticks with dramatic roles and movies that challenge his acting abilities, I think Cooper can be up there with Robert De Niro. (Maybe) Jennifer Lawrence was also a nice surprise in this movie. After The Hunger Games, I didn't expect much out of her. Lawrence surprised me with her performance of a girl who blames herself for her husband's death and deals with it by having sex. The chemistry between Cooper and Lawrence felt real, I could see her heartbreak when Pat constantly talks about his ex-wife and how out of control she would get when she felt attacked or hurt. Watching the movie, I didn't see Jennifer Lawrence, instead I saw Tiffany, a girl who lost her husband and was figuring out her own ways of dealing with it.<br/><br/>Chris Tucker. I've loved Tucker since I first saw him in The Fifth Element. Funny movies aside, he's actually a decent actor. Tucker stole every scene he was in. While he was more of a comedic relief for the movie, you could see the seriousness of the mental illness that his character was going through.<br/><br/>Great supporting cast with De Niro, Weaver, Stiles and many more. I loved each character and they were each thrown into the movie where I didn't feel overwhelmed.<br/><br/>One of the best movies to come out in 2012, without a doubt.<br/><br/>Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a serious laugh, and some amazing performances. If not, just see it for the dance scene at the end of the movie. If that can't make you laugh then you're helpless."
"maurice_yacowar","8","0","2","5 March 2013"," Hard-edged romantic comedy embraces mental problems.
","Silver Linings Playbook reminds us how much weight a conventional Hollywood genre can bear, if you trust it. By the Romantic Comedy conventions, two attractive young people meet ""cute"", i.e., with instinctive mutual dislike, then overcome the obstacles to romantic fulfillment at the end. In the classic theatre comedy, the young sexual energies that may threaten to disrupt the social order are instead harnessed to renew it through the ritual of marriage.<br/><br/>The film refreshens the genre in several ways. Its romantic heroes both have clinical psychological disorders, with self-destructive, even violent, impulses. But both are suffering from the loss of their life mates. Pat (Bradley Cooper) was institutionalized after beating up his high school teaching colleague he caught in the shower with wife Nikki (Brea Bee). Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) is a recovering sex addict whose husband died -- coincidentally, after she'd lost sexual interest in him. The seriousness of their respective losses encourages our acceptance, even identification, with these unusual romantic leads. <br/><br/>Part of the film's brilliance lies in its realistic depiction of these troubled psyches, with their rampaging highs and lows. Part lies in the witty, complex dialogue. Within a speech, even within a sentence, a character will swerve between extremes in sentiment, desire, self- understanding, outreach and retreat.

","First impressions: J-Law getting the only Oscar was exactly right. (Best Picture, not so much.) As far as my biggest criteria for an actor being ""great"" - that when s/he's on screen, they're all you can look at; they're interesting; they hog your attention. That's J-Law. She's vulnerable, raw, weak and wounded; then she lures you in for the kill. She completely out-acted GQ model, B-Coop, who can smile and that's about it. I don't see anything boiling behind Cooper's eyes. He's had a nice childhood and plays golf with his dad. That's what comes out in his acting. DeNiro was awesome, although his one crying scene seemed excessive. He knows how not to hog the screen, how to fill the air with chatter, keeping the story and attention on Bradley. But I don't see B-Coop going further than TV in his skills. That's not to say he won't get 8 Oscars in his lifetime, the way the bar is being reset. Julia Stiles was awesome - such a power house. John Ortiz read his lines.<br/><br/>The story was original and sometimes fun. It could have been 10x better if they borrowed from some of the dramatic mental illness/family dysfunction movies of yore (Great Santini, Ordinary People) but they had to keep it peppy with dancing and love letters. The explosive anger scenes were about 70% motivated, but I never really felt what Pat was feeling. Why was he so angry? Except for TONS of exposition in the first 20 minutes we had no way of feeling what he was feeling. (Better writing would show it instead of tell it in a shrink's office.) It seemed like a Woody Allen movie without the humor. When both characters dump their pathologies on the street, instead of laugh, you pity them. Then you question the world we live in. How did people get this messed up? What made Pat this way? I still don't know. <br/><br/>Chris Tucker did his best with the writing. I see him doing more dramatic stuff in the future, but his role seemed to be ""funny black guy does black stuff blackly.""<br/><br/>There were grueling scenes. The big dance bet came late in act II, just when you thought things should start resolving. Yes, the writing course says ""have your character want something, then make sure he gets something else."" Fine. The ending was canned girl food. Russell was right to have J-Law instigate the Final Kiss. It was her movie."

I like how the central character Pat is portrayed as mentally ill but as being still human and worth rooting for. Not just the stereotypical loony. I like how Jennifer Lawrence's character is not just very vulnerable, but able to be very assertive in stating that Pat must reciprocate if he's going to be with her. I like how the film dares to portray suburban life, with the family's obsession with football. I like how Pat's father (Robert De Niro) is also deeply flawed -- he isn't exactly a criminal but he's a bit shonky in how he earns his money -- but he's still likable and a loving father. I liked how the film shows a little hobby like dancing can give meaning to people's lives.

","There is a thin line of difference between 'eccentric' and 'unstable': Pat Solitano, a victim of bi-polar disorder behaved more unstable than eccentric or quirky, and so I pitied him instead of loving him. Bradley Cooper has Pat's uncontrollable anxiety down to a tee and he plays his character with great sincerity because of which we sympathize with him all the more. Silver Lining Playbook's humor seemed more dark than quirky in the first half, and when the director David O. Russell brings in the screwball comedy post intermission, I was a tad disappointed because I was looking forward to a better resolution for Pat's dilemma. Maybe Cooper should have performed his character with less believability and more stylization, and then I may have laughed with him all along. But since the actor plays every moment of his character with utmost sincerity and believability, I could not laugh at his actions and behavior before intermission. I pitied him, I prayed for him, I had a lump in my throat when he began screaming at the top of his lungs in the middle of the night, but I did not laugh much. <br/><br/>I was howling with laughter when Tom Ewell played Richard Sherman in Seven Year Itch. I almost fell off my couch watching Billy Wilder and Tony Curtis play two impersonators in Some like It Hot. I fell in love with screwball romantic comedies like Awful Truth and Send Me No Flowers. In none of the films did the protagonists invoke pity right from scene one. Maybe Cooper, despite his impressive efforts, isn't the right choice for a genre like this. His co-star Jennifer Lawrence is ideally cast though because we do not sympathize with her in the beginning; she plays her part in a manner where we gradually fall in love with her eccentricities and then care for her when it seems she won't achieve her desire. This imbalance Cooper creates manifests strongly in the second half when the situation goes berserk – that is when the artificiality sickens us instead of charming us and our interest in the characters and the plot dwindles right up to the very end. <br/><br/>Silver Lining Playbook has a winsome premise involving bi-polar disorder patient Pat's release from mental institution and subsequent endeavor by him to ignore all negativity and set his life back on track keeping the motto 'Excelsior!' in mind. Pat's main objective is to get his wife Nikki back, who refuses to meet him and has a restraining order against him after he almost beat her paramour to death after the two were caught making love in the shower. He is not encouraged by his parents to do so and so when he gets to know that his friend's wife's younger sister Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) can help him by delivering messages to Nikki, he becomes friends with her. But Tiffany has her own problems – suffering from depression ever since her husband died, she spent a long time having sex with almost all her co-workers (women included) at her job until she was kicked out. Even now, she is extremely impulsive and volatile and she only agrees to deliver Pat's letter to Nikki if he partners her for a dance competition. Pat's father on the other hand suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder and he spends his entire time gambling on football team Philadelphia Eagles after losing his job so that he can buy a new restaurant with the money he gets. Things take a surprising turn when Pat Sr., who believes his son is the luck factor for his winning streak, loses his bet money and it coincides with Pat Jr.'s scuffle at the game; Pat Sr. then decides to parlay with his rival where if i) Eagles wins against Dallas and ii) Pat Jr. and Tiffany get a minimum 5 points in their dance competition, then the family shall recover all the money lost on the first bet. <br/><br/>Frankly, the entire football segment with Pat, his elder brother and the American-Indians, and the parlay segment were lame. A big issue I had was the inclusion of Pat's brother in the movie, who served little purpose than to slight his sibling whenever he could and then react to his father's parlay. I was slightly disquieted the moment Tiffany said 'dance with me' but that was nothing compared to the disappointment I felt watching every character break loose and trying to sound as if they really cared about that silly 'parlay'. The part where Tiffany wakes in during the fight and starts reproaching Pat for skipping rehearsals would've suited the old films mentioned in the first paragraph, but doesn't look good in this film. Everything after the parlay scene went downhill, and although it was funny to see the how the events turned up, I was yet dissatisfied by the resolution provided to Cooper's character in the film. <br/><br/>In supporting roles are Jackie Weaver, Robert De Niro, Anupam Kher and Chris Tucker. Jackie Weaver speaks more with her eyes and makes it clear that she loves her family to death despite all their oddities. Robert De Niro is perfectly fine except he sounded (only sounded) weirdly like Tommy Wiseau from the disastrous 2003 film The Room at times and that distracted me. Anupam Kher in the role of Pat's therapist Dr. Cliff Patel is alright, but I was stunned when how his character responded to the parlay situation at Pat's home. Chris Tucker is very likable and very funny as the hair-obsessed buddy of Patrick. David O Russell maintains the quick-shifting pace throughout using cuts, zooms and hand-held camera. Yet, on the basis of the impression I got from the first half and the changing impression I got after interval, I was left unconvinced whether Pat had really attained his silver lining."
"RainDogJr","8","0","1","22 February 2013"," ""And if I say to you tomorrow, take my hand, child, come with me""
","In that recent directors talk from the Hollywood Reporter, David O. Russell told his colleagues about the hard times as a director (and on a more personal level too with a divorce) he had after making THREE KINGS (1999) – he feels he ""lost his own way"" after that film and began to ""overthink things trying to be too interesting, too particular nothing feels right, no project feels right"". It was until THE FIGHER (2010) came, more than ten years later, that Russell felt he was doing what's he's best at; in the meantime between ""Kings"" and THE FIGHTER, Russell had more darkness -he did a film that was never finished, began having financial problems and couldn't get the money for his much wanted adaptation of the novel THE SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK- than light -he directed only one feature, 2004's I <3 HUCKABEES-. <br/><br/>For Russell, THE FIGHTER was, at first sight, too conventional, with a story that has been seen before. He is convinced that 10 years ago he would have let go THE FIGHTER or any similar project, but I imagine when his actual chance to direct that boxing film came he wasn't really in a position to refuse the job, saying to himself ""why don't you try to do this really good? See if you can do this from the heart and mean it"". The rest my friends is history – in my book, THE FIGHTER is a great one. <br/><br/>Following this success, Russell didn't waste time and only two years later he returned, doing finally the ""Silver Linings"" adaptation. He has repeated the success with tons of accolades, including the Oscar nomination for best picture (not to mention the four nominations for his cast). Good for him, as SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK may not be my favorite of the year but it doesn't disappoints. <br/><br/>Let's see, here we have a protagonist (Bradley Cooper) that suffers of bipolar disorder – it's definitely interesting and very well portrayed, with remarkable scenes that let us see what's like to live with someone who can be at times notably happy but at others extremely irritated by issues like finding a not-really-happy ending in a Ernest Hemingway book (!). <br/><br/>But let's make no mistake folks, as at core SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK features a story as conventional and rehashed as any dealing with the struggles of a sportsman. Russell insisted in doing ""Silver Linings"" because of his son, who suffers too of bipolar disorder. But I like to think that this director said once again to himself something like ""Yes, I've seen hundreds of romantic flicks, with a guy who's wrong and doesn't sees who is the girl that truly loves him. Nevertheless, I'm doing the film and I'll try to do it *really good*"". <br/><br/>As a matter of fact, of all the romantic comedies in recent memory, this ranks amongst the most memorable ones, just as THE FIGHTER as one of the best films about sport (and addiction too). The main reason why ""Fighter"" was a superb picture about yet another common issue like drug addiction is certainly the incredible performance of Christian Bale. Don't expect, however, to be blown away by the Oscar-nominated supporting cast of ""Silver Linings"". I'm really happy for Robert De Niro but he really doesn't do much as a hardcore Philadelphia Eagles fan; the same goes for Jacki Weaver – recently, she was a whole lot better in 2010's ANIMAL KINGDOM (she lost an Oscar for that performance to ""Fighter""!). <br/><br/>Nobody ""stole"" the show from the main couple (Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence) – Cooper doesn't look anymore like a spoiled dude, giving the performance of his life so far, and Lawrence is really sweet as the classic girl who has to be the friend and adviser of a guy who can't move on from a failed relationship. Arguably, when you have a formulaic story the thing has to be about those details and unique elements. ""Silver Linings"" is rich in those: like I said, we have the bipolar issue (look for a great temperamental scene of Cooper set to Led Zeppelin's ""What Is And What Should Never Bee""!), and another look from Russell to the sports world (from the fan perspective this time) – definitely anyone who knows a real fanatic of any sport will connect as here football, for De Niro especially, ain't any sort of entertainment but really a way of life and of making (and losing) money. <br/><br/>You know you're watching a worthy film when its key scene, the one that sets the tone of the conclusion, mixes all of the elements to create a unique, crazy and memorable thing. Football, superstition, therapy, everything is there to clearly expose that Jennifer Lawrence is the right girl for Cooper. Hell, at the dance that represents their soon-to-be great love, they dance and jump and go crazy to the White Stripes' ""Fell In Love With A Girl""! What's not to like? <br/><br/>*Watched it on 10 February, 2013"

","There is a particular scene in which the combined empathetic artistry of writer director David O. Russel, lead actors Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence and supporting actors Julia Stiles and John Ortiz encapsulate the heart of the message behind Silver Linings Playbook. The tempestuous, brazen Tiffany (who better than Lawrence) and the more subdued and cheerful, but still socially tactless Pat (Cooper) are two people with bipolar disorder who are getting to know each other for the first time. The topic of medication arises, and they both comfortably discuss the effects of lithium and other pills as casually as other people would discuss hayfever tablets and other treatments that are mundane to them. Meanwhile, a quick cut reveals their two neurotypical, or ""normal,"" dinner hosts listening bewilderedly to a conversation they don't have a hope of connecting with. Pat and Tiffany and playing one of the titular silver linings of making conversation about the day-to-day challenges of their condition. These unusual difficulties don't make them any less three-dimensional and human, but on some occasions, these symptoms are especially problematic, and can't be dealt with as easily.<br/><br/>Pat, as we soon learn, had had his peaceful domestic existence shattered by one freakish incident of violent manic depression. After spending eight months in the chaotic mixing pot of a mental institution, he returns to the outside world to find that beautiful wife and all of his work colleagues have all taken out fearful restraining orders against him, and that his entire neighbourhood is still in a state of confused, ignorant shock at this single fatal outburst. His only points of refuge are the home of his unconditionally loving parents, his daily exercise routines, and, in ways less obvious to him, Tiffany's companionship. <br/><br/>Of all the narrow-minded, callous parents of disabled children to have been seen on screen and in the real world, Pat's parents and certainly the most compassionate. Pat Sr. (an enthusiastically erratic Robert De Niro) also has a disorder – Obsessive Compulsive – and often finds that his son exhibits similar behaviour to himself, but tries tirelessly to be the voice of reason in his son's life. He's always asking Pat junior to watch football games together with him and his mother, Dolores (Jacki Weaver), on the couch, insisting that he should have quality family time, when it's always out of his undeniable superstitious wish to see his team score well in the presence of his good luck charm. Dolores is as caring, selfless and well-meaning as only a mother can be, but she is also understandably overwhelmed by the challenge of living with two such dangerously unpredictable men. It's quite a shock to see Weaver playing a much gentler matriarch than in her previous, chilling performance in Animal Kingdom (2010) and impressive to see her be just as controlling, but infinitely sweeter in her second Oscar-nominated dramatic turn.<br/><br/>Pat's other primary relationship, with Tiffany, largely follows the successful formula of Josh Hartnett and Radha Mitchell's characters in Mozart and the Whale (2005) who both had Asperger's Syndrome. Pat's an emotionally insecure man. Tiffany's an unashamedly emotional woman. Pat is quite mild-mannered, but still lacks a social filter. Tiffany is very brazen and puts more conviction behind her inappropriate interjections. She is also much more accepting of the realities of her different psychological profile. Pat, on the other hand, is very uncomfortable with his disorder and desperate to live the life of a neurotypical, and insults by her insisting that he's nowhere near as crazy as she is.<br/><br/>When it comes to depicting mental disorders, two are evidently better than one, especially if they're of different genders. Both ends of the spectrum can be explored, and we can see that two individuals with the same condition will not always be compatible. Pat's hypocrisy, like Donald Morton's in Petter Næss' film, is the main source of conflict between them, as well as the usual relationship hurdles that would be present without the disorder. The romantic destination of the narrative is still fairly obvious, but not really set in motion until the last few scenes. It is mostly the ups and downs of friendship, not partnership, that we see played out between them.<br/><br/>There are a few perhaps innate clichés that seep into the screenplay, such as the default suspenseful plot device of a high-stakes bet between a likable character and a sneaky protagonist, the last-minute dramas before a crucial event that's been pending for most of the film, the usual pep-talk to the uncertain male lead that inspires him to chase the girl of his dreams before it's too late, and some other victimless crimes against originality, but most of these are offset by the intelligent execution of the story, and some are even worked to the film's advantage.<br/><br/>A more than solid enough foundation is built with the brilliantly written and portrayed character – including a very lovable mental patient played by an unrecognisable Chris Tucker – and the very engaging thematic material, which easily holds together a narrative that's occasionally rickety, and makes an enjoyable, captivating film out of a very challenging subject."

","Directed by David O Russell<br/><br/>Starring Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro.<br/><br/>Written by David O Russell and Matthew Quick.<br/><br/>'After a stint in a mental institution, former teacher Pat Solitano moves back in with his parents and tries to reconcile with his ex-wife. Things get more challenging when Pat meets Tiffany, a mysterious girl with problems of her own.'<br/><br/>With all the hype and nominations this film was receiving, I didn't believe it would be as great as critics acclaimed it to be. Though this film isn't a masterpiece, it was a satisfying watch with plenty of personal messages.<br/><br/>I was very disappointed with David O Russell's last picture ""The Fighter"" and it was his directing that almost didn't make me want to see this one. I would have made a terrible mistake. He was great. He told the story so well with the setting it introduced. It couldn't have been a more common neighborhood and all the actor's were so natural that it made it a 'one-two combo!' The cinematography was descent in this picture. It was all normal. The only aspect I enjoyed was some repetitive camera movements that caught me eye to the great storytelling. The dialogue is great. Such a down to earth and natural flow. I noticed that the actors didn't have a problem with their jobs because the script did that for them. The nomination for Best Screenplay didn't surprise me.<br/><br/>The acting in this film was awesome. I'm not trying to take anything away from Bradley Cooper who did a great job but Robert De Niro and Jennifer Lawrence caught my eye the most. At first, De Niro didn't get much screen time so I couldn't really judge but once his character started playing a bigger role, I was impressed. He hasn't lose his touch with age. His dialogue, his emotional acting and his character's mannerisms with OCD all came together to get him a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. I was hearing a lot of buzz about Jennifer Lawrence before I saw the film. Not only is she beautiful to look at but her acting is just as great! She makes her presence noticeable to the screen. She doesn't over act and try to let her actions speak for her. I saw her as a very natural actress and I bought everything she was saying. Great performance. The only flaw I saw in the cast was Chris Tucker. He was annoying and didn't really have a purpose in the story. Maybe he was brought to lighten up and humor the story but it didn't work for me and was not needed.<br/><br/>Music is often key to the story in this film â€“ from Stevie Wonder's ""My Cherie Amour,"" which triggers Cooper's character's rage, to the medley of songs that serves as a backdrop for a climactic dancing competition. The Score brings an element to compliment the great acting and great storytelling.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a clever picture. It has some of the best acting and storytelling in film this year. Deserves all the acclaim it's receiving. A must see."

","Many people claim to be bi-polar. Anytime someone seems to have a mood swing or have good days and bad days classify themselves to be bi-polar.<br/><br/>Meet Pat, the protagonist of ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" a film directed by David O. Russell (""The Fighter""). Pat is a Philadelphia diagnosed bi-polar man in his mid-thirties who has just been released from a mental institute. We learn that Pat walked in on his wife cheating on him with a co-worker while listening to his wedding song (which comes up time and time again in his mind). Pat severely beat the man, and frightened his wife so much to want to be estranged from Pat. Eight months later, Pat is getting out ready to start new. He lost weight, feels a little more controlled, and is looking to get his life back in order. He is ready to find a silver lining.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper plays Pat with so much intelligence and is contingent on what bi-polar behavior is. He seems well, yet he isn't. He is longing to get back together with his wife; he will not accept his friends and family telling him that she has moved on from him. He goes to the library and gets books she has on her syllabus (very amusing scene where he throws Hemingway's novel out the window), he goes running constantly, and tries to watch the Eagles on football Sunday with his father (Robert De Nero) and mother (Jacki Weaver). He is trying to better himself to a silver lining in his curved life.<br/><br/>Then Pat meets Tiffany (played by the amazing Jennifer Lawrence in an Oscar-worthy performance). Tiffany lives near Pat, and is a young widow whose cop-husband just recently died. You can tell this girl has some conflictions of her own, and discusses different medication used for anxiety she used. She offers Pat sex, and Pat rejects. This is strange to Tiffany, who just had sex with eleven people from the office she worked and was fired from. However, the chemistry between them shows from the start that Pat is instantly attracted to her. He doesn't want to be, since he feels his life is starting over to get back to his wife.<br/><br/>Pat and Tiffany begin to see each other regularly. Not on dates or associated discussions of their feelings for each other, however. Pat wants to get a letter to his wife, whom Tiffany still associates with. Tiffany wants a dance partner for a competition. The two make a deal: Pat dances for Tiffany, and she will give the letter to his wife.<br/><br/>Pat's therapist thinks he should have sex with Tiffany. Pat calls her out on her various partners and tries to play off what he really feels. You know he has feelings for her, but he tries so hard to not. Falling for Tiffany isn't the silver lining he has been working these past months for. Or is she? Pat's parents warm him to stay away from her, but he fights in Tiffany's defense to say he is only seeing her to get to his wife. His OCD father blames her for the loses the Eagles have whenever Pat is not present during the games on Sunday. Is Tiffany placing a burden on him or helping him? Or are they helping each other? Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence have such chemistry together throughout the entire film. This is one of the best rom-com of most recent years, and is definitely the best film of 2012. The entire film consists of them strengthening each other, and finding a new silver lining to their difficult, emotionally damaged lives. The ending is nothing short of brilliance, and will leave you wanting to see it again. The screenplay is wonderful, with many memorable lines and plenty of teary-eyed dialogue. If anything, see it for Jennifer Lawrence. She is up for her second Oscar nomination at 22, and it is well-deserved. Robert De Nero plays an OCD man so well, and fits right in to this show of psychiatric patients. Nothing says OCD more than a man with set rules for remote placement on Eagles Sunday. Jacki Weaver plays a wonderful role as a mother just trying to keep her family together, and having to go through all the speed bumps of her husband and son.<br/><br/>You want a film you where you can laugh, cry, and connect with its characters? Go see ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" and see what the fuss is really about."

","Every comedy has to have an element of drama, but not every drama has to have comedy. So combining the two, while leaning in the slightest bit towards the drama side of things is not easy to do. In 2011 it was 'The Help' and in 2012 it was 'Silver Linings Playbook' that did it best. On both occasions, a delicate balance was found and it makes for a rewarding watch. Here we have a fascinating love story, mixed with a family dealing with possible mental illness. Great, positive characters thrown into this situation allow us to feel what they are going through emotionally while still having a laugh throughout. And it is genuinely, laugh out loud funny at times.<br/><br/>The story follows Pat who, after an 8 month stint in a mental institution, comes home to live with his parents. He is intent on reconciling with his wife, but things become complicated when he meets an interesting young girl by the name of Tiffany. Silver Linings Playbook has the rare distinction of having an actor nominated in all four acting categories at the Academy Awards. Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro, Jennifer Lawrence and Jacki Weaver are the well deserved recipients of those nominations. Cooper was exceptional in the lead role. The evolution of his character, combined with his perfect balance of comedic timing and dramatic effect, make his nomination well deserved, although I feel he'll be hard pressed to take the award home. De Niro is equally excellent. It's great to see him in a role like this, where his true acting potential can shine through. Too often these days it feels like he's appearing in comedies. Lawrence is the best of the lot. She is simply captivating in her role as Tiffany. Her screen presence is immense, even overpowering De Niro in a particular scene they share. Put her in Goodfellas and she would've fit right in. Personally, I feel Emmanuelle Riva deserves to win Best Actress for 'Amour', but Lawrence has a great chance of snatching it herself and it would be well deserved if she does, nonetheless. Finally Weaver, not given a great amount of screen time, she thrives in the little she has. She has the ability to put the audience in hysterics with a simple awkward glance. Not a chance of winning but a nicely deserved nomination for sure.<br/><br/>Silver Lining's Playbook reminded me a little of another film, and that film was 'Yes Man'. Both films have a similar underlying message and that is be positive and positive things will happen to you. It's a great message and one that we could all learn a lot from. I remember after watching 'Yes Man' going out and giving the concept of saying 'yes' to everything asked of me a go (not quite to the extent in the film, but enough), and I found myself doing some really amazing things with my time. Things I wouldn't usually find myself doing and it felt great. Over time I suppose that concept has slipped from my mind but Silver Linings Playbook brought it all back again because it's a positive, heartwarming story not to be missed. Watch the movie, feel the emotions the characters feel, listen to what they say, act how they act, be impulsive now and then and that $10 you pay to see Silver Linings Playbook might just be the best money you ever spend."

","Despite having a stellar cast I did not have much expectation from this movie after watching the trailer, but I was in for a surprise. The movie starts slowly but builds on a faster pace as it progresses. As the storyline moves ahead you tend to relate to the characters better and they grow on you. The movie does have its dull moments but the well executed roles by the lead cast tend to hold your interest. The story is about love, faith, family and bouncing back in life. It is about reassertion and the belief that one should never give up on life, because it can surprise you every single day. The movie strengthens your belief in yourself and tells you that no matter what the difficulty you face, there's always a Silver Lining!"
"jdneukom","9","0","1","11 February 2013"," Perhaps the Best Movie of 2012?
","I saw quite a collection of buzzworthy movies in 2012 and I must say that this movie was the best film of the bunch. It was better than THE HOBBIT, FLIGHT, CLOUD ATLAS, PROMETHEUS, DARK KNIGHT RISES, and THE HUNGER GAMES to name a few (although DKR was a close 2nd).<br/><br/>It is an interesting concept and aside from classics like ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, MISERY, RAINMAN, and AS GOOD AS IT GETS, I feel that mental illness as a thematic issue is sorely underserved in Hollywood (perhaps some irony there). Aside from endowing run-of-the-mill villains with ruthlessness, sinister, and psychotic qualities, mental illnesses are hardly mentioned in most movies. So, for it to be a fairly large portion of this film, and especially a characteristic of the hero (!!!), is actually quite refreshing. Maybe it will come as a surprise to some that many ""bipolar"" people are not defined by their illness alone and can actually function at quite a high level when on an appropriate treatment regimen with appropriate support. Perhaps this movie can debunk some of the stereotypes/connotations that are pervasive to the word ""bipolar."" Namely, people with bipolar are NOT all crazy, homicidal loons.<br/><br/>I won't get too much into how ""realistic"" the portrayal is about the illness, because frankly it's a continuum illness where not everyone experiences the same symptoms. There are different subcategories of bipolar disorder and surely, reading through some reviews, I could probably uncover some who say this portrayal is spot on, whereas others would claim this is a trivialized or inaccurate depiction of someone with bipolar disorder. To split the difference, let's just say the screenplay ""did it's homework"" and the tidbits about paranoid delusions, stress-induced ""triggers,"" manic episodes (jogging in a trash bag overcoat comes to mind), as well as some knowledge of drugs associated with management of bipolar including Seroquel, Klonopin, Xanax, Trazodone, Lithium, and Abilify are appropriate.<br/><br/>That being said, the mental illness aspect really kind of fades out and aside from Bradley Cooper's Pat and Jennifer Lawrence's Tiffany remarking about how ""off"" they both are, they actually seem strikingly normal as the movie progresses (also a hallmark of successful treatment). So, after setting the backstory well, especially with the intricacies of De Niro's neurotic OCD character, we are treated to a pretty good romantic dramedy (and a great date movie, certainly).<br/><br/>The acting is stellar all around. De Niro, Cooper, Lawrence, and Weaver all give show-stopping performances. The dialogue is solid. The editing and score complements the story well. The script is solidly above average. Throughout the film, we feel Pat's gnawing obsession about reconciling with his estranged wife and his single-mindedness in that endeavor. John Ortiz also gives a top notch performance as Ronnie, the solid friend that every sufferer of mental illness would be lucky to have. Oh, and Jennifer Lawrence was absolutely stunning and raw in this film.<br/><br/>The plot comes off as very rich and textured, which makes it stand out in the land of cardboard characters on screen these days. We see multiple sides to all of the main characters, they behave logically and in-character throughout, and exhibit unexpected depth at times. The plot delivers some suspense with Nikki showing up expectedly (or unexpectedly), Pat having to choose between his obsession and a new and better self, and there being some real suspense with the dance-off (and no, I don't watch Dancing with the Stars!). Additionally, I almost clapped when Pat tossed Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms through the attic window. It was a priceless reaction. Not to mention can you really be on a date if someone orders Raisin Bran? Must ponder....<br/><br/>Some of the things that came off as poor (keeping it from 10 stars for me) included the psychiatrist character devolving into a minstrel basically--that was totally ridiculous, and the Eagles game scene I would've cut entirely--it didn't do anything but add a bit of unnecessary racism and punching. The Apple product placement was a little much; we just needed a whole scene written for Siri. The brother character Jake didn't really add much save for some 11th hour sibling rivalry. And, maybe most importantly, it's unclear why even a person with bipolar and full-on delusions would sweep away the fact that his wife was porking the history teacher at home in their shower (though the history teacher telling Pat to go was hysterical). Pat seemed surprisingly unaffected by his wife's infidelity, paradoxically because it was that episode that likely triggered his bipolar initially. So, maybe showing him a bit more conflicted about reconciling, and less eager beaver, would have been more realistic. I mean, he's bipolar not stupid.<br/><br/>TL;DR: This was a solid and simple movie. Enjoyable. No frills. Not trying to pretend to be something it wasn't. Competent to stellar acting, direction, and writing propelled this piece to what should be a haul of Oscars in a couple of weeks. If this film doesn't win a single Oscar, I'd be stunned and disappointed. Recommended highly."

","I'm just going to go with the fact that as a men I almost never want to see comedy romance movies, this movie is fun and also talks about the troubled people with certain psychiatric problems, even they can have relationships on their very own way. Is amazing, fun, entertaining and makes you think about your life a bit, how you can help yourself with your problems, life, deal with them and even how to relieve them. Just add the fact the psychiatric problems, add the comedy, minus the common family and social behavior. <br/><br/>I would recommend it to watch it if you don't like the so common romance comedy with a boring drama just before the end."

","Sometimes, meeting the right person can turn your life around. That's one of the messages of Silver Linings Playbook. Of course, this is not exactly new territory for Hollywood love stories, but there's a lot of craziness in this romantic comedy that sets it apart from the usual fare. David O. Russell's story of two mentally ill people who fall in love, based on a novel by Matthew Quick, is not a natural recipe for a romantic comedy, but Silver Linings Playbook's upbeat, quirky portrayal of its main characters makes for a delightful experience.<br/><br/>The story is about Pat (Bradley Cooper), a substitute teacher with bi-polar disorder who was committed to a mental hospital for eight months. Later we learn that Pat brutally assaulted his wife's lover after catching them in the shower listening to his wedding song. The movie begins with Pat's mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver) discharging him from the mental hospital and bringing him back home. Pat's father (also named Pat- played by Robert Deniro), has always favored his other son, but he wants to spend some quality time with Pat Jr. to make up for it. But these intentions are masked by Pat Sr.'s job. Pat Sr., a bookie with obsessive compulsive disorder and a penchant for violent outbursts (guess where Pat Jr. got his problems from?), believes that his son is a good luck charm that will help the Philadelphia Eagles win games. Pat Jr. thus interprets his father's advances as financially motivated.<br/><br/>Pat Jr. doesn't have much time for family, however, because he is obsessed with getting his old life back. His daily routine revolves around his plans to win over Nikki even though she has a restraining order against him. Now there's a textbook case of denial for you. Pat believes that staying positive is all it will take to turn his life around. He jogs around the neighborhood with a garbage bag over his sweatshirt to stay in shape to impress Nikki, and he reacquaints himself with friends who can contact her. Pat's world is really turned upside down though when he meets a woman who knows Nikki- Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a beautiful young widow who is severely depressed and lacks confidence in herself. Tiffany bears a tremendous sense of guilt over her husband's death, and in her depression she went on many sexual escapades which only contributed to her self-loathing. There is instant chemistry between Pat Jr. and Tiffany, but Pat suppresses his feelings and convinces her to deliver a letter to Nikki. Tiffany won't be used so easily though. She agrees to help him on one condition- that Pat will help her win a dance competition that she has attempted to enter for ages.<br/><br/>I bet you can guess where the movie goes from here. While the film has a formulaic side, its portrayal of mentally ill people rings true. People who have experienced or witnessed mental illness will find that this movie hits the right chords- Pat's manic highs and lows, his refusal to use medication, and the arguments that get out of hand will be very familiar to them. I also enjoyed how the film touched on Pat's family history of mental illness as these problems are often inherited. Its core message is very positive- mentally ill people can help lift each other out of their complicated problems if they work together. Alone, they will just wallow in their destructive behavior.<br/><br/>I wouldn't describe this film as a laugh out loud comedy, but the character's quirks and behaviors, as well as the many absurd situations they find themselves in make this a very entertaining picture. Silver Linings Playbook is also elevated by its performances and Jennifer Lawrence shines the brightest. Compared to her performances in X-Men First Class and Hunger Games, Silver Linings Playbook is easily her best. Lawrence's high maturity and fiery attitude overcomes her sixteen year age difference with Bradley Cooper. Cooper, to his credit, captures the highs and lows of bipolar disorder very well. It is also good to see Robert DeNiro in an intelligent role again. This won't go down in history as one of his best roles, but he makes his obsessive compulsive quirks genuinely funny and sad at the same time. Pat Jr.'s obligation to Tiffany's dance competition drives a wedge between him and his father that leads to the best scene in the movie- a three way argument between Cooper, DeNiro, and Lawrence that unexpectedly turns to the Eagles' excellent performances whenever Pat Jr. dances with Tiffany.<br/><br/>If you're going to see a comedy in theaters now, see this movie."
"kevster007us","7","0","1","9 February 2013"," Pretty Standard Rom Com with an angle
","This is your standard Hollywood Rom Com which is differentiated from the rest of the crowd by the mental illness angle. While this aspect is handled with sensitivity and respect I did get the feeling that it was just another device and did not really message anything of importance. The needs of the Hollywood feel good factor trump a realistic, more in depth appreciation of the huge challenges of bi-polar disorder and mental illness in general. While the makers should be applauded for at least trying to incorporate a controversial and difficult subject it felt shallow and unrealistic to me. Having said that the performances are generally strong (with exception of Chris Tucker who was just annoying) and Cooper shows some range and versatility. It's all too predictable though and while it's fine for passing the time, if you're looking for some insights in to mental illness in the mould of a ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" or even ""A Beautiful Mind"" you won't find it here. Good, innocuous valentine's day fare."
"TheSquiss","8","0","1","9 February 2013"," Cooper & Lawrence are mere eye-candy no more in a heartfelt battle against love.
","Silver Linings Playbook is in the enviable position of having been nominated for eight Oscars and it deserves every one of the nods. But that doesn't mean to say it will walk away with any statuettes. Just look back at the 1994 ceremony when The Shawshank Redemption walked away empty handed despite seven nominations. Shawshank was robbed but, unfortunately, Silver Linings Playbook is up against better films in every category. But there is hope; Academy has been known to occasionally get it wrong.<br/><br/>Though there are better films on release, Silver Lining Playbook is a very good film that owes much of its success to the very fine work from the cast, Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper in particular. Both actors are known predominantly for light, entertaining films rather than gritty performances in films that count and remain in mind long after the event, but this will go a very long way to Hollywood viewing them as serious actors rather than mere eye candy. As for Robert De Niro, it's probably his best performance since Sleepers and almost erases the pain of Meet the Fockers. Almost.<br/><br/>Pat (Cooper) emerges after several months from a mental institution, where he has been treated for bipolar disorder, against the better judgment of the doctors and moves back with his parents (De Niro and Jacki Weaver). He attempts to rebuild his life and win back his estranged wife, despite her restraining order on him. Then Tiffany (Lawrence), a widow with her own substantial emotional issues, crashes into his life and an explosive friendship ensues.<br/><br/>Silver Linings Playbook isn't a traditional love story and there's no guarantee of a sweet beautiful ending, so if you're looking for a predictable, ordinary rom-com you're in the wrong screen. Go and see I Give it a Year and be damned. Here we have two broken people who cause others as much pain as they themselves are struggling to overcome.<br/><br/>For those who have no experience with bipolar disorder, Cooper gives an enlightening performance of a man who knows after the event that he has behaved irrationally, but at the time is incapable of preventing the monster inside from taking control. For those who have, it is a reminder that causes one's head to nod in acknowledgement. But Pat isn't just a disturbed character; Cooper plays him as a man with at odds with what seems obvious to him and the current of understanding that runs beneath the surface.<br/><br/>The performance Lawrence serves up as the angry, destructive Tiffany is like watching Katniss on heroin though a cracked spyglass. Buried deep inside her is a lost soul that needs care and unconditional love but she has developed her own detrimental methods of self-preservation. It is an eye-opening performance and has set a standard for Susanne Bier's Serena, in which Lawrence and Cooper will reunite later this year.<br/><br/>There are no great surprises or shocks with Silver Linings Playbook if you keep your wits about you, but it is a heartwarming film that further cements David O. Russell's status as a writer/director rushing up the A-list. Add it to the 'must see' list at number four or five.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."

","This film was wonderful, really uplifting and one of my top feel-good films of the year! A must see. The chemistry between the 2 leads is amazing. You also have to wonder if Robert DeNiro and Bradley Cooper pushed for this film to be made so that they could star opposite each other as they did in Limitless.<br/><br/>I think this film sheds light on what's happening in the world today - many people are struggling with depression on a daily basis and the world is slowly coming to terms with the fact that this is a problem - and that the people struggling are in need of care and understanding. <br/><br/>They can get better and this film shows that.<br/><br/>Patrick James Green"

","With promising names in the Cast list, such as Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro, it was bound to be above average.<br/><br/>After seeing them in less emotional and more manly acts, you might get the impression that putting an unusual face to a romantic story will make it more appealing. Well, it does! Less shooting, less jumping off buildings, but a little more drama and it's out there! No matter the cause, no matter the effect, no matter the purpose, no matter the meaning it twinkles around a boy and a girl, it builds up to a series of events which seem to have a logic. Accepting this logic is entirely up to the viewer's mood. The story itself tries to swing you through different emotions, but it only works if you decide to embrace it from the start! <br/><br/>This might have been, as some may say, De Niro's last chance to shine. And it was brilliant."

And, yes, I did like the performances of both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence in their roles and they're also both pleasing to the eyes so there's that, too! And I also liked Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver as Cooper's parents so they also deserved their Oscar nominations as much as Cooper and Ms. Lawrence.

"vriesspeech","10","0","1","4 February 2013"," Deserves all the praise in the world
","Rarely have I felt this good after watching a film. Silver Linings Playbook is a meticulously crafted piece of cinema that celebrates life, love and trying to find your place in the world, with all the struggles and imperfections that come along the way. The narrative is dead simple: Pat (Bradley Cooper) is trying to get his life back on track after he has been in a mental institution for 8 months. He has been sent there after he caught his wife cheating on him and assaulted the man she was sleeping with. Pat has finally returned home and has set his sight on becoming a better person and winning his ex back. All goes according to his plan, but then Tiffany comes into his life, a troubled young girl who has issues of her own. Pat soon discovers that Tiffany play an important role in his quest to find his love again.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so special is its cast. Everyone is phenomenal, no exceptions. Jennifer Lawrence gives the performance of a lifetime in the role of Tiffany. I was already impressed with her acting after seeing Winter's Bone in 2010, but her acting in Silver Linings Playbook solidifies her as the promise of a new generation. It has been a while since I have been this impressed by an actress in a leading role. She inhabits the character of Tiffany and makes it her own. She is a delight to look at, but her talents as an actress even outdo physical appearance. Tiffany is brutally honest, outspoken and rarely takes no for an answer. She struggles with the fact that she's bipolar and she recognises her shortcomings in Pat, who is dealing with the same mental disability. The chemistry between Pat and Tiffany is what makes this movie so great. They are not easy to identify with, but I couldn't help rooting for them from the very beginning.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper is equally amazing. I must admit that I wasn't fully aware of his acting potential before this film. I always liked him, but now he's an actor that I will watch a film for. He shines in this role. The chemistry between Pat and Tiffany takes center stage, but the stellar performances by Jacki Weaver and -especially- Robert De Niro deserve credit as Pat's parents who are trying their best to take care of their son while dealing with their own issues. It's great to see De Niro perform again as the great actor that he is, it has been a while. I found his obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles and the OCD little rituals that he has come up with to be a highlight of the film.<br/><br/>Silver Linings Playbook is far greater than the sum of its parts. A large part of this is thanks to the superb directing by David O. Russell. He gives all the characters enough room to develop. This film is also brilliantly written, with sharp and oftentimes funny dialogue with a sense of humour that feels a little out of place at moments, but is heartfelt and genuine at the same time. Everything just works here. The lighting, the cinematography, the music, everything falls into its right place. The editing deserves another separate compliment. Silver Linings Playbook is fantastically shot, but even better put together. Longer shots trade place with fast snapshots that gives this movie a very unique sense pacing. This movie just flows. Nothing is superfluous, everything scene matters here.<br/><br/>It's hard for me to express how much I love this film. No movie is perfect in my view, but Silver Linings Playbook comes very, very close. Above all, this movie sends a very clear and positive message: at the end of the day she are all a bunch of nutjobs who are doing their best to make the absolute best for themselves in this life. This film reminded me once again why I love watching movies in the first place and I can see myself watching this movie time and time again and never get bored of it."

They are totally believable as mentally challenged individuals. Cooper especially in his scenes late at night, gradually getting more and more vexed because he cannot find certain things and trusting his instinct to distrust close ones.<br/><br/>And De Niro, the man hasn't done a decent performance since the mid Nineties, but here, he really deserves the nomination he's got, he's brilliant.<br/><br/>Dealing with these sort of conditions can be very ham fisted on screen, see pap like Crazy People, but this deals with Bi-Polar, Cyclomethia, and OCD in a very respectable way, and this is where the film wins.<br/><br/>Add on some really funny scenes, every time the police officer comes to tell Cooper off is funny, and the meet at the game also is light hearted, makes the film a little bit easier to digest.<br/><br/>Even the pair scoring a five, is a laugh out loud moment.<br/><br/>It's the directors best movie, and hopefully Cooper will gain better roles, as well as Lawrence, and please Mr De Nkro, don't work for the money, because you've proved yet again,you are one of the greatest actors alive.<br/><br/>A really great, highly original movie."

","I had wanted to see this film for a while, especially after the Oscar nominations came in and this film was surprisingly nominated for 8 Oscars including 'Best Picture' Now that I've seen this movie, I can happily say that this movie is deserving a spot of the Best Picture nomination 'Silver Linings Playbook' is a story about a guy and a girl who both have had such a hard life of their own. Patty is trying to reconcile with his former lover when he meets the eccentric Tiffany, who also has had a tough life behind her.<br/><br/>This film is not what I expected going into it. I just expected a funny romance movie but what I got was something that very well depicts what life can be like. The film was definitely funny, entertaining but most importantly it shows how depressing life can be. The film, nor the director David O Russel allowed the script to ever fall away from the movie. The jokes weren't over the top, they were pretty simple funny moments but this film knows that it wasn't to be a crazy comedy. The tone of the movie is sad, a little humorous and well sad! The writing never takes away from the tone. The direction and writing is great. Good job! The acting in the movie is easily its biggest strength for me. I loved the performances in the movie, especially the ever so brilliant Robert de Niro who is definitely by far the best. That isn't to say the supporting cast wasn't good, they were terrific. Jennifer Lawrence brought such a realistic portrayal to her character Tiffany as did Bradley Cooper. By the end, these are characters we cared about. I was actually so glad to see Chris Tucker back for a short part of the film. Its been 5 years since we've seen him in a film and I'm glad he's back! The story in the movie is definitely great but also to me, its only real weakness of any real sort. Its hard to find any real weakness with the movie as everything is done brilliantly but if anything has to be called its weakest thing, its perhaps the story. The real story to the film doesn't begin until over one hour in but it was no issue as the characters were fleshed out.<br/><br/>The characters in the movie were great especially de Niro's character the father. I loved all these characters by the end of the film that I believe this film was certainly worth a 2 hour watch, despite most movies like this being a half hour shorter.<br/><br/>In conclusion, 'Silver Linings Playbook' is a movie that is most definitely worth a watch and perhaps ""even"" deserving of a Best Picture nominations despite movies like the Dark Knight Rises, Avengers and the Hobbit coming out in the same year."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","0","1","2 February 2013"," Crossing The Silver Line
","David O. Russell's 'Silver Linings Playbook' takes a look at mental illness from a different perspective, with a touch of humour. At the same time, the humour doesn't overshadow the film's depiction of the reality of mental illness (in this case bipolar disorder), its destructive effects (not only on the person suffering directly but also on his loved ones) if help isn't sought and the stigma. Russell doesn't preach about it either because what he offers here is an almost solid story that is primarily about two people who, after a shattered past, find a second chance to mend their broken wings. While Tiffany seems to be keen on Pat, Pat's primary concern is to win his ex-wife back.<br/><br/>My quibble about the story was Pat Sr's betting/gambling habit and how this was treated towards the end. This man gambled his entire savings and more...and when things don't work out he has the audacity to blame his son (who's fighting his own battles). Clearly, he too was suffering from a mental disorder (addiction and obsessive compulsive disorder). I wasn't crazy about how Russell chose to use that to end his film without addressing the damaging effects of his habit. For example, if something bad were to happen or if he were to lose another bet in the future, would Tiffany get blamed because she wasn't the good luck charm anymore? The other flaw was how the Dr. Patel character shifts roles from therapist to buddy. There's a reason (an important one) why therapists are taught not to socialize with patients outside their sessions.<br/><br/>However, where writing is concerned, I mostly enjoyed the playful dialogues especially the banter between Tiffany and Pat. On the technical side it's quite adequate. However, I did like some of the zoom out shots. The soundtrack too is quite pleasant.<br/><br/>'Silver Linings Playbook' has some fine performances. Both Cooper and Lawrence are good. It's nice to see an underrated talent like Jackie Weaver get fine roles. She has few lines (compared to her co-stars) but her character's the one who keeps it all together. Robert De Niro too does a fine job. Chris Tucker seems to be the token black guy whose character has no real purpose in the film. What's Julia Stiles doing here? Overall, 'Silver Linings Playbook' is a decent little film with an likable story and quirky characters and that touches on some issues concerning mental illness."

More laughs from the audience than most so-called comedies. Yet, it's a very emotional story and may invoke a tear or two. <br/><br/>A common thread makes you think ""What makes someone 'crazy' in our culture when so many things that we consider normal (like extreme football fandom or superstition) actually seem odd when you really think about it. <br/><br/>Great performances all around, and it was just a well- put together movie. No slow time, and the crisp 2 hours flew by.

Although these performances where largely ignored and do deserve Oscars, Bradley Cooper also knocked it out of the park as a bipolar man who wants to put his life back together after a major breakdown. I always told people he'd get an Oscar one day after I saw Limitless.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into the story, because really that's a second hand and it's really a character piece and also a study on mental illness. That being said every single performance in here is great. Even Chris Tucker, someone who I thought had absolutely no range, really knocks it out of the park. Bradley Cooper really transforms himself into a beaten down, but really genuine person. Jennifer Lawrence was amazing as well turning in a more emotional and raw performance but still just as good. This is an actor's movie and everybody showed up to do work. <br/><br/>I have ultimately nothing really negative to say about this movie. Normally these ""Oscar"" movies have really bad pacing, too long, and you can feel the ego coming from behind the camera. Nope David O Russell Clearly just wants to tell a good story. Normally I like darker movies, like Black Swan, so anybody thinking this is a sappy, sweet movie you're absolutely wrong. This is an incredibly sincere movie. I teared up I laughed and I liked all the characters.

","Silver Linings Playbook was the average romantic comedy. Boy meets girl, they start hanging out, they realize that they are perfect for each other; the catch here though is that I think that the two were not really that perfect for each other. I really don't see any good coming from a depressed person starting a relationship with a bi-polar one, but that's just me. And the fact that just about everyone we meet in that town has their own set of mental problems (his father, his institution buddy and his neighbor married to Julia Styles all seem to be seriously messed up in the head) won't help this poor man get back into the right mental state of mind. If you can look over those fatal flaws however, this story is very similar to other romantic dramedys and not all bad.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper (who doesn't get as much recognition as Jennifer Lawrence in this film) did a fantastic job as the Bi-polar man trying to regain control of his emotions and life. His mood swings were scary, sad, but most importantly realistic. You could see the confusion and desperation in his facial expressions perfectly and you really just want to be there to help him to get better. Jennifer Lawrence also impressed me with her natural performance, although I think she is too young to play that role. Her character was married for three years and some change, but she in actuality is only 22. (Now I know that's not impossible but it's still just very unlikely in this day and age.) If you can put that aside then you can really relate/like the character she gives you. Robert DeNiro also played the messed up father very well. <br/><br/>The dancing element in the film was a fun treatment for depression as it keeps those involved light and happy and in reach of a goal. Although not utilized as much as it should be in life it was a good plot point for the movie and a clever way of constantly bringing our characters together and showing the parallel between mental security and love. The father's ""Ju-Ju"" and Superstitious beliefs were also humorous and entertaining although again adding to the fact that this man is in no condition to help out his troubled son.<br/><br/>This movie isn't the ""all inspiring"" film that the critics make it out to be, (in fact it kind of loses your attention sometime in the middle) but it's not bad. It merits a viewing from everyone, but the rom-com lovers will like this movie the most. This movie floats along the 6.5 to 7.0 out of 10 and I enjoyed watching it."

","I has Asbergers as it is kind of bipolar disorder in a way. I have to take medication and seek counseling. But unlike the Bradley Cooper character of Pat, he does not take medication for the way it makes him feel.<br/><br/>As he just lost his teaching job, his home, and his wife who got a restraining order against him for beating his wife's lover in the shower. And spent eight months in a Baltimore mental facility to help him. You really feel for this guy and the kind of mental problems he faces.<br/><br/>His worried and loving mother, Delores(played by the great character actress, Jacki Weaver an Australian putting on a Philly accent), takes him back home, against the wishes of his Eagles loving estranged father, Pat Sr(Robert De Niro), as their love of the Eagles is all father and son have in common, but nothing else.<br/><br/>His life takes a drastic turn as he gets to working out by jogging with a garbage bag on and how people say he is unrecognizable losing the weight throughout the movie. He then meets Tiffany(played by Jennifer Lawerence, no wonder they are calling her the next Meryl Streep!).<br/><br/>Tiffany is the female version of Pat and a widow who's husband was killed and has her own mental issues. And lives with her parents. But has a dancing basement that she helped to build.<br/><br/>Despite the love-hate relationship between them, both have a bond of some quirky sorts with one another. Trying to find common ground in the process.<br/><br/>But Pat wanting to be back with his soon to be ex, keeps getting in the way. As Tiffany wants to be a dancer. But if he writes a letter and gives to Tiffany, to give to Nikki as he has that restraining order against him. But Tiffany in return, wants him to dance with her in an upcoming dance competition.<br/><br/>He reluctantly agrees as they go through a grueling and rigid dance training, helped by Chris Tucker, who is a friend of Pat's, and another patient from the mental facility.<br/><br/>A bittersweet but really sweet and dry humor kind of movie. Lawrence and Cooper really make a great couple. And how they have a sort of understanding and love-hate relationship with one another. Makes the movie watchable.<br/><br/>Weaver, Cooper, and Tucker are great in the supporting roles. Lending support to the two. No wonder it is a great film. It is not for everybody if you can understand why Pat Jr and Tiffany go through on a physical, mental, and emotional level!"
"mcguinnessken-465-982420","8","0","3","29 January 2013"," Strong Showing From The Token Comedy Film Nomination.
","This film by David O. Russell is a story of love, loss and bipolar disorder. Initially the film puts a sliver of doubt in your mind, mostly because it has Bradley Cooper, last thing I saw him in was Limitless...so yeah. As well as that we have a co star in Jennifer Lawrence...The Hunger Games...yeah. So I let myself 'meh' before I had seen it. Within fifteen minutes however, I knew I was wrong. Bradley Cooper is the best I have ever seen him, he brilliantly plays a stubborn resilience to his condition as well as being a self confessed sufferer, brilliantly balanced. We see him struggle with the real world and his unfiltered view from a really heartwarming and sympathetic viewpoint. You are laughing with him, not at him, which was important for buying into the character's goals. <br/><br/>Which brings me nicely to Jennifer Lawrence, now with The Hunger Games, I thought she was a little wooden, but then you see her in this and can only assume that she will be better in the later films, and that her performance in the Hunger Games was down to the character progression rather than her. Anyway, in this she is brilliant, I think she outperforms Bradley Cooper, and that is saying something. She is funny, tragic, love struck, strong and vulnerable, a fantastic character. The initial scene's with Tiffany and Pat are really fun to watch.<br/><br/>When you add the star turn from Robert De'Nero as the superstitious father, Pat. Sr, it adds a whole new dimension which eventually becomes entwined with Pat's overall redemption. The interaction with the mother and the father is really nice to watch and brilliantly acted, the more people who are in the scene's during the film, the better. The short snappy dialogue works so well and the family dimension creeps up and becomes all important. It is shot fittingly as well, you feel as if you are part of the drama, watching in the room with them, holding an invested interest.<br/><br/>The overall plot is that both Tiffany and Pat have had tragedies of a separate nature bringing their conditions to the brink. The disorders take over their lives and ruin them to a certain extent, they operate as seemingly fragile creatures living back with their families. Fragile my not be the correct word though, as they are both strong and decisive. Each forces the other to invest in each others problems, but not to the extent they start babbling into each others arms. It is much better than that. Tiffany wants a dance partner, so offers Pat a way to communicate with his ex-wife (who has a restraining order) in exchange. The dancing is rather secondary as you watch the two 'fix each other'. Do not fear, it is not cheesy, in fact it is nice. It brings a smile to your face.<br/><br/>In all this is a really good film, I am glad it got an Oscar Nomination because it deserves it. I think parallels might come from Little Miss Sunshine and Juno, in the way it is a comedy being nominated, but I think this is a much stronger film than those two, in terms of performance and overall quality. It is shot brilliantly with the camera shadowing the characters, the interaction between the family is especially good. You get to see Tiffany and Pat grow and then the dance at the end makes you smile. <br/><br/>I challenge any person with a heart not to thoroughly enjoy this film. <br/><br/>8.5/10<br/><br/>by @KenMcGuinness - http://addocogito.wordpress.com/"

","I had to watch so many shitty movies, and especially ""romantic/drama comedies"" this last few years to get to this one. It's hope. That there will always people who dare working hard and take risks. Great cast, great directing, great story. <br/><br/>It's just a movie, but then it's life too. The story of how I met my girl friend would meet the script properly. You can bring such change in your life and in the life of others I can tell you. Life is about learning to live with those around you. To find balance. This is what this movie is about, among other things. And it's good to see it narrated in such a powerful and joyful way. Thank you.<br/><br/>I would need a lot of cursing to write this review properly. But then I have to contain myself. Just go see it."

","No, this man clearly isn't fine. He's not OK or alright or anything. He's a time bomb certain to explode. He doesn't look, he glares. The face is a tightly fitted mask that hardly manages to hold in check what' trying to come out. The words about being positive and getting his life back together are well-learned phrases which clash violently with the language of his face. He's learned all the self-help lingo and he's well-versed in the speech of pharmaceuticals. And that's all that's needed to declare him fit enough to go back into the real world – at least with a little persuasion from his mother. Silver Linings Playbook is a remarkably open as well as funny portrayal of a misfit, a man diagnosed bipolar after almost killing the man his wife cheated him with. And it is a warm-hearted comedy about broken people and society's way of dealing with them, containing several jibes at America's obsession with both the self-help hype as well as psychotropic drugs. For among other things, this is also a satire on America's belief that there are easy answers for ever problem. Give an obsessive and angry man a few drugs and a positive life motto, and all will be well. but it isn't, as Bradley Cooper's tight face tells us right away.<br/><br/>Silver Lining Playbook also deals with the need for people to function. Society's biggest problem with Pat Solitano is that he isn't properly functioning, that he doesn't respond to crises in the expected way, that he cannot or will not control himself. The same is true for Tiffany (Jennfer Lawrence) who Pat meets at dinner at a friend's house. She responded to the death of her husband by sleeping with every man at her company. Again she was outcast, diagnosed as depressive, not functional. There is a wonderful scene when Pat and Tiffany discus various psycho drugs and their side effects. All these easy solutions they are nothing but a joke. A sad one though because it can destroy people's lives.<br/><br/>Of course, nothing is simple. Pat is not cured and despite a restriction order is convinced he will get back together with his wife. Things do not go smoothly and the time bomb goes off repeatedly as demonstrated when his psychiatrist plays his wedding song which he associates with his wife's cheating and all that followed. It does not take a second to unleashed a Hulk-like anger in Pat. All this therapy, all those drugs have not deactivated the time bomb, quite to the contrary. They have giving him a disguise in which to wrap himself up and disguise his true nature, pretending he has learned how to function again.<br/><br/>Instead, the film celebrates the dysfunctional. There is Pat's father (Robert De Niro), an illegal bookkeeper and football fan who has been banned from the stadium for violent behavior. There is Pat's best friend who dreams of breaking out of his marriage. There is fellow-patient Danny, a hair-obsessed volatile bundle of joy. And there is Tiffany, brutally honest just like Pat, who falls for him quickly and tries to break his shell and tear him away from his obsession with his wife.<br/><br/>This is where the film works: How the distant and rejecting Pat allows Tiffany into his life, if only as a useful tool to communicate with his wife. How Tiffany craves to find someone to be near her, someone to understand her, someone not only a sex partner. Their slowly developing relationship with its many ups and downs, with funny twists and turns and unsettling breakdowns is what turns the film into one of the better ones this year. Russell gives them time, allows them long periods without word, where looks and their avoidance, where his rigid posture and her uncertain walk speak louder than any dialogue could. These are ""damaged goods"" slowly moving into a mutual comfort zone in which they are not judged on the basis of whether thy function or not but from which they can be ejected – or from which they can eject themselves – at any time.<br/><br/>So far so good but unfortunately, Silver Linings Playbook, later falls into the trap of becoming itself what it set out criticizing. For Russell finds an easy and painfully simple answer: With the help of a dance competition, Pat ends up falling in love with Tiffany and in the end all is well and everybody is happy. All problems are solved by love and understanding and so the film ends in the most disappointing of happy endings, turning into a shallow romantic comedy and throwing everything over board that made the film interesting in the first place. So instead of drugs and self-help strategies, the film's happy ending suggests love as a cure for all. The drugs don't work so let#s get another one. To state that the film's resolution was disappointing would be an understatement.<br/><br/>http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/2013/01/26/damaged-goods/"
"abigail-s-levin","8","0","1","23 January 2013"," Overall an entertaining, slightly offbeat RomCom
","I enjoyed this movie. <br/><br/>Both Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper give great performances. I found it refreshing that the two lead characters were dysfunctional and somewhat mentally ill. I wish J.Law's character had been developed more - as much as Bradley Cooper's character was.<br/><br/>There were funny moments and sad/bittersweet moments. Maybe I'm too dark but I wish the story hadn't ended on such a happy note. The happy ending is what made this movie an 8 instead of a 10 for me. If it had an unusual ending, a truly different and quirky ending, instead of a Hollywood happy-ending, I probably would have liked it more. <br/><br/>Nevertheless it is way better than the vast majority of RomComs released."
"jprdo","10","0","1","23 January 2013"," Mental Health Disease is not appealing
","I can count on my hands the number of movies that are good enough to see in a movie theater and Silver Lining Playbook is one of them. This movie is filled with humor, love and drama. We all have heard of mental health disease. What this movie does well is add the human aspect! No one wants a mentally deranged neighbor or co-worker and it is really hard to go back to a regular life after spending time in a mental health facility. Pat, Our anti-hero is presented to us on the day of his release from his mental health facility. He is on a mission to get his wife back no matter what! He moves back with his parents but he has no means since he lost his job. His parents are absolutely loving and very encouraging. Pat's life would remain on the same path but he meets the beautiful and troubled Tiffany who needs help with a dance recital."

","movie we are getting this from http://ashare.me/files/vSaGh1358848168.html <br/><br/>Tiffany is another version of the tough bartender and college drop-out in Russell's The Fighter who sets out to rescue the failing boxer from the family that is destroying him. Both are familiar characters in Hollywood comedies, but the fundamentally sensible Tiffany is given a rare depth and pathos by Jennifer Lawrence. She bonds in a complex way with Pat by giving him a pejorative, one-minute summary of Lord of the Flies before throwing it out into the street. This echoes a literally shattering scene earlier on when Pat reads the high school syllabus his wife is currently teaching, is driven crazy by the wilful pessimism of the end of Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms and throws the book through a closed window. Perhaps the message of this strand of the narrative is to carry on with the medication but be careful what you read. The great strength of Russell's writing and direction resides in the way he consistently manages to retain a comic tone without losing touch with the characters' pains and anxieties. There are numerous scenes that in other hands would be as excruciatingly embarrassing on the screen as they would be in real life: a row in a diner, for instance, that spills out into the street on Halloween night and involves a crowd in fancy dress outside a cinema. But Russell involves us so closely in what we're watching that we become emotional participants. And that's because he cares for these people in a wholly unpatronising fashion"

","Life doesn't always go according to plan. Pat Solatano has lost everything – his house, his job, and his wife. He now finds himself living back with his mother and father after spending eight months in a state institution on a plea bargain. Pat is determined to rebuild his life, remain positive and reunite with his wife, despite the challenging circumstances of their separation. All Pat's parents want is for him to get back on his feet – and to share their family's obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles football team. When Pat meets Tiffany, a mysterious girl with problems of her own, things get complicated. Tiffany offers to help Pat reconnect with his wife, but only if he'll do something very important for her in return. As their deal plays out, an unexpected bond begins to form between them, and silver linings appear in both of their lives.<br/><br/>Very enjoyable, great story, great cast. A simple movie, but very effective. I wasn't expecting it to be so funny! It had everything you could want in a movie, it was even a dance movie! The only think I could really complain about it, is like so many movies it ended too abruptly. There was so much build up and you wanted so much for these two characters to end up together, and when they finally do it doesn't show what else happens. Do they buy a house, what do they do for work..? All in all a good film worth watching.<br/><br/>Breakaway Daily www.breakawaydaily.com"
"zentist-563-976986","7","0","2","12 January 2013"," A game of two halves
","The movie was a traditional romantic comedy with a touch of social commentary on mental illness at the start. It was quite entertaining, Jennifer Lawrence very sexy and the the general level of acting was very good. I am not that surprised to see a number of Oscar nominations but given the lack of gravitas in the movie as a whole I would not expect to see any of it's actors winning the award. As regards Bradley Cooper, I have no direct experience of people with Bipolar disorder but have with schizophrenia and he seemed quite convincing in the start of the movie. His size made his frenetic episodes quite frightening especially in the confines of his parents' smallish house and he had me concerned for the welfare of his parents. HOwever, instead of a bloodbath what we got was a bit of father-son slapping and then a remorseful son gets back on his meds. After that is is basically a traditional romantic comedy."
"michigangino","7","0","2","30 December 2012"," Above average Dramedy
","I liked the movie and it is worth seeing in the theater. Bradley Cooper and Robert Di Nero give great performances that remind us that life is sometimes complicated and messy. But they keep the fun in dysfunctional. Things are not always wrapped up in a pretty bow. Family baggage is tough to deal with and sometimes handed down from generation to generation. The film left me with a message that as long as a family keeps love and support for each other, they can get through anything. There is also a good message about making a commitment and following through with it. I liked the simplicity of the story without the usual over dramatic romantic movie recipes. The heavy references to the Eagles football team was a bit unusual, but maybe its a testament to the loyalty of those fans."

","Normal is only a setting on the dryer goes the old maxim but as Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) discovers as he reenters his life after a short stint in a mental institution, normal is hard to rediscover. Pat returns to live with his parents Pat, Sr. (Robert DeNiro) and Dolores (Jacki Weaver) until he gets back on his feet. This former teacher and husband so desperately wants to move on with his life. Unfortunately his perception of the world around him can be misleading. In comes Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who has her own set of issues and Pat, Sr.'s obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles football team. Danny (Chris Tucker) is his friend who cheers Pat on as he transitions on the outside. This movie really captures the delicate balance of the complexity of stability when attempting to handle mental illness. After seeing Bradley Cooper play endless bad frat boy characters, this role delves into his skills to portray a multi layer character in a believable role."
